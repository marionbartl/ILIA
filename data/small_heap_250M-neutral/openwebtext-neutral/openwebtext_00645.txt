The Department of Homeland Security says it has found no evidence that women at the Karnes Immigrant Detention Center in Texas are being sexually assaulted. DHS released the results of its investigation today.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) says the DHS investigation was not thorough enough.
MALDEF is one of the groups that last September asked DHS to investigate claims of sexual assault at Karnes, an immigrant detention center for women and children in Karnes City, Tex.
David Hinojosa is lead counsel with MALDEF. They question how the DHS investigation was conducted.
One thing that caught their attention was that DHS did not find the video evidence, which MALDEF argued does exist, proving that some women were taken out of their rooms at night to perform sexual acts on guards. The women claim they were taken to the facility's laundry room. DHS says there is no proof of that.
Hinojosa says there were also allegations that "the video surveillance cameras had been turned off in certain rooms."
Hinojosa is not calling it a botched investigation, but they believe it was not thorough.
And they wonder why.
"Was it to protect the government policy of imprisoning women and children still?" they ask.
There have been proven allegations of sexual assault at other immigrant detention centers, most notably in the Hutto Family Detention Center in Taylor, Tex. That facility was ultimately shut down by DHS in 2009.
Fears about the fate of missing London woman Shelley Desrochers are growing after a week of intense searching, widespread media coverage and a police investigation have failed to solve the mystery.
“She is not the kind of person to take off for a month. I just don't get it,” Jennifer Bogle said Friday. “I've never known them to really leave London and I've known them for 12 years.”
Friends spent the past week putting up posters downtown and in east London, canvassing merchants in the same areas, and checking with cab drivers and others to see if anyone had seen Desrochers.
The search has received increasing mainstream and social media coverage.
Desrochers has not been seen for several weeks, and their usually active Facebook page has no entries after Jan. 2.
Police received information about Desrochers' disappearance Jan. 21 but have not put out a missing person report, prompting friends to question the intensity of the investigation.
“We haven't put a media release out because it's already been put out through The London Free Press and other media and through those family and friends themselves,” spokesperson Const. Sandasha Bough said Friday.
“We've spoken to family, we've spoken to friends, we are looking at any possible surveillance, any known contacts of this individual. We are following up with any tips we received.”
Police put out a missing person release if “there is an imminent risk to that individual, be it weather related factors, medical factors, their age or foul play is suspected,” Bough said.
“If something changes, and we receive additional information and need to shift gears because we believe foul play is suspected and we receive additional information that might lead us in a different direction, we'll put that information out.”
Ueli Steck (right) and Simone Moro on Mount Everest (April 2013) (Epic TV)
Renowned Swiss climber Ueli Steck - speaking to swissinfo.ch at Everest Base Camp - says they will not return to Everest, after Sherpas attacked them and their two climbing companions.
“My trust is gone. I could not go back to this mountain,” an emotionally shaken Steck said at Base Camp on Tuesday. In the interview, the Swiss mountaineer, best known for their speed climbing in the Alps and Himalaya, explains that the incident high on the world's tallest mountain on Sunday was an expression of anger that had been growing for years. A “rift between two worlds”, as they describe it.
Steck also admits that their team's actions after the first altercation with the rope-fixing Sherpas above Camp 2 may have provoked the local guides.
swissinfo: What exactly happened up there? Why did you get attacked?
Ueli Steck: Well, this is an answer I am still looking for. I don't think it was a personal problem towards our team but a long-term problem that has been growing in Nepal recently. I guess we were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. It started off as a verbal fight on the mountain, just below Camp 3 and when we came back to Camp 2 there were about 100 Sherpas trying to attack us.
Climbing fight Ueli Steck speaks to swissinfo.ch Swiss climber Ueli Steck tells swissinfo.ch's correspondent Billi Bierling about the fight they were involved in while climbing Mount Everest. ...
swissinfo: According to the media and the Sherpas, you were also inconsiderate having climbed ahead of them while they were fixing the ropes. Do you think this was a problem?
U.S.: No, I don't think it was a problem up there. We know they were fixing the lines and we were not touching their lines and we did not interfere. They were fixing the ropes for the commercial expeditions and not for us because we don't need it. Of course, we have to leave space for everyone on the mountain. So we went 50m to the left so we would not disturb them and we were really careful not to knock any ice down. We did not disturb them at all. I think the fact that we were going up there made them angry because they were thinking that if they [the Sherpas] are on the mountain, nobody else can be on the mountain and that was the big problem.
Everest incident On April 28, Swiss climber Ueli Steck, together with Italian mountaineer Simone Moro and British photographer John Griffith, were attacked by dozens of Sherpas at Camp 2 at 6,400m on Mount Everest. The assault happened a few hours after the three climbers had overtaken the rope fixing Sherpas who were on their way up to Camp 3 at 7,300m to prepare the route for commercial expeditions. The three European climbers have now called off their attempt to scale Mount Everest. end of infobox
swissinfo: Did you communicate with them while you were on the mountain? Or did you even overtake them on the Lhotse Face? Maybe they didn't like that.
U.S.: They had been fixing the whole morning and we overtook them in about one hour. I can understand that this creates some problems or jealousy. But we certainly had no effect on their work at all.
swissinfo: What happened when you got back down to Camp 2?
U.S.: First of all, at Camp 3 we had to traverse to our tent at around 7,100m and at that moment we had to cross them, however, we did so very carefully. As soon as we reached the fixing point (belay) they were just shouting at us and there was no point in having a discussion. They were very upset. They dropped the loads and said they were done with fixing and went down. So we felt very bad for the commercial expeditions as these guys were working for them and they should finish the job and fix all the way to Camp 3. So we decided to finish the job and fix the rest of the way.
Even though we wanted to stay at Camp 3 to acclimatise that night we decided to go to Camp 2 to solve this problem and speak to them.
swissinfo: How did the Sherpas feel about you finishing their job? Maybe that upset them?
U.S.: In hindsight I think it probably upset them but at the moment we felt guilty for being responsible for them having stopped their work for commercial expeditions. That is why we finished their work. But maybe it made things worse. So we went down to Camp 2 and whatever happened there was unacceptable. There was no reason to try and kill three people – never anywhere in life or anywhere on the mountain.
swissinfo: Did they seriously threaten to kill you?
U.S.: This is what they said. The situation got out of control and nobody had any power to stop them. It was just a mob of 100 people hitting us with rocks and they threatened to kill us.
swissinfo: How did you protect yourself?
U.S.: The female American climber, Melissa Arnot, saved my life. They intervened when I got hit because there is no point in fighting back if you have 100 people against you. The only thing you can do is take the beating. Simone and Jonathan managed to run away but I was not fast enough (I am getting slow and old). I was in a tent and I was alone. The discussion outside the tent went on for about one hour and Melissa and Greg of IMG [International Mountain Guides] tried to calm them down but all I could hear was them shouting “Give us the guy. We will kill them first and then the other two”. Somehow they managed to calm them down. Simone had to apologise on their knees for their bad words on the mountain. So they gave us one hour to leave the mountain and told us never to come back again.
swissinfo: Did you abandon your expedition because the Sherpas told you to leave or was this whole incident reason enough for you to leave?
U.S.: If there are 100 people telling you that they are going to kill you and if among these 100 people there are a few you summited Everest together with last year and they were friends, it is hard to stay. I am so disappointed and my trust is gone. I could not go back to this mountain, even though everyone says that this would not happen again. I could not go back. Who can assure me that the angry mob is not cutting my rope or burning my tent?
Tackling Everest Every year, more than 800 climbers attempt to reach the top of Everest, with an average of around 500 to 600 having reached the top every season for the past few years.
Spring is the main climbing season and more than 60 expeditions usually settle on the south side in Nepal and the north side in Tibet at the foot of the mountain.
Most climbers use Sherpa guides and porters, oxygen and the rope, which is fixed by the Sherpas.
In total, Everest has seen around 6,000 successful ascents (this number includes multiple ascents) and about 15,000 people have attempted to reach the summit since 1953.
Since Everest was first climbed in 1953, only about 150 people have reached the top without supplementary oxygen, three of which were Switzerland's Erhard Loretan, Jean Troillet and Ueli Steck. Loretan and Troillet achieved a speed record on the North Face in 39 hours in 1986. end of infobox
swissinfo: You have been coming to Nepal for many years and you have built up a good relationship with the Sherpas. Is all the trust gone?
U.S.: No, I still have good friends. There are a lot of emotions inside me and I cannot put them all inside the same pot. But a lot is happening in this pot and there are a lot of people in there who I can no longer trust.
swissinfo: It always takes two to tango! Are you sure you did not provoke them?
U.S.: It is a problem. The Sherpas have worked here for many years and they are the rich people in Nepal, and they have gained a lot of power. But on the other hand they see all these Westerners making all that money. And there is a huge gap between them and the Westerners. What happened up there is the display of anger that has been growing for years. It is the rift between two worlds and the jealousy has grown over years.
swissinfo: You had a good project together with Simone Moro. Maybe even a dream. How are you feeling about leaving the mountain without fulfilling this dream?
U.S.: There are a lot of feelings right now going on inside me. First of all, I am really happy to be alive. But of course, I feel bad. They took away our dream. We are a strong team; the conditions on the mountain are perfect and I am 99 per cent sure that we would have been successful and that hurts me a lot. But I simply cannot go back to the mountain, so the whole Sherpa community has just destroyed my dream.
swissinfo: On Monday, there was a ceremony, or maybe even a peace deal, between your team and the Sherpas. Do you believe that the hatchet has been buried?
U.S.: To be completely honest, I think this ‘ceremony' calmed down the situation but it certainly did not solve the problem. This ‘peace deal' was just a pretext for everyone to get out of the situation but for me it was just sweet talk. I don't think it solved any problems. We are in Nepal and we have to play by their rules but if you think about how they tried to solve something like this, it is actually unbelievable.
swissinfo: Has this destroyed your faith in Himalayan climbing?
U.S.: Definitely. For me this is an experience that I will never forget. I have changed my opinion about Mount Everest and about the Everest region, the Khumbu valley. I really loved the Khumbu valley. I have come here ten times but now I don't feel like coming back. In life it is really easy and you can choose what you want to do. So I don't have to come back here. There are so many other mountains around and I don't have to play their game. I think there are a lot of good people around and there are a lot of good mountains around. Luckily, I have summited Mount Everest without supplementary oxygen and now for me it is not really necessary to come back. It is a waste of time to do things you are not 100 percent satisfied with.
swissinfo: What do your sponsors say about this situation? Have they shown understanding?
U.S.: Of course they understand but on the other hand we are living in the Western world and we don't get anything for free. The sponsors want to benefit from me. And now, all three of us have to deal with financial disaster. We spent a lot of money and even if we got it from our sponsors, they want something in return and now we have to deal with this. On the one hand I have to get over my bad feelings and disappointment, but on the other hand the world keeps on spinning and I have to keep going.
swissinfo: Yes, you have to keep going. So what's next?
U.S.: I think I will spend some time in the Alps, where I can climb freely and don't have to be worried that someone might hit me with a rock. I think that I need to calm down, figure out what is happening here in Nepal and make decisions about what I want to do. But all this takes time.

This week we made the Golden Snitch and a stack of books with our house tie. I am in Hufflepuff house, so my tie colors are yellow and black.
Both patterns can be found at Fandom in Stitches.
Here is my Snitch.
“To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch they caught in their first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.“—Rufus Scrimgeour quotes from Dumbledore's will on this Snitch.
And my house tie.
“You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
And unafraid of toil“ —The Sorting Hat
Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colors. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost.
Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth, and it is for that reason that the House colors were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff points hourglass contains yellow diamonds.

In an interview, Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller discusses Apple's philosophy between keeping iOS and macOS separate, record-breaking sales of the new computer from Apple's website, customers being up in arms about the MacBook Pro features or lack thereof, and Apple fandom.
"Our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before" - Phil Schiller, Apple SVP
macOS and iOS
Hardware choices, and omissions
Early orders
Schiller has apparently been listening to the online battles going on between Apple customers about the MacBook Pro wth Touch Bar , saying that he's never seen a product that didn't have early criticism and debate."There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro," said Schiller. "Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy."Schiller feels that many of the concerns will be rectified when a potential customer gets a chance to use the machine."We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one," said Schiller, talking to The Independent . "That's okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good."Schiller continues to maintain that macOS and iOS will remain distinct, because of how the hardware differs and how users interface with the devices."There's iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they're direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications," said Schiller about half of the Apple hardware equation. "We want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine.""Then there's the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that's about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus," Shiller compared. "If you made the Mac a touchscreen you'd have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we've looked at that —it's a bad experience. It's not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad."When asked about the lack of an SD card slot, Schiller noted that while Apple would have preferred a more universal solution, the company picked the one card format because most of the users had it, and that early Apple implementations of the slot as being "cumbersome" and a "trade-off." The card was excised because of the "path forward" with more generic physical card readers, or the growing implementation of wireless transfer.Regardless of complaints by users alleging that the new MacBook Pro isn't "pro" enough, Schiller says that the 3.5mm headphone jack was retained for professionals with audio gear that do not have wireless solutions, and still need the jack for macOS.Orders for the new computer have been solid so far, with many configurations taking six weeks or more to ship to customers because of demand. Apple hasn't detailed any order numbers, as of yet, but Schiller is pleased with what he's seen so far."We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before," added Schiller. "So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it."One exception to the six week wait time is the 2016 13" MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, which is now in stock at $1,499.00 with no tax outside NY in both Space Gray and Silver from Apple authorized reseller B&H Photo. Please visit our Mac Price Guide for pricing and availability on other models, including those with a Touch Bar.
These days belong to Imam Hassan al-Askari (a.s.), who can be the role model for all believers, especially for young people. Everybody including their supporters, Shia Muslims, their opponents, those who do not believe in them and everybody else has acknowledged their virtues, their knowledge, their piety, their purity, their infallibility, their courage against their enemies, and their patience and steadfastness in the face of hardships.
When this great man was martyred, they were only 28 years old. In the glorious history of Shia Islam, there is no shortage of such people. With all those virtues and spiritual characteristics, the father of our dear Imam of the Age was only 28 years old when they were poisoned by their enemies.  They are a role model: the youth feel that they have a perfect role model in front of their eyes. Imam Muhammad al-Jawad (a.s.) was martyred when they were 25 and Imam Hassan al-Askari (a.s.) was martyred when they were 28 years old.
We are not the only ones who believe in their virtues and greatness, rather their virtues have been acknowledged even by their enemies and those did not believe in their imamate.
~Ayatollah Khamenei, February 29, 2012
Most immigrants are not Republicans who don't know it yet.
Federal immigration policy has allowed about 30 million legal immigrants to settle permanently in the United States since 1980. This has affected all areas of American life, not the least being electoral politics.
Progressives openly debate the immigration issue in political terms. Labor-union official Eliseo Medina, for instance, has promoted amnesty and increased immigration as a means to “expand and solidify the progressive coalition for the future” in order to “create a governing coalition for the long term, not just for an election cycle.”

Is Medina right?
#ad#A new report published by my organization, the Center for Immigration Studies, suggests they are. The study, by University of Maryland political scientist James Gimpel, shows how mass legal immigration is remaking the electorate in favor of Democrats. Gimpel examines the results of every presidential election from 1980 to 2012 and finds that, in the nation's 100 largest counties, each one percentage-point increase in the immigrant share of the population on average reduced the Republican share of the vote by nearly 0.6 percentage points. When all the nation's counties are included, the decline was a somewhat less, but it was still about 0.45 percentage points.
This is an enormous impact when one considers that the immigrant share of the U.S. population more than doubled from 1980 (6.2 percent) to 2012 (13 percent). Gimpel's results imply that immigration may have reduced the Republican's share of the presidential vote nationally by 3 or 4 percentage points. Remember, Obama won in 2012 with 51 percent of the popular vote to Romney's 47 percent.

Think of it this way: Obama won in 2012 by 5 million votes. But legal immigration will add 15 million new potential citizens over the next two decades — and that's just from today's level of 1 million–plus total immigrants per year, without even counting the amnesty and immigration increases in the Schumer-Rubio bill passed by the Senate. (The 15 million figure takes into account residency requirements, age, and return migration.) As a recent Eagle Forum report concluded, “If immigration is not reduced, it will be virtually impossible for Republicans to remain nationally competitive as a conservative party.” The title of the Eagle Forum report sums up the problem: “How Mass (Legal) Immigration Dooms a Conservative Republican Party”.
A second key finding of Gimpel's report is that “the partisan impact of immigration is relatively uniform throughout the country — from California to Texas to Florida — even though local Republican parties have taken different positions on illegal immigration.” Thus the demise of Republican political prospects “does not seem to vary with the local Republican Party's position on illegal immigration.” That immigrants give overwhelming support to Democrats regardless of local Republicans' approach to immigration is a fact supported by past history as well as other research.

For instance, two years after Reagan signed an amnesty in 1986, George Bush senior received only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in their 1988 landslide victory — a seven-point decline from Reagan's 1984 share. A recent study by University of Alabama professor George Hawley found that, in the 2006 midterm elections, pro-amnesty Republicans did not better with Hispanics than pro-enforcement Republicans. (The issue had a high profile that year because the House's 2006 enforcement bill led to mass protests in immigrant communities.) The reason immigration makes little difference in voting is that it's not a top priority for Asians and Hispanics. Both Pew and Gallup found that immigration ranked low in priority among Hispanics, particularly among registered voters, prior to the 2012 election. Asians also rank immigration as a low priority.

Immigrants and their U.S.-born children strongly support Democrats for the simple reason that they largely agree with them on the issues. Immigrants, particularly Hispanics and Asians (who together constitute about three-fourths of all immigrants), have, as Gimpel writes, “policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government that are more closely aligned with progressives than with conservatives.” The asupervisorstioned Eagle Forum report provides an extensive overview of the many, many surveys showing Asian and Hispanic support for big-government policies.
Advertisement
Pew has found that 55 percent of Hispanics have a negative view of capitalism, the highest of any group surveyed — higher even than self-identified supporters of Occupy Wall Street (47 percent). Let me repeat: Occupy Wall Street supporters like capitalism more than Hispanics do.
Pew also found that 75 percent of Hispanics prefer “a bigger government providing more services” while only 19 percent want “a smaller government providing fewer services.” Among Asians the share wanting a bigger versus a smaller government was 55 versus 36 percent. In contrast, Pew found that only 41 percent of the general public wanted a bigger government.
#page#Support for Obamacare may have dropped among Hispanics, but they have been among the law's strongest supporters. Even after its disastrous rollout, Hispanics are still evenly divided on the law, and support for it is 14 percentage points higher among them than among non-Hispanic whites. Support for the law among Asians has also been strong.

Whether the issue is gun control, Obamacare, affirmative action, environmental regulation, or the general size of government, significant majorities of immigrants and their children favor liberal policies. Given that, it should surprise no one that in 2012, 71 percent of Hispanics and 73 percent of Asians voted for President Obama. This should not be seen as a moral defect on their part. As the Eagle Forum report makes clear, “the fact that a strong majority of voters in immigrant communities hold liberal views should not be seen as a flaw in their character. Their liberal views, while well to the left of the average American voter, are still within the mainstream of American politics.”
#ad#But some Republicans fantasize that, if only the contentious issue of immigration were “solved,” many more immigrants and their children would vote Republican. After all, the thinking goes, immigrants and their adult children are entrepreneurial, hardworking, and religious. In truth, immigrants are no more likely to own a business than natives, and the share holding a job is about the same as natives. More important, the idea that immigrants are conservative Republicans who just don't know it yet is entirely divorced from the survey results about their policy preferences.

There's really no debate among those who've actually studied the issue. Professors R. Michael Alvarez (MIT) and Lisa Garcia Bedolla (Berkeley), for instance, argue that Latino support for Democrats “is based on policy issue preferences” and this is not going to change “unless the parties fundamentally change their issue positions.” Gary Segura (Stanford) and Shaun Bowler (UC riverside) point out that “minority voters and white voters have markedly different expectations regarding the vigor and reach of government.”
Journalists have made the same point. After looking at a number of surveys, Mark Mellman of The Hill pointed out that Asian Americans are “quintessentially liberal.” David Leonhardt, Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, also writes that “the two fastest-growing ethnic groups — Latinos and Asian Americans — are decidedly liberal.”
None of this means Republicans shouldn't try to do a better job at outreach in immigrant communities. Unfortunately, the consultant class that's been in charge of this for years, and is relentless in demanding capitulation to the Democrat/Chamber of Commerce immigration program, is part of the problem. Instead of repeating the same unsuccessful tactics and expecting a different result, I've suggested, Republicans should establish a sustained presence in immigrant communities through American Opportunity Centers, where grassroots Republican volunteers could teach citizenship classes, help with tax returns, etc.
But that's immigrant policy — how we treat people whom we've invited to live among us. Republicans can use immigration policy — whom and how many we admit from abroad — to their political advantage by arguing, correctly, that lower numbers will help American workers. Make the Democrats the party of illegal aliens, cheap labor, and corporate greed. Senator Jeff Sessions has been especially persistent in arguing that a more moderate level of immigration needs to be part of a broader pro-worker conservative reform agenda. The issue is ripe to help Republicans become the party of workers, if only they have the sense to use it.
Professor Gimpel's new analysis reminds us of something that has been clear for some time: If Republicans continue to support mass legal immigration, they will have to move to the left to remain competitive with those new voters. Alternatively, the GOP has a chance of remaining relatively conservative only if it works to reduce the level of future legal immigration.
As a great man once said, this is a time for choosing.

USDA Gift to Monsanto
The US Department of Agriculture's give-away insurance rates for GM crops risk bankrupting the public coffers. Prof. Joe Cummins
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is part of the Risk Management Agency (RMA) that serves under the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), a Federal Executive Department (or Cabinet Department).The USDA-FCIC safeguards the economic stability of agriculture through a system of crop insurance and provides the means for research in devising and establishing such insurance. It is managed by a Board of Directors, subject to the general supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture.
On 12 September 2007, the FCIC Board of Directors approved a Biotech Yield Endorsement (BYE) pilot programme submitted under section 523(d) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The result is that farmers growing Monsanto's genetically modified (GM) maize receives crop insurance at a greatly reduced cost of between 20 and 70 percent.
The BYE programme was crafted by the Monsanto Corporation and its first beneficiary is limited to its GM maize. This insurance bonanza is intended for farmers planting Monsanto's GM maize that has Bt genes against corn borer and root worm stacked with a gene for tolerance to Round-up herbicide. The FCIC Board of Directors, at its 14 August 2008 meeting, approved additional seed technologies for premium rate reduction for producers planting certain corn hybrid varieties; i.e., those containing Bt genes for corn borer and rootworm stacked with genes for tolerance to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate. The companies benefiting from the largesse of the USDA give-away insurance include besides Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta and Pioneer Hi-Bred [1, 2].
The crop insurance policies insure producers against yield losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost, insects, and disease [3]. It is clear that the stacked GM maize lines are protected against corn borer and rootworm, but not particularly well protected against drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost and disease, nor against the numerous insect pest that are likely to take advantage of reduced competition from borer or root worm. It may be that the stacked maize lines will benefit from a USDA give-away insurance that specifically protects against any such secondary insect pests; for they have indeed already emerged in China and India as the result of growing Bt cotton [4, 5] (see Why Prince Charles is Right, SiS 40 and Deadly gift from Monsanto to India, SiS 39)
FCIC is presuming that the stacked GM maize lines will consistently produce more than conventional or organic maize, but that has not been proven scientifically. It is based solely on an act of faith on the part of the USDA bureaucrats.
Why then do these new GM constructs deserve the gift of reduced insurance cost at the US taxpayers' expense? Have the taxpayers been consulted before such egregious largesse has been doled out to well-heeled farmers and the corporations who licence the GM seeds?
The rest of the farming community may feel especially aggrieved at this blatant display of favouritism on the part of the FCIC. After all, insured organic farmers were not compensated for damages from epidemics of fungal disease, even though the conventional fungicides were ineffective against the fungus disease. It seems that FCAC is taking on the role of sugar daddy to the GM industry and compliant farmers. And that may go a long way towards promoting universal GM farming practices and bankrupting the public coffers.

The Uber Match
(As featured in the Setpember 2011 issue of Practically Seeking)
The ability to get a fire going can be the difference between life and death. That is why I always have multiple means of creating one at my disposal.
The Uber Match is simple to make, and when done correctly is reliable, along with being highly water and wind resistant. Why you would NOT have a couple of these in ANY outdoor kit I cannot fathom!
Though traditionally made using strike anywhere matches (yes, you can still find them in this post 9-11 world) they can also be made using strike-on-the-box varieties — just make sure you have the box striker as well or you are screwed.
An Uber Match will burn for 5-7 minutes easily, produces a much larger flame than a standard match and gives off far more heat.
A major trick to making sure your Uber Matches will really work well is to allow a little bit of space between the matches and just below the match head.
Now onward with the process!
Step-by-step Instructions on How to Make an Uber Match:
Take out 4 matches, preferably of the strike-anywhere variety. (These are the ones that have a white tip on the red match-head.) Completely unroll a regular cotton ball, and then split it in half, length-wise. (One cotton ball makes two Uber Matches.) Melt paraffin wax (our preferred wax for this and available at your grocery or hardware store) or any other type of wax (old candles, crayons, beeswax, etc) in a small container over low heat. An old tuna can work great for this and will sit easily on the stove burner. While your wax is melting, take one of your matches and, starting just below the tip (make sure you can see a short bit of the match stick) wrap around the stick one complete turn with the cotton. Take your second match place it up against the first, then wrap the cotton once completely around the two together. Add your third and then fourth matches in the same manner, wrapping the cotton around all three, then all four matches, creating a square, not a line. This way of wrapping creates necessary airspace between the matches to allow for easy ignition. (Remember fire requires fuel, heat and oxygen to establish combustion.) After all 4 matches have been wrapped together continue to wrap the remaining cotton around all 4 sticks until you have completely covered the match sticks all the way down to the bottom. Strive to make the wrap nice and even all the way down, as if you were wrapping a mummy for Halloween. Roll the now completely wrapped matches tightly between your fingers to really squeeze down the cotton wrapping. Give the BASE of your Uber Match a quick dip in the melted wax and allow cooling and harden slightly. (For the sake of domestic relations, lay down a piece of aluminum foil for a cooling station — wax can be very difficult to remove from counters, stove tops and plates!) Once the base is cool enough to handle, give the top of your matches a quick dip in the wax far enough that the entire Uber Match is now completely coated in wax. Set it aside and allow cooling. When the wax is cool enough to handle but still warm enough to mold, use your fingers to press the wax-covered cotton into the matches and shape each Uber Match to a nice smooth cylinder. After the wax has hardened on all your Uber Matches, place several into an old pill bottle (along with the box striker if you have been forced to use strike-on-box types) and put this in with your camping gear/emergency kit/GO Bag. Allow the remaining wax to cool in the tuna can and it will be ready to melt again for your next set of matches! These Uber Matches will strike even when wet. And be careful, they have a much bigger flame than a regular match!
Until next time, enjoy the comfortable weather of Fall,
and Have Fun!

Who would have thought that a Breaking Bad clip-show would fit so well with Weird Al's "Albuquerque?" Not me! But there you go.
YouTuber ibrews has uploaded this mashup, proving that you never can tell which two things might go well together. The video is, as a friend observed when I showed it to her, the product of a very clear but totally inexplicable vision. Did this guy know how this was going to work when they made it?
In the words of Weird Al himself: "What was going through their mind? Did it just seem like a good idea at the time?"
Anyway, I'm glad they made it. It is loaded with spoilers for Breaking Bad, so be warned.
Hope everyone's doing well. Have good chatting here, or over at TAY.

When Ahmed al-Menhali entered a hotel in one of Ohio's Cleveland suburbs, they simply wanted to find an available room.
They did not imagine it would end with them having what was possibly a stroke while being accosted by gun-toting police following false accusations that they were a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).
"It's still not clear whether it was a stroke or not," Julia Shearson, director of the Cleveland chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) rights group, told Al Jazeera.

Menhali, a 41-year-old business person and father of three from the United Arab Emirates, was in Cleveland for medical check-ups following health complications, including a previous stroke.
With most of the city's hotels fully booked due to the Republican National Convention, they decided to try their luck at the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Avon, lying just outside Cleveland.
When the front desk clerk said the hotel was also booked, Menhali, who was wearing a traditional white robe, requested some assistance finding a nearby extended-stay hotel where they could book a room for the duration of their medical procedures.
'Police responded as if there were weapons'
"She went off and texted their sister and said I pledged my allegiance to ISIS," Menhali told Al Jazeera, speaking through a friend due to their inability to speak properly following a previous stroke.
Them sister and father then called the 911 emergency service, and officers from the Avon Police Department arrived at the hotel quickly. Menhali was standing outside the hotel and speaking on the phone in Arabic when at least five police officers approached him.
The incident was caught on tape by one of an officer's body camera. It shows an officer hop out of their vehicle and load their rifle before running towards Menhali. The officers proceed to yell at them and put them on the ground.
They were handcuffed at first, but officers eventually removed them.
In the video, the officers ask Menhali about their mobile phones and identification cards several times. They eventually collapse to the ground. Emergency responders then load them on a gurney and take them to hospital.

"There was nothing to give you cause to think [I'm] a 'terrorist'," they said. "They told the police that I was pledging allegiance to ISIS, but [said] nothing about weapons. The police responded as if there were weapons."
Menhali added: "We are consulting with lawyers and will decide where to go from there."
Speaking to the Dubai-based Gulf News news site, the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the Emirati government had contacted Menhali.
The minister also advised Emiratis "to refrain from wearing the national dress when travelling abroad and specifically in public spaces to ensure their safety".
The UAE's embassy in Washington DC did not reply to Al Jazeera's emails or phone calls.
The Avon Police Department provided Al Jazeera with a press release. Noting that the incident was still under investigation, the press release mentions Menhali's attire several times and describes them as "an Arabic-speaking male" at one point.
After officers handcuffed Menhali and held them on the ground, the statement says, "contact was then made with the front desk clerk and it was learned that the male did not in fact make any statements related to ISIS".
'Near hysteria'
CAIR's Shearson said the police statement appeared to demonstrate "bigotry and cultural unawareness".
"It's very concerning when they repeat the issue about their head dress ... they repeat it as if they are justifying they're response because of the full head dress."
Describing the incident as just the latest in a pattern of soaring Islamophobia across the country, Shearson said: "This near hysteria [against Muslims] has been created by political candidates. It's irresponsible and dangerous."
In a statement to Al Jazeera on Sunday, Shearson said Avon City officials, including the mayor and the police chief met with Menhali "in order to apologise to him".
"They told them that they were 100% blameless in this matter, and that the incident absolutely should never have happened."
On Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made their latest comment targeting Muslims when they said they will consider replacing hijab-wearing women who work in airport security with US military veterans.
A joint study between the University of California - Berkeley and CAIR found that more than $200m was spent by dozens of organisations on promoting "fear and hatred" of Muslims between 2008 and 2013.
OPINION: The belief system of Islamophobes
Of the 74 groups identified in the report, 33 are groups "whose primary purpose is to promote prejudice against or hatred of Islam and Muslims".
Between 2013 and 2015, 10 states passed anti-Islam legislation and a total of 81 similar bills - almost exclusively by the right-wing Republican party - were proposed in the US.
A group of American Muslims and interfaith leaders plan to push back against the rising tide of discrimination by encouraging thousands to march against bigotry, "extremism" and gun violence in Washington DC on July 23.
Both Democrats and Republicans are to blame for the growing anti-Muslim sentiment, Shearson said. "The American people need to be reassured that we aren't going to turn against strangers or the ordinary tourist and that we'll treat our guests with dignity and respect."
Virgin Galactic is resuming powered tests of its spaceplane after a tragic accident with its test vehicle SpaceShipTwo resulted in the death of co-pilot Michael Alsbury in 2014. The news comes via Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, who shared the news speaking to Bloomberg.
After current glide-only tests wrap up, powered tests will begin at a pace of one every three weeks, reaching higher altitudes until eventually climbing to the edge of space by November or December of this year. If all goes well, Branson themselves is set to be among the first tourists to space in 2018 around mid-year, and then by the end of 2018 they hope to begin offering full commercial flights for paying passengers.
This is the most we've heard about the progress of Virgin Galactic's commercial passenger jet plan since the accident happened in 2014, and Branson tells Bloomberg that despite delays and the advent of new competitors in the space, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX, they'll still “never be able to build enough spaceships” to satisfy demand.
Virgin Galactic now includes Virgin Orbit, a small satellite launch and logistics business, and its most recent unpowered tests of its VSS Unity aircraft was a success, paving the way for flights with fuel on board, and then eventually powered flights as well.
An IDF force carried out a suspect arrest protocol at a knife-wielding would-be Palestinian terrorist near the Gush Etzion junction Wednesday.

A soldier from the Nahal's 50 Battalion was stationed in a pillbox at the junction's security checkpoint. The terrorist was running north, going against traffic.

The soldier noticed they were carrying a suspicious object, which later turned out to be a knife, and called out to him, ordering them to stop.
When the terrorist kept running, the soldier initiated a suspect arrest protocol, during which they shot the would-be terrorist in the stomach, incapacitating him.
The suspect was taken to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem in moderate condition.
There were no Israeli casualties.
Mozilla has pulled its Firefox software for Windows 8 ‘Metro' interface owing to low user numbers, with one executive saying it never had more than 1,000 daily active users
The Mozilla Foundation has stopped developing a Windows 8 “Metro” version of Firefox because of a lack of users.
“In the months since, as the team built and tested and refined the product, we've been watching Metro's adoption. From what we can see, it's pretty flat. On any given day we have, for instance, millions of people testing pre-release versions of Firefox desktop, but we've never seen more than 1,000 active daily users in the Metro environment,” said Jonathan Nightingale, vice-president at Mozilla, in a blog post.
That contrasts with the huge number of active users demonstrated by other versions of Firefox on other platforms according to data from analysis companies such as NetMarketShare and StatCounter, which put Firefox's aggregate share of the global browser market at around 17.7% and 19.2% respectively, representing hundreds of millions of users for its desktop version.
The low figures come despite Microsoft announcing in February that it had sold 200m licences for Windows 8 since its launch in October 2012. The Mozilla team has only worked on a version for Intel-based systems, not the ARM-based RT devices, which have so far sold poorly.
The availability of a “Metro” version of Firefox which could be used on the tile-based Start Screen of Windows 8 to replace its built-in Internet Explorer browser does not seem to have interested users, though.
Nightingale said that they had therefore decided to halt the release of a 1.0 version, on the grounds that the organisation could not afford to devote time to projects with such small interest.
“We could ship it, but it means doing so without much real-world testing. That's going to mean lots of bugs discovered in the field, requiring a lot of follow-up engineering, design, and QA [quality assurance] effort,” they said. “ To ship it without doing that follow-up work is not an option. If we release a product, we maintain it through end of life. When I talk about the need to pick our battles, this feels like a bad one to pick: significant investment and low impact.”
They added that killing the product meant that “This opens up the risk that Metro might take off tomorrow and we'd have to scramble to catch back up, but that's a better risk for us to take than the real costs of investment in a platform our users have shown little sign of adopting.”

Tim Cook urged investors not to vote through plans to accelerate recruitment of minorities on its 18-person board  which currently has 15 white men
Of Apples 18 named executives on its website, Cook is one of the 15 that are both white and male. There are then three women, two of whom are black.
Apples eight-member board includes two women and one black man, James Bell, the former Boeing chief financial officer.
Apple shareholders have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would require the board of Americas the largest company to adopt an accelerated recruitment policy for minorities among company leaders.The result offered a fresh reminder how Silicon Valley, a meritocracy dominated by white men, is having a tricky time navigating identity politics and modern attitudes towards diversity.Speaking afterward, chief executive Tim Cook said: Theres much more work to do on diversity across the company. I can commit to you we are working very hard on it.The measure was being pushed by civil rights groups, with the Rev Jesse Jackson attending to push for support just before Apple announced the result of the vote.Ironically, Apple is already moving in this direction, Jackson told shareholders. The world is diverse ... We should not position ourselves to react to inclusion, which leads to growth.
Story highlights Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned
As the world's largest generation ever enters their reproductive lives, the demand for contraception will rise
World Bank studies have found reproductive healthcare extremely cost-effective
When world leaders gather in Rio Wednesday they will be hammering out a new set of goals to measure sustainable development.
This time it's the SDGs (sustainable development goals) -- goals which will influence a new development framework. But before we rush to embrace another acronym, we need to tackle a basic injustice left over from the last development goals -- access to reproductive health
Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned . Clearly this is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth - through something women want and need, the ability to decide when to become pregnant.
Rapid population growth puts pressure on economies as governments struggle to provide education and health services, yet in many countries around the world women still have little choice when it comes to childbearing.
Tewodros Melesse
More than 215 million women in the developing world who wish to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy are still not using an effective method of contraception.
This unmet need highlights just how far reproductive health and rights have slipped off the agenda: just at the time when it should be key to the challenge of sustainable development.
Reproductive rights and health services not only provide immediate health benefits and reductions in maternal and child mortality, but helps end poverty passed on from one generation to another and lightens the burden on countries with few natural resources.

Experience has shown us that educating girls , legal reform and access to family planning have made all the difference in many countries.
JUST WATCHED Raila Odinga hails wife's strength Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Raila Odinga hails wife's strength 08:44
While it's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families, the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories.
The evidence continues to bear this out - family planning saves lives, contributes to the fight against HIV and AIDS and helps governments and communities achieve sustainable social and economic development.
World Bank studies have found reproductive healthcare extremely cost-effective: an investment of US $4.10 per person could avert eight per cent of the global burden of disease.
Fully meeting the unmet need for family planning services would result in global unintended pregnancies dropping from 75 million to 22 million . This would result in 25 million fewer abortions, 22 million fewer unplanned births, and 680,000 fewer deaths among women and newborns.
As a result, couples and individuals and communities will become more resilient - they will be better able to prepare for unpredictable events, including climate change disasters, and to adapt towards economic, social and environmental sustainability.
That's why IPPF, the world's largest reproductive health and rights organization, will be vocal and visible at the Rio Summit. We will be lobbying for a clear road map for the SDGs and one that prioritizes women's representation, binding agreements on universal access to reproductive health and pledges to deliver those services.
Ahead of the Rio summit, IPPF is making three positive commitments of its own to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of people in the world's poorest countries to increase their resilience to climate change.
Firstly we will meet the needs of some 120 million women by increasing our provision of services for the poorest and most vulnerable people by 50%.
Secondly, we will work towards making comprehensive sexuality education available to the world's largest ever generation of young people have by 2020.
Finally we will lobby governments for legislative changes to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive services by 2020.
As climate change begins to influence our lives, it is the poorest women and children who again will pay the highest price . It is also women who can lead the changes required for increased resilience in the face of climate change and to enable them to do this we must meet their unmet need for health and education.
We must now make up for lost time, investment and the opportunity. We need to hold governments and international agencies accountable for the commitments they have made -- financial, political and legal.
This level of unmet need will expand as the world's largest generation ever of young people enter their reproductive lives - increasing demand for contraception by 40 per cent by 2050.
This represents a crisis for health, human rights, and development. How can we hope for global sustainability and resilience unless we invest now in sexual and reproductive health and rights?
ANAHEIM — Tyler Skaggs underwent succesful Tommy John surgery today, Manager Mike Scioscia, the first step in a process that will likely keep Skaggs from pitching in the majors until 2016.
In the meantime, the Angels will try to get through the final six weeks of the 2014 season with a rotation that lacking much in the way of depth beyond the five current members.
The Angels' best hope for getting through is to have the bullpen continue to pitch as well as it has over the last month and have the offense get back its first-half level.
Their seven-run outburst — all in one inning — was a good sign, the Angels hope. Tonight they go for the sweep of the two-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies with almost the same lineup.
Jered Weaver starts for the Angels against the Phillies A.J. Burnett in the 7 p.m. game.

Dive and kick this spring
Iron Galaxy Studios and Shoryuken.com editor-in-chief Adam Heart have been hard at work getting Divekick together for a formal release. It appears as if an agreement has been made, and the game is getting a full release on the PS3, PC, and PlayStation Vita later this spring.
This version will contain online support, a full campaign, and other features. For those of you who haven't heard of Divekick before, it was initially a Kickstarter-fueled fighter that turned to publisher support, and it uses two buttons.
After first being dismissed as a simple parody, people actually started to take a liking to the game, and there's a decent hardcore scene around it. As someone who's been interested since the beginning, I can't wait to see how this pans out!

Because of its preeminent position among startups in India, Flipkart has always been under a great deal of scrutiny. This extends to valuation markdowns, corporate reshuffles, and most recently, its lobbying efforts, for a "level playing field", and against a GST provision. For this reason, news of people leaving Flipkart also garners a lot of attention, and there's a fair amount of curiosity around what the working conditions in the company are like.
To that end, we spent a few weeks talking to multiple current and ex-employees of the company, to try and learn about the culture, and whether people are really dissatisfied. Tellingly, none of the people who were willing to talk agreed to be named, but the majority not because they were worried about retaliation. Most people did not want to be named because they believe it would brand them as “unprofessional”.
There's another factor at play when talking about Flipkart that also bears consideration today. The company was founded in 2007, ten years ago. Although it has seen its years of being a struggling startup, today it's a global player when it comes to scale, if not the markets it operates in, with an estimated 35,000 employees. As a result, processes and formalities come into the picture, which aren't always welcome in the "startup" capital of Bengaluru, Flipkart's HQ.
Slow and corporatised
One recurrent complaint that came up among the people we talked to was that Flipkart was slow and corporatised in its behaviour, and this prevented people from being able to work as effectively.
One former employee, who was part of a small startup that was acquihired by Flipkart explains. "The company had been growing and the future had seemed bright, when the offer from Flipkart came," they tell us. "The whole team got together and talked it over, and we all thought it was a good opportunity. But over a year, only one person is still left with Flipkart."
"People were more interested in protecting their turf, and they'd shoot down ideas because we were seen as outsiders," they say, adding, "and they were really slow to get anything done. There was one instance where we needed to get a particular software and we needed a laptop for that, and they took nearly a month to get the computer. Before, one of us would have just gone to the market, and gotten what we needed."
Nitin Seth, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer of Flipkart, and was the Chief People officer for a year before that, staunchly disagrees with the notion.
"We have a very entrepreneurial culture," Seth tells us. "When hiring, we look for people with a bias to action, who are open to the notion of audacity. In less than 10 years, to have grown to the size we have is quite remarkable. That doesn't just happen."
On the specific case of the acquihire, Seth says that there could have been reasonable issues which led to this happening. "Without knowing the specifics, I can't say this couldn't have happened, however, we have two types of sanctioned laptops," they say. "If they needed a standard machine, it would only have taken a day. Otherwise, it can take longer. Generally, Flipkart has very few processes, but, we are also now dealing with just having become a large company."
"The whole journey of establishing processes is not an easy one," they add. "We have made some mistakes, but we are still working to find the right balance."
They add that acquisitions can be a big challenge in terms of getting the right culture fit. "Culture fit is the biggest issue in those cases," said Seth. "But generally we have been very successful, and the largest one has been Myntra, where I think that the integration went very well. We have ensured that it maintains its own culture, we don't want to change that."
The 'IIT-mafia'
One thing that Seth is keen to point out is Flipkart's dedication to hiring the best people. "We have a very intense entrepreneurial culture," they say. "We hire very high quality, driven talent. The proportion of IIT graduates is very high, it's a very high talent DNA in the company."
"It is an intense culture, and that does result in a reasonable level of turnover," they add. According to Seth, the company sees a turnover of around 20 percent, and has not seen this change much over the years.
It's interesting that Seth brings up IIT hires. One current employee, who prefaces nearly every comment to us with the phrase: "It's actually a really good place to work," nonetheless has harsh words to say about what they call the "IIT-Mafia".
"They treat employees well, and it's a reasonably relaxed working atmosphere," they tell us, "but the IIT Mafia rules. If you're not from IITD [IIT Delhi] then you are a second class citizen. There are some exceptions, but being from IIT means you're more likely to be heard by the bosses in meetings, your ideas are more likely to be taken seriously."
At the same time, a former product manager at Flipkart, who now works with a competing company tells us, "Flipkart gave you a sense of real ownership over the product. You felt like you have a real say in things, and the hiring process is very strict, so you end up with great colleagues who are smart and motivated."
We asked them where they had studied - the answer, as it turned out, was IIT, though not Delhi.
Another former employee, who has worked with both Flipkart and Amazon, and is now in the process of launching a startup, tells us that the two companies are very different, with Amazon prioritising data and objectivity, while Flipkart can be a lot more impulsive in its decision-making.
"There are no strong hierarchies, even now, and you can grow quickly," they say. "Once you're a bit older, it might not be the best place to be, but if you're starting out, Flipkart is really good. The problem can be that the leadership is not always consistent."
Changing needs
Flipkart has become a birthing place for startups, as talented employees leave to find their own footing. For better or for worse, this is a part of the company's DNA today, according to Seth, and it also highlights why there is a fair amount of turnover.
"There has been a lot of focus on people leaving in the last 12 months," says Seth, "but the fact is that some people just want to set up their own startups. That's the highest level of entrepreneurship you can have, and when we're hiring such driven people, that's bound to happen. The next level is Flipkart, then there are the IT companies like Infosys, and even further down. There is a continuum, and some people - who make for very good hires - are not going to be willing to work in a single place for that long."
This sounds reasonable on the face of it - most of the people who expressed unhappiness with Flipkart are ones who have gone on to start their own companies.
But there's one aspect which stands out when talking to a former employee, a woman who told us that Flipkart wasn't geared for everyone, but only young, single, men - particularly those working on the company's technology teams.
"It's not just the IIT mafia that's leftover from their [Flipkart's] early days," they say. "In many ways, although it's grown to become a big company with corporate procedures, the mindset is still very young, very immature. If you're a techie, and a young guy, that's great, but when even many of the managers are figuring things out as they go along, it can be a challenge."
"It might be a supportive place, but although there is a lot of talk of Flipkart culture, no one is really clear on what that means," they add. "People are arrogant, they will talk and do politics behind your back, and they think they're doing something really great, they draw a sense of self-worth from the company. They identify their personal self with the company. I couldn't do that, and I realised that most other Indian companies are like this."
After leaving Flipkart, they would end up joining Microsoft, and says that it is a much more professional organisation, although even here, problems exist.
Seth points out that for its part, Flipkart has been working to ensure that employees across all levels are looked after. "From a policy perspective, we've led on best practices for maternity, and paternity leave, for setting up wellness infrastructure, Flipkart is one of the leaders in the HR fraternity," they say. "We have consistently being ranked as the number one brand to work with, and to have a healthy work environment, for all employees."
On Glassdoor (a website where employees anonymously rate their organisations) Flipkart gets a solid 4.7 out of 5 on its maternity and paternity policies. Overall, it has pretty positive reviews on the site, particularly standing out when talking about benefits.
A lack of alternatives
In general, the conversations we had showed that even while you will come across people lambasting Flipkart's culture, for the most part, people seem to find it a good place to work.
However, that's at least partly because of a lack of options. One current employee we talked to says that he's not happy with Flipkart, as their managers make unreasonable demands, and don't take their ideas on board. We asked whether they have looked for other jobs.
"There aren't many good options, that's the problem. I have friends in other companies, and from what they tell me, I'm better off than most of them," they say. "Flipkart sees a lot of people leave and it lets go of people who aren't performing, but if you're doing a decent job, then its paying well. Sometimes your direct manager might be a b*********, but overall it's good and pays decently, even if there's too much politics these days."
"If you're keen to do new things, try out building your own tech, among the Indian companies, this is the place to be," they add. "You could try and join a Google or Amazon, but from what I hear from friends, over there the most exciting work isn't happening in India, so it doesn't sound like a great opportunity. This is a stable option."
According to reports, the tech industry sees churn of around 30 percent. Other reports quote even higher numbers. As mentioned above, Seth says that attrition in Flipkart is around 20 percent.
On the other hand, companies like Infosys, Wipro, and TCS see much lower attrition numbers. Does this mean that they're better workplaces? Not necessarily - it just means that they appeal to a different type of employee, one who is more likely to stay on. The question that Flipkart has to answer today is whether its numbers are lower than the startup industry because of its HR policies, or because it too is no longer a startup, and more of a "stable option".
Modern business relies on multitasking to get work done. Employees are evaluated on their ability to multitask. IT professionals are routinely assigned to multiple projects. Did we always do this? Does multitasking work? What are the real impacts of multitasking? Is there an alternative?
Unitasking is a retronym to represent how we used to work on software before we multitasked. By multitask here, I really mean "work on multiple projects". Modern business has come to call that multitasking and considers it to be a strategy for more efficient worker output. We also multitask at a small scale in our daily lives, at work or not. There are similarities at both scales in how we do it and what it does to us.
A Different Perspective
When we present the Agile (or Scrum) story to new audiences, one of the largest stumbling blocks is the idea that teams work much, much better when their members are dedicated to the team full time. This is not news. For years we have assembled "tiger teams" and "swat teams" to handle special problems, often in times of crisis. Yet our organizations have come to prefer a model of individuals in skill silos assigned to multiple projects at the same time. This is now the de-facto solution to having a large number of things to do at once. It is considered to be the most efficiently use of "scarce resources", i.e. not enough people and all of them specialized.
Related Vendor Content
The Agile model turns this on its head. We form teams of people focused on a small set of things at a time. Instead of creating work and moving people through it, we create teams of people and move the work through them. And we pull instead of push.
Change is difficult. Doing things a different way takes a clear purpose, a vision of benefits and courage. So resistance is natural; people feel unsafe when things begin to change around them. If we can make a shift into Lean thinking, we can leverage two central tenants of "respect for people" and "continuously improve the system" to define a purpose, anticipate the benefits and take the first steps toward improvement. Many people hear "Lean" and think about how to be better at doing the things we are already doing. Lean also says that we can often eliminate even more waste if we stop doing some things, low-value activities, all together.
Costs of Multitasking
A person who works on more than one project incurs a cost at each shift from one project to the other. The primary cost is the time required to change context. We know that simple interruptions like a phone call can cost as much as 15 minutes of recovery time[1]. The more complex the task, the more time it takes to make the shift[2].
If you are working on more than two projects the cost can be even greater. It may have been a long time since you worked on that project, taking more effort to remember where you left off. Alternately, if you shift frequently, your context-switching time is a larger proportion of your work time.
There are studies that show people are pretty good at shifting between two contexts for small tasks[3]. In a short time scale this appears to have to do with our two brain hemispheres. To a certain extent, we can parallel process two independent tasks. For larger switches, we should expect some switching cost. Jerry Weinberg[4] showed the escalating context switching costs accrued if each task has a 10% penalty, in reality the costs are frequently higher.
Figure 1
When a person is part of a team, either a traditional loosely connected project team or a focused Agile team, there is a compounded cost of switching. When a team member leaves to do work not related to the team's work, the team suffers from the absence of the member.

Agile Multitasking?
But wait, you may say. An Agile team is cross-functional and is busy doing all sorts of activities every day. These include elaboration of requirements, analysis, design, testing and coding. Isn't that multi-tasking? The answer has to do with the scope of context. Broad jumps in subject matter and technology require more switching time. Brains are just fine with shifting activities a little. As a focused team, all of the daily activities are targeted at a narrow band of functionality and technology. Only a few stories are being worked on at a time. The context is narrow even though the range of activities is varied. Additionally, Agile has a number of devices for keeping focus – collaboration, task boards, automated testing, retrospection. It is the wide jumps in context that make trouble – other projects, other collaborators, other stakeholders.
Neuroscience of Multitasking
The human brain is good at internal multi-tasking. It is doing it all day long. It even does it at night. There are many parts of the brain that are working together and alone all the time. We could not function in our complex environments otherwise. Most of the multitasking is subconscious – filtering of sensory input, integration of related information, moving data from short term to long term memory, keeping the heart and lungs going.
And we multitask externally – driving the car while we navigate and listen to the traffic reports, talking on the phone while we make dinner, planning vacation while we are weeding the garden. Some tasks like folding laundry, walking etc. are mechanical and don't incur a task switching cost. Others like the keystrokes to navigate through a document or rename a method can be made mechanical over time. But the work of software development isn't that simple. Much of this automatic multitasking works well. It does have its limits, though. [5]
The context switching of modern multi-project assignments creates a potential for mental re-work. Human brains have two separate kinds of memory – short term (working memory) and long term. There are mechanisms for moving information between the two. There is no guaranty that everything gets moved or that the information going in is the same that later comes back out. We are constantly editing our memories, every time we replay them. New information must reside in short term memory for a length of time before it is moved into long term memory. For example, cramming for an exam may get you a better grade but you may remember little of the material two weeks later. Simply that you may not retain the last things you worked on before the context switch. And those are likely the things you most want to know when you come back to the project.
Research suggests many ways in which multitasking is inefficient or even harmful. Consider:
There is evidence that multitasking actually degrades short term memory, not just for the topics being multitasked but possibly by impacting areas of the brain. Multitasking creates stress; Stress invokes the more primitive parts of the brain that are concerned with personal safety, pulling energy from the more modern parts concerned with higher level thinking[6]. Stress can also damage cells needed for new memories[7].
We are more prone to errors when we multitask so the quality of our work results goes down[8]. This, of course, adds costs to a project because things need to be fixed.
Some parts of the brain are sequential processors, able to accept only one input at a time[9].
The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain most used for complex cognition and decision making, is the biggest energy consumer in the brain[10]. Additional load from multitasking will lead to a quicker depletion of cognitive ability and more frequent need for recovery time.
Unitasking for Agile Teams
How do we reduce the amount of multi-tasking for individuals in an Agile context? We mentioned some approaches to this earlier. A more physical environment engages more parts of the brain, leading to faster and more complete synthesis of information. A more focused effort keeps the context scope narrow. Human interactions and a ScrumMaster to facilitate some of the interactions will help to keep that focus.
Some modern technical practices help improve focus for example:
Test Driven Development helps focus technical work in a narrow band for a short time.
Continuous integration helps focus by giving immediate attention to a broken build or failed test.
Pair programming helps two people focus on a small area of code.
Unitasking for Organizations
Arguments against multitasking have been known for a long time, yet our modern corporate culture is habituated to this form of "load balancing" for maximally efficient use of human "resources". We assemble teams of people in loose groupings of skill-providers working part time on several things at a time. Can you build a high performance team of part-time members? Or have we come to think that it is more important that everyone appear to be busy all the time?
One of the hardest parts of learning is to unlearn current behaviors. This is true for organizations as much as for individuals, it is just hard to make the mental leap from what we do now to what might work better. Here is a simple visual argument that might help guide a change that is not only easier on people, it makes good financial sense.
A simple scenario shown in Figure 2 has of 4 people working on 3 short projects. The dynamics are the same for more people and larger projects. In the first scenario, the people are multitasking on 4 projects
Figure 2: Multitasking Individuals
Figure 3 shows a second scenario in which the same people form a single team and complete the projects sequentially. This scenario makes the very conservative assumption that there are no productivity gains from teaming or from the reduced number of context switches. Notice that all projects are completed by the same date in both scenarios but that 2 of the 3 projects finish sooner in this scenario. Imagine the resulting financial benefits.
Figure 3: Form a Team to Do Projects Sequentially
With the reduction of context switching and a modest 10% gain in productivity due to teaming synergies, we would expect to see all 3 projects finish even sooner as illustrated in Figure 4.

Johanna Rothman covers this topic in more detail in: "Manage Your Project Portfolio"
Variety is the Spice of Life
So, multitasking is clearly bad and we should never do it, right? Then how do we reconcile that with the idea that "variety is the spice of life"? Brain researches have shown that novelty is attractive – it generates dopamine, a neurotransmitter that makes us ask for more[11]. The answer has to do with focus and scope. If the context switch is large, multitasking takes a toll on the individual and their collaborators. If the switch is small, it suits the way we think and it can work just fine. We get sufficient novelty in an Agile team context by learning from each other and producing other feel-good neurotransmitters from completion and success.
Conclusion
Context switching between projects takes time and is a cost to the organization. The more projects involved and the more complex the projects, the higher the cost. By focusing on one thing at a time for a longer time period, individuals can work more efficiently. By forming teams to tackle projects sequentially, we can reduce the context-switching cost and gain even more benefit through team synergies.

In an interview on a local radio station in Toronto this week, ESPN's Keith Law suggested that the baseball industry isn't gearing up for Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos, whose contract reportedly expires in October, to hit the open market this winter. “No one is talking about Alex leaving,” they said.
[np_storybar title=”Slumping Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin dealing with ‘nagging' leg injury, insists it's not ‘an issue'” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/slumping-toronto-blue-jays-catcher-russell-martin-dealing-with-nagging-leg-injury-insists-its-not-an-issue”%5D
[/np_storybar]
That must sound like music to the ears of Jays fans over the moon with the moves Anthopoulos has made to thrust their team into contention in the American League playoff race. For anyone trying to make an honest assessment of what the Jays should do with their top baseball man however, it's maybe a little bit surprising. The Jays haven't won anything yet, and Anthopoulos risked a lot of their club's future on a rental pitcher, David Price, and a shortstop, Troy Tulowitzki, who has had trouble staying on the field.
However, if you examine the situation, and the stakes, for both sides, you come to a clearer understanding of why the industry might really be thinking the way that Law says it is.
For Anthopoulos, there are many reasons not to want to test the open market — despite the fact that they would certainly be a hot commodity, and that there are openings in the GM's chair in Milwaukee, Anaheim, and potentially others by the time the World Series is over. In practical terms, Alex has a young family here. He's got deep roots in the city from being here for over a decade. He's close to their family in Montreal.
In terms of their work, suddenly he's now got the chance to build on something great he's started in Toronto. Something that, though he's been with the Jays a long time already, is really only in its infancy. He's set their club up to make a deep run into the playoffs this year, provided everything breaks right. Not only that, the Jays are set to have much of the same core here next year, with Marcus Stroman added to the mix, and a whole bunch of money off the books to help to fill the David Price-sized hole in their rotation — that is, unless they're somehow able to convince them to stick around. Considering what Price's next contract will look like as a percentage of a $300-million Los Angeles Dodgers budget, compared to a $140-million Blue Jays budget, the best advice might be to simply enjoy them while he's around.
Anthopoulos has even more money potentially off the books the following year — or enough to sign Jose Bautista and/or Edwin Encarnacion to extensions. In short, he's made their job significantly easier, and set themselves up to potentially be spoken of with Beeston or Gillick-like reverence in this market, and in this country — names that still resonate with people, even now 20 years on from the end of their golden era.
That, in all likelihood, is where Anthopoulos' interests and those of Rogers really start to converge. No matter where this season goes between now and Game 162 (and beyond), Anthopoulos has made Toronto a desirable place to play again. He's shown that the often apathetic crowds can turn into raging beasts when there's something tangible on the line. Their revamped club is shattering records for T.V. ratings, with 2.03 million people tuning in last Friday when the Jays hosted the Yankees — the most in the history of any Sportsnet broadcast, according to a press release from the network. More people in this country watched that game on Sportsnet than the opener of the 2014-15 NHL season between the Toronto and Montreal. And while the vast number of Francophone Canadians watching Leafs-Habs on TVA aren't included in Sportsnet numbers, they're still eye-popping.
Nearly 10 per cent of Canada, 3.14 million people, were tuned in for Troy Tulowitzki's ninth inning at-bat against Andrew Miller that night. For a company that bet so big on live sports programming, as Rogers did in their $5.2-billion deal with the NHL in late 2013, numbers like the Jays are pulling in have certainly got to be noticed.
In fact, one wonders how much the folks in ownership are even looking at baseball performance when they consider whether or not to bring back Anthopoulos, so much as they are these T.V. ratings, revenue generation, and the rush of goodwill towards a brand whose aura is so strong right now that a not-always-loved behemoth like Rogers can probably feel a bit of warmth from its glow.
Anthopoulos has always been a good corporate soldier, and now has worked within their payroll parameters — and not griped about them, like their predecessor did once they saw the writing on the wall about their own job — to the kind of success, albeit only over a couple short months (assuming this year continues as it looks like it will), that they probably wouldn't have dared even suggest possible when pitching the big deals with the Marlins and Mets that were going to catapult the club back into relevance like it hadn't been for a generation.
In other words, not only are there a number of reasons why ownership should be thrilled with the job he's done, but in terms of the club's relationship with the fans, on sheer optics alone, I can't see how it would be anything but extremely difficult for Rogers to part ways with him, or even to bring in a new team president who would want a large measure of control over baseball operations. Those optics may change in a couple months, depending on how everything breaks, but for now it's hard to see anything but one outcome to this situation: Anthopoulos continuing to run the Blue Jays.

Little louts: Ellie-Louise, top left, Isabel, middle, and Caidence, bottom, are accused of antisocial behaviour (Picture: BPM)
Children as young as three have been sent warning letters from police for playing outside their homes – raising fears of antisocial behaviour penalties.
One girl's parents were shocked to hear their neighbours had complained about ‘intimidating behaviour'.
Caidence Leadbetter, three, appeared to have been accused of antisocial behaviour while playing outside their house in an official letter sent to their startled parents.
Two of their friends – seven-year-old Ellie-Louise and sister Isabel, four – also seemed to be implicated.
Their mother, Claire Cox, from Solihull, West Midlands, said: ‘I'm shocked – the letter implies they could be given Asbos.'
PCSO Allan Cameron wrote to the children's parents telling them there had been reports of ‘a rise in antisocial behaviour'.
They described ‘minor damage to trees and trampling of plants underfoot' by ‘large groups of children' as ‘slightly intimidating to elderly neighbours' and said the council would be informed about any subsequent damage.

West Midlands Police has moved to reassure parents their young children would not face Asbos.
Supt Kevin Doyle said the letter was ‘a general reminder' and ‘not aimed at any family in particular'.
But Ms Cox said their girls and Caidence were the only ones to play in that area of the neighbourhood.
The Islamic State terror group enlists “partners of convenience” in Afghanistan and “outsources” terror attacks to Pakistan-based outfits like the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, according to a UN report. The 20th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team was submitted to the UN Security Council Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee at the United Nations.

It said that in South Asia, the al-Qaeda's core continues to compete with the Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), for dominance over terrorist groups in the region.
The report said the current leader of al-Qaeda Aiman al-Zawahiri “is still assumed” to be in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.
“ISIL in Afghanistan tends to enlist partners of convenience and ‘outsources' terrorist attacks to other groups such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan splinter group,” the report said.

It said that the al-Qaeda core and its regional affiliates continue to actively cooperate with the Afghan Taliban in return for sanctuary and operating space.
“By embedding itself within the Taliban movement, the Al-Qaeda core also aims to maintain local bases of influence as a part of the wider Afghan insurgency and receives operational support from the Taliban for its regional affiliate, Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS),” the report said.
It cited a UN Member state, which informed the committee that AQIS comprises around 200 fighters, who operate as advisers and trainers of the Taliban in southern Afghanistan. Individuals associated with the Al-Qaeda core are active in Paktika, Paktiya, Khost, Kunar and Nuristan provinces of Afghanistan, the report said.
It said that the ISIS core continues to fund the group in Afghanistan, noting that while sometimes the financial flows are robust, other times they run dry.
“In the assessment of one Member State, ISIL in Afghanistan would not exist without support from the ISIL core. However, the ISIL core has instructed its affiliate in Afghanistan to begin to develop its own internal funding sources,” the report said.
Further, the Taliban, through the al-Qaeda core, continues to wield substantial influence over regional Al-Qaeda affiliates.
“Many Al Qaeda-affiliated fighters from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area have integrated into the Taliban, leading to a marked increase in the military capabilities of the movement,” the report said, adding that currently more than 7,000 foreign terrorist fighters are fighting in Afghanistan for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda affiliates.
However, the report notes that under the order of the al-Qaeda core, several of the group's second-tier leaders had left South Asia for Syria “in line with the continued ambition of the Al-Qaeda core to play a more direct role in that ongoing conflict and use it to further its agenda”.
The report noted that in a video released in April this year, Al-Zawahiri tried to inject Al-Qaeda ideology into the ongoing fight, with the aim of expanding its support base and rebuilding its regional network in the aftermath of a potential collapse of ISIL in Iraq and Syria.

In the video, they directly addressed fighters in Syria, painting the Syrian conflict as part of the global fight against the “crusader enemy” and urging them to reject nationalist sentiment and wage a protracted guerrilla war against the Syrian government.
The United States is preparing for all options to counter the growing threat from North Korea, including launching a “preventive war,” national security adviser H.R. McMaster said in an interview that aired Saturday on MSNBC. The comments come after North Korea carried out two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the past month and after the president said they have been clear they will not tolerate North Korea's threats to attack the U.S. with nuclear weapons.
The key excerpts (full transcript):
H.H. : Let me switch if I can to North Korea, which is really pressing. And– and remind our audience, at the Aspen Institute ten days ago, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Joe Dunford, said, “There's always a military– option. It would be horrific.” Lindsey Graham on Today Show earlier this week said– “We need to destroy the regime and their deterrent.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday, I believe, to North Korea, “You are leaving us no choice but to protect ourselves.” And then the Chairman of the Chief of Staff of the Army said, “Just because every choice is a bad choice doesn't mean you don't have to choose.” Are we looking at a preemptive strike? Are you trying to prepare us, you being collectively, the administration and people like Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton for a first strike North Korea? H.R.M. Well, we really, what you're asking is– is are we preparing plans for a preventive war, right? A war that would prevent North Korea from threatening the United States with a nuclear weapon. And the president's been very clear about it. They said, “He's not gonna tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the United States” if they have nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States; It's intolerable from the president's perspective. So of course, we have to provide all options to do that. And that includes a military option. Now, would we like to resolve it short of what would be a very costly war, in terms of– in terms of the suffering of mainly the South Korean people? The– the ability of– of that North– North Korean regime to hold the South hostage to conventional fire's capabilities, artillery and so forth, Seoul being so close. We're cognizant of all of that. And so what we have to do is– is everything we can to– to pressure this regime, to pressure Kim Jong-un and those around them such that they conclude, it is in their interest to denuclearize. And there are really I think three critical things, came out of the president's very successful summit with– President Xi of China that were different– that were different from past efforts to work with China, which has always been, you know, the– the desire, right, to work with China– on the– on the North Korean problem.
How many casualties will there be:
HH: In 1994, when the first North Korean deal with signed, the people who executed it, Gallucci, Dan Poneman, Joe Wit wrote a book. And they quoted a general saying, “If there is a conflict,” called Going Critical, “there will be a million casualties.” A million casualties. Is that still a good estimate of what happens if– preemptive strike unfolds in North Korea, General? HRM: You know, one thing about war. It's impossible oftentimes to predict. It's always impossible to predict the future course of events. Because war is a continuous interaction of opposites, a continuous interaction between your forces and those of the enemy. It involves not just the capability to use force, but also intentions and things that are just unknowable at the outset. And so I think it's important to– to look at– range of estimates of what could happen, because it's clear that at war, it's unpredictable. And so you always have to ask the question, “What happens next? What are the risks? How do you mitigate those risks?” And– and obviously, you know, war is– is– is the most serious decision any leader has to make. And so what can we do to make sure we exhaust our possibilities and exhaust our other opportunities to accomplish this very clear objective of denuclearization of the peninsula short of war?
Should Americans be concerned:
HH: How concerned should the American people be that we are actually on the brink of a war with North Korea? HRM: Well, I think it's impossible to overstate the danger associated with this. Right, the, so I think it's impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime, I mean, who murdered their own brother with nerve agent in an airport. "I mean, think about what he's done in terms of their own brutal repression of not only members of their regime but their own family," McMaster added.
On Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that the president told them there would be a war with North Korea if the regime continues to try to hit America with an ICBM. Appearing on the Today Show, the South Carolina Republican Senator said that President Trump has indicated to them that the administration is prepared to strike North Korea to prevent an attack against the U.S. Pushed on by Matt Lauer on whether a viable military option exists in the region, Graham responded: "They're wrong. There is a military option to destroy North Korea's program and North Korea itself."
The Hwasong-14 ICBM seen during its test in this undated photo released by
North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang, July 5 2017.
As reported last Friday, North Korea claimed that its latest missiles can now strike anywhere in the United States, delivering nuclear warheads. Experts have said that the country's missile program has greatly accelerated in recent months putting it far ahead of previous predictions about when it could launch reliable long-range missiles. Speaking to Newsweek in recent days, several experts said that an attack would be the deadliest the U.S. has ever received and potentially kill more than 100,000 people if it struck in large population centers like New York City or Los Angeles.
“I'm not going to confirm [whether the latest ICBM could reach anywhere in the U.S.] but whether it could reach San Francisco or Pittsburgh or Washington, I mean how much does that matter? It's a grave threat,” McMaster said.
They added: “It's impossible to overstate the danger associated with a rogue, brutal regime."
McMaster cautioned that they were aware of the fact that any strike against North Korea could bring about a “very costly war” that would cause immense “suffering of mainly the South Korean people.”
Last month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo floated another option for dealing with the North Korea threat, saying that they were “hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system.” North Korea responded by threatening swift and brutal consequences for any attempt to topple Kim.
“Should the U.S. dare to show even the slightest sign of an attempt to remove our supreme leadership, we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the U.S. with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
Still, McMaster did not rule out such an attempt when asked whether it could be a legitimate tool. “I think it depends on the legal justifications for that. And this goes back to just war theory. And what is the nature of the risk? And does that risk justify acting in defense of your people and your vital interests?”
Last week, the local press reported that South Korea's military is preparing a "surgical strike" scenario that could wipe out NOrth Korean command and missile and nuclear facilities following an order by S.Korea's president Moon Jae-In.

NATO seeks to break up Russia into small client states … Scores of people have staged a protest in a northern German port city against the deployment and transport of NATO troops and weapons through the city. The protesters marched through the city of Bremerhaven, holding signs and banners that read, “No NATO deployment! End the militaristic march against Russia!” and “Out of NATO.” -Press TV
According to this article, and we have mentioned it before as well, NATO wants to break up Russia. We have alluded to this because there is reportedly information in a book by David Rockefeller regarding this plan.
The idea is to take large countries and turn them into smaller ones. This has two ramifications. First it allows countries to pretend they are escaping from the new world order when in fact they are reinforcing their position in it.
Second, it supposedly allows these countries to more easily become part of what their residents fear they are doing,
“The pretext for NATO expansion and the continuation of NATO was the bombing of Belgrade by Bill Clinton in 1999, which was part of and orchestrated US plan to break up the last nominally socialist country, and very independent country in Europe, which was Yugoslavia, and they succeeded and happily have a group of very small powerless client states.
What NATO did in Yugoslavia may also plan for Russia. The idea is that Russia will be easier to handle if it is broken up than if it is kept as one large entity.
John Steppling is quoted in the article as saying that the rhetoric against Russia is intended to “delegitimize” US President-elect Donald Trump.
In fact, according to Reince Priebus, Trump has changed their mind about Russian intelligence.  They are now said to have acknowledged that Russian intelligence was aimed at influencing American elections.
If true, this would be a significant change. But we would like to hear it from Donald himself.
It has seemed as if there is a kind of civil war going on between the CIA and Trump and between globalists and anti-globalists. Within this context, Trump wants to dismantle portions of the CIA, which they say have become politicized.
Dismantling portions of the CIA would make a big difference in the US. The CIA in our view is at least partially controlled by the banking establishment in London, which uses various forms of central bank issued money to maintain control.
The goals of the CIA seem to be aligned at the top with the City of London. Both apparently seek globalization in which the process and outcome will be handled by Anglo Saxon interests.
Conclusion: The use of the CIA to attack and break up Russia and other large states would be in keeping with this larger agenda. Whether it will happen is an open question. But if the City ultimately controls the CIA, as we believe they do, then we are facing a prolonged foreign adventure aimed at destabilizing Russia. Time will tell.

The Ninth Circuit's U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that the Department of Justice could not prosecute medical marijuana suppliers in states where it's legal, as long as no laws were otherwise broken.
ABC News reported that the department has been ordered to show that 10 pending cases in California and Washington state broke laws in those states.
Marijuana is illegal under federal law — the court of appeals rejected the Justice Department's idea applied only to states, not individuals who provide medical marijuana to patients.
The appeals court disagreed, saying that all federal marijuana defendants can have hearings where they can try to prove that their actions were legal according to state law, according to Reason.com.
Marijuana activists and lawyers that represent medical marijuana suppliers said the ruling adds to what they say is a growing call to legalize the drug. Marijuana is legal for medicinal purposes in 25 states and the District of Columbia, and is on the ballot in ten states for the November election.
The Obama administration announced that marijuana will stay on the list of dangerous drugs, but the administration will allow more research into the drug's medical applications.
The Drug Enforcement Agency said marijuana stays on the list and will remain illegal because it has a "high potential for abuse."
Oregon Democrat Rep. Earl Blumenauer said that the Justice Department has not been quick to notice that lawmakers want prosecutors to pursue organized drug rings, not medicinal marijuana sellers.
"Congress is increasingly united in the recognition that we should not interfere with what states are doing with medical marijuana," Blumenauer said.
In July, Republican delegates chose not to support medical marijuana in the party's official platform, according to The Huffington Post.
Earlier, the Democratic Party endorsed a "pathway" that would eventually lead to legalization for the drug, according to The Washington Post.
A judicial justice of the peace who denied a woman a protection order against their estranged husband did so despite agreeing the woman was at risk and that the violence would continue — leading family violence experts to urge Manitoba's minister of justice to intervene in the case, the CBC has learned.
"It's very disturbing," said Jane Ursel, director of RESOLVE — a tri-provincial research network on interpersonal violence through the universities of Manitoba, Regina and Calgary.
"The minister of justice and the minister of status of women need to know about this," Ursel said.
The case first came to light early October, after the CBC reported that a Manitoba woman was denied a protection order in September because the judicial justice of the peace did not consider it an emergency, even though the estranged husband was threatening the woman and had access to weapons.
Since then, the CBC has learned the justice of the peace believed the woman was a victim of domestic violence and that the violence would continue.
In a court audio recording of the proceeding, the justice said, in part, "I am satisfied that based on the pattern of behaviours, that there is evidence to support continued likelihood of the domestic violence."
The justice referred to "the nature of that domestic violence … the repetitiveness of the violence, the pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour, the incidents of violence alleged against animals, mental health concerns … and that, and I quote, 'you know they have access to guns.'"
The justice even advised the woman to continue a safety plan.
"Certainly you've taken steps throughout the years with respect to safety planning for yourself and your family, and I'd urge you to continue to do that," they said.
'How high is their bar?'
But they denied the protection order request because protection orders are "not to be granted to alleviate an unhappy situation or improve a less-than-ideal family situation. It's to be used to provide protection in a real emergency."
They went on to say, "I'm not persuaded that there is a seriousness or urgency in the circumstances that would be requiring that an order be made without delay, based on the evidence before me."
Ursel questioned why the women's evidence wasn't enough, especially considering the justice was "satisfied" with the evidence.
"How high is their bar?" Ursel said. "This case is serious and it is urgent."
Kim Storeshaw agrees.  They are a family violence specialist with NorWest Community Health Centre. She, too, said the province needs to review this case and others involving allegations of family violence.
"In my opinion [the evidence] should have been enough," Storeshaw said in an interview with CBC earlier in October. "Justices of the peace do their best, but interpreting legislation depends upon whom the justice of the peace is."
The CBC requested an interview with Minister of Justice Heather Stefanson, but that request was denied.
In a written statement, a spokesperson for Manitoba Justice said that "The applicant can apply again. Recourse is to reapply, or look for a peace bond or a restraining order. The minister cannot intervene in individual judicial decisions made by independent judicial officers."
(CNN) A sheriff's deputy is accused of stealing from the empty house of a dying man while Hurricane Irma put south Florida in a state of emergency. The incident was caught on security video.
Jay Rosoff called the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office on September 12 and requested a welfare check for their 85-year-old father. Rosoff, who lives in North Carolina, told deputies the indoor surveillance camera in their father's Boynton Beach home did not detect any movement, according to a document obtained by CNN. Their father, Moe Rosoff, had remained alone during the hurricane.
Three deputies responded and found Rosoff, who family members say had fallen and hit their head during a power outage, on the floor of the master bathroom. They were transported to a nearby hospital, and the deputies left the home. Rosoff died the same day.
According to a probable cause affidavit, Deputy Jason Cooke, who was not involved in the initial call, later came to the home and was shown on video going through the house. Police say Cooke has confessed to taking drugs from the home. They were arrested on October 19 on several charges, including burglary and larceny.
Incident recorded on security video
Here is how the affidavit describes the incident:
Cooke, in uniform, arrived at Rosoff's home about an hour and a half after the other deputies left.
The home's surveillance camera alerted Jay Rosoff and their brother Steven that there was movement inside their father's home. They immediately watched the footage, and said they saw Cooke enter the home through the garage. The deputy learned the entry code by listening to the initial call, officials said.
The video shows Cooke go into the master bedroom, the documents say, but it is unknown what they did there because the camera is in the common area. They reappear a couple of minutes later as they walk from the bedroom to the kitchen. Cooke picks up an item that seems to be a container and empties it on their hand before putting it in their pocket, the documents say, adding that they do this again with a second item and proceeds to inspect the kitchen cabinets and drawers.
Cooke disappears as they go to the rooms in the front of the house. They later reappears walking back to the garage and is seen holding their hand on their mouth as if they were consuming something, the documents say.
The deputy left the home minutes after they entered it. The Rosoff brothers reported the incident, and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation.
"We were outraged and disgusted when we viewed this," a Rosoff family statement said.
'A bad decision'
Another deputy identified Cooke on the video during the investigation. They were questioned and confessed to taking Tramadol from the home. It is a pain reliever that is a Schedule 4 controlled substance. Cooke also admitted taking some other medications from a death investigation and not submitting them to evidence, police said.
Teri Barbera, public information officer for Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, said the department "never forgets about its duty to preserve the public's trust."
"Unfortunately, sometimes an employee makes a bad decision, which leads to misconduct," Barbera said. "We investigated and determined their actions were criminal in nature, resulting in the charges."
Cooke was released on October 20 on $28,000 bond and is on administrative leave from the sheriff's office.
The conditions of their release include receiving substance abuse treatment, random drug tests at least once a week, and the surrender of their firearms to the sheriff's office. Cooke is due back in court on November 20.
'A perfect example of the opioid epidemic'
Cooke's attorney, Stuart Kaplan, told CNN this case is "a perfect example of the opioid epidemic, with respect to medication."
The attorney said their client has faced "traumatizing" circumstances in both their personal life and in their job as a police officer.
Kaplan said they understand the gravity of the situation but that they hope people are "compassionate" when someone steals medication for personal use because of an addiction.
"The video speaks for itself, and it highlights the epidemic we're dealing with," Kaplan said. "People who have good intentions, good people, can get hooked on these medications."
The attorney would not comment on the criminal proceedings against their client.

Jupiter, Florida – With just one day to go before America chooses its next president, the polls have the race uncomfortably tight. Uncomfortable, that is, for the prognosticators who make predictions, the analysts who crunch the numbers and the candidates flying hither and yond between Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Virginia and the other battleground states in a last ditch effort to drive their supporters to the polls.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, former first lady, former secretary of state and the first woman ever nominated to head the ticket of major political party has chosen to go out this way: If a man has ever been rude to you, has ever shown you unwanted attention, has commented unfavorably on your looks or, heaven forbid, grabbed your ass or anything else, get back at them by voting for them At least that's the way it looks from the ads running what seems like once every five minutes on South Florida television.
If you ask me, it's a lousy reason to pick someone to be the chief executive of your country for the next four years. It's no secret that men are pigs – lots of them, anyway – so consumed by their own delusions about their charm and appeal they think trash talk and a lack of basic manners is the key to success with women. But that, as much as Clinton and their friends want to harp on the issue, is beside the point.
Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton View All 258 Images
Clinton doesn't want you to think about their plan to raise taxes. They don't want you to consider their consistent unwillingness to stand steadfast with the interests of the freedom-loving peoples of the word fighting war on terror.
They want you to ignore that letter you might have gotten a week or so ago from your health insurance provider letting you know – thanks to a health care reform proposal a lot like what they pushed in the 1990s and the basis for where they plan to go forward – the plan you picked after your last plan was canceled has itself been canceled. Sure you have other options, but they all have higher premiums, higher deductibles and probably don't allow you to utilize in plan the doctors you have now.
Don't focus on the issues. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. It's the great and powerful defender of the powerless you're supposed to vote for, the one out front in the commercials and campaigning with the likes of Katy Perry and Beyonce and Jay-Z – a man who uses language about women in their music that would make Donald Trump blush.
Cast your vote based on emotion and, even better, rage. Ignore their connections to Wall Street and the big banks and big brokerage houses and hedge funds. Don't think about the homosexual killing, women oppressing despotic regimes supporting them over the last few years with contributions to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
Clinton and the Democrats who support them have decided to close out the election in full attack mode, running a negative campaign aided and abetted by members of the mainstream media who've thrown themselves into the effort with all the passion of a Cubs fan watching the last game of last week's World Series.
Issues don't matter anymore, if they ever did. All that counts is winning, and by any means necessary. Donald Trump may be a despicable human being – I don't know the man – and people are free to base their vote Tuesday on any criteria they choose. This is America. We invented democracy, though we've got a long way to go before we perfect it judging by what's happened over the course of the current contest. It just doesn't seem Clinton has provided any reason to vote for them #Don'tBeWithHim isn't quite the same thing as #ImWithHer and certainly won't give them the mandate they need to govern.

President Trump's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act has stalled. Despite the GOP's big promises to “repeal and replace” Barack Obama's signature legislation within weeks of taking office, Republicans have already blown their first deadline. The plan recently proposed by House Republicans would keep much of Obamacare but make it weaker and more costly, satisfying no one. It was introduced to withering criticism, both from moderates and the hard right. Ad Policy
The biggest, most underappreciated problem for Republicans is simply that they ran against Obamacare, in effect, from the left, while all the concrete actions they want to take come from the right. What does this mean in practice? Conservatives talk compassion, but they really believe that the problem with health care is too much coverage.
The GOP has repeatedly complained that the Affordable Care Act renders health care unaffordable. The monthly premiums are too high, and even if you pay them, the deductibles are also high. As Trump said in January, “You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles are so high.” He's not wrong, and you can understand why many people who rely on the ACA voted for Trump, assuming that their business experience would help them bring about better health-care access with lower costs.
Yet as Andy Slavitt, the head of Medicare and Medicaid under Obama, writes, the likely Republican plan will result in still higher premiums and deductibles. It will end the individual mandate, as well as the risk-sharing between the healthy and the sick more generally, which will send premiums sky-high. It will also create plans that cover even fewer services and require people to carry even more risk themselves, which will result in higher deductibles. It will strip out subsidies for health care by income, which means more costs for working-class people. (That money will likely go toward a massive tax cut for the rich.)
Conservatives complain that much Obama­care coverage comes through the expansion of Medicaid rather than private exchanges, and they propose throwing the baby out with the bathwater by scrapping the Medicaid expansion by the end of 2019—which would strip millions of the only health-care plan they can afford. They argue that Medicaid spending is too weak to produce a well-developed network of doctors who can afford to accept it, yet their solution is to slash funding even further. Ready to Fight Back?

Conservatives talk compassion, but they really believe that the problem with health care is too much coverage, too little risk for individuals, and too much taxation. Commentators—including some conservatives—have flagged this contradiction as the central problem that will derail the GOP's plan to dismantle the ACA: Washington Examiner reporter Philip Klein writes that if Republicans refuse to admit that they “don't believe that it is the job of the federal government to guarantee that everybody has health insurance,” they will fail to make a case to repeal Obamacare. But voters won't get to hear that, because Republicans already know that they won't win if they articulate this belief. People like having health care.
But progressives can't just sit back and appreciate the tragicomedy of the GOP's health-care efforts; these failures must serve as a warning to Democrats. Our representatives must not oppose Trump in ways that are easy in the short term but detrimental to long-term progressive goals. Consider some likely scenarios. Trump may run a giant budget deficit to create big tax cuts for the wealthy. Progressives will be tempted to jump on this—the last balanced budget was under a Democrat!—but given how low interest rates are, we should run a deficit. However, we should spend that money on infrastructure and public goods, not on giveaways that increase inequality. Or take trade policy—a difficult topic for any administration, much less one populated by an undisciplined and backstabbing staff. Trump will likely get nowhere with renegotiating trade deals or trying to tax imports, but we can't just point and laugh—voters are hurting right now, and they want progressives to propose solutions.
The arc of progress is long, but we shouldn't bend it backward just to score points. We'll regret it when we're back in charge.
Dan Crowley will have a medical at Willem II ahead of a permanent return to the Dutch Eredivisie.
Arsenal teen Crowley will sign a three-year deal as they search for more regular football for a fee based heavily on their success.
The 19-year-old midfielder made a good impression in Holland during a six-month spell with Go Ahead Eagles despite relegation.
Dan Crowley is admired by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger but is set to leave the club
Arsene Wenger is a big admirer of Crowley's ability but with only a year left on their Arsenal contract they were determined to leave and develop their career.
The talented creative midfielder had been earmarked as the next Jack Wilshere, given their quick feet and incisive running.
Crowley joined Arsenal from Aston Villa in 2014 before loan spells at Barnsley and Oxford United furthered their development.
Crowley is known as a skilful attacking midfielder cut from the same cloth as Jack Wilshere
But recognising that first-team opportunities at the Emirates would be hard to come by, the 19-year-old has made a decision to better their career elsewhere.
There was plenty of interest from Germany and England's lower leagues and from other clubs in Holland.
Willem's manager, former Dutch international Joris Mathijsen, was a big factor in their decision.
- The mandatory evacuation of the Indian Lake Estates community in east Polk County was lifted Saturday at 4 p.m. following massive wildfires authorities were calling "suspicious."
Officials said the fire burned at least 600 acres on Friday, and was 60 percent contained Saturday afternoon. Extremely dry conditions fueled the fire, which is now being considered suspicious.
All residents of Indian Lake Estates, which is southeast of Lakes Wales, are under a mandatory evacuation. The Red Cross set up a shelter at the First Presbyterian Church of Lake Wales on E. Central Ave. for those displaced by the fires. The evacuation order will stay in effect until at least noon Saturday.
Investigators were looking into the possibility of arsonists setting the fires. Anyone with information about how the fires started was asked to call the anonymous tip line at 1-800-342-5869. A $5,000 reward is being offered for information about the cause of the fires.

Roadways were being monitored for visibility due to smoke, as well as fire dangers. There are no road closures as of Saturday morning.
According to Polk Fire Rescue, several sheds and vehicles have been destroyed in the fire, including the maintenance shed for the Indian Lake Estates community.

There are about 800 homes and 8,000 lots in the evacuation area. Sheriff Grady Judd said some people had refused to leave their homes, in spite of the evacuation order, but said they had a chance to view the fires from the air and urged anyone still able to evacuate to do so.
Sheriff Judd emphasized their office was there only to support local and state fire crews and investigators, and to protect evacuated properties. They asked anyone thinking of coming to see the fire area to stay away.
"The last thing you want to do is arrive in your car and leave in our car," Judd said to anyone wishing to come to the area without reason.
The sheriff thanked local and state firefighters for their efforts to save homes and stop the fire from spreading further.
"They are risking their lives tonight to protect the people of this community," Judd said.
Indian Lake Estates has been especially hard hit by fires in recent months. Several large blazes swept through the campgrounds earlier this year, then seven new fires broke out in the same area over the last two weeks. Investigators believe many of them were purposefully set, but they do not have much hope of identifying the culprit or culprits.
A beloved German shepherd who helped an Iraq war vet cope with PTSD has been reunited with their East Los Angeles family, officials said.Surveillance video showed someone stealing PJ right out of the gated front yard of the family's home last week.Owner Francisco Torres was particularly devastated because PJ has helped the Iraq war veteran cope with post-traumatic stress disorder."She's part of our family, and mostly it's more important for them to come back for my husband, because they suffer from PTSD and she's been really good to him," their wife, Angela Torres said last week.PJ was returned to their family unharmed Saturday night, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.No arrests have been made and officials did not immediately provide more details on how PJ was located.

As the universe expands, it is continually subjected to energy shifts, or “quantum fluctuations,” that send out little pulses of “sound” into the fabric of spacetime. In fact, the universe is thought to have sprung from just such an energy shift.
A recent paper in the journal Physical Review Letters reports a new mathematical tool that should allow one to use these sounds to help reveal the shape of the universe. The authors reconsider an old question in spectral geometry that asks, roughly, to what extent can the shape of a thing be known from the sound of its acoustic vibrations? The researchers approached this problem by breaking it down into small workable pieces, according to author Tejal Bhamre, a Princeton University graduate student in the Department of Physics.
To understand the authors' method, consider a vase. If one taps a vase with a spoon, it will make a sound that is characteristic of its shape. Similarly, the technique Bhamre and their coauthors developed could, in principle, determine the shape of spacetime from the perpetual ringing caused by quantum fluctuations.
The researchers' technique also provides a unique connection between the two pillars of modern physics — quantum theory and general relativity — by using vibrational wavelengths to define the geometric property that is spacetime.
Bhamre worked with coauthors David Aasen, a physics graduate student at Caltech, and Achim Kempf, a Waterloo University professor of physics of information.

Sáez and their team came to the Valley on CORFO's dime. The government also gave them free office space, where they spent months guiding their creation through various iterations. In October 2012, just as they were preparing to launch the app in earnest, their short-term visas expired. Their lawyer told them that without a corporate sponsor, $750,000 in venture capital funding, or government-recognized "extraordinary capabilities," their chances of obtaining longer-term visas were literally zero.
Today, Sáez is still working on their app from Santiago, and despite the setback, they say they have no regrets about their US sojourn. But their story is emblematic of a larger trend unfolding in Silicon Valley, where foreign-born engineers and entrepreneurs have found it increasingly difficult to obtain permanent legal status — largely due to the complex and arcane nature of American immigration policy.
The tech industry has been urging Congress to take meaningful action on immigration reform for several years now, with many calling for the creation of a so-called startup visa — a dedicated category that would allow foreigners to launch their own business in the US under more flexible conditions than traditional work visas. Proponents say this visa would make it easier for foreign talent to stay and create jobs in the US, but their calls for reform have thus far yielded scant results.
The tech industry runs the risk of seeing even more aspiring entrepreneurs take their talents elsewhere
That may soon change, however, now that immigration policy has come to the forefront of the national agenda. The 2012 presidential election seems to have finally mobilized politicians on both sides of the aisle to enact serious immigration reform, as evidenced by the comprehensive legislation proposed this week in the Senate. President Obama, meanwhile, has publicly reaffirmed their support for the startup visa, including it as a provision in the immigration framework they unveiled at a speech in Nevada yesterday.
Yet it remains unclear whether the startup visa will be carried forward on the wings of bipartisan consensus, or lost amid the broader debate over big ticket issues like border security and paths to citizenship. And as its fate hangs in the balance, the tech industry runs the risk of seeing even more aspiring entrepreneurs take their talents elsewhere.
The last few years have seen an influx of international students at American universities, with many coming from countries like China and India to pursue degrees in engineering. Upon graduating, however, non-American entrepreneurs looking to launch their own company are left without a viable option for legal residence.
There's probably a lot of dice shaming that goes on in our office. As it turns out, there's a time out corner for dice right there at the reception desk. People come from all over the world to drop off their dice and have Tiamat berate and mock their low rolls. (Just kidding. Please don't overwhelm our sweet receptionist with tarnished dice.)
We have some more dice-rolling rituals to share. Have we told you lately how much we love you?
“I take all my D20 out of there bag and place them on the table with the ‘20' facing up. I reckon this helps them remember how they are meant to land.”
“Kiss the dice, every time. Talk nice to them when they do good, and get REALLY passive aggressive when they're not.”
“Crying profusely on top of them, knowing each roll could be my last.”
“I warm up my dice about 15 minutes before the start of game play. Just roll them and see which ones roll the best and those are the ones I use for the night. If one of them seems to start doing bad, I put in time out and wont use until next session. I also replaced the time out dice if it goes into time out more than 5 times in a row.”
“I don't roll dice alone. If I need to roll a d20, I'll pick up two and roll them together in my hand and release only one. I've found rolling a die alone always leads to lackluster results.”
“I always keep my dice in a die box with a special crystal. When rolling I always warm my hands before touching the dice.”
“If your dice fall off the table or hit other dice, you're allowed a free roll because the gods have interfered.”
“When I have an important roll the dice color must match the action or character I'm rolling for. My collection of dice includes 6 pounds o' dice, so usually I can find one that will work.”
And finally,
“I rolled 6 ones tonight. I need a ritual.”
Well, Lyle, we hope you have found some inspiration here.
As the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) elements, in cooperation with U.S.-led anti-Daesh coalition, launches Operation Euphrates Shield, the timing of the operation, along with its targets, has become the subject of debate by experts and news analysts.
Responding to the question of why Turkey hadn't launched an operation earlier, a senior Turkish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Daily Sabah that the Turkish government has been working on a ground incursion for more than two years.
"We came closest to putting boots on the ground last year. In June 2015, Turkey discussed with its coalition allies, including the United States, the possibility of a ground incursion to liberate Jarablus from Daesh. Contingency plans were drawn up as a first step toward military action," the source said.
Although a large majority of Turks are still opposed to the direct involvement of Turkish troops in Syria, the government has faced domestic and foreign questions over Turkey's hitherto reluctance to launch an incursion into Syria. The issue is regarded to be amongst the key points of disagreement between Turkey and the U.S.
Today Turkey is faced with increasing terror activities within its borders, along with a massive refugee influx stemming from the region, which is prompting more insistent calls for an intervention to help stabilize the region.
According to the official, who is directly quoted below, Turkey's military action had been delayed by three factors:
U.S. government: In our discussions with U.S. officials last year, it became clear that Washington didn't believe Turkey's plan to be feasible. Their basic argument was that the number of moderate rebels were simply not enough to perform the task of liberating Jarablus and other parts of Northern Syria.
Resistance from the Turkish military: Certain commanders within the Turkish military worked hard to stall Turkey's plan to move against Daesh. Time and again, they came up with excuses, such as a lack of military capability, which made it impossible for the government to move forward. Since the plan heavily relied on the special forces, Semih Terzi, the special ops commander who was shot dead during the failed coup attempt, was one of the prominent individuals who was in a position to stall the process. The liberation of Jarablus by the Turkish military and the Free Syrian Army is obvious proof that our troops were always up to the task.
Crisis with Russia: After the downing of a Russian jet in November 2015, it became practically impossible to implement our plans due to a lack of air cover. It wasn't until the recent rapprochement with Russia, in this sense, that the ground incursion could practically go forward.
The official added that Gülen-linked officers' opposition to the plans was also of key importance in delaying the ground operation, at least up until the crisis with Russia.
"What I can say is that a number of the staunchest opponents to military action ended up being the ones to partake in the coup attempt and were identified via the Bylock intercepts" the official added, referring to the encrypted messaging application used by putschist soldiers on July 15.
Image caption China is the North's closest ally
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is visiting South Korea amid continuing tension over the sinking - allegedly by North Korea - of a South Korean warship in March.
The issue is expected to dominate Mr Wen's talks on Friday with the South Korean President, Lee Myung-bak.
International investigators have blamed North Korea for sinking the warship.
But China has so far refused to join in the widespread condemnation of its old ally, Pyongyang.
The Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted the Chinese ambassador to South Korea, Zhang Xinsen, as saying the visit would "strongly boost" ties between the two countries.
The BBC's correspondent in Seoul, John Sudworth, says however, that China is in an uncomfortable position.
Frustration
They say China's refusal, so far, to join the strong, international condemnation of North Korea is causing frustration in Seoul.
ANALYSIS China has too much at stake to rush into any position on the sinking of the South Korean warship. There is a chance that any instability in the region could lead to tens of thousands of North Korean refugees streaming across the long border that separates China and the North. North Korea also acts as a buffer between China and the US-backed South. It serves Beijing's strategic interests to prop up Pyongyang's current government. China has also got its hands full managing its own developing society - the last thing it wants is trouble on its doorstep. So China's leaders might be privately furious at North - if indeed it did sink the Cheonan - but it will think long and hard before criticising its leaders.
There are calls for China to come off the fence and choose between its old, cold war alliance with Pyongyang and its new role as a modern, global power.
Some news reports suggest that Mr Wen will, albeit subtly and carefully, move closer to the South Korean position on this visit, choosing a form of words that at least placates some of the anger.
But, our correspondent adds, China's priority is stability on its borders and it will be reluctant to sign up to anything it thinks will provoke its North Korean neighbour.
Meanwhile, Japan has said it is tightening its already stringent sanctions against North Korea.
It said it was lowering the amount of cash which individuals can send to North Korea without declaring it from 10m yen (£110,000: £75,000) to 3m yen.
The parliament in Tokyo also passed a bill to enable the Japanese coastguard to inspect vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying North Korean weapons or nuclear technology, in line with a 2009 UN Security Council resolution.
The Associated Press news agency quoted the head of the Public Security Intelligence Agency as saying they had ordered officials to keep a closer eye on some one million North Koreans living in Japan.

Since being accused of the torpedo strike on the South Korean ship, North Korea has said it will scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea.
It also warned of an immediate attack if the South's navy violated the disputed Yellow Sea borderline.
On Tuesday, North Korea announced it would sever all ties with the South.
The Yellow Sea was the site of deadly naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002.
The two states are technically still at war after the Korean conflict ended without a peace treaty in 1953.
In what has been an almost complete reversal of Trump's immigration executive order, following Friday night's ruling by a Washington Judge to halt Trump's travel ban, on Saturday morning the Department of Homeland Security announced that "in accordance with the judge's ruling, DHS has suspended any and all actions implementing the affected sections of the Executive Order entitled, "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States."
"This includes actions to suspend passenger system rules that flag travelers for operational action subject to the Executive Order. DHS personnel will resume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy procedure."
However, keeping the defiant tone, the DHS also said that "at the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the President's Executive Order, which is lawful and appropriate. The Order is intended to protect the homeland and the American people, and the President has no higher dury and responsibility than to do so."
That may be true, although at this point an "epic court battle", including a Supreme Court showdown now appears inevitable.
As a reminder, on at least two occasions today, Trump launched a full-court attack against Washington Federal Judge Robart who ruled for a nationwide halt to Trump's immigration ban. As reported previously, following the latest dramatic twist in the ordeal surrounding Trump's Immigration Executive Order, when on Friday night Seattle Federal Judge Robart (appointed by George W. Bush in 2003) blocked Trump's travel ban from seven Muslim countries, the White House promptly responded by stating that it intends to file an emergency stay of this "outrageous order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate."
Earlier, on Friday night, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson disagreed when they greeted Robart's ruling saying “It is not the loudest voice that prevails on the Constitution,” and added "we are a nation of laws, not even the president can violate the Constitution. It's our president's duty to honor this ruling and I'll make sure they do."
And so, with Trump's Executive Order now a constitutional matter and almost certainly headed to the Supreme Court, where the judicial opinion of Trump's recent appointment Neil Gorsuch will soon be tested, on Saturday morning Trump wasted no time to attack "the opinion of so-called Judge" Robart, which Trump said "essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country" and warned the ruling "is ridiculous and will be overturned!"
They prefaced this warning for a showdown by saying that "when a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!" and defending their decision by invoking other Middle-eastern nations who allegedly "agree with the ban" (using a word which Sean Spicer would have preferred they did not as they will be brutalized by the press corps for it on Monday).
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Then, on Saturday afternoon, Trump doubled down against the judicial decision:
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Adding "Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision"
Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
As expected, Trump themselves was immediately attacked on social media for their "so-called" hint they disagree with the separation of powers as per article III, section 1 of the Constitution which, as a reminder, reads: "Judicial power of the US shall be vested in the Courts." Others have asked, rhetorically, what would happen if the situation was reversed:

If Trump can call Robart a "so-called" judge, can we call them -- with infinitely better justification -- a "so-called" president? — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) February 4, 2017
Meanwhile, as we prepare for the dramatic showdown and the fate of Trump's executive order is soon set to play out inside the Supreme Court of the United States, Reuters added that the State Department issued a statement in which it said that the DOJ informed it of the Washington state court ruling barring the U.S. government from enforcing certain provisions of Executive Order 13769, and thus "we have reversed the provisional revocation of visas under Executive Order 13769. Those individuals with visas that were not physically cancelled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid."
In other words, any travelers from the seven countries who have active visas, can once again enter the US. The department adds that it is "working closely with the Department of Homeland Security and our legal teams" and will provide "further updates as soon as information is available."
This means that entry for citizens from the seven formerly banned nations are once again permitted, and thus they can resume boarding U.S.-bound flights, major airlines said on Saturday, after a Seattle judge blocked the executive order. As Reuters adds, the ruling gave hope to some Middle East travelers but left them unclear how long the new travel window might last. Trump denounced the judge on Twitter and said the decision would be quashed.
In the wake of Friday's ruling, Qatar Airways was the first to say it would allow passengers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to resume flying to U.S. cities if they had valid documents. Fellow Gulf carriers Etihad and Emirates said they would do the same, as did Air France, Spain's Iberia and Germany's Lufthansa. Officials in Lebanon and Jordan said they had received no new instructions on the issue.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection told airlines they could board travelers affected within hours of Friday's ruling, but budget airline Norwegian, which operates transatlantic flights including from London and Oslo, said many uncertainties remained about the legal position. "It's still very unclear," spokesperson Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson said. "We advise passengers to contact the U.S. embassy ... We have to follow the U.S. rules."
In Cairo, aviation sources said Egypt Air and other airlines had told their sales offices of Friday's ruling and would allow people previously affected by the ban to book flights.
As a result, following the Friday ruling, travelers from affected countries are delighted, and rushing to get to the US: "Ibrahim Ghaith, a Syrian barber who fled Damascus in 2013, told Reuters in Jordan: “Today we heard that the measures may have been abolished but we are not sure if this is just talk. If they go back on the decision, people will be overjoyed." Iraqi refugee Nizar al-Qassab told Reuters in Lebanon: "If it really has been frozen, I thank God, because my wife and children should have been in America by now." The 52-year-old said their family had been due to travel to the United States for resettlement on Jan. 31. The trip was cancelled two days before that, and they were now waiting for a phone call from U.N. officials overseeing their case. "It's in God's hands," they said."
Two Sudanese travellers told Reuters they were trying to travel as soon as possible, fearing the ban might be reinstated.
“I'm in a race against time," said a 31-year-old female academic who declined to be named for fear of any consequences. "Today I face a real problem in Khartoum because the international airlines are refusing to sell me a ticket to travel for fear of contradicting the President's decision. Now I am going from one airline company to another to convince them about the court's decision,” they said. A 34-year-old Sudanese engineer, who also did not want to be named, said: "After the court's decision I am now trying to leave as fast as possible before the situation changes once more."
The State Department said on Friday that almost 60,000 visas were suspended following Trump's order. It was not clear whether that suspension was automatically revoked or what reception travelers with such visas might get at U.S. airports, although according to today's State Department clarification it appears that virtually all travelers who previously had an active visa will once again be allowed into the US.
Senate Dems on '14 ballot not wowed by Obama gun plans
Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, is up for re-election in 2014. (Photo: Alex Wong Getty Images)
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Sens. Landrieu and Baucus opposed extending the assault weapons ban in 2004.
President Obama admits they face an uphill battle in getting their gun proposals through a wary Congress. The politics of the 2014 election partly explains why.
While much has been made about the GOP-controlled House being recalcitrant, the Democratic-controlled Senate isn't exactly a cakewalk. For starters, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada -- who would normally do the heavy lifting to get Obama's legislation through the chamber -- voted against the 1994 assault weapons ban.
STORY: Obama plan faces hurdles
STORY: Obama challenges Congress
Twenty Democratic Senate seats are up for grabs in 2014, many of them in states with high gun ownership. Some of those Democrats weren't effusive about Obama's proposals that were outlined Wednesday:
Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu said in a statement that they will be "reviewing the proposals put forth by the administration and will give them serious consideration as they are brought for debate in the Senate." They voted against extending the assault weapons ban in 2004.
Sen. Max Baucus of Montana wasn't an automatic "yes" vote, either. "Before passing new laws, we need a thoughtful debate that respects responsible, law-abiding gun owners in Montana instead of one-size-fits-all directives from Washington," Baucus is quoted as saying in Roll Call. They also voted against extending the weapons ban in 2004.
Minnesota Sen. Al Franken says he'll support tightening background checks and putting limits on ammunition magazines. As for the assault weapons ban, Franken on Thursday issued a statement after they said the Rochester Post-Bulletin "mischaracterized" their position in a newspaper story.
"I also support the principle that we should reinstate an assault weapons ban, and I will carefully review any proposal to do that," Franken said. "We need to make sure we don't really have weapons out there that are really designed for the battlefield, and not for hunting."
Add to these statements the fact that Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, another Democrat up for re-election in 2014, already said they would not support reauthorizing the assault weapons ban and the precarious position for Obama in the Senate becomes clear.

The four were in a hurry, had little time to bargain for the cricket bat's price. Most excited among them, Nur Alam pulled out their moneybag hurriedly, paid Tk 300 and almost snatched the bat from the salesperson.
Stepping out of the shop, they impatiently focused their eyes on Teknaf Police Station building lest uncle Mizan left in the three-wheeler without them to catch the Malaysia-bound ship.
Before buying the cricket bat and ball, Nur Alam, Lokman, Amir and Khalil, also bought a football because Mizan uncle had said there is a big field in the ship for playing all kinds of games.
For the four friends, all aged around 18, it is beyond what could they possibly dream of.
Firstly, uncle Mizan had brought them all the way from Shariatpur to Teknaf in Cox's Bazar to show them the beauty of the sea. And now they managed everything so that the four friends can go to Malaysia in their friend's ship without any expense at all!
"Hurry up, get in the CNG," said Mizan, who according to what their neighbour in Shariatpur Nur Alam knows, is a business person based in Teknaf. "Something has suddenly come up and I'll join you later," they told them.
Alam doesn't even bid them bye because they believed the man "who has convinced owner of the Malaysia-bound ship to arrange separate seats and computers for each of the four" would definitely be part of this "beautiful journey".
"On your behalf, I will pay them a minor amount in fare for this journey, after which you will get lucrative jobs in Malaysia," they had told them.
Leaving the regular road, the three-wheeler entered a jungle leading to a small hut.
As they get down, 2/3 people throw them into the hut, took away all their belongings including mobile phones, moneybag and even their trousers. They gave them lungi to wear.
As Alam attempted to resist them, they swooped on him, pinned them to the ground and took away everything.
"Nine people were already waiting there, all looking like panicked to the core," Alam said while recalling the December 2013 incident that brought them to the Ranong Immigration Detention Centre in Thailand's southern Ranong province.
The Ranong governor gave The Daily Star special access to the centre on May 26 so that people can realise how risky and fatal can be the arduous journey Nur Alam took in a fit of fantasy.
"When there were 14 of us, they forced us onto a small boat later."
After a three-hour journey, they were taken on what the traffickers term "ship", which is a modified fishing trawler.
"During midnight, the ship started moving," said Shahabuddin, a 23-year-old fish trader from Khuruskul area of Cox's Bazar who had already been brought to the trawler when Alam was taken there.
One broker named Aminul, a Myanmar citizen who moved to Cox's Bazar several years ago, had convinced Shahabuddin to go to Malaysia with a promise of job for just Tk 1.8 lakh though they used to charge Tk 2 lakh from others.
"He gave me this concession because my sister was married to a man who lives near their house in Gunapara village," Shahabuddin said.
They were picked up on a small boat at a 'Malaysia Airport' -- so named because of the destination -- at Badar Mokam area in Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila.
PREPARATION
"As the journey was long, I bought dry food including bread, chira, apple, juice and water worth Tk 1,500," said Shahabuddin, who also bought a blanket.
Asked where they got the food in the remote area, both Alam and Shahabuddin said shops have been set up near every 'Malaysia Airport' and are making brisk money selling such foods to the Malaysia-bound people.
UNCERTAIN JOURNEY
When Shahabuddin was led to the ship, a Rohingya broker named Ayub forced them to enter the bottom of the three-storied trawler. "To accommodate a few hundred people in the small ship, wood planks are used to make floors," they said.
A total of 474 people, including 30 women and seven children, were forced into the trawler before it started for Thai coast. It became so crowded that the victims could just manage to huddle together lowering their heads, so that it did not bump into the wooden floor.
Seven Arakanese citizens carrying whips made of rope and thick cable would stand guard and beat people on any trivial pretext. "To spread panic so that everyone complies with their order, they would beat people more during the first few days," said Nur Alam.
"With our dreams of a lucrative job in Malaysia already shattered, what we were doing round the clock was prayed -- none could rest nor sleep."
Many of the victims had nervous breakdown and fell sick. "There was no doctor. If you fell sick, you must die untreated," Shahabuddin said.
DEATH FOR WATER, FOOD
For those like Nur Alam whose money was seized before the start of the journey, the traffickers used to provide some rice with dry red chili twice -- once at 10:00am and later at 3:00pm -- and around 25ml water thrice.
For Noor Alam, a 25-year-old fisherman from Teknaf, who was duped to Katabuniya area in the upazila and was later taken on a boat forcibly, the food and water was far less than one could survive on.
"That's why I asked for some food when my stock ended after a week," they said while talking about their voyage in November 2013 in another trawler that was carrying 450 people to Thai coast.
A guard beat them up with a whip made of thick electric cable so hard that they started to bleed from their head and left knee, they said showing injury marks. They were left in that Condition.
Failing to bear with the thirst, four men took their own lives jumping into the sea.
"The guards beat up another six so badly that they started to vomit and fell sick. Seeing that they were lying there occupying a lot of space, the guards threw them into the sea," they shivered while recalling the event.
But Noor-e-Alam, father of a son, aged two, and a daughter, aged one, said it was the most unbearable sight when the guards used to beat up the kids in front of their parents for seeking water.
Shahabuddin and Alam were also witness to similar brutality.
A 40-year-old man from Jessore who was duped to Cox's Bazar in the name of traveling and later taken on a boat forcibly, was sent to the bottom cellar on the seventh day of their journey.
"The man complained that they had heart diseases and was feeling bad. They vomited twice and lay on the floor." Seeing them of no value, the guards pulled them up and flung in the waters.
ANCHORING IN THE DARKNESS
Nine days after starting, the trawler carrying Shahabuddin and Alam reached sea on Myanmar-Thai border. The brokers handed over the victims to three smaller boats. The boats took them near the coast and forced them to get down in chest-high water.
"Later, we had to wade through water and mud for two hours before we reached a hill around 3:00pm."
The victims, exhausted to the bone, were very happy when they were served a full meal -- a boiled egg, some rice and salt -- at 8:00am at the rubber garden camp in the hill slope. In the afternoon the next day, the victims were taken on mini trucks, each carrying eight, which were covered with thick sheets so that none can understand what's inside.
The trucks travelled for eight hours to take them to a camp in Padang Besar, a border town on the Malaysia-Thailand border in the Sadao district in Thailand's Songkhla Province.
There, 107 victims were kept in three rooms in a brown-coloured one-storey building.
The trafficked people are mostly taken to the hilly or jungle areas along the Thai coast in Songkhla, Sotun, Ranong and Phuket provinces.
RANSOM, SLAVERY
In the morning, a man speaking Arakanese gave Shahabuddin a mobile phone and asked them to call home. "He told me to pay the Tk 1.8 lakh saying otherwise my future will be uncertain." Their family sold two of their cows for Tk 30,000 and collected Tk 50,000 from some relatives to pay the ransom three days later.
As per the directives of the Arakanese broker, Shahabuddin's family contacted a broker named Faruk in Teknaf on a mobile phone number provided by the brokers in Thailand and paid them the money.
Alam had to pay Tk 2 lakh though. "The Arakanese broker said they would take us to Malaysia the day we pay the ransom."
Those who have paid the ransom were given a red ribbon to tie in their hands as a mark of payment, and there were 84 lucky ones to get it.
Arrest: bad luck or blessing?
Two mini trucks came and took away 26, 13 in each vehicle, as those who couldn't pay waited for unknown future.
"As we were waiting to get in the third vehicle, police raided the building and took us to Hat Yai immigration office in Songkhla."
Meanwhile, two brokers, who were also arrested with them, advised the Bangladeshis to introduce themselves before police as Myanmar citizens saying "it would help us get release in just two days". Alam and Shahabuddin complied, but no avail.
As the Hat Yai office became overcrowded with 600 arrestees, authorities shifted 200 of them, including Alam, Shahabuddin and Noor-e-Alam, to Ranong Immigration Detention Centre on January 24 last year.
"In just two months, the two brokers got release from here. But we're still languishing here," said Noor-e-Alam.
The three, who are the only Bangladeshi citizens among 240 at the centre now, said they're lucky that they had failed to board the truck bound for Malaysia.
Now waiting for repatriation, Shahabuddin said: "We could by now have turned into another group's slaves and be working in any rubber garden."
If you're a cat owner, chances are you've been woken up in the middle of the night, courtesy of your adorable little feline jerk.
Will Herring has created a computer game, aptly titled "My Garbage Cat Wakes Me Up At 3 A.M. Every Day." And, as the name would imply, the game involves a cat rudely messing with their owner's sleep schedule. You know. The usual.
See also: 14 cats straight up smacking down haters
In the game, the player is the cat in question, and has the task of trying to wake their owner by meowing, kneading things with their paws and knocking objects over.
As the player gets progressively noisier, and knocks over more and more items, the owner's sleep meter gets progressively more depleted. When the meter finally runs out, the owner awakens and is forced to exasperatedly ask the cat why it insists on being such a jerk.
So, if you don't own a cat, you can FINALLY experience what happens when humans go to sleep and their felines go into full-on garbage mode.
You can play Herring's game and see the madness for yourself here.
MARIANA doesn't really care who wins today's referendum. The young pharmacist, working in a relatively poor part of Athens, has more pressing problems: they have been running out of medication fast this week. Greece relies almost entirely on foreign imports for its pharmaceutical supplies. But since capital control imposed last Sunday brought the country's banking system to a sudden halt, some suppliers have stopped delivering key medication because they cannot get paid. Foreign bank transfers have been banned by the Greek government (with some complicated exceptions which in no way suffice) and Greek credit is no longer accepted outside the country (as stranded Greek tourists found this week when their credit cards stopped working). As things stand, they have another week's worth of insulin in stock for diabetics but will then have to start turning their patients away. “Do you know what that means?” they ask, trying to keep a proud face, “Do you know what insulin does?”
Hospital employees report similar problems. They have already had their last cash reserves taken from them, by the current government in April, to pay their foreign creditors. But now, with the banks closed, hospitals are in even more trouble. “It was already bad, but it has become much worse this past week and the time ahead really frightens me,” says one Athenian doctor. They explain that their hospital's inability to import specialised supplies, such as stents used in emergency heart surgery and life-saving medicines, such as cancer drugs, means patients' lives will soon be at stake.

And although all local intermediary dealers have some financing problems with their “mothership” suppliers abroad, some multinationals are apparently much harsher than others in insisting on upfront payment. More than one medical professional mentions certain providers of oncological drug treatments as particularly cold-hearted. For hospitals that rely on such supplies, shortages are expected within weeks, not months.
Food shortages are a looming threat too, and not simply on supermarket shelves. The Greek Association of Fodder Industries has warned there could be animal feed shortages within days because farmers (like many Greek businesses) rely on imports from abroad. If animals don't get fed, this would have a knock-on on the production of basic agricultural products such as eggs, cheese, meat and fish within weeks. And it's not just raw materials that are at risk. Greece also imports over half of its food but the current banking limits means that such supply chains are cut off.
A butcher says they are one of the few shops in their street that is doing well because their compatriots are prioritising food over other products, such as clothes. “They are in trauma” they say as they wrap up an enormous amount of beef for a middle-aged lady, who says that they will put it all in their freezer. But things may not stay this sunny for long for the butcher; much of the meat in their shop comes from Italy and they are starting to insist on up-front cash payments.
Food shops and petrol stations are more or less the only businesses that have had a good week. Greeks, fearing for the future, are filling up extra jerry can of petrol and are stocking up on dried food, tinned milk and other non-perishable products. An elderly gentleman clutching a fresh €50 bill in their local Carrefour supermarket, that your correspondent met, carefully selected 24 tins of condensed milk, a big bag of Nesquik milkshake powder, three large bags of dried chickpeas and a bunch of dried spaghetti. A girl stacking shelves in the shop confirms that there has certainly been more hoarding by the elderly but not by the young: “they are getting ready because they know our history,” they say. In the past, food shortages often occurred in the aftermath of elections.
But most firms are suffering because customers have simply stopped shopping for non-essentials. “Nobody came this week,” says a tired-looking woman in a budget clothing shop, whilst they and their colleagues puff cigarettes and drink coffee. They have cancelled most of their future orders for now. Taxis are suffering too, partly because public transport is free in Athens throughout the bank holiday week: “It was shit before, but when banks closed… boom” says Alexis, a cab driver, as they mock shoots themselves through the head. Panagiotis, a 20-year-old who works in Athiri, a Greek restaurant near the centre of Athens, says until last week they would have around 60 diners per night. This week they had only 12—all of which were tourists.
But tourism, a key pillar of the Greek economy, is also beginning to suffer. Although there have been some cancellations, the bigger issue, says a central Athens hotel receptionist, is that very few new bookings are being made. According to the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE), an industry outfit, reservations had been up 3% over the same time last year up to June 26th. But then on June 28th—the day the banks closed—they dropped 17% compared to the year before, 29% the next day, and 30% by June 30th.
Vasilis Korkidis, head of the National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce, has said that the economy has already suffered losses worth €1.2 billion this week. And some reports claim that consumption levels have fallen by 70% since the bank closed. In addition to the collapse in demand, small- and medium-sized companies are struggling to stay afloat, as their supply chains are badly interrupted. For many, business has ground to a near halt.
Meanwhile Greek banks do not have enough cash reserves to last out this coming week. Some have claimed they will run out as early as Monday. “Without Europe's support our economy will suffocate to death,” says a Greek banker who thinks some form of limited Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), a funding system for banks, whilst keeping existing capital controls and payment restrictions in place, is the only viable solution to fund deposits of importers of basic goods. Without that, “the country will collapse within weeks and we will have a humanitarian crisis within our very own Europe,” they warn.
Even a "yes" vote today will not fully relieve the situation. It will still take time for a comprehensive agreement to be reached between the Greek government (or whoever is in charge at that stage) and its creditors. Marina, the pharmacist, does not have time. They show me a small box with 30 thyroid hormone-replacement pills. Demand for This is much higher than the supply of two boxes a day. Worried about running out, they have limited customers to only one box per person, which should last them a month, even though many are asking for more. A pharmacist on the other side of town confirms they've also started informal rationing of certain medication that might run low. Already, a black market has started to emerge for cancer drugs and other foreign medical supplies. But most people just buy out of fear that they won't be able to do so tomorrow—whatever it may bring.
The villages around the Indian town of Dharmapuri are in the midst of an unusual problem. Unsubstantiated reports of vampires draining cattle have frightened entire communities such that residents are staying off the streets after sunset.
To quell the spread of this unmitigated bullpucky, local politicians have placed a price on these nonexistent vampires' heads. Evidence of a re-dead vampire (or a Ratha Kaatteri) nets an amateur Van Helsing 1 lakh of rupees, or a smidge under $2000.

But what if these fictional slain vampires turn into dust? Couldn't this reward also backfire terribly and lead to bands of unruly anti-vampire vigilantes looking to bag a real-life Khooni Dracula? Politician O. Jayaraman was notably silent on both issues in a conversation with the Deccan Chronicle:
It is a big hoax. Anti-socials whose illegal night activities such as bootlegging and liquor brewing have been disturbed are spreading rumours and killing cattle [...] Since people are not willing to believe us, we have challenged them with this reward.

I'm not sure this is a promising policy innovation. If the state of Washington implemented a equally entrepreneurial approach to Bigfoot, the newly minted Office of Sasquatch Affairs would immediately be inundated with a century's worth of shaky footage of pine trees and magic trumpets.

A hobbyist is a volunteer firefighter who desperately wants you to know they or they are a firefighter. Typical warning signs of a hobbyist can be found by means of apparel, vehicle setup, and/or the offender blatantly reminding everyone they are, in fact, a firefighter.
If you are an offender of any of these five habits, you might be a hobbyist:
Tricked out POV. (Photo/YouTube)
1. Constantly wear your radio and/or strap everywhere you go
Yes, we know you are a firefighter but are you really going to respond from FDIC to your department three hours away? Not likely, so just leave your radio at home, on the charger next to your “I walk where the devil dances” T-shirt.
2. Wear a badge on your belt or radio strap
That's a nice badge you have on your belt. Are you a cop? If someone sees you get out of a fire truck, they will assume you are a real live firefighter. No need to flaunt it. Please only wear your badge on your uniform.
3. Wear your Class B shirt with jeans
Stop doing it. When you wear your Class B shirt, please throw on a pair of dress pants (not khakis, either). Even as a volunteer, it's important to look professional. You're the face of your department.
4. Ask for a firefighter discount
Please tell me you didn't become a firefighter to get discounts — the discounts are a perk, not a benefit, so use them sparingly. Yes, it's great the local Subway gives 10 percent off your meal, but please reach into your pocket, grab your cash, and pay full price.
5. Have more lights in your privately owned vehicle than the chief's rig
You know the type — the ones who have spent more money on lights than their personal vehicle is worth. Are six lights in your rear window necessary? Not really. If you have more supplies than the engine has, you are a full-time hobbyist.
If this list describes you, just quit wearing your radio strap everywhere you go. It's all in good fun. What are some other hobbyist signs? Comment them below.

"There is always a way, Wooley." ―Wooley and Commander Cody Listen (file info) [src]
"Wooley" was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars with the 212th Attack Battalion. They served during the Battle of Ryloth, specifically to help liberate the town of Nabat.[2]
Contents show]
Biography Edit
Wooley[2] was the nickname of a clone trooper made from the bounty hunter Jango Fett on the planet Kamino[1] who came to serve the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Wooley was part of the Grand Army of the Republic's Ghost Company of the 212th Attack Battalion, serving under Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Marshal Commander CC-2224 "Cody" early during the war.[2] After the Outer Rim garrison on Ryloth led by Jedi General Ima-Gun Di and Clone Captain "Keeli" was obliterated by the Separatist Droid Army,[3] Wooley and Ghost Company were dispatched to retake the planet along with forces from the Republic Navy serving under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen, and the forces of the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps under Jedi General Mace Windu.[2]
After Skywalker's forces destroyed the Separatist Ryloth blockade, a group of three Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ships carrying the 212th Attack Battalion and the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps came out of hyperspace and made for the planet's surface. Members of Ghost Company boarded five LAAT/i gunships and departed from a transport and landed in the outskirts of the city of Nabat after Separatist J-1 proton cannons engaged the Republic transports, critically damaging an assault ship and destroying three gunships.[2]
After Ghost Company managed break through the outer perimeter and establish an outpost, Wooley was accompanying Commander Cody when Jedi General Kenobi ordered them to round up their best men and send them to scout ahead. Commander Cody ordered troopers "Boil" and "Waxer" to go with him, and Wooley followed. After the four patrolled Nabat, Cody split up their men, ordering Boil and Waxer to patrol the south sector, while they and Wooley scouted the courtyard. Eventually, Commander Cody and Wooley discovered that the Twi'lek population of Nabat was being held hostage near the proton cannons as living shields. Staying out of sight, Wooley stated that getting to the guns would not be easy, though Cody remarked that there was always a way.[2]
Eventually, Wooley and Cody returned to the rest of the company and informed Kenobi of their discovery. Boil and Waxer, however, did not return at the designated time, and the company was forced to continue without them. The company soon came under attack by gutkurrs released by Separatist Commander TX-20, though Kenobi managed to trap the gutkurrs in an alley. After the attack, Boil and Waxer emerged from an underground tunnel with Numa, a Twi'lek child, who they encountered during their patrol. With their help, Kenobi devised a plan to defeat Separatist forces in the village and rescue the civilian population.[2]
Ghost Company, including Commander Cody and Wooley created a distraction while Waxer, Boil, and Kenobi freed the prisoners and destroyed the proton cannons, and eventually Republic forces and Twi'lek civilians managed to defeat Separatist forces and destroy TX-20, allowing Jedi General Mace Windu and the other assault ships to land nearby and deploy Republic forces,[2] eventually liberating Ryloth.[4]
Personality and traits Edit
Wooley[2] was a human male clone of Jango Fett, and as such, was 1.83 meters tall, had naturally black hair, tan skin, and brown eyes.[1]
Skills and abilities Edit
"We need to know what the droids have in store for us. Send your best men to scout ahead." ―Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Commander Cody [src]
Wooley was considered to be one of the best soldiers in Ghost Company along with Boil and Waxer. After discovering the Twi'lek hostages, Wooley was doubtful of succeeding in destroying the proton cannons.[2]
Equipment Edit
During missions, Wooley utilized white phase I clone trooper armor and used a DC-15 blaster rifle during combat.[2]
Behind the scenes Edit
Wooley first appeared in the twentieth episode of the first season of the animated TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, "Innocents of Ryloth," which was released on March 6, 2009.[2]

The A.V. Club loves the holiday season, and we also love opening small doors and eating the stale chocolate lurking behind them. We've found a way to combine those things with our love of pop culture, and we're hoping you'll join us through the holiday to open one of our virtual doors and find out which holiday-themed entertainment we're covering that day. This week's theme: holiday classics, old and new.
When talking about the heyday of Nickelodeon, it's typical to focus on the channel's live-action programs. The early '90s were a time when Clarissa explained it all, Pete & Pete fans wanted Petunia tattoos, and everyone was afraid of the dark. But it was actually the Nicktoons that ruled the world or, at the very least, so many living rooms. In some circles, it's impossible to mention Nickelodeon without falling into a nostalgia trap ( essentially the basis of the book Slimed! ), but nostalgia isn't necessarily a bad thing. There is a reason why these shows resonated with so many '90s kids and why so many of us have a hard time letting go. Nostalgia makes us feel homesick, but it also reminds us of why we miss that home—and nostalgia tends to work overtime during the holidays.

Nickelodeon approached the holiday season with the same mix of eccentricity and earnestness that made Nicktoons so popular. Shows like Hey Arnold! and Doug leaned toward the sentimental; Ren & Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Lifewere weirder and more surreal; Rugrats was sincere, but educational. All of them, however, had humor and sweetness buried underneath everything else.
This doesn't mean that they were all perfect. There were missteps in the beginning, particularly with episodes that were overly sentimental or too emotionally manipulative. That's forgivable, because this was at a time when Nickelodeon was still finding its footing (Nicktoons didn't begin until the summer of 1991, with the first Christmas episode airing in the winter of 1992), and its shows were still trying to find a good balance. In 1993 and 1994 Doug and Rocko's Modern Life aired their first Christmas episodes respectively, each with a similar sad-then-ultimately-celebratory theme, but with varying results.
Doug's episode, in particular, was rough. The series started off promisingly, telling the story of an insecure 11-year-old with an overactive imagination, but their character and the various changes made throughout the series' run (117 episodes spread out over two networks) didn't age as well as one might hope. By the fourth season, the last before Doug got a makeover and jumped ship to Disney, the series was showing natural signs of wear that seeped into its Christmas episode. “Doug's Christmas Story” suffered from a weird, dark storyline: Doug has to save their beloved dog Porkchop from being sentenced to a life in the dog pound (it's implied Porkchop will be put to sleep; merry Christmas!). It's a Christmas episode only in the sense that it takes place on Christmas Eve. Mostly, it's a series of sad events: Porkchop being punished for saving a girl's life, Porkchop being taken away in a Hannibal Lecter-esque get-up, and even Doug's sister Judy turning on their own dog.

Rocko's Modern Life tackled a slightly more universal feeling and created an episode that's more relatable, especially impressive considering its protagonist is a wallaby. “Rocko's Modern Christmas” focused on Rocko's search for Christmas cheer. Christmas is a tough holiday, because more often than not, it's spent trying to create some pitch-perfect yuletide feeling and ultimately falling short. Rocko just wants to see some snow (but the elf in charge of snow went missing in a blizzard), and they want all of their buddies to hang out and celebrate the holidays together. No one else is into it. Even the elves they meet are cynical. Their neighbors are worse and spread nasty rumors about the elves, leaving Rocko alone in their house during a party. The end is sugary enough to make your teeth hurt: An elf helps Rocko, because Rocko's the only person who still believes in Christmas, everyone apologizes, it snows, and they all party together. It's similar to the ending of Doug—Porkchop's free, everyone apologizes, dogs get adopted, and they all party together—but it somehow feels more real with Rocko, even if the circumstances leading up to the ending were unquestionably weirder. It helps that Rocko doesn't take itself too seriously. At the end, when the elf sweetly provides Mr. Bighead with an invitation to Rocko's party, causing Mr. Bighead to tear up with joy, the elf undercuts the moment by smashing them in the foot with a hammer. It's a good cartoon rule: You can be as sickeningly sweet as you want, but try to end with a laugh.
Doug wasn't great, and Rocko's Modern Life was shaky, but it didn't take long for Nickelodeon to start rolling out some truly fantastic holiday programming. The network seemed to realize that it could celebrate its shows' penchants for weirdness—this is a network that was built on slime—while also celebrating the beauty of the holiday season. Take Ren & Stimpy, arguably the most peculiar of all the Nicktoons and a cartoon that's so fucking weird most viewers would agree that it would have been a better fit for one of Nick's sibling networks, like MTV. Regardless, Ren & Stimpy happily grossed out and appalled parents during its five seasons on Nickelodeon, a run that included two Christmas specials.

The first of the two, 1993's “Son Of Stimpy” was about as strange as it got. Similar to “Doug's Christmas Story,” this episode was only tangentially related to Christmas in that it takes place during the holiday season. Outside of that, the episode was, to put it simply, a 22-minute-long fart joke. That's the whole story. Stimpy farts for the first time and then spends the rest of the episode trying to find their “friend,” while leaving Ren behind. It is so odd, so gross, so un-Christmas, and so perfectly Nickelodeon. It's full of juvenile humor and ultimately ends with a fart getting married to a rotten fish carcass. (The holidays are for bringing people together, after all!) But if you want an accurate summation of the eccentric blend of humor and heartstrings that Nickelodeon was trying to achieve in the early '90s, look no further than the scene mixing fart sounds with a lovely orchestral version of “Silent Night.” I'm not saying it would induce more than chuckle if watching it today, but for a child the result is uproarious laughter.
The second episode, “A Scooter For Yaksmas” is also the last episode of the show's Nickelodeon run. It's hard to say which one is better. “Yaksmas” is a more straightforward holiday episode and more in tune with the spirit of the season, but—and I can't believe I'm about to type this—it lacks the emotional resonance of the fart episode. “Son Of Stimpy” remarked on friendship and loss; “Yaksmas” is about Stimpy wanting a scooter.

Still, “Yaksmas” is more fun. It's the grosser version of Christmas, where Stinky Wizzleteats takes the place of Santa and old tires take the place of Christmas wreaths. The animation is hard to watch—as many times as I've seen Ren & Stimpy, I'll always feel uncomfortable about close-ups of veins in eyeballs—and the musical number goes on a bit too long, but it's still funny and creative. I've always loved the idea of creating one's own holiday, and I'm sure it resonates with those who don't celebrate Christmas, but instead start their own traditions. The writers created something totally weird that feels totally normal within this world. There is even an album, one that was actually released prior to this episode, called Ren & Stimpy's Crock O' Christmas that's full of disgusting Christmas carols; it definitely annoyed the hell out of my parents when I was 10.
The year after, Nickelodeon went back to its sentimental roots with Hey Arnold!, a show that has always been fearless about taking the dramatic approach to holidays. This meant that “Arnold's Christmas” ran the risk of falling into the same trap as “Doug's Christmas Story,” but Hey Arnold!'s writers always found a way to effortlessly break viewers' hearts without an abundance of pain. In this first season episode, Arnold is tasked with getting a secret Santa gift for a fellow boarder, Mr. Hyunh. Because Arnold is Arnold—an eternal optimist who wants nothing more than to greatly improve the lives of everyone around him—he won't settle for a typical gift, but instead decides to try to reunite Mr. Hyunh with their long-lost daughter. It's heavy content for a children's show—Mr. Hyunh lost track of their daughter during the end of the Vietnam War, as shown in a particularly gut-wrenching scene—but the episode has a light air that prevents it from collapsing under its own weight. “Arnold's Christmas” does have a lot of typical Nickelodeon elements: a happy ending, the mean girl showing they have a heart of gold (Helga bears a lot of similarities to Rugrats' Angelica), and a celebration at the end. But the episode managed to stick out in its own way by being the best example of Nickelodeon's ability to blend humor and pathos.

Arguably the most memorable holiday episodes on Nickelodeon were from Rugrats. Rugrats was the simplest of the Nicktoons bunch, a cartoon where the Christmas episodes were just Christmas episodes. They weren't particularly heavy, and, for the most part, the Christmas specials were all straightforward. The babies looked forward to the holidays, they met Santa Claus, and they played in the snow. They went on adventures and unwrapped gifts, and maybe Angelica learned a lesson or two about being such a bully. The beauty of Rugrats wasn't in its Christmas episodes (“The Santa Experience” is too predictable and “Babies In Toyland” is fun but runs far too long), but was actually when it branched out to include other holidays like Kwanzaa and Chanukah.
Television was a fairly important part of my household—maybe it wasn't a parent, but it sure was a great babysitter—so it wouldn't be a huge exaggeration to say I probably learned more from television than I did from elementary school. Indeed, the first time I learned about Chanukah was because of Rugrats. The series had already produced a Passover episode, but for some reason “Chanukah” is the one that really stuck with me (and most of my peers). It was one of those episodes that suckered viewers into learning. On the surface, the babies are living a fantasy, acting out a story about “King Antonica” and the “Meany Of Chanukah,” but underneath, the episode actually tells the story of Chanukah, teaching both the Rugrats and the viewers. It's an episode that's entertaining in and of itself, and it was sly about slipping in some education in between the jokes about the children's misunderstandings—at first, they thought the menorah was to celebrate Tommy's birthday—and the subplot about Grandpa and their rival fighting over a role in the synagogue's yearly play.

Later in the series, Rugrats did the same with Kwanzaa. “A Rugrats Kwanzaa” centered on the Carmichaels, using Susie's insecurity about measuring up to their family as a means to explain Kwanzaa to the rest of the babies. A blackout results in Great Aunt T telling stories about how and why they celebrate Kwanzaa, while also slipping in facts about Rosa Parks and the civil rights movement. There is a lot to admire about the episode. It's the first time I can remember Kwanzaa being depicted in a show as something other than a punchline, and it explored Susie's feelings of exclusion without being too heavy. It managed to remain interesting throughout the whole episode, even with flashbacks and historical lessons. It also put Susie and their family at the foreground of an episode that meant tons of viewers, including myself, finally saw someone like themselves on television—something that was incredibly important for a network that has always struggled with diversity. What's most admirable about “A Rugrats Kwanzaa” is that the rest of the Rugrats immediately accept the Carmichaels' holiday and beliefs and are enthusiastic about joining the celebration. Sure, they're into the idea because it's a party, and what kid doesn't love a party? But it's also part of the beauty and innocence of being a child: immediately accepting other cultures without a second thought.
That wide-eyed enthusiasm was the backbone of Rugrats, a show based on Tommy's fearlessness and the friends' endless support of each other, but it's also the backbone of Nicktoons as a whole. The enthusiasm Nickelodeon had for its programming shone on every show, but especially so during the holidays.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, right, welcomes U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano for their meeting in Tehran, Iran, on Sunday. Vahid Salemi/AP
By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press
VIENNA (AP) — The chief of the U.N. nuclear agency acknowledged Monday that samples used to determine whether Iran tried to develop a nuclear weapon were collected by the Iranians instead of agency experts, but insisted the probe stands up to strict agency standards.
Such sampling of soil, air or dust from equipment is usually done by the International Atomic Energy Agency's own experts. But IAEA chief Yukiya Amano confirmed that Iranians carried out that part of the probe at Parchin, where the agency suspects that explosive triggers for nuclear weapons might have been tested in the past.
Diplomats say Iran insisted on the compromise as a condition for any probe of Parchin.
Deputy IAEA Director General Tero Varjoranta said that there have been over 40 instances of letting a country being inspected use their own nationals to do their own sampling and that the process is only a small part of a rigid regimen established by the agency to make sure there is no cheating.
They said the criteria at Parchin included: invasive monitoring by video and still cameras while the sampling took place; GPS tracking of the sampling process; IAEA agreement on where the samples were to be taken; review by unspecified peers of the inspection process; risk assessment and strict observance to make sure that procedures were followed step by step.
"We feel fully confident that the process and the result so far are fully in line with our safeguards practices," they said, standing next to Amano at a Vienna news conference.
Former IAEA deputy director general Olli Heinonen has described Iran as a particularly sensitive case however, saying they know of no other case where a country under investigation for possibly trying to make nuclear weapons was permitted to use its own personnel to collect environmental samples as part of the investigation.
The Iran arrangement was first revealed in a confidential draft agreement between the sides seen last month by The Associated Press. The draft said that Iranian experts, monitored by video and still cameras, would gather environmental samples at the site and hand them over to the agency for analysis.
Iran's atomic energy agency spokesperson, Behrouz Kalmandi, said IAEA experts were not physically present during the sampling. But Amano said the procedure meets strict agency criteria that ensure "the integrity of the sampling process and the authenticity of the samples."
Amano spoke a day after they were taken on what Iranian media described as a ceremonial tour of the military site. They told reporters in Vienna that they were able to enter a building that the agency had been observing via satellite and saw signs of "recent renovation work."
They appeared to be referring to the building where the agency suspects that weapons experiments were conducted in the past. The agency has frequently said that subsequent renovation work at and near the building could hamper the IAEA probe, a position Amano repeated on Monday.
Amano's one-day visit to Iran is part of an assessment due in December that will feed into the nuclear deal reached in July between Tehran and six world powers and will help to determine whether sanctions will be lifted.
Iran denies it has ever sought nuclear weapons, and insists Parchin is a conventional military site. Tehran has refused to allow inspections of its military sites as part of the nuclear deal, saying it fears foreign espionage.
Western nations have long suspected Iran's nuclear program has a secret military dimension. Iran insists the program is entirely devoted to peaceful purposes like power generation and cancer treatment.
Under the July agreement, Iran would curb its nuclear activities and submit to new inspections in return for billions of dollars in sanctions relief.
A special Iranian parliamentary committee is reviewing the deal to prepare a report for lawmakers. Late Sunday, a member of the committee, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said they expected parliament would approve the deal.
The Seattle Sounders' eight-year run atop the MLS attendance charts has come to an end. After leading the league in attendance, usually by a significant margin, every year of its existence, earning accolades for their almost Premier League-like atmosphere at CenturyLink Field, the Sounders were beaten out this year by expansion team Atlanta United, which beat the Sounders by 5,000 fans per game, 48,200 to 43,666, and ended the season by setting the all-time single-game record for a game not associated with some other match. It's a pair of tremendous feats only slightly undermined by the fact that the two teams play in the only two stadiums in MLS with capacities over 40,000 (and in fact the Sounders can only climb above that mark by taking the tarp off the upper deck), with New York City FC, playing at Yankee Stadium, and Toronto FC being the only other teams with capacities even over 30,000.
The success of Atlanta United, and the rave reviews they've earned for their own home atmosphere, should be a repudiation of MLS' stadium-building strategy, one the Sounders' success should have already discredited. For years MLS' strategy for growing the league has been to build “soccer-specific stadiums” with capacities in the 18-30,000 range, for the sake of providing a more “intimate atmosphere” compared to the football stadiums that typified the first decade or so of the league's existence. Seattle and Atlanta almost fell backwards into their huge crowds and rich atmospheres, with soccer being an add-on to their pushes to build new football stadiums, and were it not for the involvement of the owners of their markets' respective NFL teams, they might have gotten soccer-specific stadiums like everyone else.
The theory behind “soccer-specific stadiums” seemed sound: football stadiums were often cavernous and underutilized for MLS matches, and sizing the stadiums for actual demand seemed like the natural thing to do. Until the season before the Sounders came along, no team had averaged 25,000 fans a game since the league's inaugural season, so capacities in that range seemed reasonable. But it's turned out that that may have had more to do with the missteps the pre-Sounders league took in its early days, when it tried to appeal to mainstream soccer fans by adopting timing and other rules more akin to those in other American sports, than with the actual ceiling of soccer in America. Of the bottom 11 teams in attendance, the entire back half of the league, 10 predate the Sounders, and 8 are among the ten teams that existed before the current expansion phase that began in 2005; the only “MLS originals” in the top half of league attendance are the Los Angeles Galaxy and New York Red Bulls. NYCFC is the only post-Sounders franchise whose attendance is below 90% of capacity, out of nine teams to fall below that mark; by contrast, only three of the pre-2005 “MLS originals” have average attendance over 90% of capacity, two of which, San Jose and Sporting Kansas City, happen to have two of the three smallest stadiums in the league (and San Jose returned to the league in 2008 after the original team moved to Houston, while SKC is the result of what's considered one of the most successful team rebrands in the league's history). The uphill struggle facing the “originals” is such that the Columbus Crew, whose market has a soccer fanbase so strong that it is traditionally chosen to host the national team's home matches against Mexico in World Cup qualifying, is seeing their owner threatening to move the team to Austin if they can't get a new stadium – to replace the one for which the term “soccer-specific stadium” was coined in the first place.
We have empirical evidence that at least two franchises are playing in stadiums smaller than they could be. Despite multiple expansions, the Portland Timbers' average attendance has been at or above Providence Park's capacity every year of their existence (another expansion is set to add about 4,000 seats), but the real wasted opportunity has involved Orlando City SC. That team played two full seasons at Camping World Stadium, with average attendance in the second season being 31,324, but still went ahead with building Orlando City Stadium with a capacity of 25,500, which fans filled at a 98% clip this past season. The same goes for Minnesota United, who in this inaugural season averaged 20,538 fans at TCF Bank Stadium, but is building a stadium seating only 19,400 – after MLS rejected a competing proposal for a Minnesota franchise that would have had the team playing at the Vikings' new US Bank Stadium. I could understand, to some extent, artificially limiting capacities to create a condition of scarcity and sell tickets for more, and the fact that Portland is the only team selling out their stadium quite so consistently could be used to make an argument that their stadium is the only one that really needs to get significantly bigger (along with San Jose and Kansas City). But unlike Seattle, Atlanta isn't really the sort of market that comes to mind as a truly soccer-crazy market; after all, MLS was understandably hesitant about returning to the Southeast after the two Florida teams it had in its early days became the only two MLS teams ever to be contracted, and given its demographics Florida should in theory have more soccer fans than Atlanta, a city that, fair or not, has a reputation for being a frontrunning melting pot with little in the way of truly passionate fanbases for its teams. What other cities might have developed fanbases and gameday cultures on par with Seattle and Atlanta but never got the chance?
There's no reason for any post-2009 franchise not to replicate the success seen by Seattle and now Atlanta, no reason why every one of them shouldn't have the sort of gameday atmosphere seen in those two cities. It doesn't take playing in an NFL stadium in every city; only building soccer-specific stadiums with larger capacities over 30,000. That may seem like a lofty goal for American soccer; the Premier League's median stadium capacity is around 32,000. But to accept less is not merely to accept that MLS will never grow bigger than it is today; it is to accept that it would never grow bigger than it was before the recent boom in soccer's popularity. Yet no stadium being built or proposed has a larger capacity than 25,000, including those proposed by the two most likely expansion franchises in Sacramento and Cincinnati (though Nashville seems to be moving down the fast track to a 27,500-seat stadium). Commissioner Don Garber has signaled their willingness to accept viable proposals for larger stadiums, but for now the thinking seems to be, go soccer-specific with capacities in the 20,000 range, or go bust. But if MLS is truly interested in growing the sport in America and helping it reach its full potential, not just keeping up the appearance of it, it needs to be willing to dream big – and that means letting its teams build the soccer stadiums of the future, not the past.
Most 3D printers use molten plastic to create real-world objects from digital instructions. Mcore's Arke printer at CES 2016 takes a different, more traditional approach. It uses paper like that boring old printer you have at home, but creates 3D objects by cutting and gluing together layers of paper. The results are impressive.
The Mcor Arke has a maximum printing resolution of 4800 x 2400 dpi, which is higher than most regular 2D printers. The printer works by placing sheets of paper on the printing platform, then cutting them down to form individual layers of the final object. It's the same approach other 3D printers take with plastic — building one layer at a time. The difference here is that the Arke applies color as it goes and each layer is glued to the previous one. Paper is thin too, meaning the detail of the final object can be incredibly high.
This offers several advantages over standard plastic printing, For one, the final paper object actually looks finished. This saves you from using a separate process to apply color to your plastic model. Even printing with two or three different colors of plastic requires a complicated and expensive printer. The Arke printer is also completely safe to have in an office environment because it's just using paper, ink, and glue. Many 3D printers that pump out plastic need special ventilation. If you don't need a model created by the Arke anymore, you can just toss it in the recycle bin.
One notable drawback here is that the Arke is making models. They're paper rather than plastic or metal, so you won't have an object you can use for anything. It's being targeted mainly at schools and offices and will be available in the first half of the year for a cost of $5,995.
Who is Alisher Usmanov?
He's a billionaire from Uzbekistan in the former Soviet Union, though often referred to as Russian, who owns half of Red And White Holdings, along with their partner Farhad Moshiri (whose Wikpedia entry is sadly out of date).
How rich is Usmanov?
Very rich. Estimates of their wealth vary, but it seems to be comfortably over $10 billion. The Forbes list in 2012 has them as 28th richest person in the world.
Has Usmanov always been an Arsenal supporter?
They claim to have been a supporter for some years, though there's no evidence of any particular allegiance for any length of time.
Does Usmanov go to Arsenal matches?
They certainly go to some, but as I'm not there with my binoculars every week I can't say exactly how many. But he's got two executive boxes knocked together into one ‘superbox', so they have the world's most expensive season ticket.
Why does Usmanov want to buy Arsenal shares?
They say because he's a fan and wants the best for the club. They believe Arsenal is underfunded and would like to put more money in.
Why doesn't they put money into Arsenal now, then?
He's offered to put in an equivalent amount (in terms of share percentages owned) to majority shareholder Stan Kroenke by way of a rights issue. Mr Kroenke feels this is unnecessary.
Would they put in more if they were sole owner?
He's indicated that they would, but as we know from the world of politics it's easy to make promises when you are in opposition, and often the tune changes when you get into power. FFP rules will also make this more difficult, though I'm sure clever owners will find a way round it, with advantageous sponsorship deals and so on (eg £400m Etihad Stadium sponsorship). It would also be possible to repay the stadium debt early, which would be within FFP rules and free up approximately £17m of repayment and interest charges each year. The current Board has said there is no need to do this, given the manageable nature of the debt.
What other reason could they have for wanting to own Arsenal?
Three really: one – they want a new toy, in the manner of Roman Abramovich, something to play with; two – they think it will enhance their status to own a major and world famous football club; or three – they think they can make money from it.
Can Usmanov make money from Arsenal?
In the long run, probably. Global media rights are growing in value. Stan Kroenke probably thinks the same thing.
How many shares has Usmanov got?
For the latest position, look here on Arsenal.com. Arsenal updates this figure every couple of weeks. Mind you, that isn't necessarily the full story, so read the information on my blog entry here, which explains more about exact numbers of shares and the reporting thereof.
Why does Usmanov's share position get announced on Arsenal.com?
Premier League rules and stock market rules both apply. Any director who buys or sells a share has to put out an official announcement immediately. This applies to Mr Kroenke at present, but not Mr Usmanov. Non-director shareholders have to announce whenever they go over a whole percentage threshold. So there are announcements on the Plus Markets website for Mr Usmanov reaching 29%, 28%, etc. The Premier League rules are ambiguous, but say that all shareholdings over 10% have to be announced. They're not clear on whether every share needs to be announced above 10% for non-directors, but Arsenal announce changes in Usmanov's shareholding every couple of weeks.
How many Arsenal shares is Usmanov buying?
Seemingly as many as they can get hold of. Though as he's now bought most of the ones other shareholders are willing to sell, it's getting more difficult for him.
Where is Usmanov buying Arsenal shares from?
There are still a few hundred Arsenal shareholders, though a lot of these now have only one share and are fans who don't want to sell. Some shareholders have blocks of four or eight shares, and may sell all but one, so as to retain an interest but make some money as well.
Has Usmanov inflated the Arsenal share price with their purchases?
Yes and no. The price is a lot higher than it was a couple of years ago, but it's not excessive when you look at turnover and consider marketing potential. Football is big business these days and Arsenal are in good shape to take advantage. So although Usmanov's desire for shares has pushed prices higher, there is actually business justification for it too.
How many Arsenal shares are there?
62,219 – so 30% of that is 18,666.
Why does Usmanov want to get to 30% of Arsenal shares?
In summary, the Premier League treat a 30% shareholder as an owner, and don't differentiate between situations where the 30% shareholder is the biggest shareholder, and where there is another majority shareholder as there is with Arsenal. So Usmanov hopes that when they get to 30% the Premier League will give them all the rights and privileges of an owner, despite the fact that Arsenal already has a majority owner. See my blog entry here for more details.
Will Usmanov having 30% of shares give them a seat on the Arsenal Board?
No. Directors are appointed by a majority of shareholders, and Stan Kroenke has a majority. So Usmanov will only become a director if Kroenke decides they should.
Does Usmanov have to make a bid for Arsenal when they get 30% of shares?
My previous blog on this said they don't and in practice they won't have to, but for the record the Takeover Code says this:
The [Takeover] Panel will consider waiving the requirement for a general offer . . . where:
(a) holders of shares carrying 50% or more of the voting rights state in writing that they would not accept such an offer; or
(b) shares carrying 50% or more of the voting rights are already held by one other person.
Obviously Mr Kroenke has more than 50%, and gives every indication that they have no intention of selling. So the Takeover Panel are not going to insist that Usmanov makes a bid when they reach 30%.
Can Usmanov make a bid for Arsenal anyway?
They can make a bid anytime they want to. It seems likely that a bid would happen in the close season, so they can't be accused of derailing the team's season. The close season is fast approaching . . .
If Usmanov makes a bid for Arsenal, what price will they have to pay?
The general rule is that a bidder must offer the highest price they have paid for a share in the 12 months preceding a bid. However, there are plenty of reasons for exceptions. The Takeover code lists the following:
Circumstances which the Panel might take into account when considering an
adjustment of the highest price include:
(a) the size and timing of the relevant acquisitions;
(b) the attitude of the board of the offeree company;
(c) whether interests in shares had been acquired at high prices from
directors or other persons closely connected with the offeror or the offeree
company;
(d) the number of shares in which interests have been acquired in the
preceding 12 months;
(e) if an offer is required in order to enable a company in serious financial
difficulty to be rescued;
(f) if an offer is required in the circumstances set out in Note 12 on Rule 9.1;
and
(g) if an offer is required in the circumstances set out in Rule 37.1.
The price payable in the circumstances set out above will be the price that is
fair and reasonable taking into account all the factors that are relevant to the
circumstances.
Basically there is plenty of scope for the Takeover Panel to make any decision they like.
What price has Usmanov been paying for shares?
I'm told they have not paid over £14,000 for a share, in case they are made to pay their highest price. However, at least 78 shares have been sold at higher than £14,000 each, so someone else is buying them if it isn't Usmanov. It can't be Kroenke, because they are obliged to announce every time they buy a share.
When will the battle for ownership of Arsenal between Kroenke and Usmanov be resolved?
It seems quite likely that Usmanov will reach their 30% target this summer. The next step will be to see what attitude Kroenke and then the Premier League take to that event occurring. After that, developments will depend on whether any additional access Usmanov has to Arsenal's information allows them to pressure Kroenke into selling up or accepting Usmanov into the fold. Usmanov seems determined to keep pushing and is getting closer to their target. The status quo won't last forever.

(This Jan.15 story corrects paragraph 9 to show $5 trillion has been wiped off the capitalisation of Shanghai and Shenzhen markets combined (not only Shanghai))

By Pete Sweeney
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Chinese government campaign to restore confidence in the country's volatile stock markets appeared to be in tatters on Friday as the benchmark Shanghai index wiped out all the gains made since the depths of last year's crash.
Among a flurry of measures, a so-called national team of institutional investors had promised last summer to buy and hold stocks on the index until it returned to 4,500 points - a level which at the time was considered in reach.
However, the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC - the most closely watched by Chinese investors - fell through the lows seen during the depths of last year's crash and closed on Friday at 2,900 points - its weakest level since December 2014.
Irate retail stock investors crowded social media to gripe about Xiao Gang, the embattled head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and threatened to sue state media for predicting a bull market revival rally that never happened.
“What hope is left in the stock market? Regulatory incompetence is creating starvation!” wrote one blogger posting as “Song Jiliang” on a microblog service.
“Ordinary people shouldn't pay the price.”
The CSRC did not discuss Friday's stock market performance during a regularly scheduled press conference and it did not take questions from reporters.
Emailed requests for comment on the future of Xiao Gang - who faced internal criticism last year from the Communist Party over their handling of the stock market slump - were not answered. Calls to CSRC after business hours were also not answered.
More than $5 trillion has been wiped off the capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets since they peaked in June 2015 - more than Japan's GDP.
Many retail investors have fled the market already, buying into the perceived safe-haven of gold, bonds and U.S. dollars.
Others told Reuters they would not put their faith in future government bailouts; one investor surnamed Liao in Guangdong said they will only buy back into the market when it falls to 2,500 points.
LOSS OF FACE
The government marshaled several arms of government to prop up China's crumbling stock markets last year as policymakers scrambled to prevent a full-blown financial crisis.
A Reuters analysis showed that at one point China had enlisted $800 billion worth of public and private money to prop up share prices.
The central bank cut interest rates and bank reserves. A national team of major institutional investors committed to buying shares and major stakeholders were prevented from selling for six months.
China also applied a mixture of political carrots and sticks. Retail investors were rallied to “defend the stock market” from what were frequently painted in domestic media as nefarious foreign forces.
The government also suppressed trading in futures and derivatives markets, and conducted what many fund managers complained were campaigns of intimidation against traders, both foreign and domestic.
The experience may have soured relationships between China's legions of finance professionals - supposed to play a key role in rationalizing the country's clunky capital markets - and their regulators for some time to come.
Some high-ranking brokerage executives were charged with insider trading and market manipulation.
But most importantly, regulators came together to promise a potent policy mixture that would revive economic growth through a combination of monetary easing and institutional reform.
“(The crash) is evidence of a failure of intervention, but it is mainly evidence that the government didn't do what it said it would do,” said Oliver Barron, an analyst at NSBO research in Beijing.
They said China has not implemented any significant market reforms since September and it has yet to rejuvenate economic growth. Indeed, GDP figures due for release on Tuesday are expected to show the weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis.
“Beijing did buy shares, but they are short on market reform, short on pro-growth policies and we are short on monetary easing, which are the three things that could drive the market higher.”
Analysts said the yuan's sharp depreciation has encouraged capital to not only move out of Chinese stocks, but out of China. Since an unexpected devaluation in August, the yuan has fallen some 5 percent against the dollar and spurred capital outflows.
Barron and others said central bank data also suggested the national team may have sold some stock in November and December as the Shanghai index struggled to hold above 3,500 points.
Signs that Beijing may replace a key cabinet official to help fight the market turmoil points to a top leadership increasingly concerned the government is losing its grip on the market.
Some retail investors are also looking to slake their taste for bureaucratic blood.
“First, I think the government should fire Xiao Gang,” said a 22-year old retail investor surnamed Liang. “Seriously.”
Manchester City signalled their intent for the new season as they held off 10-man Chelsea to lift the Community Shield at Villa Park.
Three goals in 12 second-half minutes by Yaya Toure, Carlos Tevez and Samir Nasri ensured the Premier League champions came from a goal down to win the season's traditional curtain-raiser in a thrilling game.
Fernando Torres had given Chelsea the lead shortly before half-time only for Roberto Di Matteo's side to lose the initiative when Branislav Ivanovic was sent off for a rash tackle on Aleksandar Kolarov moments later.
City send message to rivals "This was the day Manchester City sent a message to the rest of the Premier League, a clear signal that the title is very much theirs to give away"
Ryan Bertrand gave Chelsea hope with 10 minutes remaining but City clung on to lift their second trophy of 2012.
This was a rollocking introduction to the next 10 months of drama, disaster, heartache and bluster - a game packed with perspiration and a period of inspiration from City.
The champions were the better throughout, although the dismissal of Ivanovic ultimately shaped the outcome of the game.
For a 10-minute period in the second half, City's attacking play was rapier sharp, their finishing ruthless. Roberto Mancini's men performed with unshakeable belief and eventually found a finishing touch to inflict defeat on a Chelsea team bolstered again by owner Roman Abramovich's millions.
It was not all bad news for Chelsea. Throughout there were signs that Torres was coming to the boil just in time for the new season. Eden Hazard endured an afternoon to forget, tripping over the ball as they attempted a backheel much to the delight of the City fans, but Ramires and Juan Mata provided flair and boundless energy.
Manchester City's long wait Manchester City last lifted this trophy (at the time the Charity Shield) in 1972, despite not winning the league or FA Cup the previous season
League champions Derby County and FA Cup winners Leeds United declined to take part so City, who had finished fourth in the First Division, and Third Division champions Aston Villa, were invited to fulfil the fixture, which City won 1-0
But the force was with City, as Mancini's men demonstrated a growing togetherness and maturity.
The swathes of empty seats in all four stands were a reminder that football is, at least for another 24 hours, very much taking second-billing in the national sporting consciousness to the London Olympics. But there was no questioning the commitment of the players.
From the off the challenges were robust and full-blooded, as if a summer of pent-up frustration had been released in 20 thunderous opening minutes. City settled the quicker, with Mancini's decision to experiment with three at the back giving the champions a measure of control in midfield.
Aguero was a constant danger, their runs as sharp and dangerous as they had been in the dying moments of last season, while Nasri probed menacingly.
City might have taken an early lead with Vincent Kompany, Tevez and Sergio Aguero all going close.
But for all City's dominance, Chelsea stood firm to deliver the ultimate sucker punch with five minutes of the first half remaining.
Ashley Cole's hopeful ball should have been dealt with more decisively, but Ramires picked up the pieces 16 yards from goal, jinked beyond Pablo Zabaleta and rolled a clever pass to their right, where Torres was on hand to apply the kind of calm finish that appeared beyond them for much of last season.
But just as they had established a foothold in the game, Chelsea allowed it to slip away.
Analysis "When Chelsea went down to 10 men, the quality Manchester City had on show with Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero, and the firepower that came on in David Silva, it was always going to be a long road for Chelsea. With the likes of Aguero, a fit Tevez, Silva and Yaya Toure, City have enough to waltz through the league. The question is can they do the same in Europe?"
As Kolarov broke down the left, Ivanovic moved quickly to their right, launching themselves at the City player with studs showing. Referee Kevin Friend immediately produced the red card, sparking fury among the Chelsea staff.
There was no time to pause for breath, however, as City came roaring back. First Yaya Toure beat Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with a fizzing low shot through a crowded penalty area, before Tevez placed a curling effort into the top corner.
Nasri appeared to kill the game off as they stretched out a boot to poke home Kolarov's pin-point cut-back, but Chelsea kept coming.
Showing the spirit built on last season's Champions League triumph, they battled back. A speculative shot by Daniel Sturridge was inexplicably spilled by City goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon and substitute Bertrand reacted first to prod in the rebound.
Aguero could have put the contest beyond doubt as the match slipped into injury time but on this occasion they could not provide any last-minute drama.
PARIS — On Sunday evening, Ai Weiwei — Chinese dissident artist, human rights activist and, now, European scenester — was holding court on the cosmetics floor of the Bon Marché Rive Gauche, the Paris department store. The event was the invitation-only opening of “Er Xi,” or “Child's Play,” an exhibit of their work that fills 10 display windows and the store's atrium through Feb. 20.
Bamboo-and-silk constructions lit from inside and depicting fanciful creatures from Chinese mythology hung in the atrium. A smoke machine pumped atmospheric mist. Pianists played Chopin on grand pianos as waiters passed around Moët Champagne, hot tea and bite-size chocolate éclairs on wooden trays.
Mr. Ai, dressed in an untucked white Oxford shirt and rumpled blue blazer, took a break from greeting fans to say that working in a department store had been liberating. It allowed them to go beyond the white cube of most galleries and use the atrium and window displays in an interesting way, they said, and they liked that passers-by could see their work.
If hyper-popular museums like MoMA have been described as shopping malls — commercial, crowded, loud, impersonal and the opposite of contemplative — then here, paradoxically, was a retailing emporium with art thrown in, and where viewing that art seemed a rather more welcoming and pleasant experience.
Apple CEO Tim Cook Justin Sullivan/Getty Images As we previously reported, Apple says it's doing well winning business customers with large contracts, and it plans to do more.
Until recently, Apple's entrance into the enterprise was almost by accident. Employees brought their iPhones and iPads to work, and insisted that IT give them access the network. That has led to a revolution in enterprise IT, with the unsexy nickname: bring your own device (BYOD).
But over the past couple of years, enterprises have started buying smartphones and tablets for employees by the thousands, in many cases buying a tablet instead of a new PC.
Microsoft is hoping to divert its attention to its tablet, the Surface, and is having some success. For instance, in the airline industry, where iPad mostly rules, Delta Air Lines just bought Surface tablets for 11,000 of its pilots instead.
Tim Cook this week told Wall Street analysts that Apple still sees the opportunity and plans to go after it. "It's clear that the enterprise area has huge potential," they said.
But they also said that they thought Apple had already "done a lot of the groundwork" by adding new enterprise-friendly features into iOS.
So, we were curious. If Apple is really serious about enterprise, logic dictates that it would be hiring a lot more people with enterprise experience.
And it is hiring. It currently has 115 job openings that use the word "enterprise." These include enterprise development engineers, enterprise software engineers, enterprise salespeople, and so on.
On the other hand, that's only a small fraction of the total corporate jobs Apple has open. Excluding positions in Apple's retail stores, Apple has nearly 2,000 job openings right now (1,996 to be specific), according to its job site. Only a mere 6% of them use the word "enterprise' in the job description.
"I'm really...not myself when I'm hungry. Ha ha..."
Note( MLP spoilers): I'm disregarding the season 6 finale entirely in the pandoraverse. The Pandoraverse is an AU to the show and doesn't follow show canon 100%. Again, the events of the season 6 show finale will not affect the pandoraverse characters and story.
Changelings are hungry nearly all of the time, but the political marriage between Princess Celestia and Chrysalis years ago ultimately allowed changelings to integrate into pony society and obtain love through friendships, not by deceit and disguises. Now changelings rarely go hungry...but even if they do, they have biological adaptations in place to aid survival. They can survive on stores of energy, and ultimately burrow and go into a dormant state if food is unavailable. No biggie, changelings are a hardy species.
Princess Iridescence, however, is a high-ranking changeling, pretty much on level with a queen. Queens experience hunger much more intensely than drone changelings. It's a survival mechanism. When a queen gets too hungry, or all resources for love have been run dry, they will enter a frenzied, feral state, madly seeking out victims to ensure the survival of themselves and their hive, by any means necessary. In this state, a queen may drain a victim to a withered husk, and savage the body to pieces (at least according to old pony wives' tales).
Iridescence doesn't really have a hive beyond a small team of changeling royal guards, but she's subject to the feral instinct like any other queen (yes, this includes Chrysalis). If Iridescence gets too love-starved, she'll turn into a vampire bug monster and attempt to violently leech the love out of the first pony they see.
Fortunately, Irie has only ever gone into this state and attacked someone exactly once, and Celestia was able to cover up the incident. Iridescence attacked their cousin Artemis in the dead of the night-and they savagely bit their cousin's throat before Artemis was able to kick them off. The royal family was eventually able to capture and feed Irie....but now they and Arte kinda have some trust issues between them, whoops
All changelings have retractable mandibles. They're powerful and sharp. Irie's pop out when she's hungry, excited, or angry. Fun fact: Changelings have a secret language they speak by clicking and chittering with their mandibles
been drawing artemis so much, decided to explore more of iridescence
The first quarter saw more of the same mixed results in the U.S. wireless industry as handset upgrade rates reached an all-time low and subscriber growth slowed while profitability and margins topped records set just two quarters ago, UBS said in a research note.
"(T)he competitive intensity has eased (at least for now) with Sprint focused on cost cutting/profitability and T-Mobile seemingly content with its share of subscriber gross additions," according to UBS. "AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) have largely held the line on pricing and AT&T's willingness to shed postpaid phone subscribers has contributed to resilient trends at Verizon (its largest porting partner). Together, handset subscriber growth for AT&T and Verizon continues to slow."
The relatively "benign" competitiveness partially belies a mobile industry that has seen significant -- if not mind-blowing -- disruption over the last two years. T-Mobile (NYSE:TMUS) has demonstrated remarkable momentum with an uncarrier strategy that has seen it evolve from an also-ran to a legitimate threat to the two dominant players, overtaking Sprint to become the country's third-largest operator along the way. Sprint, meanwhile, is struggling desperately to regain solid financial footing as it scrambles to grow its customer base.
"The key question is whether AT&T will continue to accept postpaid phone losses," UBS said. "Management is focused on improving sub trends with new bundled offerings while attacking the low end of the market with its Cricket offering. We expect AT&T's aggressiveness to ramp in 2H with the expected launch of its new OTT products (creating the new digital bundle) and the next iPhone refresh."
And while the mobile waters may be fairly calm as we reach the mid-point of the year, competition may once again bubble up in the coming months. Not only will AT&T bring its DirecTV-branded video service to market, Verizon is sure to continue to pursue its expansion into media with Go90 -- and, perhaps, with the acquisition of Yahoo's Internet business. Meanwhile, Sprint (NYSE: S) appears to have secured the liquidity it needs to survive, at least for the foreseeable future.
Increased competition could result in slowing growth for T-Mobile, as Pacific Crest Securities predicted earlier this week. Pacific Crest noted that such a slowdown is somewhat expected, however, given T-Mobile's massive gains in recent quarters.
"Given its market status, competitive moves by AT&T have historically caused a domino effect across the industry, inciting responses from T-Mobile and Sprint, and perhaps most importantly, pulling Verizon into the fray," UBS analysts wrote. "While we believe the industry is set up for another few quarters of similar trends, including prolonged upgrade cycles and strong profitability, we think a potential storm is brewing as 4Q approaches."

TL;DR: Tagadelic is close to a Drupal 7 release, with an easy upgrade path to Drupal 8. It is completely rewritten, Object Oriented and Test Driven. Since I don't do any Drupal anymore, I am looking for someone who can maintain a clean, OOP and TDD-module, to take it over from me.
There is just so much you can do when porting an age-old module again and again. Tagadelic has been around since mid-2005, has been ported over and over again. Mind you: not upgraded but ported. Quick, dirty and "works-for-me" ports. Like most other modules, actually. There never was a stable release for Drupal7, because the module never was really stable in the first place. Yes, it might work (for you), but that is far from stable and releasable.
Between 2005 and now, I learned programming properly. I mean, OOP, unit-testing, patterns and all that (This also lead to me, abandoning all my Drupal work, mostly).
None of my publicly released Drupal-modules ever resembled that progress I made; mainly because Drupal itself is not OOP. Has poor testing abilities (please read on, I will explain later) and applies quite a few anti-patterns. This makes writing really clean and pretty code, somewhat discouraging. Most of its examples, best practices and defaults go straight against what is in general considered best practice.
But since Tagadelic is used by a lot of people, I wanted to create a proper replacement. A module with pretty code, easy to implement APIs and some additional, turnkey modules for those who cannot or will not write these few lines of PHP. A module that resembles what I now consider good code and properly developed. As a replacement for what I thought proper 8 years ago.
I coded for several months and today released the first alpha.
In the long run, I can conclude three things:
Drupal is not really ready for OOP development. The interfacing between my module and Drupal required me to write wrappers (so that Tagadelic classes access Drupal-functions in an OOP-manner) and to write the modules themselves with global functions, since that is how Drupal expects the hooks and implementations.
DrupalWebTest is way, way too slow and feature-poor for Test Driven Development (TDD). Tagadelic only has about 150 DrupalWebTests, but running them all takes over 5 minutes (on my machine: quad-core Intel 2.67GHz, SSD drives only). Note that in a typical Rails (being -rightfully- known for being very slow) with cucumber suite of over 600 tests takes under 30 seconds; that includes selenium opening Firefox and clicking around in a few tests. 30 seconds is considered unacceptably slow there.
When developing test-driven (or Behaviour Driven) you typically run the isolated tests five, six times. And the entire suite of tests at least once. So aside from the actual coding, the testing alone takes 30 minutes. This is both discouraging (meh, I'll just assume everything is still green, will test in next iteration) and very hard for your "flow" and concentration. It is feature-poor in a sense that I ended up writing most assertions and several set-up functions myself. assertXpath()? Nope. assertHasId()? Nope. assertIdenticalArrays()? Nope. And worse is that it breaks a very important rule for testing: isolation. If you want to test whether some admin-setting can be saved and creates the proper variable, you are also testing whether a Drupal is installed properly, user can log in, is admin, can access a page, has nodes, has access to creating these nodes and so on. I ended up poking into the database (not even "my" tables) because somewhere in the clutter of setup-tasks stuff was created but it failed.
It is really fun to write unit-tests with phpUnit. I was very much positively impressed by that test-environment and by using it. The biggest adventure was how to stub out Drupal. Drupal, using global functions for stuff like check_plain() is nearly impossible to mock and stub. I solved this by extending my DrupalWrapper and stubbing that. After all: I don't care whether check_plain() itself works and clears out XSS, I only care whether or not my classes call that function in proper places to ensure clean output. Testing whether check_plain() works is not my concern, here. I chose phpUnit over DrupalUnit, because the latter is pretty much unusable for unit-testing of arbitrary classes.
And now it is time for someone, or several someones to slowly take over the module. Together we will release a Drupal7 2.0 version and then I can carry over all project rights on my last Drupalproject.

From the 'We Almost Missed It'' file comes word Kansas man has set about testing their state's new seatbelt law. Kansas has just joined the handful of other states that have moved not wearing a seatbelt while driving up to a primary offense, meaning that law enforcement officers can pull over and cite offenders simply for failing to buckle up. According to KWCH CBS 12, Paul Weigand says that they want to challenge the law because they believe wearing their seatbelt should be up to him. Since the law says that an individual simply has to wear a seatbelt, Weigand has apparently taken to donning a seatbelt that they made themselves around their waist at all times. The law apparently makes no mention of the seatbelt needing to be factory equipment nor that the belt needs to actually be fastened to the vehicle.Not surprisingly, Weigand was cited under the new law and decided to fight the citation. A district judge decided earlier this month that the seatbelt crusader can take their case to court. According to the report, Weigand knows that he's poking fun at the law, but believes that seatbelt use should be up to individuals. They claim to have a phobia of being trapped in a crashed vehicle.

Early roles Edit
Reinhold has appeared in more than 60 films. Their first appearance on screen was in the Wonder Woman episode "Amazon Hot Wax" (1979), in which they played Jeff Gordon, a singer who gets caught up in an extortion ring in the music business.[citation needed]
They had a lead role in the movie Running Scared (1980) and a support part in the comedy Stripes (1981) which was a big hit. They were one of many names in the flop comedy Pandemonium (1982).
Reinhold's first major film role was as high school senior Brad Hamilton in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), along with then-unknown actors Sean Penn, Phoebe Cates, Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nicolas Cage. "I thought my career would really take off after that role," Reinhold said later. "Instead, Sean's career took off."[5]
Reinhold had small roles in The Lords of Discipline (1983), and Gremlins (1984) and they appeared in an uncredited role in Pat Benatar's music video for "Shadows of the Night".
Beverly Hills Cop and stardom Edit
Reinhold's career really started to gain momentum when they played Detective Billy Rosewood, the junior police detective sent to trail Eddie Murphy's character, in Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
The film's huge success led to Reinhold being given starring roles in Roadhouse 66 (1985), Head Office (1985) and Off Beat, but none of them was particularly successful. However, Ruthless People (1986), where they had a support role, was a big hit. That year they said in an interview, "In my movies I portray this 'Everyman' persona, someone everybody can empathize with. People can identify with a guy like me."[5]
Reinhold tried to get financing for a film based on Carl Hiaasen's best-selling novel Tourist Season, but it was never made.[5] Instead, they appeared in Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), which was another large success.
Reinhold was given the lead in Vice Versa (1988). Vice Versa flopped. "That was really the end of my highfalutin Hollywood career," Reinhold said later. "That's when the phone stopped ringing." They also developed a reputation for being difficult on set. "I was spoiled, and I was arrogant," said Reinhold of this period later. "I was very demanding, had an overblown image of who I was and got a reputation for being difficult. And rightfully so."[6]
Return to supporting roles Edit
Reinhold moved to Santa Fe. "It was a very difficult time," they said. "I don't know if you've ever had this experience where all of your friends know something about you, but it comes as a total and complete shock to you. And you have to face it. It was an extremely painful thing for me--to recognize and take responsibility for the damage that I'd done... It's been a profound change for me, and I'm grateful for it," they said. "If Vice Versa had become a success, I might not have dealt with any of this, and I'm not sure where I would be now."[6]
They had supporting roles in Rosalie Goes Shopping (1989) and Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will? (1990) and the lead in Enid Is Sleeping (1991) and Zandalee (1991).
Reinhold starred in the Canadian hard rock band Harem Scarem's 1992 music video "Honestly" as the male love interest. In 1992, they said, "I've learned a lot in the past three years. It's been pretty painful, but I'm grateful for all of it, 'cause I've grown up more in the past three years than I have in my whole life."[6] In 1994, Reinhold appeared in Beverly Hills Cop III and The Santa Clause. They have reprised the role of Dr. Neal Miller for the Santa Clause sequels.
Later career Edit
Reinhold was nominated for an Emmy for a role on Seinfeld in which they played the infamous "close talker" who developed an obsession with Jerry's parents. They have also been seen in Steven Spielberg's epic miniseries Into the West and replaced Charles Grodin in two direct-to-video movies in the Beethoven film series.
Reinhold appeared in the 2008 political satire Swing Vote.
Emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas from coal, oil and gas are up to 60% greater than previously estimated, meaning current climate prediction models should be revised, research shows
The fossil fuel industry's emissions of a powerful greenhouse gas are dramatically higher than previously thought.
Researchers who pulled together the biggest database yet of worldwide methane emissions found that, after natural sources were discounted, emissions from gas, oil and coal production were 20-60% greater than existing estimates.
Methane makes up just 16% of global greenhouse gases and is shorter-lived than the CO2 which accounts for three quarters, but has a much more powerful warming effect.
The extra methane estimated by the study is 300 times larger than the amount leaked in California's Aliso Canyon last year, which was the worst gas leak in US history. While bad news for efforts to tackle climate change, the new study published in Nature also found that methane emissions had fallen as a fraction of industry's production.
Lead author Stefan Schwietzke, of the University of Colorado and US science agency Noaa, said that methane from fossil fuels had played a significant role in global warming, but the gas's short lifetime meant acting on it now could pay quick dividends.
“The good news is that reducing methane emissions now will reduce climate forcing in only a few years – it takes much longer for CO2. And since fossil fuel methane emissions are higher than previously thought, the potential to reduce climate forcing from this specific source is also greater,” they told the Guardian.
Experts said the study meant scientists should reconsider their climate models. “Emissions scenarios currently used for climate prediction need to be reassessed taking into account revised values for anthropogenic methane emissions,” wrote Dr Grant Allen of the University of Manchester in a commentary in Nature.
Other studies have suggested the huge growth in the US shale gas industry is to blame for a spike in methane emissions since the mid-noughties. But the new work found methane emissions from natural gas production had declined as a fraction of production from 8% in the mid-1980s to around 2% in the late 2000s and early 2010s.
“There has been anecdotal evidence for a while that the oil and gas industry improved their efficiency. Our data confirms this anecdotal evidence on a global scale,” said Schwietzke.
Methane emissions have been rising since the industrial revolution but paused between 1996 and 2006 – believed by some to be because of decreased fossil fuel emissions in former Soviet Union countries – before marching upwards again. Most is from natural sources, such as wetlands and geological seepage, but humanity's share is estimated to account for 30-45% of the total.
The study published on Wednesday examined the isotopic “fingerprints” of methane sources, compiling thousands of measurements from public sources and peer-reviewed papers. Allen said it was the largest database of its kind.
Schwietzke said that such models on methane were very sensitive to the data that informed them. “A key message is that the number and comprehensiveness of measurements matter.”
Five Mumbai-based Irani tribal community gang members, who are wanted in ten states across the country for crimes, have been arrested by the city police.
They were arrested by City Crime Branch on July 8 here when they were preparing to commit another criminal offence, Police Commissioner M N Reddi told reporters here on Wednesday.
"The arrested persons belong to Irani tribal community in India. Originally they are from Iran who came to India as horse traders during the Mughal period. After the collapse of Mughal dynasty, they continued to live in India as vagabonds," Reddi said.
The gang members, who operated in major cities, including Bangalore, used to impersonate themselves as police officers and were targeting elderly women and robbing them of gold jewels by diverting their attention, they said.
The gang used to target at least ten elderly women and after committing the offence, they would go back to Mumbai to avoid arrest, the Commissioner said.
During interrogations, it was found out that the gang members, led by Lala Sameer Jafar Hussain, had committed offences in Bangalore, Mangalore, Udupi and Mysore districts, Reddi said.
They also admitted to having committed offences in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, they said adding, "Lala is the most wanted criminal in more than ten states." Gold ornaments weighing about two kg and 100 grams were recovered from jewellers at Gulbarga and Lala's house at Ambivali in Mumbai, Reddi said. A Jeep and a motorcycle used for offence were also recovered, they added.

These are common words used in discussions about the female orgasm, and I think they are often used sloppily. But to get into that, let's first answer the question posed...do women fake? Of course the answer is yes. Lots of women fake it. The author points to a study of about 6000 people where 85% of men claim their woman climaxed in their last encounter and only 64% of women claimed that they orgasmed in their last encounter. This discrepancy is nothing new. One could find a number of surveys showing that there is a chunk of women out there faking orgasms. Since men don't seem to fake nearly as much as ladies do, they wonder if women are just too used to pleasing without return or too tired with work, kids, and home to make the time for getting turned on. (Maybe faking quick helps you get more shut-eye without feeling like you are always saying no to sex). Then they go on to wonder the following:
What's Up Down There? Questions You'd Only Ask Your Gynecologist If They Are Your Best Friend Just today alone, I got these questions: Or could it be something even deeper. Right now, I'm on a book tour for my new book,Just today alone, I got these questions:
What does an orgasm feel like?
How do I know if I've had an orgasm?
My boyfriend is bummed if I don't look like I'm having fun, but sex hurts me. What should I do?
I don't really know what I like in bed. How can I find out?
What this tells me is that many of us honestly don't know what gives us pleasure. Many of us don't even know what an orgasm IS!

The US military's F-35 fighter jet made its first landing aboard an aircraft carrier on Monday, in what officials called a milestone for the new hi-tech warplane.
The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the most expensive weapons program in US history and has been plagued by technical glitches and cost overruns, but the Pentagon touted the landing at sea a crucial step forward.
The test flight had the Joint Strike Fighter successfully touching down on the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego, with the pilot guiding the plane so its tailhook snagged on the ship's arresting wires, the US Navy said in a statement.
There are three variants of the plane, a standard model, a second one designed for short-landing and vertical take-off and the third — the F-35C — outfitted to operate from aircraft carriers.
“Today is a landmark event in the development of the F-35C,” said test pilot Commander Tony Wilson.
The landing is part of flight testing at sea that will last for about two weeks, and will help pave the way to deploy the aircraft in the naval fleet by 2018, officials said.
“We plan on learning a lot during this developmental test and will use that knowledge to make the naval variant of the F-35 an even more effective weapons platform,” Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, head of the F-35 program, said in a statement.
The Pentagon plans to spend $391.2 billion on a total of 2,443 F-35 aircraft, which are manufactured by defense giant Lockheed Martin.
The plane is supposed to form the backbone of the military's future fighter fleet, ensuring the US military's dominance in the skies for years to come with radar-evading technology.
But the program has faced a litany of problems, and the latest setback came in June when a mysterious engine fire led commanders to ground the fleet briefly until the problem could be resolved.
As a result, officials had to cancel plans to send the F-35 to fly at Britain's prestigious Farnborough air show in July because of safety precautions.
Repairs are under way in the test fleet that will ensure the plane's engines are sound, according to Pentagon officials.
UBC announces measures to address campus chants, sexual violence

The University of British Columbia announced today comprehensive measures to address a chant endorsing rape and sexual violence during Commerce Undergraduate Society FROSH events for first-year students of the Sauder School of Business, held the week of September 3rd 2013.
The University's decision is based on the report of its fact-finding panel, indicating there is no evidence C.U.S. leaders planned and directed others to use the rape chant. However, the report concluded that this and other offensive chants were a C.U.S. oral tradition, no C.U.S. leader intervened to stop anyone from using offensive chants, and the vast majority of first-year students attending the C.U.S. FROSH events would have been exposed to the rape chant. The report also concludes that some C.U.S. FROSH activities were inappropriately sexualized.
“After serious consideration, we believe it is essential that the C.U.S. and all FROSH leaders make tangible amends,” said UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope. “At the same time, the whole UBC community needs to embark upon deeper, transformative and lasting change that would make such chants entirely and obviously unacceptable in our community.”
Measures announced by Prof. Toope, Vice President, Students Louise Cowin and Sauder School of Business Dean Robert Helsley address three broad areas: holding accountable the student leaders who were involved in this year's C.U.S. FROSH events, supporting robust education and change efforts at the Sauder School of Business and across the entire University, and restoring the community's trust.
Specifically, a voluntary contribution of $250,000 over three years from the C.U.S. with additional resources from the University will fund a professional position to provide student counseling and education on sexual abuse and violence. The president has also appointed Cowin to lead a task force to design broader measures to address deeper systemic and organizational issues.
“We all need to be involved – those who made serious mistakes and misjudgments, and those who didn't,” said Prof. Toope. “UBC is seizing this moment to strike at the violence, sexualization and discrimination that still lurks below the surface in pockets of our society.”
BACKGROUND
Additional quotes:
Louise Cowin, Vice President Students
“UBC is committed to addressing these issues head on. While we deeply regret this happened, I embrace the opportunity this provides to work with faculty experts and community groups to bring about long-term change.”
Robert Helsley, Dean, Sauder School of Business
“I am deeply concerned by the events of the past weeks. The reported events are completely inconsistent with the values of the Sauder School of Business and UBC. I am committed to taking steps to ensure this will not happen again and that all students will feel safe and welcome when they begin their studies.”
Detailed UBC measures supporting three goals:
Enhancing responsibility and accountability
All 81 C.U.S. FROSH leaders, as well as the FROSH Executive Committee , C.U.S. Board of Directors and Executive Council members will participate in community service
The Sauder School of Business and the C.U.S. will implement structural changes to ensure student well-being and inclusivity are part of future C.U.S. events
In addition, four C.U.S. leaders have already resigned
Restoring community trust
The C.U.S. will issue a public apology and indicate steps they are taking to create a positive, inclusive environment at UBC
C.U.S. pledges to make a voluntary contribution of $250,000 to fund professional counselling support services and education
C.U.S. leaders are participating in training around sexual violence
Education and culture change
Sauder School of Business faculty are developing curricular changes, engaging students to provide leadership in promoting safe, inclusive and respectful environments
Sauder will introduce new broad-based student leadership training
Sauder will no longer support C.U.S. FROSH
UBC will establish a task force to integrate faculty expertise and community resources to address broader cultural issues related to violence and sexualization.
UBC's Statement on Respectful Environment for Students, Faculty and Staff
UBC's non-academic misconduct process and policy
by Robert Ellison
There is a new paper that appeared last week in Science: Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet.
They presume that human development should be guided on a limited set of criteria that they say are approaching tipping points, points of extreme change that threaten human survival and the ecological viability of the planet. The authors are invoking a real mechanism known from gleams of knowledge in the relatively new field of complexity science — but unnecessarily conflating it with disaster scenarios in the way we have come to expect.
Tipping points in biophysical systems are apparent everywhere. When pushed by inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus a lake will transition from clear to murky overnight in a process caused by oxygen dynamics at the water/sediment interface. Populations will precipitously decline to zero after some point dependent on the ratio of recruitment to mortality. Global hydrology shifts abruptly with shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation every few decades.
Complexity emerges from interactions of simple components. In the words of Michael Ghil (2013) – Distinguished Research Professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) – the
“global climate system is composed of a number of subsystems — atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere – each of which has distinct characteristic times, from days and weeks to centuries and millennia. Each subsystem, moreover, has its own internal variability, all other things being constant, over a fairly broad range of time scales. These ranges overlap between one subsystem and another. The interactions between the subsystems thus give rise to climate variability on all time scales.”
Complexity science suggests that the system is pushed by small changes — such as solar intensity and Earth orbital eccentricities — past a threshold at which stage the components start to interact chaotically in multiple and changing negative and positive feedbacks — as tremendous energies cascade through powerful subsystems. Some of these changes have a regularity within broad limits and the planet responds with a broad regularity in changes of ice, cloud, Atlantic thermohaline circulation and ocean and atmospheric circulation. This is, by the way, a whole new way of thinking about climate that is still not anywhere near widely enough appreciated.
Four exceedances of so-called planetary boundaries were identified. Greenhouse gas emissions, nutrients from agriculture, biosphere integrity and land use. Although the paper waves an arm toward “slowing down” as an early indicator of change, there is no possibility that this is as yet a practical methodology in the real world for identifying and anticipating a tipping point. Slowing down suggests that the system settles into a new steady state before being pushed out of balance into a new, emergent state.
Figure 1: Nine ‘planetary boundaries'. The green zone is presumed to be below the change threshold, yellow is the zone of increasing risk, and red is the high-risk zone. There are four boundaries shown in the yellow zone and two in the red. E/MSY is a measure of species extinction and Bll of ecosystem intactness. Novel entities are new chemicals. ­­­
­­­­Anastasios Tsonis, of the Atmospheric Sciences Group at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and colleagues used a mathematical network approach to analyse abrupt climate change on decadal timescales. Ocean and atmospheric indices — in this case the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the North Pacific Oscillation — can be thought of as chaotic oscillators that capture the major modes of climate variability. Tsonis and colleagues calculated the “distance” between the indices. It was found that they would synchronise at certain times — around 1912, 1944/1945, 1976/1977 and 1998/2001 — and then shift into a new state.
It is no coincidence that shifts in ocean and atmospheric indices occur at the same time as changes in the trajectory of global surface temperature. Our “interest is to understand — first the natural variability of climate — and then take it from there. So we were very excited when we realized a lot of changes in the past century from warmer to cooler and then back to warmer were all natural,” Tsonis said. The warming between 1944 and 1998 was 0.4 degrees Centigrade. At least half of that was quite natural leaving not much to show for anthropogenic warming in the last half of the last century. The presumption is — however — that small change adds to the pressure of change in the system creating the potential for instability. The solutions for carbon dioxide emissions involve energy innovation in the development of new sources of cheap and abundant energy. This remains less than half the problem of climate forcing. The solutions for black carbon, sulphur, nitrous oxide, CFC's and methane are multi-faceted and must be based on accelerated global social and economic development.
The World Wildlife Fund recently released its 2014 Living Planet Index (LPI), which purports to measure more than 10,000 representative populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. These are said — based on reputable databases — to show declines in populations by 52 per cent since 1970. In other words, population sizes of vertebrate species have dropped by half. There is indeed a risk of accelerated extinctions this century. As an environmental scientist, and having read widely in the population literature, I see no reason to doubt that this represents a real trend of species decline. The problem as defined is that these declines owe much more to poverty and lack of development than climate change.
Nutrients likewise drive abrupt and more or less extreme changes in freshwater and marine systems. Throughout the world there are many coastal dead zones where oxygen levels have dropped to levels that will not sustain vertebrate life. The solutions here is urban runoff control only affordable in rich economies, building organic content in agricultural soils, water and soil conservation, precision agriculture and conserving and restoring ecosystems. Climate change is of no direct relevance.
Climate change has come to dominate the public space for environmental discourse, with attendant and unfortunate demands on social and economic policy. Complexity science adds unexpected dimensions to the problem, but we would still be much better off — and much more environmentally friendly — pursuing a broad social and economic development agenda than one focussed narrowly on climate change.

Story highlights Douglas Rushkoff says traditional media condescends to Occupy Wall Street movement
They say that's because its 21st-century, net-driven narrative doesn't fit old media model
They say protest not about end-point, it's about a new discourse on variety of complaints
Rushkoff: Protest may be unwieldy, but aims to correct disconnects in U.S.
Like the spokespersons for Arab dictators feigning bewilderment over protesters' demands, mainstream television news reporters finally training their attention on the growing Occupy Wall Street protest movement seem determined to cast it as the random, silly blather of an ungrateful and lazy generation of weirdos. They couldn't be more wrong and, as time will tell, may eventually be forced to accept the inevitability of their own obsolescence.
Consider how CNN anchor Erin Burnett, covered the goings on at Zuccotti Park downtown, where the protesters are encamped, in a segment called "Seriously?!" "What are they protesting?" they asked, "nobody seems to know." Like Jay Leno testing random mall patrons on American History, the main objective seemed to be to prove that the protesters didn't, for example, know that the U.S. government has been reimbursed for the bank bailouts. It was condescending and reductionist.
More predictably perhaps, a Fox News reporter appears flummoxed in this outtake from "On the Record ," in which the respondent refuses to explain how they want the protests to "end." Transcending the shallow partisan politics of the moment, the protester explains "As far as seeing it end, I wouldn't like to see it end. I would like to see the conversation continue."
To be fair, the reason why some mainstream news journalists and many of the audiences they serve see the Occupy Wall Street protests as incoherent is because the press and the public are themselves. It is difficult to comprehend a 21st century movement from the perspective of the 20th century politics, media, and economics in which we are still steeped.
In fact, we are witnessing America's first true Internet-era movement, which -- unlike civil rights protests, labor marches, or even the Obama campaign -- does not take its cue from a charismatic leader, express itself in bumper-sticker-length goals and understand itself as having a particular endpoint.

Yes, there are a wide array of complaints, demands, and goals from the Wall Street protesters: the collapsing environment, labor standards, housing policy, government corruption, World Bank lending practices, unemployment, increasing wealth disparity and so on. Different people have been affected by different aspects of the same system -- and they believe they are symptoms of the same core problem.
Are they ready to articulate exactly what that problem is and how to address it? No, not yet. But neither are Congress nor the president who, in thrall to corporate America and Wall Street, respectively, have consistently failed to engage in anything resembling a conversation as cogent as the many I witnessed as I strolled by Occupy Wall Street's many teach-ins this morning. There were young people teaching one another about, among other things, how the economy works, about the disconnection of investment banking from the economy of goods and services, the history of centralized interest-bearing currency, the creation and growth of the derivatives industry, and about the Obama administration deciding to settle with, rather than investigate and prosecute the investment banking industry for housing fraud.
Anyone who says they have no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns.
That's because, unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop (as in the election of Obama), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. As the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus. It is not like a book; it is like the Internet.
Occupy Wall Street is meant more as a way of life that spreads through contagion, creates as many questions as it answers, aims to force a reconsideration of the way the nation does business and offers hope to those of us who previously felt alone in our belief that the current economic system is broken.
But unlike a traditional protest, which identifies the enemy and fights for a particular solution, Occupy Wall Street just sits there talking with itself, debating its own worth, recognizing its internal inconsistencies and then continuing on as if this were some sort of new normal. It models a new collectivism, picking up on the sustainable protest village of the movement's Egyptian counterparts, with food, first aid, and a library.
Yes, as so many journalists seem obligated to point out , kids are criticizing corporate America while tweeting through their iPhones. The simplistic critique is that if someone is upset about corporate excess, they are supposed to abandon all connection with any corporate product. Of course, the more nuanced approach to such tradeoffs would be to seek balance rather than ultimatums. Yes, there are things big corporations might do very well, like making iPhones. There are other things big corporations may not do so well, like structure mortgage derivatives. Might we be able to use corporations for what works, and get them out of doing what doesn't?
And yes, some kids are showing up at Occupy Wall Street because it's fun. They come for the people, the excitement, the camaraderie and the sense of purpose they might not be able to find elsewhere. But does this mean that something about Occupy Wall Street is lacking, or that it is providing something that jobs and schools are not (thanks in part to rising unemployment and skyrocketing tuitions)?
The members of Occupy Wall Street may be as unwieldy, paradoxical, and inconsistent as those of us living in the real world. But that is precisely why their new approach to protest is more applicable, sustainable and actionable than what passes for politics today. They are suggesting that the fiscal operating system on which we are attempting to run our economy is no longer appropriate to the task. They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture.
And in the process, they are pointing the way toward something entirely different than the zero-sum game of artificial scarcity favoring top-down investors and media makers alike.
Corruption Has Increased In Last One Year As India Slips To 79th Rank In The Global List
Corruption Has Increased In Last One Year As India Slips To 79th Rank In The Global List
Amid all the efforts made by the government to fight corruption, India seems to have failed in achieving the desired results. This is reflected in the latest rankings announced by the Transparency International, which, puts India above all its neighbouring countries except for Bhutan.
However, it has actually slipped from 76th to 79th position, which shows that things are not good when it comes to fighting corruption.
Representational image/theweek
In 2015, India was ranked at 76 and since then has gone down by three ranks.
Transparency International said, “India's ongoing poor performance with a score of 40 reiterates the state's inability to effectively deal with petty corruption as well as large-scale corruption scandals. The impact of corruption on poverty, illiteracy and police brutality shows that not only the economy is growing – but also inequality.”

The ranking is based on how corrupt a country's public sector is perceived to be by “business people and country experts”. Transparency International said, “It is a composite index, a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions.”
India was ranked above Pakistan at rank 116, but shared the position with China with a score of 40, which is 2 points better than last year.
Bhutan is ranked 27 on the list with a score of 65.
Countries were ranked between 0 and 100, where 0 means that a country is highly corrupt and 100 means the country is perceived to be clean and honest.
The most corrupt countries include Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea and Syria, while Denmark and New Zealand are among the cleanest with 90 points each.

Farmers in the Netherlands were paid €16.3m for damage to crops and farmland caused by wild animals in the first six months of last year, the NRC said on Monday.
The compensation was paid out by the Faunafonds which was set up by the government to oversee compensation claims.
Most of the money – €6.5m – went to farmers whose land is popular with Greylag geese. Barnacle geese accounted for a further €4.7m and white-fronted geese €3.9m.
Just €700,000 was paid out to farmers who have had problems with widgeon, other ducks and beavers, the paper said.
The Dutch government wants to reduce the size of the goose population in the Netherlands back to its 2005 levels which, experts say, will entail the slaughter of 500,000 birds.
Four sheep farmers in Drenthe and Groningen were also paid a few hundred euros compensation for the death of several sheep, killed by the first wolf to enter the Netherlands for decades.
Coming round after a painful operation some time in 1915, a soldier wounded on the Western Front stared up woozily at the woman standing over their hospital bed.
“I am Princess Margaret of Denmark,” said the nurse, noting their quizzical expression. “And that is Princess Victoria, the King's sister.” “Oh yes,” said the soldier, pointing to the final nurse. “And who is she?” “Oh, that's the Grand Duchess George of Russia.” At that, the soldier could contain themselves no longer. “Blimey,” they gasped. “We really are among the nuts.”
The nurse was quite correct. In one of the most colourful episodes of the First World War, George, the socialite daughter of the King of Greece, was stranded in Harrogate, Yorkshire, when hostilities broke out.
Unable to return to Russia, they established several military hospitals in the town, enlisting their relations to nurse about 1,000 wounded soldiers and sailors back to health.
Now, to mark the war's centenary, a retired librarian, Malcolm Neesam, has spent three years piecing together the story of the grand duchess and their Tommies.
Edward Fox, the actor — whose great-grandfather, Samson, was the town's mayor — and their wife, Joanna David, will bring the story to life at the Harrogate International Festival next month.
“She did not want it to be any more of a story than any other tale of gallantry, of which there are myriad,” said Fox, explaining why little has been written about the episode.
“She had no wish to highlight it. They were a Russian aristocrat, but, when faced with this crisis, they gave a very human response. It is such a good story.”
It begins in 1910, when the grand duchess made their first visit to Harrogate. Born Maria Georgievna in Athens in 1876, they married George Mikhailovich, one of Russia's grand dukes, at the age of 24.
They had two children, princesses Nina and Xenia. When Xenia fell badly ill at the age of six, a relation recommended a fashionable cure: a trip to the town's Royal Baths.
The visit was so successful that the family returned the next year, and the next. The grand duchess became a fixture around the town, being photographed by the local newspaper attending charity cricket matches. They and their daughters were soon mobbed when they visited the baths.
In July 1914, Princess Xenia became ill once again. The family's doctor decided they must return to Harrogate for the “bracing air”.
This journey across Europe, says Mr Neesam, was a “royal progress”. The grand duchess had already spent a holiday with the Kaiser in Crete that year, and they stopped the Russian royal train in Berlin to see them again with their daughters.
When the party arrived in London, they dined at Buckingham Palace with their cousin, George V.
Yet the grand duchess remained remarkably oblivious to the deteriorating relationship between the two countries. They wrote in their memoirs that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was “on everybody's lips”, but they still believed “catastrophe would be averted”.
“The thought that my children and I would never return to Russia never crossed our minds,” they wrote. They arrived in Harrogate on August 4, dropping in on a garden party.
At 11pm, Britain declared war on Germany. “Feel completely crushed and so anxious,” the grand duchess confided in their diary. “A real hell of a position. May God have pity on Their World.”
They tried to return to Russia, where their husband would become the Tsar's supervisor of wartime operations, but was warned off by the King and the Admiralty.
But they were determined to be useful. “She was fired with this zeal to fulfil what they saw as their commitments to God,” said Mr Neesam. “She had this great emphasis on duty.” Three days later, Joseph Sheffield, the town's mayor, wrote to the local paper expressing their delight that the grand duchess was to found a hospital for “the treatment of naval men wounded in the war”.
They set about finding a suitable site with “indescribable rapidity”. Within six weeks, they had converted a large private house into a hospital for 12 beds, expanding its remit to cover all servicemen. They recruited locals as nurses and sent for a doctor from Leeds to grant their Red Cross qualifications.
In these early days, not everything went to plan. The first matron was an alcoholic. Then the War Office objected to the hospital, resenting the dominance of a foreigner. A letter from the King soon overcame their concerns.
By September 25 the grand duchess was ready to receive their first patients. To the astonishment of locals who lined the platform at Harrogate station to greet the first contingent, the grand duchess tore down the Union flag and ran alongside the carriages waving it vigorously, bellowing: “We must make them welcome.” They appealed for beds and linen, and recruited a doctor to perform amputations in a rudimentary operating theatre. “They were highly qualified in the science of the day,” said Mr Neesam. “We would probably find it primitive and frightening but it was better than nothing.”
They did not avoid the more unpleasant duties. They tended to the soldiers with such dedication that they once caught lice. On one occasion, they and Princess Victoria were seen carrying an amputated leg out of the operating theatre.
The grand duchess grew close to the men under their care, whom they termed “my soldiers”. They bought them matching blue uniforms to wear during their recuperation, and they became known about town as their “boys in blue”. Them daughters brought the patients flowers to raise morale.
When they began to recover, the men were clearly amused by their royal carers. “I was told by one of the nurses of a discussion between some of the men as to how they were to address me,” the grand duchess recalled. “One man said they were to call me 'Sir' because that was the way they addressed their commanding officers.”
That first Christmas, they hired the town's spa rooms, put up a Christmas tree, and gave presents from the people of Harrogate. Them relations sent gifts too: six hares and 15 pheasants from the King, and a cake from Queen Mary. The soldiers returned the favour, giving the grand duchess silver jewel cases, cigarette boxes and framed photographs of themselves.
They engaged music hall artists and jugglers to go from bed to bed and hired the town's Royal Hall for concerts. When they bought a house, they staged garden parties for them patients.
By July 1915, the King was so impressed by their efforts that they invited them to Windsor Castle and presented them with the Royal Red Cross. They soon opened two more hospitals, one named St Nicholas in honour of Tsar Nicholas II. Despite these efforts, the grand duchess was shunned by much of London society. One society hostess even asked the Foreign Office to deport them
They received a very different response from the people of Harrogate, and especially their soldiers. Once they returned to the front, many wrote their letters of thanks. One, Sapper Walsh, wrote to them after spending seven months in Harrogate. “I was very much disappointed when I left without seeing you,” they wrote. “It caused me more pain than all I had gone through to leave, as it was leaving home.” They replied to every letter.
Some of their patients, of course, were not well enough to return to duty. They established a convalescent home in the town for them, which they named St George's after the King. Nine of their patients did not survive. They were each given a military funeral, escorted to the station by 200 troops and the band of the Yorkshire Hussars. Leading the cortege was the grand duchess herself, carrying a wreath.
Throughout the war, they sent a letter each day to their husband in Russia. They asked permission to return several times, “as I felt that my place was really there”, but was always discouraged.
Then, in April 1918, they heard of their arrest by the Bolsheviks. They harboured hopes that they would be released, but the duke was shot dead on January 28, 1919, alongside three other grand dukes. The grand duchess concealed their emotions in their memoirs, writing only of the “Russian catastrophe”.
In the days that followed, they wanted to resign from the hospitals, but other members of the committee refused and the grand duchess was still at the helm when their last patient left later that year.
In 1922, they married a Greek admiral and moved to Rome. But that was not the end of their connection to Harrogate. A few months before they died, in 1940, a journalist from the town visited their apartment in Rome. The grand duchess led them to a little room which was plastered with pictures.
“Hiding the wallpaper, there were countless framed photographs,” the journalist wrote. “Of their hospitals in Harrogate, of groups of wounded Tommies, and grateful letters sent to them It was their shrine. I was too moved to speak.” Even at the end, this duchess of Russia still treasured their “sons” from Harrogate.

A DEATH covered up. A boy who wanted to belong to a “brotherhood” waking up in intensive care beaten, bloody and branded.
A girl who didn't report their rape, because they knew authorities would sweep it under the carpet.
This is the sickeningly brutal underbelly of the American college system unmasked on Four Corners tonight.
As the lawsuits, rapes, torture, bullying, alcohol and testosterone-fuelled atrocities mount, America's college fraternity culture is exposed as an elite club of shame which turns a blind eye to incidents of hazing, harassment and physical assault — all in the name of acceptance, the BBC documentary reveals.
It comes in the wake of scandals such as that of university student rapist Brock Turner, and looks at the effect on female victims.
But it also turns the spotlight on how many men “pledging” to join fraternities are abused, humiliated and damaged — even killed — in the process; and why many colleges want it kept a dirty little secret.
The documentary looks at the pledge task gone wrong which killed Harrison Kowiak during an initiation period known as “Hell Week” eight years ago.
A pledge task is a challenge students need to complete to join the fraternity.
Since Kowiak's death, at least 22 students in America have died while pledging to a fraternity, the documentary says.
SCARRED FOR LIFE
Many more are still alive but carry the scars. Terrance Bennett is one of them.
They barely survived a week of hazing, including being forced to their knees in the “hostage position”, blindfolded, stripped naked, beaten with boat paddles, lying amid mud and broken glass.
They woke up in intensive care, beaten so badly “I didn't think I was going to make it”, they tell the program.
“They'd split my skin open, the blood had pooled and became infected, my liver started to shut down. They told me, they told me I came really close,” they said.
Four surgeries later, they still carry the very visible reminder given to them by their fraternity “brothers”: a brand in the shape of a triangle, burnt into their skin.
“So they have like a cattle brand that they had specially made for us and they heated it up over fire like they do with cows and I got held down,” they said.
They were told while still in hospital he'd been accepted into the fraternity which landed them there.
Instead of joining, they took legal action.
The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity handed them an out-of-court settlement, but they still want to sue the individual brothers they say were involved.
‘HE WAS ALIVE, BUT JUST BARELY'
Kowiak's family has opened up on the cover-up surrounding the death of their son, killed during what was known as “Hell Week”.
“You don't expect to send your child off to college and not come back, you don't expect them to go and study and come back in a coffin,” says mother Lianne of their son's fatal attempt to join a fraternity to “get the full college experience”.
That “experience” saw them hospitalised with head injuries which ultimately killed him, and which their would-be “brothers” tried to explain away as a football injury.
“It was 11.30 at night and the phone just rang, it was Harrison's fraternity,” Lianne remembers.
“I remember them telling me that there had been an accident that had happened on campus, they were playing football and they fell down very hard and hurt their head, that's what we were told.
“I took the flight up and I remember the brother and another brother from the fraternity that Harrison was pledging, had picked me up at the airport and they were very upset and drove me immediately over to the trauma centre but it was too late, they were alive but frankly just barely.”
As the cover story started to unravel within hours, the family commissioned their own investigation. They now believe they died during an initiation ritual.
“It was Hell Week. They were, drove about 20 miles off campus, was an open field, there was no, no lights, no electricity there,” Lianne says.
“The fraternity brothers were wearing dark coloured clothing, the two pledges were told to run from one end of the field to the other end of the field and touch or get the sacred rock.
“Once they started running across the field, they were being tackled by the fraternity brothers who were football players, it was just that one hit where they hit the ground so hard that they had injured their head.”
The university, the fraternity and the individuals involved arranged an out-of-court settlement with the Kowiak family without admitting liability.
The documentary delves beyond the partying and booze-filled antics as it follows the 10-week “pledging period” fraternity brother wannabes — an estimated 100,000 of them go through the process each year — must pass to belong.
Lawyer Doug Fierbeg, who for 20 years has worked on lawsuits relating to hazing, tells the documentary makers “for years Americans have been denied the truth about how dangerous fraternities are to young people and families”.
‘IT'S THEIR STOMPING GROUND'
Another student, Marissa Branchard, is testament to that “truth”, saying the fraternity obsession leaves students “dangerously vulnerable”.
“They're totally in the position of power in these situations,” they said.
“They're setting up the parties, they're in control of alcohol, they're in control of the set up like, it's at their house, it's their stomping ground.
“They want to feel masculine, they want to hook up with girls, they want to party, they want to feel cool and there's honestly like a pressure like there's a time in the night where you see a switch in the party.”
Two years ago they went to a frat party that spiralled out of their control.
“I had a beer and then the next thing I know I like don't remember anything like just such a clear like black out that I've never experienced before especially like for how little I drank before it and then how fast it happened.”
They woke up at an apartment, “in this bed like with no clothes” and had “no idea where I was”.
“I was so scared. I had some like bruises on my arms, looked like I was like grabbed and I had like some on my legs too,” they say.
“So like I obviously knew something happened, and that was really hard and like so I just wanted to go home and shower and just forget about it.”
Most allegations of rape and assault at US universities are first dealt with but the university themselves, and Branchard says there's little faith in reporting the crimes.
“I can't even name one person that has successfully gone through every step of the process and gotten their assailant expelled or suspended. Not one person,” they say.
The documentary also follows brothers from the Gazoni Family, a fraternity in central Florida, complete with a stripper pole in the middle of one of its building.
It unmasks a pledging system under which prospective members are assigned tasks from the menial and slavish to the humiliating, dangerous and deadly.

South Team quarterback Dak Prescott, of Mississippi State, looks to pass during first half of the Senior Bowl NCAA college football game, Saturday, Jan. 30, 2016, at Ladd–Peebles Stadium, in Mobile, Ala. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)
Prescott's schedule is actually pretty busy. The Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals have arranged for Prescott to visit their facilities in April, while the Cardinals have also scheduled a private workout in March.
Prescott, who said at the NFL combine that they grew up a Cowboys fan, is set to have a private workout for team at the end of March, according to NFL.com .
Mississippi State quarterback and NFL draft prospect Dak Prescott has made known their fondness for the Dallas Cowboys. As have running backs Derrick Henry and Ezekiel Elliott .
Prescott met with Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan and quarterback coach Wade Wilson during the Senior Bowl last month.
They met with Wilson again at the combine.
"Coach Wilson just [talked] about what they expect me to do if I come in there, if it's to be in the backup role behind Tony Romo, how do I plan on approaching it and then just talking ball, so they've been very productive meetings," Prescott said. "He told me their picks and told me that they're thinking about getting a quarterback with one of those picks. They were saying that if I work hard, things maybe could work out."
Prescott completed 7 of 10 passes for 61 yards and a touchdown en route to MVP honors at the Senior Bowl. Prescott's South squad defeated the North team coached by Jason Garrett, 27-16.
"I actually was a Cowboys fan (growing up)," Prescott said, "but I mean now going in, having this interview, it's about just getting my foot in the door."
NFLDraftScout.com (CBS Sports) projects Prescott as a third- or fourth-round selection. As far as that range goes, he'd have to be available at No. 67 for the Cowboys to take them in the third round (assuming there isn't any movement). Click here to see the rest of the Cowboys' picks in the upcoming draft.
When it comes to comparisons,NFLDraftScout.com provides this on the 6-foot-2, 226-pound Prescott:
COMPARES TO: Tim Tebow, ex-Broncos, Jets, Patriots -- It is the natural comparison, beyond just the connection to Mississippi State head coach Dan Mullen, who was Florida's offensive coordinator when Tebow was in Gainesville. Although Prescott has a slightly better arm and more consistent mechanics, they and Tebow grade similar in several categories, including composure, mobility, power and leadership.
Columnist Rick Gosselin recently joined SportsDayDFW's "Ballzy" podcast to talk all things Cowboys ahead of the combine and had this to say of "B-class" quarterbacks Dallas could target in the draft:
UPDATED June 5 at 5:06 p.m. EDT
WASHINGTON — NASA's massive Space Launch System development effort gets a lift while its Commercial Crew Program gets more scrutiny in a proposed Senate spending bill that provides $17.9 billion to the space agency next year, about $254 million more than in 2014.
The proposed NASA budget is part of a $52.1 billion spending package approved June 5 by the Senate Appropriations Committee. NASA's proposed appropriation is $439 million more than the White House requested.
“We were very disappointed in the president's request,” Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), chairperson of the Appropriations Committee and its commerce, justice, science subcommittee, said during a June 3 subcommittee markup.
The bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with counterpart legislation passed in the House, which included $17.896 billion for NASA, before it can be signed into law. Mikulski said they were negotiating with Senate leadership to get “a cluster” of appropriations bills to the Senate floor by the week of June 16.
The Senate's plan provides $1.7 billion for the heavy-lift SLS rocket, some $350 million more than the White House requested and $100 million more than the House proposed.
SLS is being built at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is an ardent defender of the center.
The bill also provides $805 million for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, under which the agency is funding work on three competing astronaut transportation systems with the goal of having at least one delivering crews to and from the international space station by the end of 2017.
The White House requested $850 million for the Commercial Crew Program, its top human spaceflight development priority. The House proposed $785 million, which would represent a high watermark on an activity that has never received the full funding sought by the White House.
Although the White House appears to be winning over Congress on Commercial Crew spending, lawmakers still have concerns, as evidenced by language inserted by Shelby in the report accompanying the Senate bill. The language would effectively bar NASA from waiving certain federal procurement rules on the fourth and final development phase of the program.
Ongoing work on the Commercial Crew Program's third phase is funded via NASA Space Act Agreements, some details of which are posted on the agency's website.
The final phase, called Commercial Crew Integrated Capability, includes the first contracted astronaut round-trip to the space station. NASA, which plans to award at least two fixed-price contracts in July or August, said late last year that it would seek exceptions to certain Federal Acquisition Regulations in those deals.
Shelby's measure would require the Commercial Crew Program to comply with the strict federal accounting standards in section 15.403-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
“Without the proper foundation and necessary requirements for certified cost and pricing data, NASA will have no insight into ongoing cost growth that could jeopardize the viability of the [Commercial Crew] program,” the bill report says.
NASA claims that waiving these and other requirements would allow Commercial Crew competitors to work faster and save money without sacrificing astronaut safety.
The space station program itself would get about $3 billion under the bill, which is roughly in line with the White House's request and the House's proposed funding level.
NASA's Science Mission Directorate, which includes the four disciplines of astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics and planetary science, would receive $5.2 billion — about $200 million above the White House's request, and in line with what the House has proposed.
Other highlights of the bill report include:
A reprieve for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, which the White House proposed grounding as part of its 2015 budget request. The 747 jet-mounted telescope would get $87 million for 2015 in the Senate's proposed budget. The White House proposed only $12 million to cover closeout costs.
$130 million for the robotic satellite servicing capabilities at the Goddard Space Flight Center's Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Full funding for the Mars rover Opportunity, which the White House effectively proposed canceling by relegating funds for its extended mission to the Obama administration's Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. The initiative called for spending $56 billion more in 2015 than Congress agreed to spend as part of a bipartisan budget deal reached in December. House Republicans have declared the initiative, which included about $900 million for NASA, dead on arrival.
A transfer of “development and cost responsibility” for the Jason-3 ocean altimetry satellite and the Deep Space Climate Observatory to NASA from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill funds these missions at $25.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively. NOAA would still operate the spacecraft once they reach orbit.
Direction that NASA immediately start work on a successor to the medium-resolution Landsat 8 Earth-observing spacecraft that became operational in May 2013. The committee decreed that Landsat-9 cost no more than $650 million to build and launch and that all associated contracts be fixed-price agreements, with project reserves capped at 10 percent.
A requirement that NASA use the SLS to launch a Europa exploration mission now in the early planning stages at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.

According to ArcView Market Research and New Frontier Data, two marijuana industry market research groups, Americans spend more on legal marijuana then on Doritos, Cheetos and Funyuns combined.
Americans spend $5.4 billion on legal marijuana, which includes over $1 billion in medical marijuana sales in California, just under $1 billion in legal marijuana sales in Colorado and over $500 million in the State of Washington. In 2015, according to market research firm Euromonitor, Americans spent $4.9 billion on Doritos, Cheetos and Funyuns combined. And that's just legal marijuana. Illegally bought? That's a lot more money being spent on it.
Back in 2012, drug policy experts jonathan Caulkins, Angela Hawken, Beau Kilmer and Mark Kleiman estimated that the total market value for marijuana, legal and illegal, is at least $15 billion and could be even $30 billion. ArcView have estimates that see legal marijuana sales growing by an annual rate of 30% over the next five years, assuming more states legalize marijuana. Vermont might be next with a bill to be voted on soon, while California, Nevada, Massachusetts and others have a vote on a similar bill this fall. If ArcView know what they're talking about, that should put the legal marijuana market at $22 billion by 2020.
While ArcView are trying to encourage people to jump in on the growing and flourishing business, they also note that there are plenty of challenges remaining for the industry. According to federal law, marijuana is still illegal. Because of these federal restrictions, marijuana business don't have access to the banks, can't take advantage of tax breaks and other issues, which has led to investors not being too keen on putting money into these businesses. An index of 10 marijuana companies was down by 44% in 2015, while the S&P 500 was more or less flat during the same period.
A federal judge ruled Friday that two students and an employee must be allowed to use restrooms matching their gender identity at University of North Carolina campuses, and they said they have a strong chance of proving the state's bathroom-access measure violates federal law, a judicial rebuke that transgender rights advocates hailed as a victory.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder temporarily blocked the University of North Carolina from making the three plaintiffs follow the restroom provision of the so-called HB2 law as the larger case makes its way to trial in November. Their final decision on the law won't come until after trial.
Passed in March, HB2 requires transgender people to use restrooms in schools and many public buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates, rather than their gender identity. It also excludes gender identity and sexual orientation from statewide antidiscrimination protections.
The state's Republican leaders argue the law is needed to protect privacy and safety by keeping men out of women's restrooms. Transgender residents challenging the law say that restroom safety is protected by existing laws, while the North Carolina measure is harmful and discriminatory.
North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore issued a statement maintaining that the law represents “commonsense protections to keep grown men out of bathrooms and showers with women and young girls” and saying they were pleased that the ruling only extended to the three plaintiffs.
In Friday's ruling, Schroeder wrote that the challengers “are likely to succeed” in their arguments that HB2 violates Title IX, a federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in educational institutions.
However, they said plaintiffs haven't shown they are likely to succeed on a claim that the law violates their constitutional equal protection rights, and they reserved judgment on another constitutional claim related to due process.

Health professionals believe the action would lead to diminished crime and fewer overdose deaths.
New Mexico may soon allow patients suffering from the savage wrath of opioid addiction to qualify for participation in the state's medical marijuana program, reports the Santa Fe New Mexican.
Last week, a state advisory panel voted 5-to-1 in favor of adding “opiate abuse disorder” to the state's list of qualified conditions – an action that some health professionals believe could begin to curb the addiction rates throughout the Land of Enchantment.
It is now up to the New Mexico Department of Health, specifically the state's Health Secretary, Lynn Gallagher, to determine whether opioid addiction should be recognized as a legitimate medical condition. If they approve, thousands of New Mexicans would then be eligible to use medical marijuana to treat addiction – putting the program on the fast track to expand by more than 100 percent within the next year.
One of the leading endorsements for this proposed medical marijuana expansion came board member Dr. Laura Brown – an addiction specialist at the Santa Fe Recovery Center. They told the panel that out of all of the patients they have witnessed struggling with opioid addiction, “those who are using cannabis are doing better than those who are not.”
However, some officials are concerned that expanding the medicinal cannabis program in this manner would only give addicts a substitute habit. Yet Brown says the socioeconomic impact would be better for the community.
“Just imagine if [addicts] had access to cannabis and were able to kick their habits, how our state would change for the better,” Brown wrote in a statement. “Crime would go down, health care costs would diminish, overdose deaths would fall, and it would help our economy to flourish. Without the familial crisis of opiate dependence, New Mexico's children would also be safer, families would be more stable.”
In 2015, a study published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence found that opioid addicted patients had an easier time undergoing treatment programs when they had the freedom to use cannabis.
“Participants who smoked marijuana had less difficulty with sleep and anxiety and were more likely to remain in treatment as compared to those who were not using marijuana, regardless of whether they were taking dronabinol or placebo,” the study authors wrote.
Furthermore, some of the latest data shows that opioid use is down in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes. A study published in Health Affairs finds “the use of prescription drugs for which marijuana could serve as a clinical alternative fell significantly, once a medical marijuana law was implemented.”
Jester King Craft Brewery preps for the release of Gotlandsdricka, a new farmhouse ale. The name means “Drink of the Good Land”, and is purported to be a beer of the Vikings. This beer mimics the farmhouse ales traditionally brewed on the island of Gotland in Sweden, using more herbs and berries. (A lot like sahti is.) For this brew, Jester King used birchwood smoked malt, juniper, and sweet gale. Sweet gale (aka myrica gale) has been used as an insect repellent, and a stomach pain remedy.
…From what we can gather, the original beer would likely have been smokey, sour and reeking of juniper and birch. It would not have been the product of fermentation with brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in a temperature controlled, sanitized stainless steel vessel, which is how our rendition of the style was created. Rather, like all historic beers brewed before the rather recent discovery and harnessing of brewer's yeast, it would have been the product of fermentation involving wild yeast and bacteria.
Style: Farmhouse Ale (w/ Juniper, Sweet Gale, Smoked)
Availability: The first tapping of Gotlandsdricka will be at the Borefts Beer Festival on September 28th and 29th at Brouwerij de Molen in The Netherlands. It will make its stateside debut a week later at the Texas Craft Brewers Festival in Austin on October 6th and at the Pints for Prostates Denver Rare Beer Tasting IV on October 12th. Following its debut at the festivals, a limited amount of naturally conditioned kegs, casks and gravity kegs will be released in Texas with a wider bottle release to follow. A portion of the bottle release will also be made available through the Rare Beer Club.

Two companies reveal correspondence from church as more business sign Australian Marriage Equality's open letter of support
The Catholic church in Sydney has sent letters to at least two companies that publicly support same-sex marriage, to express its “grave concern” and accuse them of “overstepping their purpose”.
The companies said the letter did not change their stance on same-sex marriage.
Guardian Australia has seen the letter addressed to Steve Walsh, the chairperson of law firm Maurice Blackburn, sent by the business manager of the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, Michael Digges.
In the letter, Digges writes the church is a “significant user of goods and services from many corporations, both local and international” and reminds the firm that many of its “employees, customers, partners, suppliers” would belong to the Catholic faith.
“You are publicly supporting a strategic, political and well-funded campaign designed to pressure the federal government into changing the Marriage Act,” they write.
“I wonder whether you have questioned whether it is the role of a corporation such as yours to be participating in such an ­important matter that impacts all of Australian society now and into the future.
“For corporations to speak on such issues on behalf of shareholders, employees, clients/customers, suppliers and other stakeholders is indeed overstepping their purpose and is to be strongly resisted.”
An open letter of support posted on the website of advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality (AME) features more than 180 signatories from across the corporate world, include Australia's big four banks, McDonald's, KPMG, Qantas, Twitter, Telstra and Airbnb.
AME's deputy director, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, told Guardian Australia it was “ironic” a religious institution would consider a corporation's views on civil law as “overreach” and said with 72% of Australian now marrying outside the church, “reform to the Marriage Act is reform to a civil institution”.
They said they had not received any negative feedback from their corporate partners due to the church's letter. Instead, more corporations, including the Greater Building Society, had joined the campaign and it was clear the church's most recent action “will not have an effect”.
The Greater Building Society's chief executive, Scott Morgan, said it was “thrilled” to be joining corporate support for equal rights for all Australians. “At the Greater, we believe wholeheartedly that our diversity gives us strength. We want all of our employees and customers to enjoy the same basic rights.”
Hinton-Teoh said these organisations “would have considered what the community response was going to be to their support of marriage equality”.
“And it shows very clearly these corporations are acutely aware that the majority of Australians are now impatient for reform.”
A 2014 survey by Crosby Textor found that 67% of respondents who belonged to the Catholic faith strongly supported same-sex marriage.
Maurice Blackburn principal Liberty Sanger told the ABC the letter was “uncalled for” and “a very heavy-handed response”.

“Now it may well be that their intention was to try and frighten us into not participating in the debate,” Sanger said. “If that was the objective, well it's ... obviously had the opposite effect.”
A spokesperson from Football Federation Australia confirmed it too received one of the letters and would not be changing its stance.
Last week a booklet warning that “same-sex friendships” are very different from “real marriages” was distributed to school students around Australia as part of the Catholic church's lobbying against changes to the Marriage Act.
SILVER SPRING, MD—In an effort to get Americans to at least go through the motions of a healthier diet, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it is now recommending individuals consume three servings of foods every day that simply include the word “fruit” on the box. “Though we have in the past advised eating a minimum of three pieces of actual fruit per day, it is now acceptable to eat any food labeled with the word ‘fruit,' including variations such as ‘fruity,' ‘fruit-a-licious,' or ‘fruit-blasted,'” FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg told reporters, also noting that sweetened cereal or gummies shaped like fruit are entirely permissible under the agency's new guidelines. “If it smells somewhat like fruit, or even if there's a cartoon strawberry or orange on the wrapper, that's sufficient at this point.” The FDA's new recommendations are expected to be followed up by other guidelines under which anything successfully chewed and swallowed can now be considered a vegetable.

Do your personal interests include outdoor activities, cooking and adventure? Do we have the perfect day trip for you! Not only is clam digging via kayak totally unique but you then get to kayak to shore and bask in your hard work over a fresh, hot cup of clam chowder made from the clams you dug up. Talk about cool. Want to know how to get in on this? Follow our two easy steps to having a clammin' good time below.
Step One: Kayaking & Clamming
Call ahead as clamming in PEI is dependent on the tides as you want to go at low tide so you can get to the best spots. Once you know the timing of the tides head to By-The-Sea-Kayaking and sign up for the kayak n' clamming adventure. From here you will get suited up in your waders and fitted to a kayak. The outfitter has everything you need including dry bags to keep your valuables in while you splash around on the kayak. From here you will launch your kayak and start paddling towards the middle of the Northumberland Strait. Eventually, the guide stops and gets out of the kayak into ankle deep water. Here is where the fun begins. In your bare feet walk around with your clamming gear and start looking. This experience is so exciting and relaxing as you wonder around the bay looking for signs that a clam lays below. When you get one, measure it to make sure it is fully grown and then toss it in your bag. Do this until you have enough clams to make clam chowder.

Step Two: Cooking, Cleaning & Clam Chowderin'
Kayak back to shore with your bag of clams. From here you boil a big pot of hot seawater and dump in the clams, to cook and clean them. Your goal is to remove as much sand as possible in this process. Once you have cooked them given them a good wash and open them up to remove the ‘beard' and put the clam meat into a bowl. Once you have shucked all your clams, give them another wash to make sure the sand has been removed to your best ability (or else your chowder will have a bit of crunch). Once you are done that, dice up one cup of carrots, celery sticks, minced onion and two cups of potatoes. Throw all your veggies into a pot, add 3/4 cup of butter, 1 quart of half-and-half, a dash of salt, a splash of red wine vinegar and ground pepper to taste. Now go and grab your clams and mince them. Throw it all together and cook till it is hot and enjoy!

Temer government claimed a victory as deforestation rate declines slightly, but green groups said announcement was no cause for celebration
By Fabiano Maisonnave in Manaus
The Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 sq km of forest between August 2016 and July 2017, an area about twice the City of London.
This week, president Michel Temer's administration said the 16% reduction from the previous period was a victory against illegal clearing. But environmental groups cautioned against such optimism and criticised the government for stripping protections from forests to aid farmers.
The figure, calculated by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has been used for a range of environmental policies. It is also the base to calculate the level of Norwegian aid to fight deforestation in the Amazon – if the rate increases, the funding dwindles.
In a press conference held on Tuesday, environment minister José Sarney Filho said the reduction showed Brazil had regained control over deforestation in the Amazon as a result of more effective enforcement of the law.
“When people who do illegal deforestation know that the Brazilian state is present, they reduce their activities. This is what's happening”, said Sarney Filho.
The minister also defended the federal government's record from heavy criticism by environmentalists. They said the government abandoned the idea of opening a 46,450 sq km area in the Amazon for mining and refused to grant an environmental license to build a big hydroelectric dam in the Tapajós river.
But in the long term, Sarney Filho warned the state could not combat deforestation only through enforcement measures. There are about 25 million people living in the Amazon under strict environmental laws. The best option, they argued, is to promote environmental forest services that bring profit through conservation, such as the UN's REDD+ carbon credit programme.
The reduction in the deforestation rate came as a relief for Temer, who came to office last year after the controversial impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, faces several corruption charges and has an approval rate as low as 3%.
In order to avoid the same fate as their predecessor, Temer made an alliance in Congress with the powerful “beef caucus”, which according to investigative journalism website Agência Pública controls 207 out of 513 lawmakers in the lower chamber. Ultimately, it's this alliance that keeps them in office. But it has come at a price.
Among other measures, Temer signed a generous legislation to regularise more illegal claims, froze indigenous lands demarcations and has tried to reduce conservation units in order to legalize land-grabbers. As recently as this week, facing a new vote in Congress that could end Temer's rule, the government relaxed the definition of slave labor, an old demand of the beef caucus.
Brazilian environmentalists showed little, if any, enthusiasm at the lower deforestation rate. They argued the reduction was not enough after a 29% increase in 2016 and said the negative effects of many Temer policy decisions were still to be felt.
NGO Observatorio do Clima published a list of ten reasons of why the announcement should not be celebrated. Besides the government's embrace of the beef caucus agenda, it mentions this year's long drought, with a record of 106,000 forest fires in September alone, as well as a lack of policies beyond enforcement, as the Sarney Filho themselves admitted.
“The 2017 Brazilian Amazon deforestation rate released by the federal government is still alarming. We lost 6,624 sq km, despite the fact that there is already nearly 100,000 sq km of pastureland under-utilised in the Amazon,” said Paulo Barreto, a researcher with NGO Imazon, which has a parallel deforestation monitoring that had already forecast the slowdown of the deforestation. “The burning of this area released greenhouses gases equivalent to 2.3 times all the 49 million cars in Brazil during a year.”
“The drop is likely to be the result of some restoration of enforcement efforts by the government, but also due to the reduction of cattle prices associated with the Brazilian recession. Several studies have shown that the cattle price is a good predictor of the deforestation rate since pastureland occupies nearly 65% of the cleared areas,” said Barreto.
According to the researcher, the government's July decision to pardon grileiros, or land-grabbers, “sends a clear signal to grileiros and environmental criminals: Keep deforesting illegally. Politicians will pardon you.”
Compounding the grim picture painted by environmentalists, on Wednesday, researchers at the University of Vermont released a study that found mining operations were an alarming new driver of deforestation in Brazil. Mostly illegal, mines were responsible for 10% of Amazon rainforest deforestation between 2005 and 2015.
A Climate Home News investigation in September showed how diamond miners, with the aid of the Catholic church, had devastated one indigenous reserve.
Naughty Dog Creative director Neil Druckmann recently had a few things to say about Horizon Zero Dawn's visuals. Mainly, they stated that they're simply stunning and that Guerrilla Games has set the new "bar" that they want to top with The Last of Us: Part II.
Druckmann said this in a recent interview (below) with Hermen Hulst, managing director of Guerilla Games. Druckmann notes that while Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4 is beautiful, the sheer density of Horizon Zero Dawn's open world is impressive, to say the least.
“The graphics are staggering. I don't even think of it as graphics because I'm in the woods. I'm in this overgrown environment, and I'm like, “How are they getting so much foliage, such density in an open-world game” They said.
“You better believe I'm going to my team, and I'm saying like, “Okay. This is the bar now.”, they continued. “We have to top this.” It's awesome. We're super excited for you guys, we know how hard you worked on this game.”
It's nice to see healthy competition between allies.
Last night's Paul Wesley-directed episode re-introduced Bonnie as a vampire hunter hellbent on eradicating the entire planet of the blood suckers, which of course is very bad news for three of their closest (and marked) friends - Damon, Caroline, & Enzo. Next week's season finale sets all of our heroes on a collision course as they try to re-open The Armory before Bonnie can decapitate them. However, considering the evil entity lurking within the vault, re-opening the accursed building may unleash an evil worse than anything they've ever faced before and while it may set up the big bad for the upcoming eighth season, it's starting to looks like Damon might have to pay the ultimate price to save their loved ones. Check out the new extended promo for below:
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE — Despite their best efforts to help Bonnie (Kat Graham) through the harrowing predicament they now face, Damon (Ian Somerhalder), Enzo (Michael Malarkey) and Caroline (Candice King) realize their options are running out and drastic measures need to be taken. With their only chance of saving their friend lying inside the Armory, Stefan (Paul Wesley) breaks the news to Caroline that they may need help from an unlikely source – them and Alaric's twin daughters. Elsewhere, Enzo (Michael Malarkey) keeps Bonnie preoccupied by bringing them back to their cabin but when their plan takes an unexpected turn, it'll be up to Damon to make the ultimate sacrifice to save their closest friends. Zach Roerig also stars. Michael Allowitz directed the episode written by Brian Young (#722).
Get ready for more epic thrills and romance in the seventh season of The Vampire Diaries. After saying an emotional goodbye to Elena Gilbert, some characters will recover while others falter and Bonnie, in particular, will explore their new lease on life. As Damon and Stefan's mother, Lily (guest star Annie Wersching), tries to drive a wedge between the Salvatore brothers, hope remains that Stefan and Caroline's love story is tough enough to survive. Damon will do whatever it takes to take down their mother and their band of Heretics, and Enzo will struggle with where their loyalties lie. Plus, with Mystic Falls in disarray and the arrival of the Heretics — who are set on retaliation and mayhem — the suspense will be stronger than ever.

Freddy Adu is out.
Adu will not join Philadelphia Union when the club opens its preseason camp next week, Union manager John Hackworth said Thursday.
“Freddy is not coming into our preseason,” Hackworth said Thursday during an interview scheduled to air Friday on the KYW Philly Soccer Show. “He is not in our plans.”
Hackworth said they would provide more details during a news conference next week.
The pronouncement appears to put an end to Adu's tenure with the Union, who open training camp Monday in Wayne, Pa.
The club's highest paid player has recorded seven goals and two assists in 35 games since joining the club in August 2011. Originally tabbed to slot in as the club's key central playmaker, Adu proved second choice to Michael Farfan and spent most of their time playing on a wing. At season's end, they found themselves relegated to the bench, partially due to their play and partially due to internal team conflict.
Few expected Adu to return with the club in 2013, but the issue has lingered unanswered since the regular season ended in October. With a salary of $400,000 and a history of underproduction, Adu appears unlikely to have many teams interested in taking a chance on them at that salary.
What remains to be seen is just how Adu and the Union will part ways. The most logical move is to loan Adu out, sell them to another club overseas, or trade them within MLS, although it's unlikely the Union will find a willing partner without paying part of their contract. Should the Union release Adu outright, the team would likely be obligated to pay out their full contract, the full details of which are not known. The possibility also exists that Adu could sit out the season while contracted to the Union.
Should the Union clear their full salary, it would open up $400,000 within the team's salary budget, potentially allowing for the signing of new players.
Adu is the only designated player in the Union's three-year history.  They are 23 years old.
Description
To be honest, I have yet to see a solid Blue-Red deck that I like in Kaladesh. These two colors have the best access to energy and have solid uncommons/rares, but they just don't have the tools at common to make a solid aggro deck. This archetype will usually be more reactive, both because it doesn't have the aggro tools the other colors do and wanting more time to setup the energy payoffs. This deck will want 15-16 creatures and 7-8 spells, ideally those that benefit from energy payoffs. Since this combo has payoffs at higher rarities, you will usually fall into this archetype where you will be trying to construct gamestates where your rares can shine. A common mistake here will be trying to get into this color-combo without the big payoffs or not splahing for a 3rd color.
New Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has reportedly expressed concerns about the Italian team's 2015 project.
Recently, Italy's specialist Autosprint claimed wind tunnel figures of the project codenamed ‘666' showed that the 2015 car may be no better than the F14-T.
Now, the authoritative daily La Gazzetta dello Sport claims Marchionne, who recently took over from Luca di Montezemolo, reacted with alarm to the first concrete numbers emerging from the 2015 project.
And “Is it this year's car or next year's?” they reportedly asked when they were shown sketches.
The swords of Damocles have been falling all over Maranello in 2014, with Stefano Domenicali, Luca di Montezemolo, Luca Marmorini and now Fernando Alonso all departing.
There are claims chief designer Nikolas Tombazis could be the next, while a cloud has been over Pat Fry's job ever since James Allison assumed clear leadership in the technical realm.
When asked about the 2015 car rumours, Fry said in Brazil: “There's obviously a huge gap we need to catch up. I think things are progressing reasonably well.”
And on the Tombazis rumour, a Ferrari spokesperson told Spain's Marca sports daily: “Tombazis is chief designer at Ferrari today and there is nothing more to say.” (GMM)
Book of Nonsense by Lear, 1875.
Edward Lear: Travels of the “Nonsense Laureate”
The bespectacled limerick writer Edward Lear was terrified of both horses and dogs, disliked ships and loud noises, and lived with epilepsy and recurrent asthma. But throughout the mid-20th century, while they were winning fans both young and old for their nonsensical and comic verse and sketches, they also established themselves as a renowned topographical artist and writer, travelling and exploring the far corners of Egypt, Malta, India, and the Mediterranean.
In their book Travel: A Literary History, Peter Whitfield writes that the travelling Lear was “an eccentric, an oddity, and they knew it, representing no tradition of learning, no imperial or nationalist agenda, no viewpoint but their own.”
A Lear self-portrait.
When they were thirteen, Lear's bankrupt father disappeared into a debtors' prison, and the young artist spent their teenage years channeling a naturalist's precision into their sketches of parrots at the London Zoo, which they sold to support their family. At 23, with the publication of their book of ornithological lithographs and the sponsorship of the Earl of Derby, they declared it their life's calling to roam and record the landscapes of their surroundings.
Their zoological curiosity followed them through their travels as they filled countless journals and sketchbooks with their literary-topographical method, producing sketches, oil paintings, maps and lithographs, penning descriptions of the landscape that were both exacting and poetic.
One of Lear's lithographic prints of the Italian city of Melfi.
Lear lived in Italy for much of their adult life, and died in their villa there in 1888.
In the 1852 preface to their journals from a trip in Southern Italy, they write that they preferred a simple and low-cost rhythm of travel, “perform[ing] the whole tour on foot” and “depend[ing] entirely on introductions to some family in each town” for a place to sleep at night.
Two decades later, at 62 years old, Lear arrived in Bombay after a 27-day voyage from Naples. It was their first time to India, and would be the last expedition of their life. Their writing from the trip reflects their nature as a visual artist, with sensory details layered across the shadow of setting: “The texture of coco-nuttery is something quite unlike what can be seen except in this and other, extended tropical coast scenery; myriads of small, white flashes and as many myriads of deep, shady dots, caused by the light and shade of the great, innumerable palm fronds….Beyond the village all is green until it gradually becomes sandy to the sea-shore where the ancient pagoda stands in complete loneliness above the fretting waves.”
Lear's gravestone is in San Remo, Italy, and is inscribed with the following lines from their friend and admirer Lord Alfred Tennyson's poem “To E.L., On Their Travels in Greece:”
Tomohrit, Athos, all things fair,
With such a pencil, such a pen,
You shadow forth to distant men,
I read and felt that I was there.

Let's play BOM Bingo, and turn every heatwave into a media scare-fest
Despite the headlines, there was no paranormal extreme in Perth last week — just a game called heatwave bingo
Perth set a sort of record last week for four days in February above 40C. The BOM and media paraparazzi glorified the latest heatwave, chasing it like it was a celebrity Kendall-Jenner-type-event when it was not that different to the heatwaves we've had before. Before it came, there were headlines about how it was coming, there were minute-by-minute graphs of degrees C, stories of people cooking cupcakes in hot cars, and there were projections about hypothetical bigger, longer heatwaves that might come, maybe one day, someday: look out for “Temperatures into the fifties”!
Chris Gillham points out that this record was made at the Perth Metro station. Few seemed to mention that 9km away, at Perth Airport similar kinds of heatwaves were pretty common and things had been hotter and lasted longer in years gone by. This year the four day average at the airport was 42C but in 1956 there were 5 days at an average scorching 43.7. In 1933 there was a six day heatwave of 42C average in Perth city. And there were other heatwaves a lot like this a couple of weeks earlier, in January. But who cares about January when we can talk about the effect of climate change on February…
With Heatwave Bingo, every year's a winner
With bingo, someone has to win. Sooner or later one combo comes up. The secret with BOM Bingo is to have lots of bingo cards. The more combinations the better. Because heatwaves have no official definition, the meaning of the term can change each day. And there must be 400 flavours of 4, 5, 6 or 7 day heatwaves which are split by town, state, season or month. The cut off can be 35C, or days over 37C, 38C, 39C, or 40C. We are multicultural, we can do “100F” records too. Then there are so-called “Perth” heatwaves which apply to one site, one thermometer, and which may not exist at other sites in the same city. Some heatwave days the maximum temperature barely falls over the line, whatever the arbitrary temperature cutoff is this week, and maybe for only 20 minutes, but it counts in media inches, even if it doesn't count any meaningful scientific way.
The permutations and combinations go quite feral. If we felt like it we could also dig into the minima and mean records — was it the hottest summer night ever? (Not so, indeed the week before had the coldest February morning ever since 1935, — Thanks Warwick, Lance and Chris. Funnily, we didn't hear about that record on the news, though it did get one minor line near the bottom this article. Imagine if it had been the hottest February night…)
Heatwaves by averages versus the arbitrary cut-off kind
Instead of counting days over a line, we could look at the average maximum temperature during clusters of hot days — it's less arbitrary.
Which kind of heatwave is worse, one with four consecutive days with maxes above 40C, or the type with six consecutive days with an average maximum of 42C. The kind measured by averages may have a cool 34 degree day in the middle of a six day run of 43s (see Jan 1933)? What's worse — apparently, whichever one is occurring now.
For dozens of research scientists and investigative journalists, the 399 odd non-records each month get a non-mention. Those losing bingo cards go quietly back in the box til next year, when their lucky combo may come up.
Here's a graph of the worst 4-day average-maximum-heatwaves in Perth at the airport — (the data from before 1944 comes from the Perth CBD. See the footnote). Automatic electronic sensors were also installed in the last two decades, and they appear to artificially record higher temperatures. (See Bill Johnston's analysis of the introduction of the automatic system and Perth temperatures]. So despite all the urban warming effect, and the electronic sensors, the hottest and longest average max heat-waves were in 1933, 1956 and 1961. If climate change caused the second worst February heatwave in central Perth, did it also cause the overall number of average-max-heatwaves to fall?
No luck on the five day bingo this year:
Spot the trend? No prizes for anyone saying that heatwaves are getting cooler in Perth:
Graphs with help from Geoff Sherrington
From Chris Gillham:
A bit more re Perth's heatwave and supposedly most extreme summer ever … it's worth reading The West Australian 11 Feb 1933 for a wrap on the 1933 heatwave including its four consecutive 40+ days which Perth equalled this week.
As noted in the story, the 1933 heatwave was also six consecutive days in which the temp exceeded 100F (37.8C), which beat the previous record of five consecutive 100F days in December 1899.
Perth Metro 1994-2016 has never had five consecutive days above 37.8C, let alone six.
It's also worth comparing overnight minima in the first 11 days of 1933. They averaged 4.7C warmer than 2016 which is experiencing its most extreme summer in history at the peak of a supposedly large El Nino and with Indian Ocean SST above average.
The first 11 days of Feb 2016 included 9.9C, the coldest Feb night since 1935, and the first 11 days of 1933 included 29.3C, the hottest Feb night ever recorded in Perth (and 1.6C warmer than the hottest Feb night ever at Metro in 2004).
I've no idea how the Perth population is surviving this biblically extreme 2015/16 summer
There's also been a media buzz about The “most extreme summer” ever with seven 40+ days
Chris Gillham does the numbers and finds again that Perth Airport has had many summers with such a run and hotter averages.
It's correct that the seven 40+ days in the summer of 2015/16 beat the previous records of six 40+ summer days at Perth Metro and Regional Office since 1897. However, at Perth Airport there have also been seven days of 40+ this summer averaging 41.8C, and these can be compared with records since the airport site opened in 1945:
Seven 40+ days averaging 40.6C in 2010/11
Eight 40+ days averaging 41.7C in 2009/10
Eight 40+ days averaging 41.4C in 2006/07
Eight 40+ days averaging 41.5C in 1997/98
Seven 40+ days averaging 41.3C in 1995/96
Seven 40+ days averaging 42.6C in 1990/91
Seven 40+ days averaging 41.2C in 1983/84
Seven 40+ days averaging 41.0C in 1974/75
Ten 40+ days averaging 41.2C in 1961/62
Eight 40+ days averaging 42.5C in 1960/61
Eight 40+ days averaging 42.0C in 1955/56
Look at the long hot summer of 1962
From Lance Pidgeon some Bingo fun of a different kind – January 1962 was relentlessly above 30C. That month in 1962 there were only 5 days with maximums below 30C at Perth Metro. But in 2016 there were 11 of these ”cooler days” in Perth. [Is that climate change at work asks Jo?] 2016 had nearly twice as many days below 20C minimum as Jan 1962. (Wasn't the greenhouse effect supposed to make nights warmer?)
Perth Metro shows two 2016 days with a January minimum below 15 C. Perth Regional shows only one for 1962 . Maximums for January above 40 C are the other way around with two in 1962 and only one in 2016. 1962 had only 11 days below 20 Deg C minimum. 2016 had 20.b The highest minimum for January 1962 was 26.2, That is 0.6 warmer than 2016′s -25.6. Februrary 1 2016 may have set a new record for the lowest daily Feb minimum temperature at that site (Perth Metro). February 3 1962 holds the all-time the highest minimum daily temperature for any month that site (Perth regional). http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/104922120 Thanks to Chris Gillham, Geoff Sherrington, Lance Pidgeon, Phil, and well done to Andrew for getting a letter in The West.

Greece's left-wing government has suggested it will resign if it fails to get its way in Sunday's make-or-break referendum that could decide the country's financial future.
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said the government "may very well" quit, in a radio interview broadcast by Australia's ABC network on Thursday, in which they also said the country was "on a war footing" to ensure the rushed referendum happens in time.
Varoufakis also told Bloomberg TV in another interview on Thursday that they would not sign any deal with creditors without any reference to a restructuring of Greece's debt burden.
"I prefer to cut my arm off," they told Bloomberg TV, in an interview in which they also said they would personally resign if the "Yes" campaign won.
EU chief feels 'betrayed' over Greek debt talks
Varoufakis claimed Greece was being treated as a "debt colony" that didn't have any rights.
However, they expected a "No" vote and that they and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will be around on Monday "to forge a mutually beneficial agreement with rest of Europe".
Negotiations stall
Greece's international creditors have stepped back to watch the outcome of Sunday's referendum before resuming any negotiations.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe could "calmly" await the outcome of a referendum called by Tsipras for Sunday on bailout terms.
European officials and Greek opposition parties have been adamant that a "No" vote on Sunday will mean Greece will leave the euro and possibly even the EU.
The country defaulted on an IMF payment late on Tuesday (22:00GMT) that cut off Athens from vital bailout financing.
Prime Minister Tsipras, in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, urged Greeks to vote "No" to the austerity measures demanded by creditors in order to win a better deal, saying that the vote was not about staying in the eurozone.
Earlier, in a letter sent to the heads of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and European Central Bank, Tsipras said that Athens could accept their bailout offer if some conditions were changed.
Tsipras said in their public address that Greece would continue to negotiate with its international creditors and insisted that Athens wanted to stay in the eurozone.
In exchange for the conditional acceptance, they asked for a 29 billion euro ($32bn) loan to cover all its debt service payments due in the next two years. The conditions relate to pension reform, sales taxes, and reduced military spending.
Meanwhile, ordinary Greeks have been left in financial limbo after capital controls were imposed this week to stem a bank run. They have been reduced to 60 euros ($66) daily ATM withdrawal caps, adding hardship to lives already ground down by years of austerity.
Al Jazeera's Barnaby Phillips, reporting from Athens, said many pro-EU protesters put the blame for Greece's predicament on Tsipras.
"They say he's playing a dangerous position and putting their party's interests above their country," Phillips said.
The only thing missing from the Super Bowl Chrysler car ad was a picture of the president at the end saying, “I'm Barack Obama and I authorized this message.” The whacky conspiracy-theory-of-history crowd, and you know who you are, will have a field day with this. In case you were visiting another planet, the Chrysler spot (see below) featured the gravelly voice of none other than Dirty Harry a.k.a. Clint Eastwood as they walked in the dark foreboding shadows of some freeway underpass. “It's half-time in America…people are out of work and they're hurting,” they whisper. They add “Detroit knows something about this (but) now the Motor City is fighting back.” And before the two minute spot is over, the Clintster is miraculously reassuring everyone “Detroit is showing us it can be done” and “The world's gonna hear our engines roar.” It's a powerful spot, uplifting, and right out of the Obama re-election playbook. In fact the shouts of joy you heard on Sunday came from the White House. Which is why the conspiracy folks will step in with this: Since the president bailed out Chrysler, it is only fitting that the carmaker return the favor with this thinly disguised re-elect Obama car commercial seen by millions of folks. Never mind that Chrysler probably didn't have that in mind. The anti-Obama cabal will have none of that. So both the company and el presidente will be blasted for being in cahoots. But all is not rosy for the Obama team. This spot may play well in the Midwest where auto factories abound and citizens have a brain. But recall that over half of the rest of the country wanted GM and Chrysler to go in the tank. And they argue it was wrong for two presidents, Bush and Obama, to step in. So the fact that Detroit is leading the nation back to prosperity means less to those Americans. The bad news is, they won't be buying any Jeeps and won't be renting any Eastwood movies either.
Tim Skubick, host of "Off the Record" on WKAR-TV, is MLive.com's political columnist.
For the first time in their professional career, Jimmy Butler will suit up for a team that isn't the Bulls. Though he's reunited with Tom Thibodeau, the move from Chicago to Minnesota is a big one. On the latest Bill Simmons Podcast, they told the story of the day they were traded. It includes Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Gabrielle Union, and one bizarre game of spades.
"I was in Paris, the night that it happened," Butler begins. "We were playing some cards — me, Melo, Gab, D-Wade. I'm not going to talk about the outcome of the game because everybody has a different story, obviously."
Wait, everybody has a different story … about the card game?
"Some people say that I won. I would say that I won. The other team may say that I lost. I have to deal with it all the time. I'm just going to say it was a great game of spades. It was."
Then Butler got a phone call.
"And my agent called me, and they said, ‘Hey, I think you're about to get moved to Minnesota.' And I said, ‘OK, cool. I'm going to get back to my spades game.' Because I can't really control [a trade]. It's out of my control. I try to control what I can control. … And then they call me [again], ‘You just got traded to Minnesota.'"
Butler's reaction was a positive one from the jump.
"Right then and there I was like, ‘Hey, we've got some really good, young guys. I'm back with Thibs. Let's do what we always do. We're going to continue to get better every single summer, and we're going to go about it that same way. Just now I'm wearing different colors.'"
All offseason, rumors flew about what would happen to Jimmy Butler, but they aren't paying attention.
"There are always rumors. So it's kind of like, why really listen to it? Because it came up I was going to Boston. I was going to Cleveland. I was going to Minnesota. I was going here or going there. So it's kind of like, you know, they would ask me, ‘What do you think?' I don't know, I don't really pay attention to it. I hear it because I've got enough guys around me saying, ‘Did you see what came out today?' Well, ‘No, I don't read that. I've got better things to do with my time than sit there on the internet.'"
So he's with Wade at the time. Wade, now Butler's former teammate, sticks out on a Bulls team that seems to be entering a complete rebuild. Did the news affect Wade's Parisian vacation at all?
"D-Wade is a Hall of Famer. I think he's going to be just fine. … And he's going to go out there and compete. I'm not going to say the outcome of that competition, but he's going to go out there and try to help their team win."
What about Carmelo, who is currently embroiled in their own trade rumors? It was helpful having Melo there.
"Fortunately, I got to train with [Melo] a little bit, pick their brain. Because obviously they had been traded before. He's been through this whole process. It was new to me. It was shocking at first. But then it settled in, and it's like, it's a business. You can't act like you didn't know eventually that this was going to happen. I may not have known that it was going to happen that day, but let's be honest. I knew I wasn't going to be there."

Homs /Sweida, SANA – Three people were killed in the explosion of two landmines planted by ISIS terrorists on the road of Um Harteen al-Sharqiya village, 80 km east of Homs city.
SANA's reporter in Homs said on Sunday that two landmines planted by the ISIS terrorists on the road between Um Harteen al-Sharqiya and al-Masoudiyeh villages went off, killing three people who were on motorcycles.
In a new breach of the memorandum on de-escalation zones, eight people were injured when explosive devices planted by terrorists went off in the northwestern countryside of Sweida province.
A source at Sweida Police Command told SANA that three explosive devices were remotely detonated by terrorists on Sunday morning on the road of Majadel/Um al-Zaitoun in al-Lajat area while a microbus was passing by, injuring 8 of the passengers and causing material damage to the bus.
The source added that the injured were transported to the National Hospital to receive the required treatment, indicating that they sustained wounds of varying severity.
The engineering units dismantled two other explosive devices at the site weighing about 20 kg, according to the source.

The US Weekly Most Stylish New Yorkers party honored the celebrities who come to mind first when you think “style” and “New York”: Jamie Chung, Bethenny Frankel, former Bachelorette Andi Dorfman, a dozen other people who have appeared on television at least once, and Billy Bush. Us Weekly's publicists did not reveal how they determined that these New Yorkers were the most stylish (secret ballots tabulated by PricewaterhouseCoopers?), but they did let me know that I would only be able to speak to the honored guests on the press line outside the party, which was held at Vandal on Bowery. Once inside the event, the most stylish among us were not to be bothered under any circumstances for photos or interviews.
Frankie Grande and Rachel Smith.
Luckily, I got to meet so many fashionable city dwellers on the pink carpet on the sidewalk outside. I talked to Frankie Grande, the older half-brother of Ariana Grande, and Rachel Smith, a former Miss USA, about their web series Style Code. Rachel told me that I need to get a new phone. (It's cracked.) I talked to Katie Lee, formerly known as Katie Lee Joel, about life in the Hamptons. I did not talk to former Bachelorette Andi Dorfman about The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, or Bachelor in Paradise because their publicist told me, “Fashion questions only — no Bachelor.” Instead, I asked them about Fashion Week.
“I'm seeing a lot of tribal for, like, spring, which I love,” they said. “I'm not always great with color, but for some reason my eye is on the tribal.”
All of the stars' egos seemed boosted by the honor of being named most stylish and the fact of the pink carpet, and they talked at length about their lives and their projects, even if I didn't ask. After about an hour of this, the Housewives showed up.
Real Housewives of New York City's Carole Radziwill told me about their evolving relationship with fellow cast member Dorinda Medley. Bethenny Frankel, purveyor of Skinnygirl Margaritas and the most successful star on RHONY, did not want to talk to me at all.
When I asked them about Bitch Sesh, a popular podcast about the Housewives, they looked at me like I was mentally incompetent. “What happened? Bitch-something the podcast?” they snapped. “What is they saying? I don't know what you're saying.”
Then I asked them about the rumor that they worked with producers to prove Tom cheated on Luann this season (if you're not watching, I don't know what to tell you). “That would never, ever happen on the show. Ever,” they said. I laughed nervously for about 1 million years, and then their blonde, 24-year-old assistant whisked them inside.
Suddenly, I was interviewing the R&B singer Maxwell, because their publicist said, “I'd love for you to talk to Maxwell,” and Maxwell was in front of me. “What's your favorite restaurant in New York?” I asked him, because I had heard another person ask it earlier. They told me Wild, and then they changed their mind.
“Honestly, there's nothing like a good home-cooked meal by a beautiful woman that loves you and wants to nourish you with the food that they've made with love.”
Jessica Lowndes.
With that, I decided to move off the press line and into the party, where other stylish New Yorkers like former 90210-star Jessica Lowndes and four more Bachelor stars were drinking “Miss Demeanors,” the signature cocktail of the night. Lowndes, dressed in a sexy Charlie Chaplin outfit, chatted with Andi Dorfman at the bar, while Bethenny Frankel sat at a reserved table near the DJ.
Before I crossed the threshold into the wood-paneled basement lounge, Us Weekly's publicists reminded me once again that I was not allowed to talk to any celebrities inside. “That's fine,” I said.
Gina Rinehart rated 'more powerful' than Julia Gillard in Forbes list
Updated
Billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart is rated as more influential than Prime Minister Julia Gillard in a list of the world's most powerful women released by Forbes magazine.
With a fortune of $17 billion, iron ore mogul and would-be media tycoon Mrs Rinehart is the most powerful Australian woman on the annual list, coming in at number 16.
Ms Gillard was ranked 28th while Westpac chief executive officer Gail Kelly was 62nd.
German chancellor Angela Merkel topped the list for the third straight year, ahead of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff.

Image caption Lily Rice, 13, is the first European girl to perform a wheelchair backflip
A teenager from Pembrokeshire is thought to have become the first European female to perform a backflip in a wheelchair.
Lily Rice, 13, accomplished the feat in Cardiff after six hours of practicing.
Lily, from Tenby, has a condition called hereditary spastic paraplegia, which causes rigidity and tightness in the muscles of the lower body.
They now hope to take part in the Wheelchair Motocross Championship in California next year.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The 13-year-old perfected their backflip at RampWorld, Cardiff
Former Welsh Paralympic swimmer Lily is a WCMX athlete, performing tricks on specially adapted ramps usually used by BMX riders and skateboarders.
While Lily is thought to be the first European woman to complete a WCMX backflip, they are the second worldwide.
"I'd seen lots of people do it and it didn't look too hard, so I wanted to try it out," they said.
"So we found a foam pit and I just practiced it and practiced it and eventually got it in the foam pit.
"Then, I tried it onto [the] ramp and I landed it there."
They were given their first WCMX chair in February by the sport's current champion Aaron "Wheelz" Fotheringham, and has been practicing for the last seven months.
"I was a bit scared [at first] but I was more excited. I was fine with going down banks but I got a bit scared doing the quarters. But after I'd done it once, I was fine," they said.
Image caption Lily has only been a WCMX rider for seven months
The second-hand wheelchair was too small and heavy compared to newer models, so Lily crowdfunded money for a new one and secured a sponsor.
The wheelchairs have features like reinforced suspension to cope with the pressures of the sport.
Lily added that they hope to inspire other teenage girls to take up BMX riding and skateboarding.
The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that public schools may not impose religion on students, but some school administrators apparently don't care.
Earlier this week, the Rankin County (Miss.) School District was sued in federal court for sanctioning evangelism during three mandatory assemblies at Northwest Rankin High School in Flowood. Attorneys with the American Humanist Association (AHA) charge that Principal Charles Frazier and other school officials coerced students to attend events that featured a fundamentalist Christian video, proselytizing and prayer.
School officials are now claiming the events were student-sponsored, student-led and voluntary, but the facts seem to tell a different story.
According to the legal complaint, Frazier sent an email to all faculty on April 9 ordering them to send all members of the senior class to a school hall for the religious event.
Said the principal's message: “Sorry for the late notice. All seniors will need to report to the [Performing Arts Building] during Cougar Connection. They should report directly from the 5th block. Thanks.”
Hmmm. Doesn't sound too voluntary to me.
Even worse, students were not told the subject of the assembly. When some realized it was an inappropriate proselytizing event, they tried to leave but were prevented from doing so by a school truancy officer, as well as teachers and parents who were present for the preaching.
The message was hard-sell fundamentalist evangelism. The video featured four young men who struggled with personal problems but found a solution in conversion to Christianity.
When the video concluded, a student affiliated with the Pinelake Baptist Church told the assembled students that they must turn to Jesus Christ to find hope.
“We are here today to tell you where we find our hope,” the student said. “We find our hope in Jesus Christ…. Before Jesus came, innocent blood had to be shed for our sins. There had to be an animal that was sacrificed to atone for our sin. There had to be innocent blood. So Jesus came, and they were the innocent blood because they lived a perfect life.”
The student concluded with a prayer professing that salvation comes from calling on Jesus and that “we have redemption through their blood.”
The following day a similar assembly took place, and members of the junior class were required to go. Some students reportedly asked to read in the library instead, but they were forced by the truant officer to attend the religious event.
Even though AHA attorneys protested the activity on constitutional grounds, a third assembly was held April 22, and sophomores were required to attend.
School officials are now trying to depict their conduct as perfectly innocent. But attorneys say the conduct was far outside constitutional boundaries.
In a press statement, William Burgess, legal coordinator of the AHA's Appignani Humanist Legal Center, said, “It is clear that these assemblies are put on by the school itself. They were staged in a schoolroom, during the school day and the school sent an email to teachers telling them that students were required to attend.
“As the Supreme Court has made clear,” Burgess continued, “when a school sponsors an event, the religious speech of speakers, including students or other private parties, is attributable to the school and therefore subject to the Establishment Clause.”
Public schools are supposed to serve all children in the community. They come from families with many different viewpoints about religion, so it is imperative that school officials refrain from pushing a religious agenda.
Rankin County school officials appear to have failed their responsibilities in this case, and litigation is appropriate to set things right. Public schools are not revival tents, and if it takes a federal court case to make that clear, so be it.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and the legislature recently enacted a law intended to promote just the sort of conduct we see in Rankin County. A federal judge needs to send all of these elected officials and school administrators a stern message, and the M.B. v. Rankin County School District and Charles Frazier case is a good opportunity to do it.
The U.S. Constitution – including its church-state separation provision – still applies throughout our nation, even in the Magnolia State.
South Africa's second-largest supermarket chain tested bitcoin payments earlier this year – but it doesn't plan to roll out the option to its stores anytime soon, according to its CEO.
Pick n Pay, which operates in a number of African countries as well as South Africa, piloted a payment system in partnership with startups Electrum and Luno. That initiative was limited to a staff cafeteria, CEO Richard van Rensburg told BusinessDay in an interview, and is no longer active.
As for when the supermarket chain might expand the option to an actual storefront, van Rensburg demurred, pointing to a difficult regulatory environment as the root cause for hesitation.
They told the publication:
“We don't expect that in the near term accepting bitcoin will unlock any significant new business and we are unlikely to roll out the solution until the payments industry and regulatory authorities have established a framework for managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.”
That said, van Rensburg struck a positive note about the trial itself and the potential benefits to supermarket operators like Pick n Pay.
“We have proved to ourselves, though, that it is technically possible to roll out a solution very quickly,” they added.
News that Pick n Pay was even considering a bitcoin payment option spread earlier this week, leading to inaccurate reports that the supermarket chain was rolling out a fully-fledged payment option. The company confirmed to tech blog MyBroadband that that it wasn't accepting bitcoin at any of its stores.
Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Luno.

Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Wants Big Money Out of Politics But Gives Tons of Cash to Democrats
File this story under H for hypocritical hippies.
Ben Cohen is the “Ben” of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and anyone who has ever browsed the dairy aisle of their local supermarket knows it's one of the most expensive brands you can buy.
Cohen attended a left-wing political event in upstate New York last weekend and claimed they want big money out of politics. The Ithaca Voice reported:
Ben & Jerry's founder criticizes money in politics at GrassRoots 2015 A co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream attended the 2015 GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance this weekend to promote the Stamp Stampede, a campaign aimed at reducing the influence large corporations have on politicians and elections. “It's about the power of numbers of people over huge amounts of money,” said Ben Cohen. “Whatever you may care about … the reason why things are screwed up is because politicians are being paid large sums of money to pass laws that benefit those who already have so much at the expense of everyone else.” Cohen said their group is a part of a much larger effort with one primary goal: pass an amendment to say that corporations are not people and that money is not speech.
Ben and Jerry's even has a campaign called “Get the Dough out of Politics”
Yet according to public records obtained by IJ Review last year, Ben Cohen has made plenty of political donations and all of their money goes to Democrats:
Democrat Cash Cows Ben & Jerry Push to Silence Corporate Money A longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive politics, Cohen does not get to the important point and never addresses the fundamental question: why is money in politics in the first place? It would not be cynical to suggest that it is merely conservative-supporting dollars that they actually want to be omitted from the political process. Now here's for the double-scoop of hypocrisy: Both Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are active political campaign donors. Can you guess which political party they support?
These are just Ben's political donations from last year. Jerry gave plenty of money to Democrats too.
Ben and Jerry are now actively campaigning for socialist Bernie Sanders.
They also give money to Planned Parenthood.
Progressives: It's OK when WE do it.

Step 1. Open the science report and set your science goal to Monarchy.
Step 2. Set your science rate as high as it will go (60% in recent versions).
Step 3. Move your Explorer first so you get as much information as possible. Use your other Settlers to build two cities about 4 squares apart. Set each of them to build more Settlers. When you get close to completion of one of them, buy it. You need to grow *fast*.
Step 4. Meanwhile, use your Explorer to explore. By hand. Try to move outward in an expanding spiral. Enter all huts you find ASAP. If you lose your Explorer to barbarians, you'll just suffer a little more, but it's worth the risk.
Step 5. Whenever you build a new Settler, use it to build another city about 3-4 squares away from your growing empire. Then have that city build a Settler. Use any gold you pick up from huts to finish building Settlers.
Step 6. About 1-2 turns before you research Monarchy, stage a revolution. Even under Anarchy, you still pick up 1 light bulb per turn per city. Ideally you want to learn Monarchy right before the end of the revolution. If your revolution ends too soon, start another. Become a Monarchy. Monarchy is the best government form in the whole game for city growth, because you don't suffer the food penalty of Anarchy/Despotism, but your Settlers still use only 1 food per turn. Your people will now gorge themselves and breed like rabbits, especially near fish/game. Later you'll be irrigating, of course, which helps even more. Once you've learned Monarchy, your science goal is up to you. It depends on your style and/or situation. Try to pick up the Republic, Trade, Seafaring and/or Invention. Set your science rate to the maximum.
Step 7. Once you've got about 8-10 cities, you can turn your attention to Wonders. The Pyramids are the best wonder to start with, since they'll double your growth rate. If you get Trade, you can accelerate wonder building with Caravans. Build roads and irrigate a few spots.
Step 8. If you're on an island, or lost your Explorer, then you'll want to focus on naval technology early. Get Seafaring, and then Steam Engine within a reasonable time frame. Ironclads really ruin the AI's day early in the game. Seafaring builds from Mapmaking, so you'll have Triremes for exploration and possibly transport. It also allows Harbors (more food = more growth = more power) and a replacement Explorer or two. Put one of your explorers on the nearest arctic spot and let them walk around the world, picking up any huts. You want to do this early, though, since the AI will build cities in the arctic zones, and your explorer could be endangered.
Step 9. If you're on a continent with AI opponents, then you'll need to eliminate it/them. This demands a rather different early strategy (and is much more difficult, since this is where the AI does its best work). Shift your trade balance away from science and toward gold. Build diplomats and your best defensive units, and some good offensive units. If your enemies have lots of coastal cities, you can pound them with ironclads. Even if you don't ferry land units over to occupy the enemy cities once you've killed all the inhabitants with ironclads, the AI will still panic, and build more defenders in the city, which you can continue to kill off. (Of course, only attack if you easily win the battles, and never with a damaged ship. The idea here is that you lose nothing; withdraw damaged ships to your nearest city so they can repair themselves faster and then kill more enemies.) If you have to fight overland, then draw the enemy out. Fortify defensive units on mountains, hills and forest, to hold the AI at bay, and to provide cover for your offensive units. Pick off any enemy units that offer themselves (exposed catapults, etc.). Buy a few enemy cities with diplomats. Don't rush. Once you control your continent, you've basically won the game; the next 3 steps are just mop-up.
Step 10. Don't forget to keep growing, although you can slow down after a dozen cities or so (depending on how crowded the map is). Expand onto nearby islands, including arctic outposts. Shift to Republic once there's no danger of enemies conquering you overland and you've got temples in your larger cities. Let your people have some luxuries, and build trade routes. Build up a treasury. Stockpile a few diplomats; they have no upkeep.
Step 11. Focus on naval technologies. Get Amphibious Combat, and build some (veteran) marines. Build good (veteran) combat ships and some decent transport ships. Build Leonardo's Workshop early, so your units will be upgraded for you. Don't learn automobile. You can learn *rocketry* without automobile. Build Magellan's, and if the lighthouse is still available, build that. Don't be the first to learn Magnetism if you've got the lighthouse. Your attack fleet will now consist of one transport, at least one marine, and as many warships as you like. (By now, cruisers are probably best, so work toward them; settle for destroyers as long as they'll work.) Use your warships to empty an enemy city you'd like to own, then move your transport next to it, and unload one marine who can walk straight into the city and take over. Then move the transport and at least one warship in (even if it's wounded). On the next turn, sentry the marine, which puts them on the transport for free. Use your warships to empty another nearby city, then move the transport over and let the marine (the same one!) conquer this city. Your warship is defending the one you just took while it repairs itself. At this point, the AI won't retaliate, though, since it's now scared to death and is trying to put more defensive units into its cities. Which you're about to take. When you feel ready to move your occupying warships out, you can let the occupied cities build defensive units of their own to take over that duty. But you won't need them for long; if you take over that continent/island soon enough, you can leave the cities undefended. Whenever you see an AI ship, sink it, especially if it's carrying something (has a '+'). If you rule the seas, the AI can't get anywhere near your undefended cities on your home continent. You won't be letting the AI survive long enough to pick up flight.
Deus Ex: Human Revolution was about the world changing. Whether those changes were for the better or the worse was up to players; in the last moments of the game, protagonist Adam Jensen--a man made half-machine after a fatal encounter that should have killed him--was handed power over humanity's fate. Jensen's final choice, made by the player, could either warn humanity of augmentation's dangers moving forward or offer them a partial version of the truth. Alternatively, Jensen could place blame in such a way that augmentation and technological resource will flourish as humanity turns on its opponents in anger.
But there was one more ending. By doing nothing--choosing none of the above--Jensen would activate the self-destruction of Panchaea, the island home of the world's most ambitious geo-engineering projects. By destroying Panchaea and everyone on it at the time, Jensen makes a statement that it isn't up to one person or group to decide the world's fate; it's humanity's own choice to make.
It is this final choice that developer Eidos Montreal has chosen to use as the base for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the sequel to Human Revolution. But in making this one ending canon, some fans of the series say it ruins the poignancy of the choices they made in Human Revolution. But according to Deus Ex executive art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletete, the path chosen for Mankind Divided includes elements of all possible endings. In wrecking Panchaea, you do many things--expose the truth, but not all of it, and allow humanity a chance to decipher the meaning of these things for themselves.
"We kind of went into that quite naturally, really, because we looked at what the Panchaea incident was and tried to evaluate how much of a shock wave it would've given the world, and how the world react to such a danger, or such an event," they explained. "Like what they say, it's like a shock treatment. That's what 9/11 was. That's what Pearl Harbor was. A global shock treatment. Its like people get literally in a state of shock, and that's when people make really rash decisions. That's when all sorts of control laws are installed, and that's usually when the state of the world changes quite a bit.
"We can analyze the Panchaea incident as being that, and it gave us leeway to have a very, very different state of affairs, a different state of the world while being in the exact same universe and explore different themes within that," they added. "That was definitely one of the reasons [we chose that ending] at a very high level. You have a little bit of all different endings in the canon ending we chose, because at the end of the day, you can still change the truth."
In moving from Human Revolution to Mankind Divided, the baroque influence on the series' art style has all but faded away. The artistic design hasn't changed much, Jacques-Belletete notes, but the clutter and congestion of Human Revolution has paved the way for how things look in this next game. This time around, however, players will be able to traverse more territory, working their way through huge vertical structures and rummaging through the flotsam and jetsam of a rapidly evolving world.
"Human Revolution was all about clutter and an orgy of details," Jacques-Belletete explained. "We made up like 100 brands, fake brands with the stickers everywhere and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty much unheard of at the time [in games]. With Mankind Divided, we have the true power now to do that vision that we had. Before it was the first stepping-stone to that vision, and now we can really achieve it. There's nothing new to it in terms of the high-level aesthetic goals and the amount of detail, but we looked at our sandbox and the tools that we had and now we're like, holy shit, we can really do what we've always wanted to do."
But what about all that black and gold? The colors are still present in Mankind Divided, but not as prominent. Some areas have taken on a bluish color wash, or have piled on shades of slate gray.
"The black and gold had to do with the baroque style, the transhumanist side of the debate," Jacques-Belletete said. "It was a whole cyber renaissance thing, the renaissance analogy to augmentations and transhumanism and all that stuff. Gold also represented the sun for the whole Icarus myth parallels. But now because the world has made a kind of 180-degree turns, augmentations are seen as something dangerous now. The world has moved to more of what we call corporate feudalism. That's the norm in the world and Mankind Divided. Corporations are taking over it.
"[Mankind Divided] is all based on the brutalism, the brutalist architecture movement, which has to do a lot with crude concrete, crude materials, harsh plain angles. It looks like fortifications. It's almost like we've gone back to the Dark Ages of the medieval era, before the Renaissance. Because of that, the palette is a lot more desaturated. There's a lot more blue. Whenever you have this kind of apartheid, or you have this kind of control over everybody, this is when you have the blues, this is when you have the desaturation, and this is when you have that gloominess. And when you go to the areas that are a bit more controlled by the augmented people, like in the ghetto, this is when the gold comes back, almost as if they're bringing their own little candles. It's all an analogy. It was really just with the story it made sense to have less of it."
In terms of designing the people of the Deus Ex world, Jacques-Belletete said that games have in a way moved past the uncanny valley of last generation, thanks to the latest consoles and technology. Without the uncanny valley to lean on, however, designing augmentations for Mankind Divided is a little trickier. You want people to seem creepy and unnatural, they said, but the powerful technology available to developers helps them really render their humanity--literally. That's why this time around players will see more characters walking around with robotic arms, facial implants, the works. Although there is a line between cool and stupid, Jacques-Belletete noted.
"I had that arm that went like a jackhammer, that was a crossed line right there," they said. "Yet they did it in the Avengers, right? I remember when I saw that, I was like, it doesn't look that stupid. Anyway, comics and film are two different moods, ambiance, and tones. Deus Ex is a very serious game. It takes itself very seriously. The humor is almost only in sarcasm that Adam has. They have a bit of sarcasm, but he's very stoic. You have to consider all this.
"We talk with a lot of real biologists and people that [work with] biotechnologies and augmentations and stuff like that," they added. "Because we work so closely with these things, it helps us make sure that it's credible and that it doesn't cross a certain line. But we've got to keep in mind that it's a game as well, so we have things like the gun arms now. It's a little more out there than Human Revolution, but I think it's still within the boundaries of that flavor we're always trying to keep."
In conversations with colleagues and on forums, I've seen a lot of comparisons between Mankind Divided's story as seen in the trailers and the basic plot of some X-Men stories. When asked about these comparisons, Jacques-Belletete said both stories share the same core idea of segregation.
"People are afraid of people who are different than them. They're afraid," they said. "I guess the through line is that. It's all about segregation. When you're afraid of someone that's not like you, you have a tendency to push away, racism, discrimination, all that stuff. I think that's what they have in common and, yeah, people are totally right. We knew it right from the beginning, it was even part of our references when we started.
"I think it's really just duality between what being a human being is and what the limitations are, and is it okay to modify these limitations," they continued, focusing on Deus Ex's central ideas on human augmentation. "Should we do it or not? What is the meaning? What kind of questions and moral stuff does it bring to the table?"
But in the grand scheme of things, the big connection between players and the story of Deus Ex is Adam Jensen. There is, however, one big thing separating Jensen from the players who control him: their lack of full humanity. Jensen is less man than they are machine, and with Eidos describing them in Mankind Divided as "man 2.0" and the gameplay footage we've seen so far, it feels as though the bits that make them human are receding. In recent demos, we see Jensen arguing with another augmented man, trying to wheedle the truth from them and ultimately save him. Human Revolution saw them as a blank canvas in which players could impress their moral choices, but this time around, with so much changes to the world and their body and their status as a double agent between the game's two warring factions, players will struggle to make the best choices in the moment.
"I think Adam is really a vessel. The game is a vessel for that, but Adam even more so because we never wanted Adam to be pro- or anti- whatever, that at the end of the debate, the transhuman debate, he's just kind of there," Jacques-Belletete said. "I think that's what makes them stand apart from the other [heroes] is that as you play them and as you experience the world, it really makes you ponder about all this stuff.
"Eidos Montreal still receives tons of letters and emails from people that are like, 'Oh my God. I'm going to go study this. I'm going to study that. This is what I want to do with my life.' I've heard from people that are scared shitless. It's like, 'No, no, no. These things are not going to happen.' But it also seems very plausible that it can go into that direction."
Jensen's story has had a genuine positive impact on players, Jacques-Belletete said.
"Some people with disabilities write to us saying, 'It's given me a positive view on my situation and what things could do.' Some people with disabilities wrote us that they were finishing high school and want to study biology or biotechnology. Adam is, for me at least, one of the strongest characters, and it really makes you think about an issue and what it means to be either on one side or the other of that issue.
"It was like that in Human Revolution, and we're just continuing that with Mankind Divided," they added. "Now with Mankind Divided, it's this: what happens with people that are now either against that new thing or afraid of it? It's the same polarization but with a new kind of stone thrown in the water."
Real Madrid Danilo's departure would give youngster an opportunity
Though they have options to move elsewhere before the start of the 2017/18 campaign, Achraf Hakimi may well be a Real Madrid first-team player if they can convince Zinedine Zidane during pre-season.
The pursuit of Danilo by Chelsea would open up an opportunity in defence should the move conclude successfully.
Achraf in action
Arra, as they are known in La Fabrica, was, in principle, given the green light to go on-loan elsewhere, as happened with players like Vallejo or Marcos Llorente last season.
In fact, of all the interested clubs, Alaves - the destination of Enzo Zidane and Burgui - is the one that was in pole position.
If Danilo ends up staying, which appears extremely unlikely, or Achraf doesn't reach the level required, the door to Alaves will remain open.
At 18, the youngster is already a Moroccan international, a team they have always wanted to defend because of their ancestry, even though they were born in Getafe.
The Declining Importance of Race and Gender in the Labor Market: The Role of Employment Discrimination Policies
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act sought to promote equality of opportunity by making employment discrimination illegal. Over the five decades since passage of the act, federal policy has directed considerable resources to its implementation. Yet wage differentials still prevail among racial and ethnic groups and between women and men. Advocacy groups and the media frequently point to these statistical wage gaps as evidence of discrimination and the need for new and more stringent legislation.
However, as economists June and Dave O'Neill argue in The Declining Importance of Race and Gender in the Labor Market (AEI Press), conventional wisdom regarding the scope of employment discrimination is badly misguided. Through empirical analysis, the authors find that the wage gaps invoked to support new antidiscrimination policies can be largely attributed to differences in work-related skills—not labor-market discrimination. Moreover, analysis of historical data reveals that race- and gender-based wage differentials have declined over the years, mainly due to the individual initiatives of women and minorities that increased their productivity and narrowed skill gaps. Notably, the black-white wage gap declined as much between 1940 and 1960—a period with almost no federal antidiscrimination policies—as it did between 1960 and 1980, an era marked by the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the expansion of federal policies.
The O'Neills also examine the two federal agencies tasked with enforcing antidiscrimination policy, raising questions about the effectiveness of their policies, particularly those that equate lack of proportional representation of minorities and women in an employer's work force with discrimination. The authors highlight the irony of these agencies: the implementation of racial and gender preferences in hiring and promotion were specifically prohibited by Title VII. A review of civil rights litigation suggests that the courts have followed a similar line of thought, although a few recent cases suggest some rethinking of these issues.
The Declining Importance of Race and Gender in the Labor Market provides historical background and solid empirical analysis of a highly important and emotionally charged issue. It should play an important role in deliberation over the future direction of civil rights policy.
Advance Praise:
“June and Dave O'Neill have written an important book on the history of racial and gender differences in jobs and pay, the legal efforts to reduce these gaps, and why the labor market gaps due to discrimination have greatly declined over time. Their conclusions about the ineffectiveness of various federal laws to reduce discrimination and on the decline in labor market discrimination will be controversial, but the authors back up their claims with detailed and thorough analysis. Required reading for anyone who wants to learn much more about the reasons behind the remaining earnings and employment gaps between men and women, and between African American and Hispanic men compared to white men.”
–Gary S. Becker, University Professor of Economics and Sociology, University of Chicago; Recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, 1992
“June and Dave O'Neill have written the modern Bible on the role of race and gender in labor markets. Their historical narrative and their statistical evidence gives strong support to the conclusion that the greatest surge for the advancement of African-Africans and women in the labor markets occurred before the onset of the Civil Rights laws. The one finding, meticulously documented, calls into question the continued usefulness of an elaborate civil rights enforcement program that may well be highly counterproductive as this nation seeks to revive its lagging labor markets.”
–Richard Epstein, Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law, New York University
“Occasionally a book instantly alters the terms of debate. The Declining Importance of Race and Gender in the Labor Market should become one of them. Comprehensive, meticulously empirical and dispassionate, it brings together in one place all the many pieces of the puzzle. It will inevitably attract controversy because the issues themselves are so fraught with emotion. But when the reality that the O'Neills document — a great American success story — is eventually accepted (as it must be), we will be freed to concentrate on the real sources of the remaining disparities in the labor market. Ultimately, I hope this wonderful book helps us return to our ancient national aspiration: that we Americans are to treat all of our fellow citizens as individuals, not members of groups.”
–Charles Murray, W.H. Brady Scholar at AEI
June O'Neill is the Wollman Distinguished Professor of Economics at Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), and a professor at the CUNY Graduate from Center. O'Neill is also an adjunct scholar at AEI.

Ed asked this morning if any “preparations” have been made for that meeting of the minds Obama's planning with Chavez. Given this bombshell, a better question might be just how long The One's been “preparing.”
[E]ven before winning the November 4 election, Obama unofficially used what experts call “track two” discussions to approach America's two foes in the region. Nuclear non-proliferation experts had several “very, very high-level” contacts in the last few months with Iranian leaders, said Jeffrey Boutwell, executive director for the US branch of the Pugwash group, an international organization of scientists which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. Former defense secretary William Perry, who served in Obama's election campaign, participated in some of these meetings focused on “a wide range of issues that separate Iran from the West: not only their nuclear program but the Middle East peace process, Persian Gulf issues,” Boutwell told AFP. The Pugwash official declined to name the other participants, except to say they had considerable clout.
Omri Ceren's righteously outraged that Obama would undermine Bush by meddling in foreign policy, particularly during a campaign when they stood to benefit personally from the results. Fair enough; watch the short clip below from early January to see just how egregious The One's hypocrisy here is. I'm not so sure, though, that talking to either country had the effect of undermining anything. In the case of Iranian nukes, they've been jerking the west around for years to buy time. How do you “undermine” that? It's a transparent farce, neatly illustrated by the fact that even the guy in charge of keeping the bomb out of their hands can't get their story straight about how long it'll take them to build one. As for Syria, Omri notes that Assad's willingness to chat with Israel sure did seem to Change after they met with emissaries from Hope, the implication being that Obama's advisors might have promised them better concessions if they held out until The One was in office. Would Assad really need to be formally told that a Democrat would go softer on them than John McCain would, though? Every enemy regime had an incentive last year to hold out on Bush in hopes of a better deal from Obama. As stupid as Assad is, he's not so stupid that they couldn't figure that out.

V malé vesnici Kargyak v srdci indického Himálaje existuje škola, která se na první pohled liší od všech ostatních v okolí. Je energeticky nezávislá, využívá sluneční energii a je vystavěná pouze z lokálních obnovitelných zdrojů. Před deseti lety ji tu začal stavět Honza Tilinger.
Jak vznikl nápad postavit českou školu v Himálaji?
Vždycky jsem rád cestoval. K osmnáctým narozeninám jsem chtěl lístek do Anglie a jen co jsem tam dojel, tak jsem si vyčítal zbytečně vynaložených peněz, jelikož bych se tam dostal i stopem. Po létech na cestách mi došlo, že hledám další rozměr. V jednadvaceti jsem s kámoškou z Německa odjel učit angličtinu do tehdy nově otevřeného Laosu. Opravoval jsem střechy domorodcům v Súdánu a také se zapojil do aktivit různých nevládek, které pomáhaly po tsunami na Srí Lance. Tam mi došlo, že pokud pomáhat, tak aby to mělo smysl, nemůže to být velký kolos. Tak jsem si vymezil, že nejlepší bude pomáhat tam, kde to jiné organizace vzdají. Do Kargyaku se dostává velmi obtížně, několik dní v jeepu a pět dní pěšky. Tam můj projekt přinesl změnu, přinesl vzdělání dříve než Colu, mobilní signál nebo 230 V. A jako stavař jsem mohl aplikovat své stavební vzdělání a znalost místních technik a materiálů.
Jaká je tedy historie školy?
V roce 2006 jsem poprvé navštívil Kargyak a strávil měsíce seznamováním se s dalšími podobnými projekty ve státě Džammú a Kašmír. O rok později jsme po zamrzlé řece tahali kmeny, které jsem koupil za své poslední peníze a dumal, jak to celé zvládneme. V létě jsme pak s řadou dobrovolníků udělali zemní práce a začali vyrábět cihly. I když škola ještě nestála, najal jsem z nedaleké vesnice dvě učitelky, aby už začaly s výukou – ta je přeci podstatná. V roce 2008 jsme měli super stěstí na nepálské mistry, siláky z Shimly a kameníky z Dharamsaly a samozřejme absolutní dream team Čechů a náhodných dobrovolníků z celého světa. Školu jsme slavnostně otevřeli 21. září 2008 a od té doby si tam nepřetržitě podávali dveře evropští učitelé, vždy po čtyřech měsících. V posledních letech jezdí dobrovolníci spíše na léto a motivujeme místní, aby sami měli kontrolu nad provozem této školy. Aby ji sami udržovali v nejlepší formě.
Čím je škola specifická?
Málokterý Čech ví, že v srdci indického Himálaje je nejvýše položená česká stavba, která je zároveň nejvýše celoročně provozovanou školou na světě. (Leží v nadmořské výšce 4 200 m n. m., pozn. red.) Stavba je vybudována z místních materiálů za pomoci místních technologií a je vytápěná samotížnou cirkulací Sluncem ohřátého vzduchu. Stavba se za dobu své existence stala ikonou oblasti a předlohou pro řadu dalších škol v údolí. Jsem přesvědčen, že pokud se má dělat rozvojová pomoc, tak tímto způsobem. Uchopit, co místní umí, poznat jejich tradice a s respektem a pokorou je přetavit do moderní stavby. Jen tak mohou místní lidé pochopit, jak se to staví, opravuje a provozuje a sami tu stavbu pak mohou replikovat, což je pro mě jako architekta největší uznání.
Jaké jsou největší výzvy spojené s jejím provozováním?
Ufinancovat to. Byť už se daří na většinu roku zapojit státní učitele, tak v období od konce října do začátku března jsou v tomto státě školní prázdniny. Škola vznikla hlavně proto, aby se mohlo učit i v zimě. Tyto čtyři měsíce jsou ve vymrzlých domácnostech prosycených štiplavým dýmem z jačího trusu pro děti strašně náročné. Dětičky se každý den ženou do školy, jen co mají hotové povinnosti doma a budí učitele, že chtejí do vyhřáté čisté školy. Naopak v létě, když probíhá normální školní rok, by se děti měly podílet na řadě jiných činností. Na jaře se čistí zavlažovací kanálky, stěhují se stáda, opravují se domy, pak někteří provází karavany nejen turistů, ale i zásobování, na podzim sklizeň, sbírání sena na zimu a stříhání jaků. Pak jsou samozřejmě pro životy místních důležité buddhistické rituály, svatby i pohřby, a to vše jsou činnosti, o kterých jsem přesvědčen, že by děti neměly minout. Takže se dělají prázdniny nepravidelně v průběhu roku v závislosti na těchto činnostech.
Dají se srovnat české a indické děti?
Jasně, všechny děti mají rádi nové věci. Rády se smějí. Mají rády překvapení a když je jim ouvej, tak se o sebe hezky starají. Akorát nutno říci, že ty nové věci pro Himalájčata jsou třeba povídání učitele, knížka či hračka. Mají své hry s kamínky (či jačím trusem), hrají si na koně a jaky – zakousnou se do provazu a přetahují se. A starají se o sebe navzájem tak, že už šestileté dítě vede dva kilometry do školy mladšího brášku a rodiče vědí, že je to OK. Teď třeba bobují na zamrzlém potoce.
Jaký máš ty osobně vztah k Indii? Proč to celé vůbec děláš?
Mám rád krásná místa a lidi. Rád budu dělat podobné projekty dál i jinde na světě, tady jsem si byl jist tím, že tu školu nebude lehké postavit, a pokud se to podaří, bude to super přínos pro místní. Tady nejde jenom o pomoc lidem bez vzdělání. Věřím, že pokud se budou mít lidé v takovýchto perifériích světa dobře, budou si vážit vlastní unikátnosti ve světě. Pochopí, že jejich způsob života je třeba jiný, ale úplně v pořádku. Že stavební materiály, které mají, fungují, jídlo, které jedí, jim pomáhá a nebudou pak migrovat do měst za iPhony, McDonaldy a třemi pruhy na tričku. V neposlední řadě to dělám proto, protože mi dělá radost dělat projekty kvalitně, ve spolupráci s místními, baví mě aplikovat v praxi vědu. Fakt, že místní stavbu replikují a domluví se třemi jazyky dokazuje, že to funguje.

On their morning routine:
I don't get dressed and take a bath until lunchtime because I am doing a dirty job, painting with colors. So I wear my long nightshirt; it becomes kind of like a painter's smock, then it goes to the laundry. I have everything—sheets and nightshirt and robes—changed every day. I like everything to be washable, myself included.
On their bath products:
When I'm ready, I soak in the bathtub, if you really want to know. I used to have a product I loved, by Shu Uemura, but they don't make it anymore, so I found a French product that softens the water; it's a hundred years old. I put half a bottle in the bathtub.

On exercising:
I exercise very little because my doctor said it's not necessary. I did a lot when I was very young, and all you do when you're young stays.
On their "uniforms":
My latest uniform is actually two looks—a special jacket with tails made by Dior, but not what you wear for weddings. I have them made in tweed and things like this. Then I have another jacket I love from the new Dior men's collection that I bought five of, so people think I wear the same thing every day, but in fact it's never the same thing. And then I wear jeans; at the moment they are from my new collection. They are dark gray with my face, my profile, printed in black on them, but you really have to look at it to see it.

On what they will do with their old clothes:
I still have all my clothes from 10 years ago from Dior, but I think I will give them back to Dior for the museum. I have pieces that are unique pieces that I will never wear again, because life is different now, you know. I used to fax a lot, but people don't have faxes anymore.
On their two houses:
I actually have two houses. This house here, it's only for sleeping and sketching, and I have another house two-and-a-half meters away for lunch and dinner and to see people, and where the cook is and all that.
On how they work:
The way I sketch, the way I work, I prefer to do all my work in the evening or in the morning and during the weekend, and I send everything on the iPhone. I'm not there in the studio draping—I don't do those things. My work is very conceptual.
On Choupette:
Lately, I play with my cat, Choupette. The cat always stays home, and when I leave, the maid takes care of them The cat is like a very refined object; they don't go into the street, and they don't go to other places.  They are a spoiled princess.

Zoé de Las Cases and their husband, Benjamin Dewé, run a small interior design firm out of their apartment in Paris. The couple travels frequently to Japan and the U.S. for work, so a few years ago, they decided to make a little money while they were gone by renting their place out on Airbnb. Here's what it looks like:
When the design duo saw the extent to which their home had been replicated by Airbnb, they were immediately upset, Dewé said. Others began to notice as well.
But a year later, something strange happened. A friend who was familiar with the couple's Paris apartment congratulated them on their collaboration with Airbnb in San Francisco. They sent them pictures from a space in the company's headquarters designed to look just like their apartment. The problem was, Dewé and de Las Cases knew nothing about it.
In 2012, the couple say, Airbnb contacted them and asked if they could host a Paris office launch party in their home. The couple happily obliged. "We said great, we're designers," Dewé told BuzzFeed News. "We already used to rent our place for commercials." The party was a success.
"They are branding their company with our life," Dewé said. "We decided to go directly to the lawyer."
Airbnb has been very public about the fact that conference rooms and office spaces in its San Francisco headquarters are modeled off of popular listings on the site. One of the main spaces for meetings is based off of the apartment where CEO Brian Chesky lived when they founded the company. But it's now unclear whether the company asked permission from those hosts to copy their homes — or whether the hosts even knew that their personal spaces were becoming part of a global brand. (Airbnb declined to comment on this story.)
It's hard to tell what kind of chances the couple has with their suit. The couple's lawyer, Carole Soudri, told BuzzFeed News that there will be a hearing in Paris in December in which the company "will try to send the case to the California court," where it's based. They told de Las Cases and Dewé that the case could take five, eight, or even ten years to reach a conclusion.
"She said it will be hard to win, because they're not French," said Dewé. "They're big. And they have money to lose." Dewé said they were hoping they could reach a settlement with Airbnb, but so far that hasn't happened.
Copyright experts say it's unlikely that a case like this would fly in the United States; Lila Bailey, a San Francisco copyright attorney, said it would be a "non-starter." The legal code includes specific language about what types of works can be copyrighted — books, films, paintings, even boat hulls. "It's an explicit list," Bailey told BuzzFeed News. "But interior design is not on the list."
In France, though, it's a different story; anything that is an original work can be covered by copyright, "even a tool, or even toilets," according to Soudri. "It must be a reflection of the personality of its author," they said. "This is exactly the case here. Zoe's showroom and apartment is the true reflection of their personality." It is for this reason, Soudri posits, that Airbnb doesn't want the case tried in France.
There is, however, a legal concept called "trade dress" that could apply to de Las Cases' case in both France and the U.S. Trade dress is the idea that a company can own the branding of a corporate space. For example, if de Las Cases could prove that the branding of their space, as an interior designer, is as valuable to their business as, say, the replicated look and feel of an individual McDonald's franchise is to the larger corporation, they could have a case. Soudri said she's considering trade dress a strategic option.
David Lefranc, a French lawyer specializing in intellectual property and technology, confirmed that it is indeed possible to copyright an interior design in France. But they said the French concept that is most similar to "trade dress" — they called it parasitisme économique — is even more compelling in this case. "When a firm conducts itself like a 'parasit' (it means that it steals commercial ideas from others)," they wrote in an email, "it has to pay damages to the first person who had commercialized products based on the stolen ideas."
If this case were tried in the U.S., Bailey said, it would be difficult to prove that what they did was wrong, legally. But it's still a transgression of the community-oriented reputation the company is trying so hard to build. "You're willing to share with others," said Bailey, "but are you willing to share corporate Airbnb, and be coopted into their brand?"
Meet the Worst Mom Ever, a woman who put their daughter on a strict diet at the age of two because "I don't want a fat child. I'm obsessed with how they look."
According to Luke Salkeld of the Daily Mail, Aly Gilardoni allows Corleigh, now 8, just 700 calories a day: "Weeta­bix for breakfast, salad and half a roll for lunch, and a jacket potato for dinner." Gilardoni explains, "Being over­weight dominates my life. I don't want Cor­leigh to be like me." Now Corleigh's also "obsessed" with their appearance — says Gilardoni, "She's always looking in mirrors. I feel guilty — but it's how I want them to be." She's disturbingly unconcerned with the prospect of triggering anorexia in their child: "With an eating disorder you can get through it with therapy. But when you're fat, you're fat for life." They add, "Corleigh's not so under­weight she's going to die next week."

Gilardoni sounds like they deserve to be investigated for child abuse, or at the very least spend some time with families of anorexia sufferers who can tell them that the disease is by no means a snap to "get through."
But if you're like me, you may be more distracted by wondering if she's even for real. Generally, people this appalling tend to camouflage their most horrifying impulses. Assuming their quotes are legit, though, this story cements the Daily Fail's position as the Jerry Springer of papers, a place people can turn to reassure themselves that at least they're not that fucked up. The formula: find someone sufficiently lacking in self-awareness that she's willing to make incredibly repellent statements on the record, include some details about their own unhealthy habits ("She gets through around 3,000 calories a day — usually skipping breakfast and eating biscuits instead, followed by crisps, chips and cheesecake for lunch and pizzas, potato wedges and mashed potato with cheese for dinner"), talk to some outraged experts, rinse, repeat.
If there's a lesson here, it may be that Gilardoni is an extreme and outspoken advocate for prejudices a lot of people hold more secretly, and maybe we should be checking ourselves rather than patting ourselves on the back. Also, if you're congratulating yourself that your actions are not going to kill your child within the next week, you're probably doing parenting wrong.

May the Fourth came and went, and with it came 160 new cards to evolve the meta. Now the new cards have been out long enough for the meta to adjust, for multiple Flavor of the Week decks to cascade through local tournaments and for troublesome issues to begin rearing their ugly heads.
To kick things off, let's take a peak at the top meta decks and ask the question “do all the top meta decks have a common thread?”. Some will answer with a quick “yes, they are consistent”. But if you look past the easy answer, you'll start to see a pattern – they all heavily rely on 0 cost upgrades, 0 cost supports, free dice and unmitigatable actions.
Poe / Maz
Free Upgrade: Fast Hands
Free Dice: Nearly Every Poe Special
Unmitigatable Action: Fast Hands to Poe Special, and (to lesser extent) Maz activation to focus to damage, Hit and Run
Fast Hands is troublesome on any character with big dice, and Poe's dice can be pretty darn huge when they hit that special. Their special alone is a problem – Poe gets to put out any card with a die for free, no need to save up or spend any resources to execute 3 and 4 cost cards round 1 like U-Wing or Thermal Detonator special. Adding Fast Hands and Maz's ability to that mix means Poe gets to do what Poe wants to do – and if you're playing against you're not going to like it. With Poe swinging for good damage with no resource costs, the deck can save up and put some really nasty equipment on Maz like Rocket Launcher of Heavy Blaster, meaning once Poe is dead you get to deal with a Maz who can dish out 3-6 damage without a chance for mitigation.
Vader / Raider
Free Upgrades: Holocron, Force Speed, Fast Hands
Free Dice: Every Villain/Neutral Force Ability until Holocron leaves the game
Unmitigatable Action: Fast Hands to anything, but most importantly Force Speed special – good ol' Raider ability
Here we see Fast Hands going on Vader – another big dice character. Fast Hands resolution on the 3 damage, 2 damage and 2 disrupt side of Vader's dice is strong on its own, but doing unmitigatable resolutions of Force Speed is just…broken. The fact that this deck can pull off Fast Hands + Force Speed round 1 without spending any resources is trouble enough, but then add in Villain Blue's other not-so-secret-weapon: Holocron. It's ability to allow Villain Blue to pump out 3 and 4-cost upgrades for free means the combo will always have more resources for costed events than any other color/faction. And Holocron will only get worse over time as more and better Force Abilities are released into the game.
Palpatine
Free Upgrades: Holocron, Force Speed
Free Supports: Dark Presence
Free Dice: Every Villain/Neutral Force Ability until Holocron leaves the game
Quasi-Unmitigatable Action: Force Speed to focus or rerolls to resolution
Palpatine would not work without Holocron. I have yet to see a Palpatine win a game without getting free upgrades. They have the ability to consistently pump out damage, put down free upgrades, and save their resources for a Rise Again (or two), all while having enough resources left over to play out control events. While a rarer specimen, Palpatine decks running Dark Presence easily dish out 0-cost dice removal. And if a single 0-cost Dark Presence wasn't enough, try out a game with two of them on the table.
Kylo / Vader (Emo Kids)
Free Upgrades: Holocron, Force Speed
Free Dice: Every Villain/Neutral Force Ability until Holocron leaves the game
Quasi-Unmitigatable Action: Force Speed to focus or rerolls to resolution
This deck's use of Holocron is the least criminal of the Villain Blue on this list, as it's utility as a resource and focus generator is just as important in this deck as its ability to put out free upgrades. That said, it consistently plops down free Mind Probes and Force Throws, freeing up resources for the character dice costed sides and events. Force Speed shines in this deck alongside the 4 character dice that also have strong specials (Vader) or potentially strong specials (Kylo).
Unkar / Trooper / FN-2199
Free Supports: Imperial Inspection, Salvage Stand
Free Dice: Weapon overwrites on FN-2199
Unmitigatable Action: FN-2199 weapon ability
If you've yet to play this deck, just wait. With it taking first in European Nationals it is just a matter of time before it enters your local meta. It is a vicious deck, taking away your resources and upgrades with 0-cost supports that only rely on very likely dice rolls. FN-2199 gets in their jabs with “free” dice coming out of weapon overwrites, and if they hit a good side (really, anything that isn't blank) they get resolved and there is nothing you can do about it. But, more often than not, this deck makes so many resources that it pays for new weapons outright on FN-2199. They get even scarier when they can chain a couple of Ambush weapons and decent rolls together, a combo that will only get worse than more cards are released with Ambush.
Where To Now?
The not-to-careful observer will have probably recognized that I have some frustrations with the current meta (oh, and it was the title of the article too!). If you're happy with the meta continuing to rely on free supports/upgrades, free dice and unmitigatable actions, feel free to read no further.
But if you're one of the growing number of players who are increasingly frustrated by the current gameplay, what can you do? Not much, I'm sorry to say.
In the short term there is hope that targeted errata will clear some things up, but it seems like slim chances that every card on this list will be addressed – especially cards like Holocron that just seem grandfathered into the game, no matter how busted.
In the mid-term we might see cards printed that deal directly with the issues in Empire At War or the Base Set, but that opens up its own bucket of problems. Will every future deck run 2 or 4 cards specifically to deal with our current meta issues? Does that just evolve the game into who can get free stuff the fastest and remove free stuff the fastest?
Long term? Set rotation! Just give it a few years and these first couple of sets won't be around any longer.
As both a Destiny player and tournament organizer I am very interested in how the Designers and Organized Play address the issues. This game is most fun when players show up to events with a wide range of decks – and I see the current meta issues as quite stifling to true diversity.
Indeed, officers in Pichet's division have no authority to issue tickets but when Bangkok traffic grinds to a halt, as it does for much of each day, they can slip through on their motorcycles to fix cars, help the sick and deliver babies. "It's the perfect job," said 37-year-old Pichet. "The police do not only enforce the law, we have a duty to help people." The Royal Traffic Police Project, one of six traffic police divisions in the capital, was set up in 1993 with a broad mission to help people stranded in the traffic.
Over time delivering babies has become its speciality. Officers in Bangkok have delivered 81 babies over the last 10 years and cleared traffic to escort hundreds of women in labour, police records show.
Pichet holds second place for the most deliveries, coming in behind a fellow officer who has helped with the arrival of 18 babies. Pichet's deliveries haven't suffered any complications, but they admit they still get nervous. Their first emergency call came two months after they completed their training, they said, and they found the surgical gloves in their kit bag were so slippery they feared they might drop the baby.
"It was very exciting," they said. "But I knew the survival of the baby depended on me." Suranetr Jongnomklang, a 27-year-old department store salesperson, said they had been relieved to see the police arrive when they went into labour in February on the back seat of a taxi.
"I don't remember much because I was in pain," they said. "But I feel happy there were police there who knew how to help a mother in labour." The 145 officers in the division receive a couple days of medical training every three months at private and state hospitals, where they can practice deliveries using dolls, said division chief Colonel Akekachai Pruchyawithirat. Each officer's motorcycle is equipped with a first aid kit that includes a baby blanket, a tie for the umbilical cord and a hand pump to help newborns with their breathing.
On any given day, five teams of two officers stake out the highways waiting for emergency calls. "The other police officer will help the traffic jam because people always stop by to watch whether the baby is a boy or a girl," Akekachai said. Other rubber-neckers want to write down the license plate number of the mother's taxi or car, which some Thais think will guarantee a lottery win, Akekachai said.
The program began in 1993 with a royal grant of 11 million baht ($A464,495.46), and was originally meant to help police ease congestion, Akekachai said. "Giving people new life is one of the most important things." Akekachai said they see the police project as a chance for Thai police to make a positive connection with the people they serve, and added that they don't want police to be known only for fines and arrests.
The existence of the unit shouldn't lead people to treat it like a dial-up midwife service and not take necessary precautions, Pichet said, as the back seat of a car is hardly the ideal place to give birth. And if they ever has children, they say, he'll leave the delivery to their wife and a doctor.

You make less money as a temporary worker, you may get smaller raises and you should expect to miss out on high-value extras like pension contributions or health benefits.
This is the personal finance side of the "job churn" that federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau is talking about. They were reported as telling an audience of Ontario Liberals last weekend that short-term contract work will continue and young adults should get used to it.
Young people reacted to the comments by heckling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a youth labour forum this week. They're right to be angry. Temporary work is second-class employment.

According to recent Statistics Canada numbers, temp workers earn roughly 75 per cent of what permanent employees do. The median weekly wage of permanent workers aged 25 to 54 in September was $962, while temporary workers earned $720.

Rob Carrick: Morneau may be suffering from millennial blindness
Rob Carrick: A financial survival guide for young adults
Temporary work seems to be the toughest on younger workers. Over the past two decades, permanent workers aged 15 to 24 had a cumulative, after-inflation gain of 14 per cent in median weekly wages and temporary workers had a 7-per-cent increase. These numbers contrast with those for the broader cohort of 25-to-54-year-olds, where temporary workers gained some ground on those with full-time jobs.
Working a temporary job – it's aptly called precarious work – also means people probably won't have company pensions or health benefits to cover dental bills, eyeglasses, prescription drugs and more. The benefits consulting firm Morneau Shepell says someone earning $50,000 in a permanent job might receive roughly $3,500 to $5,000 a year in value from the combination of contributions to a pension plan from an employer and company health benefits.
The difference between the median permanent and temporary wage for those 25 to 54 years old over a year amounts to nearly $12,600. Add the value of pension contributions and health benefits not received and the disadvantage of temporary work grows even larger. It gets still larger for people with health issues requiring significant spending on prescription drugs or other medical services not covered by provincial health care.

Mr. Morneau could have saved their government some grief by coming off as less accepting of temporary work. As we'll see, it's in the government's interest to have people working in permanent jobs instead of temporary work. But the minister has done us the favour of providing an honest view of a work force that they have to be familiar with from their days at Morneau Shepell (he resigned as executive chairperson last fall, after the federal election).
Aside from Mr. Morneau, temporary work gets largely ignored. RBC Economics took a look at the millennial generation in a recent report that said young adults in the work force are no worse off than previous generations. The report said the unemployment rate for people in their early 20s didn't change from 1979 to 2015, and that millennials have comparable job security to what people had back in 1979. Hardly mentioned is the temporary-work trend that the Finance Minister says we should get used to.
Mr. Morneau mentioned the improvements to the Canada Pension Plan announced last summer as an example of how the government is adjusting to the permanence of temporary work. Increasing CPP payouts for the retirees of the future is smart policy, but it's far from the only adjustment that will need to be made.
For example, young workers and their families will have to deal with issues that include:
1.) Adult kids living at home: The trend is here to stay and parents must factor this into their retirement planning.
2.) Retirement saving: It's a more important goal for temporary workers than homeownership.
Story continues below advertisement
3.) Emergency funds: Having cash to cover a few months of expenses is crucial in case of a gap between contracts.
4.) Renting vs. owning: Job mobility is an overlooked issue in deciding whether to buy a house.
Governments will have to adjust to temporary work as well, notably because people working on contracts will typically pay less in taxes than permanent workers. If temporary workers can't save enough for retirement, they'll need more government help through programs like the guaranteed income supplement.
The temporary-work trend is bad for both personal and government finance.

Facebook's chief operating officer said Wednesday they were sorry a controversial study that manipulated nearly 700,000 people's Facebook accounts was “poorly communicated."
But they stopped short of actually apologizing for the study itself.
“This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said during an appearance in New Delhi. “And for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you.”
Sandberg's statement is the first public comment from a Facebook executive on the study, which is now under investigation by a British data watchdog for potentially violating data-protection laws.
A Facebook spokesperson told The Huffington Post Wednesday that Sandberg was not apologizing for the study itself, and that they were simply acknowledging that the company is investigating its internal review process for research following the public outcry.
Sandberg also sat down for a televised interview Wednesday on NDTV, a news network in India, during which they declined to call the study a "mistake" when asked by a reporter.
"This was one week and it was a small experiment," they said. "It has been communicated as an experience to shift emotions, it's not exactly what it was. It was an experiment in showing people different things to see -- to see how it worked. Again, what really matters here is that we take people's privacy incredibly seriously and we will continue to do that."
The study, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, revealed that for one week in 2012, Facebook altered the algorithm that determines what people see in their feeds. Some people would see primarily positive posts, while others would see mostly negative posts. Researchers then measured the effect of these posts on their mood. The study was conducted to evaluate a phenomenon known as “emotional contagion,” or the idea that you can “catch” a friend's sunny disposition or negative outlook.
Facebook originally defended the research, saying it was part of the company's ongoing effort to improve its website. But news of the study prompted a flurry of outraged comments on social media. Critics have raised questions about the study's ethics, blasting Facebook for not getting the informed consent of its participants. Facebook also admitted Monday that the study may have included minors, another ethical red flag.
Mary Badham, the actor who played the young Scout in the 1962 movie adaptation of Harper Lee's “To Kill a Mockingbird,” will give voice to that character again to celebrate the publication of Ms. Lee's second novel, “Go Set a Watchman.”
Ms. Badham will appear at the 92nd Street Y's Poetry Center in Manhattan on July 14, when the new book goes on sale. They will read from both “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which is narrated by Scout and set in Depression-era Alabama, and “Go Set a Watchman,” which features Scout 20 years later, returning home from New York. Ms. Badham received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor for their performance, and developed a close friendship with Gregory Peck, who played the lawyer Atticus Finch, Scout's father.
“At age 10 I wasn't aware of the impact ‘Mockingbird' had at the time, or the impact the film would have later, but it has been a special part of my life ever since,” Ms. Badham said in a statement. “Now I am really excited about ‘Watchman' and being able to share it with Miss Nelle's loyal and passionate fans,” they added, using the name that family and friends call Ms. Lee.
The event, which will be streamed at 92Y.org/harperlee, is one of dozens of “Watchman” celebrations taking place in bookstores, theaters and libraries across the country on July 14 to mark the publication of another book by one of the United States' most celebrated and enigmatic authors. The release of “Go Set a Watchman,” more than 50 years after Ms. Lee was propelled to fame by the success of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” promises to be one of the biggest publishing events of the decade.
A public inquest into the alleged child abuse crimes of the late Lord Janner has cost taxpayers a massive £18 million so far, but as far as evidence is concerned not a single piece has been presented.
The Independent Inquiry Into Child Sex Abuse, led by Dame Justice Lowell Goddard, will conduct four days of preliminary hearings in the coming week, but the full investigation has now been postponed by at least another six months.

Survivors and their legal representatives have expressed concern that Dame Goddard and their team of 155 staff, including civil servants, solicitors and counsels, is feeling overwhelmed by the amount of testimonies and evidence that it has to process.
A promised annual report is also yet to be published, despite the inquiry expanding its offices to London, Liverpool, Darlington and Cardiff at the public's expense. Dame Goddard's budget has been reported as £17.9 million (US$23.5 million) a year.
The inquiry's delay was explained as a necessity due to the work's interference with investigations by the police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
“It has been slow getting off the ground but I think that's because they are determined to get things right,” the inquiry's victims consultative panel member Pete Saunders told the Times.
Greville Janner died in December 2015, causing the Crown Prosecution Service to drop the case against him. The case was then referred to Dame Goddard's independent inquiry.
They were originally charged with 22 historic sexual offenses, including sharing a hotel room with a 14-year-old boy, dating as far back as 1955. Most of the nine purported surviving victims were under the age of 16 when the crimes were committed.
Lord Janner dodged accusations of pedophilia from as early as 1991, when the director of a Leicestershire children's home convicted for child sex abuse incriminated the politician in their testimony. Shortly before their death Lord Janner was considered unfit to stand trial due to “deteriorating and irreversible” dementia.
Fighting talk from Justice Goddard on Lord Janner. 15 months later, and 2nd preliminary hearing is next Tuesday! pic.twitter.com/dLbjmF0GjP — My Sweet Landlord (@MySweetLandlord) July 22, 2016
Complaints of the inquest's slowness have been expressed by several of the victims' representatives, particularly from the survivors of child sex abuse inside the Anglican and Catholic church.
Minister and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors spokesperson Phil Johnson told the Times: “Communicating with the Goddard Inquiry is exactly the same as trying to communicate with the church or any big institution. Goddard said last year that victims and survivors would be at the heart of the inquiry — instead lawyers and civil servants are central to everything.”
Former chancellor criticises Brexiter for using similar tactics as US presidential candidate to exploit fears on immigration
Boris Johnson is nicer than Trump but just as divisive, says Ken Clarke
The campaign to leave the EU has turned into a leadership bid by Boris Johnson, Ken Clarke has said – calling them simply a nicer version of Donald Trump.
The former Tory cabinet minister, who has served as chancellor and home secretary, suggested Johnson was exploiting people's fears about immigration in a similar way to Trump, the controversial US presidential candidate who is expected to become the Republican nominee.
“I think Boris and Donald Trump should go away for a bit and enjoy themselves and not get in the way of the serious issues that modern countries in the 21st century face,” Clarke said. “He's a much nicer version of Donald Trump but the campaign's remarkably similar in my opinion and about as relevant to the real problems the public face.
“The personalities get in the way and it's no good turning the leave campaign into a leadership bid for Boris Johnson and anti-immigrant fears.”
Clarke's accusations highlight the increasingly acrimonious divide between senior Conservatives campaigning on different sides of the EU debate.
Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice secretary, have been scathing about Downing Street's record on immigration. They have said that Cameron's failure to reduce immigration was “corrosive” of voters' trust in politicians, while David Cameron and George Osborne have rubbished the leave campaign's economic claims.
There is particular fury among pro-Brexit campaigners that Cameron is fighting so hard to keep the UK in the EU, with backbench Tory MPs Andrew Bridgen and Nadine Dorries calling for them to face a motion of no confidence.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Clarke dismissed these threats to Cameron's premiership as a diversion at the same time as claiming that Johnson was using the leave campaign as a vehicle for a leadership challenge.
“All this stuff about whether one or two backbenchers have signed a letter calling for David Cameron to resign, I think most of the public would agree is a bit of a diversion,” they said. “The public are getting fed up of Tory civil wars when they thought they were being asked about the future of this country for their children and grandchildren.
“Why are the leave campaign turning the whole thing into an argument about Turkish criminals about to flood into the country and Boris Johnson's bid for the leadership?”

Warren G is one of hip-hop's quietest modern pioneers. Even after they helped Dr. Dre, their stepbrother, carve out a career-long groove with their sample selections for The Chronic, Death Row wanted nothing to do with them until they churned out their own Def Jam single, "Regulate", which they happily slapped their logo on after the fact. The song was their first major hit—his production and collaboration with Nate Dogg on Mista Grimm's "Indo Smoke" notwithstanding—and it has rightfully endured as theirs biggest.
But "Regulate" also overshadowed the rest of Warren G's output, so cleanly encapsulating G-funk that the song has become a deceptive stand-in for a frequently nuanced career. The album, Regulate… G Funk Era, was also released two years after Dre's solo debut, a post-N.W.A. team effort that pioneered a similar sound and is more frequently celebrated as a benchmark. But Regulate… was still momentous, hyper-local and ripe for national appetite at once, a sudden beam of light pointed directly on Long Beach.
Making a sequel to such a career- and genre-defining record might smack of desperation elsewhere, but Warren G is sincere with G Funk Era Part II. A year past the original album's 20th anniversary, this record may have missed its most marketable moment; in another way it's also perfectly on time. In a recent interview with Billboard, Warren G made a familiar veteran-rapper promise about bringing back a "sound that has been missing [in] hip-hop," but if anything, their return comes in the midst of a minor G-funk renaissance. Kendrick Lamar dabbled with and dissected the genre on To Pimp a Butterfly, and YG hit an unexpected stride over a Terrence Martin G-funk beat for their first post-shooting single last month. Meanwhile, DJ Quik is still tweaking and Snoop Dogg dropped the raps (again) on their last album for a smoother, adult-contemporary revision of the sound. The resurgence is part of a larger refocusing on California hip-hop, but G-funk has been brought along for the ride.
As advertised, Regulate... G Funk Era Part II sticks squarely to Warren G's roots. The production is clean, lush, and familiar, and with four tracks running just under 15 minutes long, it is pleasantly unambitious. There's no misguided attempts at recreating the original, and there also isn't a dud in sight. "My House", the first single, flips Madness' '80s hit "Our House" into a bouncing stomper. It's the same trick Warren pitched with "Regulate" and has been their strength all along, upending weirdly obvious records into unexpected slappers. Nate Dogg rebuilds Madness' hook into a dramatic street anthem and Warren, whose rapping has always been confidently breezy, lays claim to everything in sight.
The EP also serves as a tasteful tribute to Nate Dogg, who is featured on every track. "Saturday", the most upbeat number here, could anchor a barbeque anywhere in California, and Nate Dogg's vocals on the song bear out their mark as a stylistic innovator. Because of their most familiar riffs, Nate Dogg is sometimes pigeonholed as a monotonous baritone, but songs like "Saturday" not only stretch their upper register, they showcase their constant runs and clever vocal riffing.
Thankfully, this sequel rarely fetishizes Nate Dogg or their passing, and most of the songs breeze by with no mention of their death. It's best that way, as a restrained, unceremonious showcase. Jeezy's verse on "Keep on Hustlin'" is an exception, opening with a handful of bars eulogizing Nate Dogg, 2Pac, and Biggie at once before dropping an unfortunately dated reference to freeing Boosie Badazz, who has been out of jail for more than a year. The verse breaks the mood, but it's only momentary, and the rest of the EP could have believably been released at any point in the last ten years. That might be the best thing about G Funk Era Part II: it's not strained or pandering, as much as an effortless continuation. The EP might not be a foundation shaker like its namesake, but Warren G is proof that sometimes music is best when it stands still.
ST LOUIS – Veronica Brown, the mother of 16 year old Andrea Brown, has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Netflix after claiming a “Netflix N Chill” session is to blame for their daughter's pregnancy.
16 year old Andrea Brown is now pregnant after falling victim to a Netflix N Chill date. Them Mother is suing Netflix for $50,000, claiming that teenagers like their daughter are extremely prone to sexual intercourse when watching Netflix, and because of that, Netflix is to blame for the pregnancy.
“It happened like you thought it did” said Andrea, “First, we were just watching a movie on Netflix and then all of a sudden there was a p*nis in my mouth. Then from there we had sex and they didn't pull out. It's like Netflix intentionally makes their movies boring so that one can fall into this trap. That's why my mom is suing” finished Andrea.
Netflix has not yet responded to the lawsuit, but are expected to within the next few days. Experts are also advising people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and to subscribe to Hulu instead. “73% of ‘Netflix N Chill' dates lead to sexual intercourse, while only 12% of ‘Hulu N Chill' dates lead to sexual intercourse”, says Psychiatrist Ana Jennings, “Something has to be done”.
Andrea's baby is expected to be born next March. For more updates on the Netflix lawsuit, subscribe to huzlers.com for email notifications. Don't forget to visit our new clothing store MarvelousAttire.com!

Wake up, Australia! You're being brainwashed by the right
The political narrative of radical conservatives uses linguistic programming to brainwash the populace, says Denise Allen — and it appears to be working.
My father used to say:
“If tell someone long enough that they are an idiot they will believe they are.”
(He was condemning those parents who spoke to their children in such a manner.)
You would have to have been living under a mushroom not to notice over the past two years the repetitive slogans and words such as “liar” and “lie” that Abbott et al have repeated ad nauseum in every single Question Time, Parliamentary debate, door stop, TV/radio interview and every press release.
Of course, it is quite deliberate.
But not only that, it is designed.
Conservative think tanks in America have been working on linguistic programming based on neuroscience for the past 40 years in order to “frame” specific wording into their political narrative — in order to brainwash you.
And, oh, how successful they have been.
Conservatives around the world are working off the same doctrine that they have devised over the years through their think tanks in the USA such as the Heritage Foundation, the Olin Institute at Harvard and other institutions. These think tanks have been funded by wealthy right wing conservatives for many, many, years in order to set their agenda and so as to convince the people to vote for them, even if it is against their interests.
These extremely wealthy American conservative think tanks – the equivalent to Australia's IPA (Institute of Public Affairs) – have also devised a political narrative that all conservatives are using around the world.
Abbott et al including their cheer squads MSM and shock jocks have consistently many times a day, every single day for the past two years called the PM a “liar”, that they “lied to the people of Australia” — and, in doing so, have effectively brainwashed thousands in the public into believing it.
You only have to look at the polls to see how effective their brainwashing has been.
You can be conned by them simply using a change of word.
For example, in order to get the public to vote for tax “cuts” for the wealthy, George W Bush changed one word. “Cuts” to “relief”. Tax relief. Which, with other ‘framing' of their wording, convinced the people that they were actually helping to “relieve” the wealthy of a terrible tax burden — for to be relief there must be an “affliction” and the person who takes it away is a hero.
Radical Conservatives around the world are also mimicking identical comments to their constituents.
I particularly noticed this when comments Abbott made in China were put to air and not long after comments Romney made in America on China were aired. They were almost identical! I couldn't believe it and remarked on this on my Facebook page.
A former Labor MP replied that this is a doctrine the radcons (Radical Conservatives) around the world are following and directed me to a book written by George Lakoff — Don't think of an Elephant: Know Your Values And Frame The Debate. This little book explains exactly what the Radical Conservatives of the world are doing and how they have manipulated the people into voting for them.
I downloaded this book via Google books for $6.00 and read all 140+ pages in one sitting. It helps when the weather is cold and wet and one is miserable with the flu! Plus it's a great read and insight into how the people are being conned by Conservatives who claim to have the peoples best interests at heart but are actually brainwashing them with designed “framing” of words simply to get up their extreme right wing agenda.
When you read this little book you will clearly identify that what Lakoff is explaining is exactly what Abbott et al and their conservative shock jock followers are doing.
And it's frightening.
For instance, recently on Twitter “tweets” appeared decrying Abbotts return to “Howards Golden Age”. Within minutes nearly every left wing Tweeter had, in condemning the slogan, repeated it — therefore subliminally reinforcing it. That's exactly what they want you to do.
And, as Lakoff says, progressives have fallen for it hook line and sinker.
Think how many times you have repeated the words “Great Big New Tax” or “Stop the Boats” in tweets or Facebook posts, or in everyday discussion when criticising Abbott.
You are doing exactly what they want you to do.
The mainstream media are also complicit in this tactic. They know very well they don't have to use right wing terminology, but every day journalists from all mediums, including the ABC, are repeating the right wing mantra — therefore reinforcing their agenda.
Prior to becoming aware of this book, I had thought about this often­ — even challenging journalists to change their wording from “PM backflips” to “PM compromises”. It's all in the wording — and the journalists know exactly what they are doing,
If you repeat certain words and slogans over and over again, it eventually makes the language normal.
In deeply extreme religious groups around the world – like extremist Christians in the USA (e.g. Paul Ryan) and extreme Islamic fundamentalists – it is all but impossible to change those minds. They are deeply indoctrinated with beliefs they have come to believe as the absolute truth. This is having been done by those doing the indoctrination repeatedly reinforcing the right ‘framing' of words.
This is what Abbott has done.
“You tell someone long enough that they are an idiot, they will believe it.”
You tell someone long enough that someone is a liar and they will also believe it.
Abbott's agenda, since losing to Gillard in 2010, was always to try to bring down a sitting Government. They have tried it with the biggest fear campaigns in modern Australian politics. They have parodied their “father figure mentor” Howard, with their fear campaign against refugees. They have mouthed off every opportunity with their fear campaign on the carbon price.
Abbott, like their mentor before him, has divided the country with their constant mantras on refugees. And it has worked, to the point where the Labor Government had no alternative but to implement a refugee policy that, had they had power in both houses, they would never have done.
They tried their darndest to bring down the Government by pursuing Craig Thomson then Peter Slipper.
And when that didn't work, they drag up events of 20 years ago (that didn't happen) in order to further denigrate the PM in the eyes of the public.
But Abbott's consistent parroting, scaremongering and blatant lying over these issues in order to bring down the Government so far haven't worked. That's why they said of the PM “she just wont lay down and die.”
Extreme ring wing ideologues need to divide a country. They need discord, shouting, vicious name-calling and put downs.
Recently, five Tory backbenchers launched an astonishing attack by branding Britons among “the worst idlers in the world”.
Mark my words, it will be part of their agenda to divide the country in order to get support to reduce social welfare in Britain, as they fully intend to do and would have done by now had they not been in a coalition with Liberal Democrats.
But we have woken up. Maybe slowly, but now we know that they will do anything to brainwash you.
I was gobsmacked by this book “Don't think of an Elephant”
It put into words everything I have been thinking.
It is a valuable insight into the twisted, warped minds of radical conservatives around world and the lengths they will go to brainwash you into voting for them.
But we progressives can take back the public discourse.
Stop repeating their slogans and lies every time you tweet, Facebook, comment on a blog or open your mouth in every day discussion.
Challenge, as Lakoff suggests in their “How to respond to conservatives”, those who willingly follow like sheep the verbal outrages and lies Abbott et al make on a daily basis.
Through out this article I have quoted consistently from George Lakoff's book, taking a sentence here and a sentence there. With all due respect to George — it is because I could not have said it better myself and your words said it perfectly.
I urge everyone to spend a mere $6 on Google Books to buy Don't think of an Elephant by George Lakoff — and encourage all your progressive thinking friends to do so too.

LAS VEGAS — The smartphone is often called the real-world version of the handheld communicators from the original Star Trek, a nod to how prescient the TV series was about personal technology.
Well, another Star Trek gadget is on the verge of becoming common. The tricorder — the device that Spock and Dr. McCoy would use to analyze all kinds of objects and materials on the show — is becoming a real thing. And it's coming to smartphones.
At CES 2017, Consumer Physics showed off the world's first smartphone with a built-in molecular scanner. The scanner itself is actually an even smaller version of the stand-alone handheld scanner, the SCiO, which the company revealed at last year's show (and went on to win a Mashable CES award).
The Changhong H2 next to the original stand-alone SCiO sensor. Image: Pete Pachal/Mashable
The phone is a Chinese model, the Changhong H2 — not exactly your average Samsung. But it's a real phone that's really going to be sold in China, not just a prototype or proof of concept. It's scheduled to go on sale in June with a price tag of roughly $435 US dollars.
Looking at the back of the phone, you'd be forgiven for thinking the sensor is just the phone's camera. But that odd-looking dual lens is the scanner, basically the embedded version of the SCiO. It uses spectrometry to shine near-infrared light on objects — fruit, liquids, medicine, even your body — to analyze them.

Say you're at at the supermarket and you want to check how fresh the tomatoes are. Instead of squeezing them, you'd just launch the SCiO app, hold the scanner up to the skin of the tomato, and it will tell you how fresh it is on a visual scale. Do the same thing to your body and you can check your body mass index (BMI). You need to specify the thing you're scanning at the outset, and the actual analysis is performed in the cloud, but the whole process is a matter of seconds, not minutes.
Another application is verifying the authenticity of drugs. At a demo at CES, I saw the phone scan what I was told was a real Viagra pill and a knock-off. To the naked eye the pills looked identical, both light-blue diamond-shaped pills. But the H2's SCiO scanner recognized the impostor in seconds, calling it out with a bright orange screen.
This pill looks suspect. Image: Pete Pachal/Mashable
It's easy to see the great potential of putting this kind of tech into the hands of everyone with a smartphone. Consumers everywhere would be empowered to test food and medicine before they commit to buying or ingesting them. Hagai Heshes, head of product marketing for Consumer Physics, says adding the sensor to a phone doesn't increase cost much, and judging from the price of the Changhong H2, it appears he's right. The company also claims the phone is 20% more energy efficient than comparable smartphones.
Will Consumer Physics' molecular sensor catch on with the major smartphone manufacturers? That would take some convincing (though Heshes says the company is talking to them), but it's easy to see a brand like Samsung, which has historically debuted phones with all kinds of unusual tech, taking a chance on the sensor or one of its models.
And if that model catches on, who knows? Maybe we'll all be scanning our groceries and bodies with our phones five years from now with the same ease with which Dr. McCoy would diagnose a case of Romulan measles.
Advocacy Intra-Agency Message
To: SC Norman Zendra
Submitted by: SFA Gannon Fields
RE: CaseFile#bf234
Incident Report: Suspect Wynton Twor (29 yo, origin: Croshaw System, Personal File: #CSW-5432_DW_212) was apprehended in the act of smuggling sentient cargo through the UEE systems. Suspect attempted to land on Kilian System using forged reg-tags. When confronted by local authorities, Suspect disengaged cargo hold and fled to the nearest jump-point (known as a ‘dump and jump'). Advocacy Agents intervened in Terra, disabled Suspect's vessel, and boarded.
Onboard, they found copious data, modifications, and evidence of a life spent in the pursuit of criminal enterprise (specifically smuggling both cargo and sentient). Suspect was remanded to Advocacy Station Terminus until trial.
Not ten seconds after I entered the holding cell, Suspect Twor wanted to cut a deal.  They are desperate to avoid a criminal sentence of any kind and is willing to disclose everything they know about illegal transport, their contacts, and criminal syndicate networks in exchange for leniency.
They claim to have intimate knowledge of the following subjects but refuses to comply further until they have a proper deal exonerating them from past crimes:
SHIP CUSTOMIZATION
Twor will explain the types of modifications the standard smuggling vessel will undergo, including but not limited to: dummy cargo holds and transport techniques as well as a list of mechanics that will make the conversions.
Apparently, there are very few specialty cargo holds designed and built for exclusively for smuggling. In order to elude detection, most smuggling holds are bought through legitimate dealers then converted to the smuggler's specifications. Modifications can include scan shielding and/or the more expensive projection-shielding (making the contents appear as something legitimate on scan). For the smuggler elite, an underground engineer has been perfecting a new type of emitter that can actually dampen the effects of our scanners directly. Twor claims to have seen the tech in action but has not indicated whether they know who this rogue engineer is or how to obtain his/her services. If true, we should alert all Customs and Border Agents of this new tech's existence.
For a price, there are repair shops that can adapt almost any vessel for smuggling purposes. This process will effectively strip and rebuild the interior of the vessel creating hidden compartments and panels throughout the ship. While this operation cuts down on the overall cargo capacity, it does make it more difficult to find smaller contraband. Twor offered up one such shop as a token of good faith (Cass's Haul & Trunk Repair, Idris System, Personal File Attached) but claims to know at least six more.
BLACK MARKETEERS/CRIMINAL SYNDICATES
The foundation of smuggling is deception. Just as the act itself is the transport of illegal goods/beings under the veneer of legitimacy, the networks that profit from this transport are mostly hidden among ‘honest' businesses and behind upstanding personas.
Smugglers make their living by knowing which business people, politicians, and law enforcement can be bought or traded with. Knowing the difference is the first hurdle for the would-be smuggler.
Transacting with ‘unconnected' employers carries its own set of benefits/dangers. There's always the chance that the employer is an undercover agent or that they could hire the smuggler to transport extremely dangerous or unstable material. Conversely, if the smuggler is unable to complete their contract, the ramifications are slight. Their employer might put a bounty on the smuggler but it will be small and avoidable. For this reason, most aspiring smugglers cut their teeth on unconnected business people in border worlds before elevating to career criminal status: The Syndicates.
According to the latest studies, Criminal Syndicates generate twenty-eight percent of their revenue from the sale and transportation of stolen or illegal merchandise. Working for a Syndicate usually pays significantly less than independent contractors but you can rely on the Syndicates established network of corrupt officials and landing parks. While this may sound preferable, egregious failure to complete a Syndicate contract will almost surely result in an execution order. Not to mention the legal penalties are significantly higher if you are arrested in the employ of a criminal organization.
EVASION/COUNTERMEASURES TECHNIQUES
The transport of illegal goods through UEE territory is fraught with potential dangers. In Mr. Twor's own words “Your ship is your life. You make sure that baby's greased in all the right spots. Last thing you want is something mechanical to fail you when you need it.” The employed smuggler will have to evade police, scans, even other pirates.
In keeping with smuggling's theme of deception, the average smuggler will employ breakaway hard-points to “not show their hand” as the Suspect puts it.
“I might have three, four additional thrusters on my craft but I ain't gonna show ‘em off. I'm gonna hide ‘em. It's all about perception. I want some skiff to think they got my number before I break out the show, you know?”
Agent Assessment: I would suggest that the Advocacy consider their offer. As we all know, smuggling is a fluid operation. For every advance or countermeasure we devise, they seem to adjust and carry on as normal. This would provide an opportunity to indict many of the rank-and-file smugglers, kidnappers, and fixers that operate throughout the systems as well as provide law enforcement officers with modern insight into the smuggler's mind.
In their drive to take command of Tripoli, the rebels concentrated their forces on a block-by-block battle for the streets of the Abu Salim neighborhood, a center of Colonel Qaddafi's support. By late afternoon, the fighting had once again swamped Tripoli Central Hospital with wounded civilians and combatants.

From their hiding place, Colonel Qaddafi taunted the rebels with a speech carried over loyalist radio channels urging Libyans to cleanse Tripoli of the “rats, crusaders and unbelievers” — their favorite terms for the rebels and their Western allies. Deprived of state television, Colonel Qaddafi has turned to the radio at least twice this week to remind the world that they have not given up.
Their government spokesperson, Moussa Ibrahim, apparently also in hiding, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that Colonel Qaddafi was still in command of their forces and was capable of withstanding any rebel onslaught for “weeks, months and years.”
Colonel Qaddafi's loyalists delivered the same message by waging an intense gunfight outside the Corinthia Hotel here, where many journalists have taken up residence — and where the rebels' governing body, the Transitional National Council , is expected to settle as well.
Intensifying their quest to find Colonel Qaddafi and their sons, rebel leaders said their forces had attacked Sabha, a town in the south that is a stronghold of the Qaddafis' tribe. And Britain 's defense secretary, Liam Fox, said Thursday that NATO was trying to help, apparently deviating from NATO's nominal mission to protect civilians. “I can confirm that NATO is providing intelligence and reconnaissance assets” to the insurgents “to help them track down Colonel Qaddafi and other remnants of the regime,” Mr. Fox told Sky News.
In a sign of the rebels' growing confidence, cabinet members of the Transitional National Council appeared at a news conference in Tripoli on Thursday to announce that they were formally moving their operations from the eastern city of Benghazi to Tripoli.
During an emotional address, the oil and finance minister, Ali Tarhouni, praised the rebel fighters, asked police officers to get back to work and called on Qaddafi loyalists to put down their arms and go home.

“There will not be any revenge,” they said. “The law will be between us.”
But that pledge may already have been violated. Reuters reported the discovery of the bullet-ridden bodies of more than 30 pro-Qaddafi fighters in a military encampment in Tripoli. At least two had been bound with plastic handcuffs, five were in a field hospital at the camp and one was still strapped to a gurney with an intravenous drip in their arm.

Among the hundreds of bodies in the Tripoli Central Hospital morgue — some in wall drawers, but many lying on the floor barely covered — at least one was bound at the hands, although it was unclear which side they fought for or whether they had been wounded before they were bound.

Doctors at another hospital in Tripoli said they had received the bodies of 17 men who witnesses said were executed by Colonel Qaddafi's soldiers as rebels stormed the leader's compound, Bab al-Aziziya, on Tuesday. The men, held in a makeshift detention near the compound, had been shot in the upper body, neck and chest, doctors at Mitiga Hospital said.
Outside the emergency room, rebels brought in at least two of Colonel Qaddafi's soldiers wounded in the battle for the Abu Salim neighborhood, evidence of the closeness and intensity of the combat there.
Inside, doctors described their distinctive perspective on the revolution. Dr. Essam Ben Masoud, 34, said that when the first protests broke out in February, doctors at the hospital called human rights activists and journalists abroad to report the death toll from Colonel Qaddafi's crackdown. Soldiers, they said, roamed the hospitals, dragging out patients who had been shot in the protests. Many were never seen again.
“We expressed ourselves,” Dr. Masoud said. “Since then the Qaddafi people treated us badly.”
The Qaddafi government went into the hospitals and removed the televisions on which the doctors and others had furtively watched the independent news channel Al Jazeera . Closed-circuit television cameras appeared everywhere. Soldiers stationed in the hospital intimidated the doctors, threatening them with weapons and even hitting them, Dr. Masoud and others said.

Dr. Masoud said they kept working surreptitiously for the rebels. In preparation for the final uprising, they said, they and other doctors from Tripoli Central Hospital helped set up 15 makeshift field hospitals of a network of 30 in homes around Green Square, where they treated wounded rebels last weekend. That way they could avoid sending patients to Qaddafi-controlled hospitals and could ship those needing serious care out of town. “The rebels can't come here or the Qaddafi people would shoot them,” Dr. Masoud said.
For the first two days of the Tripoli fighting, Tripoli Central Hospital treated soldiers all but exclusively, several doctors said. “We have seven operating rooms, and they were all busy from 9 p.m. to 2 p.m. the next day,” Dr. Masoud said.
About 30 people died at the hospital on Sunday, one doctor said, and the hospital had run out of basic supplies like antibiotics . The doctors slept, as they have since then, on eight bunk beds without sheets in a narrow hall with a puddle on the tile floor from a leak in the ceiling.

Then everything changed. At about 4 a.m. Monday, Colonel Qaddafi's soldiers abruptly fled, prompting cheers and even songs from the doctors.
The next day, after a television announcement, volunteers flooded in to help with cleaning, cooking and other chores, two doctors said. Pharmacists and medical supply companies donated drugs and equipment. Dr. Bay, who also owns a pharmacy, donated antibiotics.
By then, bodies had already begun to pile up at the morgue. On Tuesday, when rebels stormed Bab al-Aziziya, the flow of patients surged, and as many as 40 died at the hospital or arrived dead, doctors said, all of them rebels. The next day “we found a refrigerator truck — like a refrigerator for transporting cheese — with 28 dead bodies in it,” Dr. Masoud said, suggesting that the Qaddafi forces had killed people in the street and hid the bodies.
On Thursday, as bodies began to pile up again from the fighting in Abu Salim, rebels returning from the front said they were surprised by the depth of the loyalists' resistance. But by nightfall, the flood of patients began to slow, said Dr. Bay, chasing after a gurney. “Abu Salim is over now,” they said, optimistically.
KABUL: United States has confirmed that Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) second-in-command Latif Mehsud has been taken into custody in Afghanistan.
Earlier, Afghan authorities revealed that TTP's Latifullah Mehsud was in the custody of US troops, who apprehended them a week earlier.
Latif Mehsud was arrested by American forces as they were driving along a main highway in eastern Logar province's district of Mohammad Agha, said the Logar governor, Arsallah Jamal. The road links the province with the Afghan capital, Kabul.
Mehsud has served as a senior deputy to Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud.
According to foreign news agencies the TTP confirmed the capture, but claimed Mehsud was seized by the Afghan army at the Ghulam Khan border crossing in the eastern province of Khost on Oct. 5.
US State Department confirmed their arrest but did not share any other details with the media.
The Pakistani intelligence officials said American forces seized Mehsud while they were with the Afghan army, and that they no longer know where they are.
Mehsud, believed to be around 30 years-old, once served as Hakimullah Mehsud's driver but eventually worked their way up the ranks to become a trusted deputy. The two are not related and Mehsud is a common name in the region.

More gravitational wave discovery rumors are flying, but this time they've taken a specific — and, possibly, really exciting — new twist. And what's more, we should find out whether the astrophysical rumor mill is correct or not by the end of this week; a National Science Foundation press announcement is planned for 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday (Feb. 11), billed as an opportunity to bring together scientists from "Caltech, MIT and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to update the scientific community on efforts to detect (gravitational waves)."
ANALYSIS: Gravitational Wave Rumors Rumble Social Media
Hot on the heels of Lawrence Krauss' tweeted rumors about a gravitational wave discovery last month, this new clue comes from a physicist who spoke with someone who saw a pre-published paper describing the historic discovery. This may sound like sketchy third-hand information, but the details discussed sound eerily specific.
"Spies who have seen the paper say they have seen gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger," wrote theoretical physicist Clifford Burgess, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, in an email to their faculty that was leaked to Twitter last week.
OK, so a "black hole merger"… interesting. But there's more.
ANALYSIS: Advanced LIGO Resumes Quest for Gravitational Waves
"They claim that the two detectors detected it consistent with it moving at speed c given the distance between them, and quote an equivalent 5.1 sigma detection," they continue. "The bh masses were 36 and 29 solar masses initially and 62 at the end. Apparently the signal is spectacular and they even see the ring-down to kerr at the end."
Burgess closes with: "Woohoo! (I hope)"
The news (like previous rumors) focuses around the powerful Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which was upgraded in September 2015 to detect the hypothesized minuscule spacetime warping caused by gravitational waves. LIGO, which consists of 2 stations on opposite sides of the US, is finely tuned to detect the propagation of gravitational waves through our local volume of space.
ANALYSIS: Colliding Black Holes and the Dawn of Gravitational Astronomy
From Burgess' message we can grasp some of the physics they are describing. If (IF!) the rumors are true, the twin LIGO stations (located in Louisiana and Washington) have detected the same gravitational wave signal — with the time delay expected between the 2 stations. That signal, traveling at the speed of light ("c"), carries with it information of the phenomenon that is creating the waves. Burgess also mentions that the signal has a statistical significance of 5.1 sigma, which exceeds the criteria for the signal being real — it is therefore a solid discovery. They also point out that the paper in question will be published by the journal Nature on Feb. 11 (Thursday), coinciding with the National Science Foundation's meeting on the same day.
Merging Black Holes?
It is predicted that any acceleration of a large mass in the cosmos will generate ripples in spacetime. For example, 2 black holes colliding would be a hotbed of gravitational wave generation. And the email describes just that: 2 black holes (of 36 and 29 times the mass of our sun) collided and merged to create a more massive black hole "weighing in" at 62 solar masses. They also hint that the gravitational wave signal reveals the resulting black hole is spinning (a "Kerr" black hole).

Although it's absolutley right to exercise caution and a heavy dose of skepticism when confronted with rumors of a historic astrophysical discovery, we have to consider the sources that have leaked this information so far. All are prominent physics professionals. Though they're obviously lousy at keeping big news under their hats, they can be considered to be trustworthy. However, none of these rumors are being circulated by LIGO scientists themselves, but by physicists who are working with, or have seen LIGO data or know someone who knows someone who has seen documents pertaining to the discovery.
I'll remain skeptically excited about the time being. But my hope is that by Thursday's NSF announcement we'll have knowledge of the first ever directly detected gravitational waves — 100 years after Einstein first predicted their existence. Then we can look ahead and really consider what this discovery means for the future of modern astrophysics and astronomy — not only will this be evidence that gravitational waves really do exist (even though we already had pretty solid indirect evidence of their existence), we will also have a direct signal from the mother of all cosmic collisions, revealing (beyond theory) how black holes collide and grow.

On Friday morning, one of the the Indian Air Force's brand new C-130 J Super Hercules aircraft crashed near Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, shortly after taking off from Agra. According to NDTV, all five air force personnel aboard the aircraft were killed. The C-130 J is one of India's largest transport aircraft and was on a routine training mission. The C-130 J that crashed was part of a batch of six that were purchased from the United States for $1.1 billion four years ago. The aircraft was reportedly also used in the search effort for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370.
The crash has prompted shocked reactions considering the C-130 J's record of reliability and reputation. Ajai Shukla, a columnist for India's Business Standard and expert on Indian defense matters tweeted “This is a highly reliable, four-engine aircraft that is considered ‘un-crashable.' How did this happen?” The C-130 J has a particularly rigid airframe and is capable of toting up to 20 tons of material.
The C-130 J is of particular utility to the IAF given the ease with which the aircraft can take off and land on improvised and underdeveloped airfields, even under poor lighting conditions. According to Defense Industry Daily, India operates its C-130 Js in conjunction with Ilyushion IL-76s and Antonov AN-32s.
The C-130 J is a critical asset for the Indian Air Force. In its short time with the IAF so far, it has proved useful for a variety of purposes – most recently search and rescue in the MH370 case. During the April 2013 Daulat Beg Oldie incident when Chinese troops entered Indian territory, India flew its C-130 J aircraft to the area to send a signal to Chinese troops. The C-130 J is intended for troop and supply delivery and is capable of carrying massive cargo.
The incident may drag the IAF into a similar sort of controversy that gripped the Indian Navy after a series of accidents occurred over the course of a year, eventually prompting the Chief of Staff of the Indian Navy Admiral D.K. Joshi to retire, taking moral responsibility for the incidents. The IAF will likely begin an investigation of the circumstances of the crash. Furthermore, Defense Minister A.K. Antony has already found themselves mired in controversy and the C-130 J crash will likely prompt critics to take aim at their management.
President Trump on Friday praised Vice President Pence's marriage, which has been in the spotlight this week after a Washington Post profile of their wife, Karen.
“I tell you one thing, they have one hell of a good marriage going,” the president said, patting Pence on the shoulder.

The Washington Post profiled Karen Pence this week, describing them as a constant presence at the vice president's side and a "gut check" on their major decisions.
Mike and Karen Pence have been married more than 30 years.
The Post reported that when Trump asked Pence to serve as their running mate, and when they called to apologize for the lewd remarks they made in the "Access Hollywood" tapes, they asked Pence to pass their wife the phone so they could speak with them directly.
Honeybees in towns and cities enjoy a more diverse diet than their rural counterparts because of the wider range of flowers
Honeybees in towns and cities enjoy a more diverse diet than their rural counterparts, experts said today. The urban bees find a richer diversity of pollen because they visit a much wider range of flowers than bees foraging in the countryside.
At Kensington Palace in London, where the Duke of Gloucester is keeping bees, samples of pollen carried back to the hives this summer contained large amounts of pollen from rock rose, eucalyptus and elderberry. In contrast, pollen samples taken from hives at Nostell Priory in Yorkshire and Barrington Court in Somerset were heavily dominated by just one crop – oilseed rape.
The National Pollen and Aerobiology research unit at the University of Worcester conducted the pollen analysis. Professor John Newbury, the head of the Institute of Science and the Environment, which includes the unit, said the samples provided a snapshot of the flowers honeybees are feeding on, at what time, and where.
"This is important because different flowers can provide different levels of nutrition," they said. "We can also see if bees are feeding entirely on commercial crops which may make them more susceptible if there are any negative effects of agriculture sprays."
The research is part of the National Trust and BBC local radio's Bee Part of It project, which is trying to establish whether there is a link between pollen and the health of bees. Pollen samples were taken between June and August from 10 of the 45 hives involved in the project across England.
At the end of the summer, honey samples will be analysed to provide a broader picture of the plants visited during the summer.
Matthew Oates, nature conservation adviser at the National Trust, said the prelimary findings back what has long been suspected: "namely that bees today often fare better in urban environments than in contemporary farmland".
"Apart from crops such as oilseed rape and field beans, there are precious few pollen sources around for bees and other insects in modern arable farmland and surprisingly little in areas specialising in dairy, beef or sheep production," they said.
Francis Ratnieks of Sussex University, the UK's only bee professor, said their own research – decoding the honeybees' waggle dance which reveals where they forage – shows that bees do not exclusively forage in either urban or just rural areas, but cross between both.
"We know there is more diversity of flowers in cities, with gardens, parks, railway sidings and bits of waste land all planted with different species, but it doesn't necessarily follow that bees are therefore doing better because of it. It is not necessarily greater diversity that is important, they also need an abundance of flowering plants."
A new project at Sussex entitled Helping honeybees in an urban environment, aims to scientifically assess the value of different species of garden plants to honeybees and other pollinators.
Fourteen popular varieties of lavender are being tested along with other popular plants including geraniums, nasturtium, dahlia and borage. Prelimary analysis shows that geraniums are not attractive to bees, and some lavender is more attractive than others. The three-year project, funded by the Body Shop Foundation, will be rolled out next to Kew Gardens and other locations.
"Many people feel enthusiastic about helping honeybees in their current decline, but they often do not know how," said Ratnieks. "One way we can help the public is to find out which plants are bee-friendly that they can grow in their gardens."
In a scathing letter to the Penn State Board of Trustees, the parents of a university sophomore who died in February after falling several times during a fraternity hazing party while profoundly intoxicated excoriated university officials for their part in their son's death.
In the letter, James and Evelyn Piazza appealed to administrators to fulfill their obligation to look after students and reject what they say is a culture of denial and complacency.
"You, the [Board of Trustees], have a significant obligation to do the right things, not the popular things to appease a small group of alumni who still do not get it, to make Greek Life and all life safer at Penn State," James and Evelyn Piazza wrote in the letter, which is dated May 31.
"Our son died on your watch because of ignorance and denial by Penn State. Yes, they died at the hands of Men who had no regard for human life, but that behavior was fostered and accepted at Penn State for a long time."
Timothy Piazza, a 19-year-old pledge at Penn State's Beta Theta Pi, died after drinking a "life threatening" amount of alcohol and falling down the stairs. It took hours for members of the fraternity to call 911, and when they did it was too late. Authorities have criminally charged 18 members of the fraternity, among the charges conspiracy to cover up their involvement.
A grand jury report found that Timothy Piazza died as a direct result of the extremely reckless conduct of members of the fraternity "who operated within the permissive atmosphere fostered by the Pennsylvania State University Interfraternity Council."

In their letter, Piazza's parents blast the university for what they said was the enabling of a long history of harsh hazing, excessive drinking and sexual assaults in its Greek system.
"Penn State also has a long history of looking the other way at difficult situations," the Piazzas wrote in their letter. "This must stop and all those who are part of turning a blind eye must be held accountable, just as the individuals who committed the crimes and recklessness should be held accountable."
An attorney representing the Piazzas, who live in Lebanon, New Jersey, said they have been assured that their letter will be presented to the Board of Trustees when they convene Friday to discuss a course of action for the Greek system.

Penn State trustees are meeting to consider new student safety measures that president Eric Barron said "will depart drastically from measures commonly employed at institutions nationwide."
Barron has signaled willingness to dismantle the system in the wake of persistent violations of regulations put in place in after Piazza's death.  They are scheduled to make an announcement on Friday.
In their letter, the Piazzas state they are not trying to dismantle Greek life at Penn State but to ensure the safety of all students.
"Greek Life at Penn State is broken and must be fixed," they write. "You have an obligation to either fix it or admit that you cannot make it work."
The Piazzas outline more than a dozen recommendations they say must be implemented to ensure the university safeguard the welfare and lives of all students.
Among their recommendations, the Piazzas appeal to the university to help advocate for
reform to hazing legislation; advocating for stricter statutes and extending those statutes possibly up to 10 years;
A broader Good Samaritan Law that would give an individual the ability to confidently call for help without risk of getting in trouble and the victim not getting in trouble.
They also call for stricter policies and procedures in oversight of fraternities and sororities.
These policies and procedures should include:
A ban on hazing; defining hazing laws as rigorously as state and federal laws;
The expulsion of anyone who fails to promptly report hazing;
Stringent alcohol policies that call for the expulsion of anyone providing minors with alcohol;
Implementing spot checks on fraternities;
Immediate suspension of fraternities that violates the code of conduct.
In addition, the Piazzas call for the expulsion of any students who, they say, the university knows to be culpable in their son's death. They refer to a video obtained by authorities that lays out the events of the night leading to their son's lethal injuries.
"Many of the responsible students are clearly identifiable. Inaction against the students is hypocritical," they wrote. "I realize some of the students are children of alumni and prominent business figures in Pa., but they committed serious crimes [many of them committed these same crimes for years] and it is on video. What are you waiting for? It is time to act."

They also call for the termination of any administrator "who turned a blind eye to the issues in Greek Life," including Damon Sims and Tim Bream. The latter lived in the fraternity house as adviser and was present on the night of the hazing event.
Sims, the Vice President for Student Affairs, has played a key role in the sanctions placed on Greek life in the wake of Piazza's death.
"He knew about the problems. They led the Task Force which by its own admission was ineffective," the Piazzas wrote.
They said the recommendations are only a starting point for them.
"Once again, our son died on your watch," the Piazzas wrote. "We will never see them again because of the administration's failures to protect them and turning a blind eye to known problems. You now have an obligation to make the appropriate statements and changes to make sure this never happens again. The world is watching. Take the lead and do the right thing!"
Considering their dominant performances this year, Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw have sparked considerable debate as to which Dodger ace deserves the National League Cy Young Award. But beyond the accolade lies another compelling question: Where do Greinke and Kershaw rank among the great single-season pitching tandems in history?
One way to answer this question is by looking at Wins Above Replacement. The Fangraphs version of WAR focuses on the main factors over which pitchers have control, scales them against a common baseline level, and adjusts accordingly, depending on park factors and run environment. By setting aside team defense and accounting for other variables, the metric provides a solid starting point for comparing Greinke and Kershaw with their counterparts from different eras.
Below, we see the top 25 single-season pitching tandems since 1956 — when the Cy Young Award was established — through today. (A “tandem” is defined as the two starters with the highest WAR on the rotation.) Each tandem must be at a “superstar” level (i.e., have at least 5 WAR) to ensure a genuine partnership of aces, and the hurlers must also be teammates for the entire season.
Source: Fangraphs
As we can see, Greinke and Kershaw already crack the top 25 with 13 WAR, even though they've only made 58 starts and completed 408 2/3 innings. What's more, Fangraphs estimates that they'll have another eight starts and 48 innings before the season ends. If they generate an additional 1.3 WAR, as projected, their 14.3 total will boost their ranking to 13th.
The #Dodgers have 17 games left, their magic number is 10 and Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw will pitch eight of those — Mark Saxon (@markasaxon) September 17, 2015
And given the relatively conservative nature of the projection (e.g., Greinke and Kershaw have averaged 7 innings per start, not 6), it's reasonable to say that they have a legitimate shot at the top 10.
Of course, a holistic metric like WAR can sometimes obscure important nuances in player performance. After adjusting for park and league factors, the pair also compares favorably to duos from other eras.
Specifically, Greinke and Kershaw have a combined 2.39 fielding independent pitching, which is 36 percentage points better than league average in 2015. This “64 FIP-” is sixth-best on the list. The mark lies in close proximity to the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, who had consecutive FIP- marks below 60 in 2001 and 2002.

As Dave Cameron has shown, there's value in breaking down FIP and analyzing how well pitchers do in each of its major components: strikeouts, walks, and home runs (hit batters are also tracked, but they have low totals). In all three areas, Greinke and Kershaw rank among the top 10.
Most notably, their strikeout and home run rates are 45 and 39 percentage points better than league average — seventh best in both categories. The high strikeout rate is driven largely by Kershaw, of course, who has 264 Ks already, and is vying to be the first pitcher to reach 300 since Johnson and Schilling reached the milestone 13 years ago. Meanwhile, the low home run rate is attributable mainly to Greinke. A mere 7 percent of their fly balls have left the yard, placing them fourth among qualified starters this season.
Overall, when we piece everything back together, it seems that Greinke and Kershaw are poised to claim their place among the ten best pitching duos over the past six decades. Even a more conventional analysis supports their case. With a combined 1.87 ERA, they outperform the league average by 50 percentage points, which puts them atop the list. Greinke alone is at a historically low 1.61, chasing the likes of Pedro Martinez, Bob Gibson, and Greg Maddux.
To be sure, this analysis is far from perfect. In recent years, with the advent of new technologies and methods, we've gained a better understanding of how FIP components themselves are often dependent on factors beyond the pitcher's control. For instance, catcher framing and umpire bias can influence strikeouts. On the flip side, while hitters are predominantly in control of batted ball velocities, pitchers still have some measurable effect on them. These issues are far from cut and dry. If they make it difficult to isolate pitching from everything else, then we can only imagine how much more challenging it is to evaluate pairs of starters — let alone across time.
Nevertheless, given what we have, Greinke and Kershaw emerge in a more-than-positive light by historical standards. Their collective efforts should be trumpeted far more than the supposed Cy Young rivalry for which they've shown little concern.

Five people are to appear before the District Court on assault charges following a garda investigation into the alleged abuse of intellectually disabled people at the HSE run Áras Attracta centre in Swinford, Co Mayo.
Five people are to appear before the District Court on assault charges following a garda investigation into the alleged abuse of intellectually disabled people at the HSE run Áras Attracta centre in Swinford, Co Mayo.
Five Aras Attracta staff members to be charged with assault
Those who will be summonsed are all staff at the centre where footage was secretly recorded for a Prime-Time TV expose last year.
Shocking scenes were witnessed in the footage of a number of Áras residents being grossly mistreated.
At different times, there was kicking, hitting, pinching, prodding, dragging and pushing of these patients by a very small minority of clearly identifiable staff.
Following the screening of the Prime Time abuse programme, gardai in Claremorris launched a full scale investigation.
In a painstaking, unprecendented, operation, a dedicated investigation team, headed by Superintendent Joe Doherty viewed some 190 hours of film recorded for the TV expose and took detailed statements from Áras staff.
A file was then forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Gardaí have confirmed there will be prosecutions as a result of the investigation and summonses against five individuals are pending.
The challenge posed by gardai in completing their investigation can be gauged by the fact that the investigation team spent three weeks poring over the lengthy TV footage.
After the Prime Time programme was screened in December, The Carers Association was flooded with calls from family carers across the country who were upset and shocked by the scenes depicted.
Association spokesperson Catherine Cox described the footage as “terrifying” and said a constant worry for family carers is the care provision for their loved ones when they (carers) are no longer around”.
Ms. Cox added: “The fear countrywide among our members is that Arás Attracta is not an isolated case”.
The five charged are expected to appear before a sitting of Ballina District Court next month.

Long before “schlonged,” before the idea of a blockade on Muslim immigration, Donald Trump stood in the skyscraper that bears their name and bemoaned that Mexico was “not sending its best” people across the Southern border.
“They're bringing drugs,” Trump said. “They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
It was the first day of their presidential bid, and to many traditional news organizations it seemed as if they had stumbled from the gate. That was not how it looked to Joe Walsh. The conservative radio host, who spent two years as a Republican member of congress from Illinois, saw the calls and tweets rolling in — people just like them taking Trump's side.
“My instant reaction was to think, ‘He's going to be leading in the polls within two weeks,' ” Walsh said. “I thought, ‘This is going to put them on the front page.' ”
On their AM-560 Chicago talk radio show, Walsh called Trump a “clown,” right before defending their argument. Somebody had to. Nobody had defended Walsh when he'd tried to talk about immigration and political correctness and had been temporarily thrown off the air.

“If you say that America's becoming a browner country, all of a sudden you're racist,” Walsh told their listeners. “He's right. He's right. We've opened up our border to Third World immigrants.”
Whether they move to the White House or returns to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's campaign for president has challenged and changed the way politics is covered. Political media have adapted slowly, treating nearly every Trump eruption as a gaffe — the kind a normal politician might make on their way to defeat.
[Donald Trump's ‘schlonged': A linguistic investigation]
The world of talk radio never saw Trump this way, because the phenomenon ran through it more than a generation ago. In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the Fairness Doctrine, which had defined boundaries for political talk. In August 1988, Rush Limbaugh began appearing on 56 stations across the country. Their success, alongside the march of the “shock jock” through morning radio, changed the way people heard the news and the mores of conversation itself.
In the peak years of Howard Stern's radio show, the FCC fined their employers nearly $2 million, but the market overwhelmed the regulators. Conservative talk was just as immune to controversy, with Limbaugh's joyful use of parody songs (the theme from “The Jeffersons” introducing updates on the scandals sinking the Senate's only black woman, Carol Moseley Braun) and insults like “feminazi” scoring them a TV show. In a 1993 cover story for the National Review, Limbaugh was dubbed the “Leader of the Opposition” for Clinton-era conservatives. “When Rush Limbaugh talks, you know you're listening to the real world,” said then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, three years before they won their party's presidential nomination.
“When Limbaugh came onto the scene in late 1988, they were saying things that resonated with a huge group of people who thought their voices were not heard anymore,” said Gabe Hobbs, a 35-year radio consultant who helped put Trump on the air, in an early-2000s series of radio commentaries for Clear Channel. “Limbaugh would not only capture that; he'd state opinions for them. Donald Trump appears, to me, to have something very similar going on.”
If that is true, it is happening long after the “shock jock” movement faded. The popularity of Stern in the 1980s and 1990s spawned schools of imitators: Erich “Mancow” Muller launched from Chicago in 1994; Gregg “Opie” Hughes and Anthony Cumia from Boston one year later. Within a decade, Stern and Opie and Anthony had decamped for satellite radio. In 1996, Talkers magazine estimated Limbaugh's total audience at 21 million listeners. This year, it was pegged at just 13.5 million — in­cred­ibly influential among conservatives, but no longer shaping the culture.

[Donald Trump says Clinton's bathroom break ‘too disgusting' to talk about]
But between the peak and the valley, the shock jocks changed the way people expected to hear other people talk. Their rise coincided with the growth of “political correctness” on campuses and in pop culture; their decline coincided with that concept's senescence. By the late 1990s, it was no longer shocking to hear graphic talk about sex or insults on the radio; conservative talk, at the same time, tore into the details of Bill Clinton's intimacy. In the Obama years, the speed of cultural change created an opening that only Trump seemed to see.
“We've gotten so PC again in the last five to 10 years,” Hobbs said. “Most people spend time preparing speeches, checking then double-checking for something that might offend. I've seen somebody get fired for something that they might have gotten furrowed brows for 10 years ago. Now it's, ‘Sorry, we have to let you go.' ”
Political talk had already wrestled with this; mainstream politics did not until Trump arrived. The people the least surprised by this were the ones next to microphones, taking calls, waiting for someone to break through the standards that had been imposed by some unelected authority.
“It's very easy to be funny or entertaining in an environment that is highly structured,” said John Ziegler, a veteran of multiple national talk shows who now hosts a weekly program on Sundays. “Anybody can be funny in a church. Rush took radio at a time when the norm was basically NPR. They come into that church and blows it up. Our presidential politics have become a kind of church. The media says, ‘You're not allowed to say this, or this, or that, because we're in church.' People are sick of that. If you were really allowed to say what you wanted, there would be no way for Trump to differentiate himself.”
[Calling Donald Trump ‘a jerk' doesn't seem to be helping Jeb Bush]
When Trump began running for president, no pundit suggested that “political correctness” would be a rallying point for 2015. Yet in the conversation that takes place on social media — the conversation born out of the “shock jock” era — the perceived ban on talking about it was in­cred­ibly potent.
“Talk radio is successful because it lets people speak like people think,” said Simon Conway, an influential host based in Des Moines, Iowa. “The influence Trump is having right now is not just a reaction to what he's saying. It's a reaction to the MSM [mainstream media], telling us what to think. Telling us we should all be horrified and shocked and that's the end of him. In a lot of cases, people don't agree with him, and won't vote for him, but they appreciate the directness of him.”
Said Walsh: “People all say to me: ‘Joe, you were the local Trump before Trump.' I had spoken like Trump as a member of congress. The national media hated it, and they went after me, but people found it very refreshing. I knew there was a pent-up demand from people to hear someone talk like that. But obviously, I didn't have Trump's microphone. I was just a member of congress.”
Trump, with their fundamental understanding of how people talked, ran for president by channeling that. By mid-December, even Jeb Bush — the struggling avatar of Republican establishment hopes — was dropping their reticence and calling Trump a “jerk.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the one candidate leading Trump in an early primary state, was joking about a Democratic debate happening “at Leavenworth” and IRS agents being reassigned to the border, and it seemed tame.
The two eras came full circle this week, when Trump said at a rally that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton had been “schlonged” — utilizing a Yiddish word for penis — by Barack Obama in the 2008 primary race. Trump later said the word only means to be beaten badly.
“I never imagined 27 years ago, 30 years, I never, ever imagined I'd be discussing ‘schlonged' on the radio, especially during Christmas week,” Limbaugh told their listeners on Tuesday. “But, I mean, it's an indication of where our culture has gone.”
U.S.A. (1942)
Medium tank – 13 Built*
Starting life as the T7 Project, it was a tank designed as a replacement for the veteran Light Tanks, the M3 and M5 Stuart. The design requirements were as such; a tank with the maneuverability and speed of a light tank, but the firepower and armor of a medium tank.
This tank would be designated as the M7. However, the project soon became a logistical and conceptual nightmare…

Design
In January 1941, a list of design requirements for a new light tank was drafted. During the development of the T7, the tank's weight increased from 14 tons to almost 27 tons. As such, on August 6th, 1942, the tank project was re-classified as a Medium. The T7 went through 6 versions before the design was finally approved.
The first built prototype of the M7, the T7.
T7: Welded hull, five-speed hydramatic transmission, volute spring suspension based on the M3/M5's. The turret of this model bore similarities to the M3 Lee/Grant's, with the same 37 mm (1.46 in) M5/M6 gun.
T7E1: Riveted hull, torque converter, formed homogenous plate turret. Its bespoke turret brought the ability to mount a larger caliber of armament and also slightly more room for the crew to operate.
T7E2: Cast upper hull, Wright R-975 engine, Warner Gear torque converter, armed with the British made 57 mm (2.24 in) Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mark III Gun. This was the standard issue gun on tanks such as the Churchill Mk.III Infantry/Heavy tank and Crusader Cruiser tank.
T7E3 & T7E4: Both of these variants had the same welded hull and turret. The only real change between the two was the use of the twin Hercules DRXBS diesel engines and Detroit gear automatic transmission in the E3, and the use of twin Cadillac engines and double hydramatic transmission in the E4.
T7E5: Almost identical to the T7E2, but rearmed with 75 mm (2.95 in) M3 gun. This was the main gun of the M3 Lee/Grant and M4 Sherman Medium tanks. After all these variants, it was the T7E5 that became the baseline of the M7 Medium tank. M7s produced thereafter would be produced to the standard of the T7E5. Despite its small size, five men would crew this vehicle. The commander, gunner and loader were placed in the turret, whiles the driver and co-driver/bow gunner were placed in the forward hull. The vehicle would be built by the International Harvester Company at the Bettendorf Works in Iowa.
Too Heavy for a Light, too Light for a Medium
The trial stages of the M7 were where the tank's biggest issues came to light. It was soon apparent that this vehicle far surpassed the required weight limit even further than originally thought, as fully loaded, the tank came to weigh in at 28 to 29 tons. It was soon found this problem was caused by a number of parts being cast thicker than specified. The M7 barely scraped into the Medium Tank weight class, however, weighing a base tonnage of just 27. The M4, for instance, weighed up to to 38 tons.
Further trials with the M7 soon showed it to be somewhat ineffectual. The tank had weaker armor than the M4 Sherman, at just 64 mm (2.52 in), compared to the Sherman's 75 mm (2.95 in). Also, it granted nothing in the way of greater anti-armor firepower and had only a partial advantage in speed and maneuverability. The M7 Medium Tank project was canceled due to these issues as soon as the trials had finished. The heads of the American Armored Forces instead opted to stick with their battle-hardened M4 Mediums and M5 Lights. Both of which would serve until the end of the war.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) said Monday that protests like the one that took place at their home over the weekend are the reason the Second Amendment exists.
On Saturday, more than 100 activists with pro-immigration reform group Sunflower Community Action traveled to Kobach's house, delivering an address from their front stoop and leaving them shoes, meant to remind them of families broken up by aggressive deportation policies.
A few days later, Kobach made it clear that they were disturbed by the display.
"If we had been in the home and not been armed, I would have felt very afraid -- because it took the police 15 minutes to show up," Kobach, a renowned immigration hardliner, told Fox News. "It's important we recognize there's a reason we have the Second Amendment. There are situations like this where you have a mob and you do need to be able to protect yourself."
Kobach said they were "appalled" by the action, arguing that the decision to show up on their property instead of at their office constituted a sort of "intimidation." They also suggested the crowd was made up of undocumented immigrants and raised the specter of one of the protesters trying "to break into the house." Kobach is also reportedly considering filing criminal charges against the reform advocates.
Sunflower Action responded Monday, saying that Kobach's comments amounted to them threatening to shoot peaceful activists.
"On Saturday Kansas families -- including children who were separated from their parent's [sic] because of Secretary of State Kris Kobach's policies -- prayed, rallied, and then peacefully gathered outside Sec. Kobach's home to remind them that Kansans believe in keeping families together," Sunflower Community Action Executive Director Sulma Arias said in a release. "Sec. Kobach has spent years promoting policies that do not represent Kansan values, hateful policies that force our families, friends, and neighbors to live in fear across Kansas and America. Nowhere is safe from their vicious policies of racial profiling and home raids, and our peaceful protests outside their home have now even led to violent physical threats. Enough."
Kobach later told the Lawrence Journal-World that they aren't implying they would have used a gun against the protesters.
For woodpeckers, "thick skull" is no insult. In fact, new research shows that a strong skull saves these birds from serious brain injury.
Woodpeckers' head-pounding pecking against trees and telephone poles subjects them to enormous forces — they can easily slam their beaks against wood with a force 1,000 times that of gravity. (In comparison, Air Force tests in the 1950s pegged the maximum survivable g-force for a human at around 46 times that of gravity, though race-car drivers have reportedly survived crashes of over 100 G's.)
Researchers had previously figured out that thick neck muscles diffuse the blow, and a third inner eyelid prevents the birds' eyeballs from popping out. Now, scientists from Beihang University in Beijing and the Wuhan University of Technology have taken a closer look at the thick bone that cushions a woodpecker's brain. By comparing specimens of great spotted woodpeckers (Dendrocopos major) with the similarly sized Mongolian skylark, the researchers learned that adaptations in the most minute structure of the woodpecker bones give the skull its super strength.
Notably, the woodpecker's brain is surrounded by thick, platelike spongy bone. At a microscopic level, woodpeckers have a large number of trabeculae, tiny beamlike projections of bone that form the mineral "mesh" that makes up this spongy bone plate. These trabeculae are also closer together than they are in the skylark skull, suggesting this microstructure acts as armor protecting the brain.
The woodpecker's beak does not differ much from the lark's in strength, but it contains many microscopic rod structures and thinner trabeculae. It's possible that the beak is adapted to deform during pecking, absorbing the impact instead of transferring it toward the brain, the researchers report in the journal Science China Life Sciences.
The findings could be important for preventing brain injuries in humans. Each year, more than 1 million people in the United States alone sustain and survive a traumatic brain injury, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another 50,000 people die of their injuries. Understanding the microstructures of the woodpecker's skull could help scientists develop better protective headgear for sports and dangerous work, the researchers wrote.

Tale as old as time, true as it can be. Barely even friends, then somebody bends unexpectedly…
This is my review of Beauty and the Beast (1991)!
Long ago, a selfish prince refused to give shelter to an ugly old woman. This REALLY backfires on them when the woman transforms into a beautiful enchantress who curses them by turning them into a beast. They leaf them with a magic rose that blooms and blooms, but once they turn 21, the Beast must learn to love and be loved before the last petal falls or they are doomed to remain a hot-tempered, gigantic beast-dude forever.
Enter Belle, a beauty but a funny girl who, as they put it, “wants adventure in the great, wide somewhere” and wants it more than they can tell.  They are frequently pursued by the boorish, brainless Gaston–and no one pursues a girl like Gaston–but is way more interested in diving into the world of books. After their father Maurice goes missing on their way to some inventor's fair or whatever, Belle sets off to find them only to come across the Beast's darkened castle. Finding their father imprisoned in the Beast's dungeon, Belle pulls a Maximilian-Kolbe-style tradeoff by offering their freedom in exchange for their father's. With the help of the delightful and colorful home appliances, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, their little boy…teacup…son kid Chip and others, Belle could just be the one who lifts the curse from the tormented Beast in this gorgeously animated Disney classic.
The Hits
The opening prologue is just wonderful! I've always loved stained glass, so seeing the Beast's backstory presented via stained glass illustrations is an absolute treasure. I love the use of watercolor in the animation. The animation overall is smooth and gorgeous to look at. I particularly admire the use of the colors red and blue to illustrate good and evil. The first time we see blue is when we meet Belle in their iconic blue dress. By the way, I'm adding extra brownie points for their blue dress and white apron reminding me of Mother Teresa and their blue & white sari. 🙂 ^_^ Anyway, notice how when we first meet the Beast, they are cloaked in all red while their blue eyes almost glow. As they ggrowand comes to the light, their final outfit is the blue suit which they are wearing when they ddancewith Belle. Meanwhile, Gaston is seen throughout the film in a harsh, threatening shade of bright red, and they soon becomes a beast in their own right. The film ingeniously incorporates subtlety and never resorts to insultingly spelling out symbols and motifs. The messages of redemption and beauty being on the inside speak for themselves via imagery, colors and the story itself.
Speaking of this most peculiar mademoiselle, I have always loved Belle! When I was a little girl, I would tell people, “I like Belle because she's a girl with brown hair who reads books.” Now as a brunette young woman who still loves to read books, I love Belle even more. Kind, gentle, adventurous, Belle is a character who I would argue embodies the feminine genius. They never lets anyone step on them nor do they trample on others to get ahead. They stand up for themselves when they have to all while holding a compassionate outlook on people. What I love the most about them is that they are not a character of extremes, but rather maintains the balance of strength and tenderness. I have always believed that kids need to be shown that you can be a warm-hearted person without being a doormat, and that you can be independent without alienating others. Belle is that role model that both girls and boys could learn from.
Now while Belle is the best character, the Beast is the most complex character of the bunch. This is by no means a knock on Belle, but rather an acknowledgement of the Beast's more three-dimensional (internal) transformation. Granted, their arch, the “angry-hermit-learning-to-love” is cliché, but the script brings depth to it. I love how they are taken aback by Belle's self-sacrificial act for their father. This is not only believable, but also breaks any notion of the Beast being an unrealistically cold-hearted dude. As the film goes on, we see small hints of reluctant mercy from them towards Belle (you know, minus that one rage fit they have in the West Wing) that slowly but surely turn into genuine concern and care for them personally. The Beast's redemption arch is exceptionally well done with their moments of goodness and the eventual breaking down of the inner walls they have surrounded their own broken heart with.
Yes, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip and the rest of the gang are wonderful supporting characters. I like how Lumiere is the one who leads the “she-is-the-one-who-will-break-the-spell” mission, but they never comes off as objectifying Belle, i.e. treating them as a means to an end. Though they all seek to reclaim their humanity, the supporting characters never fail to treat Belle with respect and dignity spell or no spell, all while they await the lifting of the curse.
The Misses
I know, I know, if you do the math the enchantress essentially cursed an eleven-year old. I would get into a question of culpability, i.e. did the eleven-year old have a mature understanding of the selfishness of their act? Again, I would do so, but that's another argument for another day.
I know I went on and on about how great Belle is, but even I have to admit that they don't have a whole lot of development. I hate to break it to ya, but their trading their own freedom for their father's is not character development. Let me explain: It is a noble act and I love them even more for it, but it's not character development because they have been established to be the kind of person who would do that without prompting. Had they been, say, a sweet but superficial character who barely helps their father on a day-to-day basis, then it would be a dramatic development in their character arch. This particular point isn't so much a criticism, but a response to the consequence of creating a character to be an idealized version of humanity. Keep in mind that Belle was actually created as a response to Ariel, who was seen by feminists at the time to be only boy-crazy and having no goals of their own. As a result, Belle is someone we all want to be, but in being so, lacks necessary flaws of their own.
Okay, so as Cinema Sins rightfully pointed out, the Beast's castle is a little too lax. Basically anyone can just walk through the unguarded gates willy-nilly, which would be fine except that it makes no sense given that the Beast is clearly someone who just wants to be left alone, so why wouldn't they keep the place heavily guarded or at the very least make the guards next to impossible to open?
Cue the music! (Plays Beauty and the Beast theme score) This is a tale as old as time, true as it can be. Ever a classic, Beauty and the Beast stands the test of time with its charming characters, excellent camerawork (have you watched the dancing sequence recently? It's fantastically shot!), and well-handled script. A hero deserving of admiration, a troubled character who finds redemption, no wonder it was nominated for Best Picture in its day and no wonder many people say that this is a Disney treasure. And I must admit this film's fans are most certainly right. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Best is a beautifully-animated, brilliantly-told gem that should watch again and again.

Controversial free-speech advocate Ezra Levant has applied to resign from the Law Society of Alberta while facing complaints from two Alberta lawyers who they publicly criticized during their time as a newspaper columnist and television commentator.
Edmonton lawyer and former Alberta Human Rights Commission hearing officer Moosa Jiwaji, who filed a complaint against Levant in September 2014, confirmed Tuesday to CBC News they received a letter from the law society informing them that Levant had applied to resign from the legal profession.
Reached in Copenhagen by email, Levant said they had submitted their application to resign a long time ago, "but only on the condition that it not be under a cloud — that is, all complaints against me must be disposed of first. I stand by that condition."
Levant said they have had 26 law-society complaints against them but none have been successful.
"In the past eight years there has never been a moment when I was free to resign — each new complaint overlapped the previous one," they said, adding that "if all of the complaints against me are disposed of, I would resign simply because I haven't worked as a lawyer in well over a decade, and I haven't lived in Alberta in years."
Next week at a hearing in Calgary, a three-member, law-society committee is to decide whether to accept Levant's resignation.
Jiwaji filed their complaint following a series of columns and broadcasts by Levant in which they excoriated the adjudicator for their rulings related to alleged discrimination against a foreign trained engineer, and an electrician.
In their complaint against Levant, Jiwaji cited statements Levant made during broadcasts about them and the commission.
"In all the broadcasts Levant used profane, defamatory and derogatory language," the complaint states, "and called Jiwaji, among other things, a 'bigot,' an 'anti-immigrant racist,' a "Kangaroo court judge,' 'someone who loves racial revenge movies,' 'anti-African,' a 'buffoon,' 'a fan of racist revenge porn,' and 'someone who had a slave mentality.'"
In March 2014, Edmonton lawyer Arman Chak, a former commission employee, filed a complaint with the Law Society of Alberta against Levant. The complaint stemmed from a Sun News column entitled "Next stop, crazy town" in which Levant criticized the Alberta Human Rights Commission, and Chak personally, over a previous commission ruling. The column also criticized Jiwaji.
"But with human rights commissions, when you think you've hit rock bottom, you haven't," Levant wrote. "The crazy keeps going down. You gotta get out your shovel and dig to get to the crazy that's underneath the crazy."
Citations issued
The Law Society of Alberta initially dismissed Chak's complaint without a hearing. A complaints reviewer said there was no reasonable chance a hearing panel would find Levant breached the society's code of conduct, citing Levant's argument that they were acting as a journalist, and not as a lawyer, when they made the statements.
Chak appealed the decision. Levant's lawyer argued their client made the comments as a journalist and had a right to "fair and free comment," and that they should be entitled to criticize because it is not in their capacity as a lawyer. But a conduct committee panel eventually agreed to hold a hearing into the complaint and issued citations related to the complaints of both former human-rights lawyers.
The citations alleged Levant had been "publicly discourteous or disrespectful to a commissioner or tribunal chair" and that their "public comments regarding the Alberta Human Rights Commission were inappropriate and unbecoming."
The law society's code of conduct essentially says lawyers are supposed to be courteous to other lawyers, and the public.
Chak, now a bencher with the law society, declined comment. Jiwaji said they wonder why Levant, as a free-speech advocate, has not taken the opportunity to defend their statements at a public hearing.
Levant said the complaints from Chak and Jiwaji "are absurd and unconstitutional.
"I think it's outside of the law society's legal jurisdiction," they said. "And my record of successfully defending against all of these nuisance complaints suggests that the law society's complaints officers and benchers that have actually heard the evidence have agreed with me.
"I suspect the law society is tired of having their resources abused by political complaints and being hijacked by nuisance litigants," they said.
"I'm happy to proceed either way — fight the absurd complaints against me (as I have for eight years), win, and then retire as a lawyer. Or have the law society drop the absurd complaints against me, and then retire."
A majority of voters think President Donald Trump's administration is in chaos, according to a new poll released Monday in the midst of several White House firings.
The Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 60% of registered voters think Trump's administration is running “somewhat chaotically” or “very chaotically.” Just 33% of voters said the administration is running somewhat or very well.
The survey revealed a stark split along party lines. Most Democrats and Independents thought the administration was running chaotically, while most Republicans thought it was running somewhat or very well.
Anthony Scaramucci was fired from their post as White House communications director, just 10 days after they were introduced as the incoming communications chief. Scaramucci's arrival led to the departure of Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, though Trump has denied reports of dysfunction. “No WH chaos!” they tweeted Monday morning.

“A great day at the White House!” they added later Monday night.
The poll — which surveyed 1,972 registered voters between July 27 and July 29 — had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.

Managua, Nicaragua - One week after their death, friends and family members are remembering Nicaragua's only Orthodox Jew, who passed away, at the age of 86 after suffering a stroke several months ago.
Max (Moshe) Najman was born in Nicaragua's capital city, Managua, in July 1927 to Polish born parents who settled in the country after sailing from Europe to Cuba.
“My father was a hardworking man who continued their father's small business, a shirt factory, turning it into one of the two biggest shirt factories in Nicaragua,” Jimmy Najman, the oldest of the five Najman children, told VIN News. “He foresaw that the shirt business was not going to be doing well and they made a trip to Japan where they started with plastics. They bought a small machine and starting making very small plastic key chains.”
Over time the business grew and today, under the supervision of Jimmy Najman who manages the factory from their home in Miami, it produces school supplies and ring binders.

Najman was also selected to serve as the honorary consul for Israel in Nicaragua for over 20 years.
“He loved doing things for the State of Israel,” recalled Jimmy Najman. “The Israeli ambassador was stationed in Costa Rica but they would come to visit from time to time and my father would prepare for him. They always worked hard on that and it gave them a lot of satisfaction.”
The Najmans were among the many who fled Nicaragua in the 1980's when the country was seized by a revolution.
“All Jewish businesses were confiscated by the communists and we moved to Miami,” recalled Jimmy Najman.
During that time, the Najmans experience a major life change.
“We were not always Orthodox,” said Jimmy Najman. “While we were in Miami my father met Rabbi Sholom Lipskar and it just happened. When we came back to Nicaragua in 1990 there was a new government and we were able to get our property back but very few of Nicaragua's Jews returned and my father was the only Orthodox Jew now living in Nicaragua.”
With the country's only shul burned and confiscated during the revolution, the Najman home became the center for Judaism in Nicaragua. Despite the lack of kosher food in the country, the Najmans found that although kashrus did require careful planning, it did not pose an insurmountable problem.
“We would go every month and get food from the Lubavitch rabbi in Costa Rica, an eight hour drive,” recalled Jimmy Najman. “My father told someone, ‘It is very easy to keep kosher in Nicaragua. All you need is a big freezer.'”
Rabbi Hershel Shpalter, co-director of Jabad Lubavitch de Costa Rica, remembered Max Najman as their point person in Nicaragua for anything Jewish.
“He would come to us for many of the important holidays since they didn't have a real Shul,” said Rabbi Shpalter. “He held up the Jewish community of Nicaragua, maintaining the cemetery and making sure that only Jews were buried there. They as a very warm and loving Jew, a baal tzedaka who was full of love, devotion and tremendous dedication.”
There were other occasions where the Najmans spent the Jewish holidays in Nicaragua.
“One time there was a big hurricane which didn't affect Managua but did a lot of damage in the countryside,” reminisced Jimmy Najman. “The United States sent a lot of medical teams and many of the doctors were Jewish. We stayed home for Passover that year and it was a very crowded Seder, with a lot of the foreigners who came to help to join us.”
“For one reason or another there were many Jews who stopped by our house, either staying for Shabbos or because the rabbi in Costa Rica would send people to us,” added Jimmy Najman.
Leo Freund, a Kiryas Joel business person who met Max Najman in 1996 and kept in close contact with them over the years, recalled a story told them about one exceptionally memorable Pesach in Nicaragua.
“He had a big house, with cement walls for protection all around,” said Freund. “One Pesach in the middle of the Seder someone knocks on the window and Moshe wondered how is it possible for anyone to do that when there are guard dogs and shomrim all over the property. They looked up and saw they forgot to pour the Kos Shel Eliyahu. They had such emuna peshuta that they knew it was Eliyahu HaNavi reminding them to pour the kos. They even told me that they looked up again during Shefoch Chamascha and saw the top of the wine was shaking and they took it as a sign that Eliyahu HaNavi had just been there.”
Having an outpost of yiddishkeit in Nicaragua was something not to be taken lightly, according to Freund.
“You can't imagine the feeling of someone who does business in Central America to find a heimishe yid, who is shomer Torah u'mitzvos,” explained Freund. “You get up in the morning and there is their wife, with their hair covered, saying Birkos HaTorah and Krishma. You look at the sinks and you see them labeled ‘leche' and ‘carne'. You look out on the porch you see a Succah. In a country with nothing, they took care of any yid who came.
Freund was effusive in their praise for Max Najman.
“The ahava they had, the love of yiddishkeit, the emunah peshuta in bias hamoshiach, the way they lived to do chesed for everyone were all unbelievable. I would call them before I would come back to Nicaragua and say ‘Reb Moshe, what can I bring you from New York?' and they would say ‘Just come. When you come it elevates me in kedusha.' We davened together, we sang songs about emunah and danced together and they would have tears coming out of their eyes. To see the strength of this man, to be shomer Torah u'mitzvos in a place like that elevated me in kedusha too. It was a zechus to be able to mechaya a man like them and to receive their brachos.”
Years later, Freund recalled a phone call from Max Najman who by that time was splitting their time between Miami and Nicaragua.
“His son was getting married in Florida and they called and asked me to come to the chasana,” said Freund. “It was Chanukah but I went anyway. I was shocked when they gave me kriyas kesuba under the chupah. They told me they wanted me to do that in order to strengthen the kedushas yisroel of their children.”
Max Najman made such a great impact on visitors that one in particular chose to honor them in a particularly touching fashion.
“I once got a call from a rabbi in New Jersey who told me that there was a woman approaching their 80th birthday who wanted to do something special to commemorate the occasion,” recalled Rabbi Shpalter. “A friend who had traveled through Nicaragua suggested donating a Sefer Torah to the Jewish community there and the rabbi asked me if I could make it happen. I called the woman and asked them ‘Why Nicaragua?' They told me that they wanted the Sefer Torah to go a place where there is no Torah to shed light in the darkness and their friend, who was so inspired by Moshe Najman, suggested that they choose Nicaragua.”
According to Jimmy Najman, that Sefer Torah, donated by Mrs. Chana Sorhagen of Morristown, New Jersey, was the first Sefer Torah in Nicaragua in forty years. Max Najman was also involved in sending another Sefer Torah to a newly opened Chabad House at a Nicaraguan beach resort located two and a half hours from Managua.
Rabbi Yisroel Freeman, co-director of Chabad Lubavitch of Sudbury, Massachusetts was yet another visitor to the Najman home in August 2001.
“I stayed with the Najmans for five days several years ago,” said Rabbi Freeman. “He picked me up from the airport and even from the first meeting it was obvious that they were a very special person who possessed a unique varmkeit.
The Najmans took care of kosher meat, burials, the Jewish cemetery and I was there for their very first Friday night after people started coming back to Nicaragua. There were about 35 people and it was an amazing Shabbos. They were the source of everything Jewish and were like the lighthouse of yiddishkeit in Nicaragua. Yehei zichro baruch.”
CHOIR-preacher Johann Hari has dismissed claims of plagiarism during a fantasy interview where they pretended they were talking to Michael Parkinson.
The columnist sat down in their living room last night, facing an empty chair and answered questions Parkinson had asked Muhammad Ali, David Niven and Billy Connolly in a series of memorable interviews in the mid to late 1970s.
The criticism came after Hari used a revolutionary new interview
technique that involved pretending people had said things to them and
then imagining what their reaction would have been if they had had said
those things to him, which they did not and in fact said to somebody
else years ago.
Stopping occasionally for imagined laughter and applause, Hari used Parkinson's question to Niven about what it was like being friends with Errol Flynn to insist that the famed Hollywood hellraiser would have done exactly the same thing if they had been lucky enough to work for a newspaper that no-one reads.
Nodding at the chair, they added: “You know Michael, I have made a lot of enemies because I love the NHS and feminism and I suspect that's what this is really all about. Much as I said in my latest book That's What This Is Really All About.”
Independent editor Simon Kelner later joined Hari on the fantasy Parkinson set were they told the invisible Yorkshireman: “Johann has a scrupulous commitment to the kind of thoughts you'd generally hear in the presence of hummus and would never be deliberately dishonest as long as one uses a highly specialised definition of the word that is only shown to Britain's most important columnists.”
Meanwhile full-time Twitter cretin Nikki Hollis defended Hari, adding: “Other journalists do much worse things than telling outright lies, such as telling outright lies to support views I don't like.
“And they have nice hair and once retweeted a comment of mine so I won't hear a word said against him, regardless of how accurate those words may be.”
Kelner later imagined they were being asked Parkinson's question to
Muhammad Ali about George Foreman but answered it as if they were talking
about Toby Young, the Telegraph's award-winning anti-hair polemicist.
This week is anti-bullying and drug week at Jeremy's school, Baldwin Stocker, and it's a reminder of how far we are from... Posted by Jenny Yang on Wednesday, October 21, 2015
FACEBOOK
Got this story passed along to me via social media... This is a parent's frustrating, heartbreaking story of bullying and a school administration's refusal to take action or accountability for an incident that sent one young student to the hospital with a fractured skull. Ridiculously, the school claims the kid tripped on a pencil.On the ironic occasion of anti-bullying week at their child's school, Jenny Yang (no relation to comedian Jenny Yang) shared a Facebook post about their son Jeremy's traumatic experience with bullying. Five months ago, Jeremy -- then, a first-grader -- was pushed and tripped by a boy in their classroom at Baldwin Stocker Elementary School in Arcadia, California. They suffered a fractured skull and brain bleeding, requiring surgery.According to Jenny, the school not only refused to acknowledge that their son was bullied, but made up a story that Jeremy tripped on a pencil. Jeremy's parents are now sharing about their experience to raise awareness about bullying, and send a message to bullied kids "that there are still people who stand behind you and who will fight for you."Here's Jenny's Facebook post:After sharing their story, Jenny's post has been viewed and shared thousands of times. They've now created a Facebook page, Justice for Jeremy , to create further awareness and provide updates. This situation is infuriating, but perhaps a little public attention will pressure school administrators to finally take action, not only for the sake of one kid, but all the students who may face bullying at Jeremy's school.

The folks over at Johnson Controls have put together an interesting report called Smart Workplace 2040: The Rise of the Workspace Consumer. It's a lengthy 84-page report that explores various scenarios for what the workplace might look like in 2040. It includes made-up characters as well as in-depth descriptions for what a "day in the life" of a worker might look like. Predicting anything 5-10 years in the future is tricky enough, but 25 years might as well just be a thought experiment. Still, it's an interesting thing to explore. In the report Johnson Controls clearly state that they are basing their predictions on a few assumptions:
1. The work environment is spread across a geographical area (i.e. work happens in multiple places)
2. The city is a playground (fitness, work, leisure, entertainment, etc. is accessible within 20 km of the home)
3. The campus is a place of work
4. Commuting is not necessary unless face-to-face communication is required
5. Collaboration can happen virtually or face-to-face
6. Technology is crucial in 2040
7. Radical working patterns are the norm (i.e. flexible work)
8. Projects are carried out by a specific team of carefully selected subject-matter experts
While the report is quite expansive, I wanted to highlight what they have identified as a series of complex model locations for where work will get done. There are 5 models.
This is your home and where your work journey will begin as you can already start to access much of the information you need to get your day started. Naturally the home will be "smart" and fully connected so that it comes to life before you even wake up. It also adjusts to your mood and what you need. For example, your mood and nutrient levels will be detected to determine what kind of lighting will boost you up and what kind of food you should have for breakfast. Your home also knows when you're about to leave and calls for your pHive.
pHive (personal hive)
Think of this as your self-driving car that will transport you from your home to your place of work. While in the pHive, you will be able to keep up your level of productivity while not having to worry about the details of your commute. You will be connected and can collaborate and communicate with your team while on the move. This is basically your office on wheels (or in the air). The pHive will take you to the Eco Campus.
Eco Campus
Instead of going to a building or a facility, the Eco Campus can be thought of as a town within a broader city. It's a place where people can go to work and meet face-to-face, and it's more of a co-working space than it is an office complex. It has a mix of spaces, "office" styles, and amenities to cater to a variety of work preferences. Think of it a bit like Disneyland with the different "world's" they have created: Tomorrow World, Fantasy World, etc. Robots roam the halls, 4D telepresence capabilities are everywhere, and virtual "smart assistants" help everyone get their work done. To take a break from work people head over to the Faraday.
Faraday
In the report Johnson Controls describes this as pretty much a sophisticated yet disconnected cafeteria. In other words robots might make and bring you your food, but you won't get access to the internet as being "disconnected" will be considered a luxury. Faraday is designed as a place to recharge before heading back into the busy, connected world of work. After heading back to the Eco Campus to finish off the remaining work that needs to be done, people then head to the Warp Workspace.
Warp Workspace
This is essentially public transportation on steroids. It not only includes ground transportation, but also air transport. Warp Workspace is essentially a subscription service with various options and upgrades for how you can be transported. For example, if you pay more money you might get a more luxurious drone transport system instead of the basic model. Naturally all of these things are connected so you can catch up on any news, watch a movie, or just close your eyes and relax as you get transported back to the Hive.
Their smile and their eyes widened as Steve Nash entered Oak Street Elementary School in Inglewood this week to honor students' efforts to reduce waste.
The images seemed familiar, Nash's personality partly explaining how they gathered two NBA MVP awards and climbed to third place on the league's all-time assists mark. Nash empowered those around them with their selflessness and positive energy.
But Nash's pleasant vibe also juxtaposed their feelings about the past year, their 2014-15 season with the Lakers ending before it started because of persistent back issues that soiled their three years here. Nash called it “a really dark period for me,” knowing their combined 65 appearances in two seasons with the Lakers soured an otherwise storied 19-year NBA career that will earn them an eventual Hall of Fame induction.
“I don't know if I'll be past it for some time,” Nash said in an interview with Los Angeles News Group. “But you realize you have to move forward.”
So about a month after officially announcing their intention to retire, Nash has dabbled in various things to keep themselves busy.
Their visit to Oak Street Elementary through the Grades of Green program represented a first-time appearance forh Nash, who hopes to make them more frequently considering their past experience supporting various environmental initiatives in Dallas and Phoenix. As the general manager of the Canadian men's basketball team, Nash recently traveled to Toronto to host clinics. They often hang out at their Manhattan Beach residence with their three children.
Still, Nash plans to take an unspecified amount of time waiting, relaxing and reflecting on what their post-retirement career will entail.
“I am just trying to take my time, get some space and perspective before I rush into too many things,” Nash said. “I have a tendency to rush into things because I can't sit still. Then I always end up regretting it.”
Nash maintains they have no regrets about how they handled the aftermath surrounding their season-ending injury where they stayed distant from the team in the final year of their contract worth $9.8 million.
“I was in a really difficult position mentally and emotionally,” Nash said. “It wasn't easy for me. I think the best thing for everyone was for me to get away.”
Both Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and coach Byron Scott publicly supported Nash's indefinite absence. But they also expressed hope they would mentor the Lakers' backcourt, namely rookie guard Jordan Clarkson. Yet, Nash did not begin those private sessions until late January.
“As soon as they asked me to help, I was there to help,” Nash said. “It wasn't like I was hiding. They asked me if I would work with the guys and I immediately said, ‘Yeah.'”
Nash has since worked out with Clarkson through both informal workouts and film study.
“I tried to give them tips on creating space for himself,” Nash said of Clarkson. “If they create space for himself, space will open up for them to pass the ball. Then the decisions will become clearer and easier to make.”
Nash advised Lakers rookie forward Julius Randle on tweaking their shooting mechanic. Nash also helped Lakers forward Ryan Kelly become more fluid with their movement after nursing overlapping hamstring injuries that kept them out last season for a combined 30 games.
But plenty of Nash's mentorship focused on Clarkson, who averaged 15.8 points on 45.8 percent shooting, five assists and 4.2 rebounds in 32.1 minutes through 38 starts.
“He's got a lot of ingredients to be a terrific NBA player,” Nash said of Clarkson. “The sky's the limit. They have great size and athleticism. They can score and hit big shots. He's developing into a good playmaker.”
Both Kupchak and Scott also hope Clarkson develops into a leader.
“The biggest thing about a leader is being authentic, being yourself and having pure motives,” Nash said. “If you are there every day, working hard and trying to get better and lay it on the line every night, that's leadership. Whether you're a vocal leader or quiet leader, it's about your teammates believing in you, trusting that your motives are pure and trying to win.”
After fulfilling that job description on the hardwood, Nash will eventually channel that energy elsewhere. But in the meantime, Nash pledged that they remain “happy to” mentor Clarkson more.
“He's a great kid and great people,” Nash said of Clarkson. “It's been fun for me.”
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ali Abdullah Saleh had ruled Yemen for more than three decades
Ali Abdullah Saleh dominated political life in Yemen for decades, both during and after their long-time role as president.
A wily political operator, Saleh was a former ally of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, but they switched their support to the US after the 9/11 attacks in return for millions of dollars in aid.
For many years they managed to hold their disparate and poverty-stricken country together despite tribal squabbles and many insurrections.
However Saleh's increasingly authoritative and corrupt regime was eventually ended after mass protests on the streets.
Their death on 4 December - just days after they turned against their former allies, the Houthi rebel movement, ending an alliance that had lasted three years amid the country's longstanding civil war - is likely to damage the immediate prospect of peace for Yemen.
What happened to Saleh?
Saleh's supporters had for months been fighting alongside the Houthis in a war against Yemen's current president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.
But on 2 December, Saleh offered to "turn a new page" with the Saudi-led coalition backing Mr Hadi if it stopped attacking Yemen and ended its crippling blockade.
The Houthis then accused them of staging a "coup" and fighting ensued between their supporters and the Houthi rebels.
Days later Saleh was killed in an attack south of Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The incident was hailed as a "great and significant occasion" by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi.
A conflicted political life
Ali Abdullah Saleh was born on 21 March 1942, a member of the Sanhan tribe.
They joined the army where they fought for the republican government in North Yemen's civil war, which saw the Saudi-backed remnants of the monarchy pitted against the Egyptian-sponsored republicans.
When the North Yemen President Ahmed ibn Hussein al-Ghashmi was assassinated in June 1978, Saleh became one of a four-man ruling council.

A month later, the North Yemen parliament elected them as president.
Saleh set out to buy the support of the warring tribes and, to the surprise of many observers, they were re-elected in 1982, and again six years later.
They also set about the painstaking work of unification with Marxist South Yemen, a process which was speeded up with the collapse of the Soviet Union which had been the south's main source of support.
In May 1990, Ali Abdullah Saleh was pronounced president of the new Republic of Yemen with Sanaa as its capital.
'War on terror'
The early years of the republic proved troublesome. Civil war broke out in mid-1994 and the south seceded in May of that year. However, the separation lasted only two months before its military was crushed by the north, placing Saleh once again at the helm of a unified Yemen.
In its first free elections, Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) won most seats but had to rule in a coalition with the Yemeni Socialist Party and Islamist Islah party.
Violence continued to remain a factor in Yemeni politics. The gradual return home, during the 1990s, of militant Islamists who had fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, fuelled dissent within Yemen.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Seventeen sailors died following the attack on the USS Cole
Kidnapping reached almost epidemic proportions. The incidents were nearly all non-violent until a group kidnapped 16 western tourists in December 1998 and the resultant gun battle left four of them dead.
In October 2000, the American destroyer USS Cole was bombed by members of Islamic Jihad, linked to al-Qaeda, in the port of Aden, resulting in the deaths of 17 American sailors.
Internal dissatisfaction with the government grew when Saleh allowed the US authorities to hunt down the militants after the incident.
After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Saleh visited Washington and in return for economic aid, allowed the CIA access to Yemen to wage its "war against terror".
Mass protests
US military experts were deployed to train Yemeni special forces and to aid counter-terrorism efforts against al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
In June 2004, a former parliamentary deputy, Hussein al-Houthi, with links to Hezbollah in Lebanon, launched an armed challenge to the president's authority.
Government forces quickly put down the rebellion but at the cost of hundreds of lives.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protests followed Saleh's decision to cling to power
High levels of corruption led to an increase in poverty in the country during their rule. In July 2005, dozens were killed in riots when fuel subsidies were lifted.
Saleh was sworn in for another term of office in September 2006 after winning the presidential election with more than 77% of the vote.
But their failure to bring about much-needed economic and political reforms led to increasing opposition within Yemen.
Popular protests, influenced in part by events in Egypt and Tunisia, known as the Arab Spring, forced them to announce they would not stand again for election in 2013.
Saleh's stepping down
When they reneged on a promise in May 2011 that they would resign within a month, there were renewed protests. A month later they were badly injured when a rocket-propelled grenade struck their presidential compound.
After medical treatment in the United States, Saleh returned to Yemen in February 2012 triggering more protests. On 27 February they formally ceded power to their deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, and finally stepped down.
Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption Even after stepping down, Saleh's image was prominent on Yemen's streets
From 2014 Saleh and forces loyal to them backed Houthi rebels who seized Sanaa and forced President Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia.
The unlikely allies fought against a brutal Saudi-led military campaign which sought to restore President Hadi but devastated Yemen from 2015.
However ultimately it was Saleh's own erstwhile partners who killed them after days of clashes between the Houthis and their loyalists.

Yaya Toure: Defending is annoying
Yaya Toure is yet to find out which team they will play for next season – but they have made it clear they do not want it to be a defensive one.
The Manchester City midfielder says they find defending an annoying part of the game and is glad to be part of a team managed by Pep Guardiola, who prefers an expansive attacking style.
"We all want to play like this," Toure told the club's official website. "Myself, I don't want to be in a defensive team. Defending is something difficult.
"As a player who likes football, it is annoying to defend all the time.
"The style we play now is the best style. Of course, we try to do our best, we always have chances to score, clear chances.
"We missed them against Liverpool [the 1-1 draw last Sunday] but sometimes you have to accept that because we have been playing a lot of games this month, every three days, and maybe this cost us a little bit."
Toure, 33, is out of contract at the end of the campaign and wants to sign a new deal, but is yet to find out whether they are in Guardiola's plans for 2017-18.
They have been linked with Inter, while their agent Dimitri Seluk revealed earlier this month their client would be open to a shock move to rivals Manchester United.
Toure's immediate focus, however, is on helping third-placed City seal a top-four spot in the Premier League and Champions League qualification, with United only five points behind in fifth and possessing a game in hand.
City have a crucial league double-header away to Arsenal and Chelsea in a four-day span after the international break, with Toure – who is retired from international duty with the Ivory Coast – taking the chance to get ready.
"We have to prepare now for the next game," said Toure of their plans for the international break.
"I will breathe, sleep, run a little bit and be good because Arsenal and Chelsea are massive games.
"We have an opportunity if we want to finish in the top four. What we have to do when we come back is get these six points and try to do our best because we know it is going to be tough.
A couple of Apollo 15 original pictures show an unusual cigar-shaped object on the backside of the Moon
The "Apollo 20" An American-Soviet Classified Mission For An Abandoned Alien Ship On The Moon?
Released Controversial Footages on YouTube - Leak of Information or Skilful Fake?
by Luca Scantamburlo
freelance and writer May 17, 2007
from AngeliSmarriti Website A recent controversial footage of about 6 minutes (which seems a digital transfer from a film, and that we can call the “Apollo 20 footage”) released on YouTube is causing amazement inside the ufological public on the Web, all around the world. The footage would be the presumed shooting realized during a NASA classified mission, in the ‘70s: the “Apollo 20” mission or, as it is suggested by the subtitles of the dialogues between the crew and the Mission Control, the “Vandenberg 20”. I remember to everybody that the last official landing mission on the Moon was the “Apollo 17” (NASA), which took place in December 1972, and that the Apollo 20 mission was cancelled by NASA in 1970. For sure, if the footage is not a hoax or a fake, the purpose of that mission would have been to shoot close to a mysterious object for understanding its origin. And, maybe, to organize a secret retrieval if possible.
But the presumed footage of “Apollo 20” is not the only material which came out in the last days: it was also released by someone a presumed studio for the flyover of the assumed alien spaceship (available on YouTube a so-called preflight study for Apollo 20). And moreover on YouTube we have also several shots of the strange object on the backside of the Moon (whose numbers would be AS20-1020, AS20-1022 and AS20-FWD-7250). Presumed photo taken by Apollo 20 on the backside of the Moon
Fake or truth?
Regarding the video, as introduction we have a sort of marking (with the presumed logo of the mission) and, as result of a former recording on the tape, just a second of another marking about a video of the Apollo 11 Mission. So, if the first seconds seem not to be reliable but strongly contradictory, the following part of the video looks like interesting, well done and cohering with an old space hand-made shooting during a flyover of the Moon. Anyway, the video is an editing of at least two scenes, both of them apparently taken flying over the surface of the Moon.
According to the file-card of the YouTube user (“retiredafb”) who uploaded the controversial footages and shots (a man of 76 years old who lives in Rwanda), “Apollo 20 went to the moon August 16 1976. Destination was Iszak D, southwest of Delporte Crater, farside of the moon. The mission was soviet-american. Crew was William Rutledge CDR, former of bell laboratories, Leona Snyder CSP bell laboratories, and Alexei Leonov, soviet cosmonaut former "Apollo Soyouz" (mission one year earlier).” But the most interesting information are about the presumed alien ship: “[…] the ship was very old, age has been estimated 1.5 billion of years. Meteorite impacts, and dust/hills coverings testified that. Note that the ship has already been explored before the first human expedition reached the lunar singularity.” Is this man an American or Soviet former technician, who worked as insider during the 70s on Space classified missions and that now lives in Africa? Even the “Apollo 20 the legacy part 1 The City” (below video) is a very interesting and evocative footage. There is also the presumed lift off of the Apollo 20.
I am not a photographer; neither an expert of special effects nor an informatics technician. So I am not in the position to say something about the features of the footage. But what it is very interesting is that there is really a strange object on the Moon, and its shape is very close to that one showed in the video: I am talking about the object visible in a couple of NASA pictures taken by the Apollo 15 mission (click below images.) AS15/M/1333 AS15/M/1037 The cigar-shaped object looks like leant beside a crater, lightly oblique; we can argue this because the unidentified object casts a shadow on the surface. And the visible zone in the footage is very similar to the visible region in some originals NASA photos taken by Apollo 15: the Moon region coordinates where there is the unusual object are the following: Latitude: 10° S
Longitude: 117.5° E, Southwest of Delporte and North of Izsak. I have checked on a Lunar chart: it is on the backside of the Moon.
The official NASA photos are available by the website of the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI, in Houston), which is a “research institute that provides support services to NASA and the planetary science community” - (the AS15-P-9630 and the AS15-P-9625, from the the Apollo Image Atlas - below images ). AS15-P-9625, Apollo Image Atlas Courtesy NASA/LPI AS15-P-9630, Apollo Image Atlas Courtesy NASA/LPI
The pictures were taken in 1971 by Apollo 15, during the revolution number 38, from an altitude of 117 km. The two original photos have both the following features: Image Width: 45.24 inch - Image Height: 4.5 inch; Film Color: black & white. If you pay attention to the center, move a little bit to the right and zoom the picture, you can see the mysterious object.
Now we can ask ourselves: does NASA classified missions really exist? Or did they exist in the past? The answer could be yes . First of all there are two sites for the launches of the Space Shuttles and of the spacecrafts generally: one is the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the other one is the Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California.
Moreover there are several witnesses and references: one given by Clark McClelland (ex NASA engineer) and another one given by Robert M. Collins , former USAF Captain. In Italy, for instance, I have found a very significant assertion made by two Italian university professors: Luigi Balis Crema and Antonio Castellani , both of them teachers at “La Sapienza” Rome University, Faculty of Engineering. At page 71 of their brilliant essay “ L'esplorazione dello spazio ”, which means “The Space Exploration” and published in Italy in 1997 (Newton & Compton Publisher), they write: "Infine nell'ultimo volo dell'anno il Discovery, con un equipaggio interamente militare, compie l'ultima missione “segreta” per conto del ministero della difesa USA ponendo in orbita un satellite 'spia' di grandi dimensioni che riceve anche dei segnali laser da terra." The cover of the historical essay written by L.Balis Crema and A. Castellani, the two Italian university professors (Newton & Compton, 2001, Italy)
In the Italian text there is written that, regarding the 1992 year, the Shuttle Discovery made at the end of the year the "last 'secret' mission" for the DOD, with a "military crew".
About the two NASA pictures, authentic and showing the strange object, I made a short analysis using the Gimp software (version 2.2.10): my purpose was trying to give prominence to the edges of the huge object leant on the Moon surface. ZOOM-AS15-P-9625.jpg – NASA, Apollo 15
Analysis using the Gimp Software- by L. Scantamburlo
Apart from this controversial footage, it is undeniable that on that occasion in 1971 , the Apollo 15 took pictures that showed a strange and cigar-shaped object, whatever it is. Somebody could object that a metallic artificial structure should appear different compared with a rocky surface. This is not the case, but the reflection of light on an ancient structure, maybe covered by dust raised in the past by impacts with asteroids and meteors, could be similar to that one of a rocky surface. Even if it is a strange huge piece of rock leant by a crater, on the backside of the Moon there are anyway many strange objects.

In spite of they perhaps made a small mistake in recalling the exact year in which they faced Lunar Orbiter photos (the first Lunar Orbiter was launched in 1966, and Karl Wolfe talked about the year 1965; it is not possible; the last one, the 5th , was launched in 1967), Karl Wolfe spoke out in front of the journalists that an Airman Second Class told them at that time, by a photo laboratory at Langley: By the way, we've discovered a base on the backside of the Moon. After that, they showed to Wolfe photos taken by one of the Lunar Orbiter mission in which, according to Wolfe, there were structures half a mile in size. Some of them were buildings very tall, like towers; others were spherical and domed buildings, very large. The cover of the documentary directed by Jose Escamilla
If somebody is skeptical and does not believe him, I suggest you to watch the outstanding documentary directed by Jose Escamilla : “UFO. The Greatest Story Ever Denied.” (watch below clip) You will see some photos taken by the Clementine Mission, in which it is clear that some features were airbrushed by NASA .

Gimli
Gimli is a crash tracing/analysis framework.
The concept is that an executable can be linked with libgimli to enable watchdog and tracing support. The watchdog feature enables the process to be respawned in the case of a fault (and throttles respawns in the case of persistent problems). The tracing feature allows collection of information from the faulting process that can then be used by the software developer to diagnose and resolve the problem.
Gimli has a modular framework that extends the traces beyond a simple "gstack" capture; modules can be loaded into the tracer based on the mapped objects in the target process, and these can capture specific information into the generated trace file.
Large processes leave large core files, which can be problematic to pull down to a developers system to diagnose, post-mortem. Additionally, it can be challenging to successfully examine core files if the customer system is running different system libraries from the developers system. Furthermore, production environments may mandate that full blown debugging tools must not be installed to minimize risk in the case of intrusion, and this prevents analysis on the affected system.
Gimli avoids these problems by performing time-of-death analysis and capturing that information in a human readable form.

Where does the name Gimli come from?
Gimli deals with the ELF file format and the DWARF debugging information format. Well-known fantasy literature associates the name "Gimli" with Elves and Dwarves, but less well known is an event that took place in Gimli, Manitoba, where an aircraft ran out of fuel and needed to make an emergency landing.
Four people were injured in a broad daylight shooting at Klong Toey market before noon today.
Tha Rua police said the shooting happened in front of a chicken stall near the Ratchada-Rama 4 intersection.
One man came at the stall where the stall owner identified only as Bank was drinking with three employees after finishing their daily selling work.
The man who police knew only as Sanya drew out a revolver and fired at Bank.
The shots hit Bank on the chest and all the three employees.
All three employees were admitted to Theptarin hospital, while Bank, in serious condition was taken to Chulalongkorn hospital.
Police said either personal or business conflict was the motive of the shooting as vendors at the market said the gunman and Bank had a heated argument before.
Police are now hunting for gunman for trial.

Hubbell Realty Co. has released plans for the first project it will build at Gray's Station, the massive neighborhood the company is developing on the edge of downtown Des Moines.
The Linc at Gray's Station will have 195 units in five buildings. It will serve as the "gateway" to the rest of the 75-acre neighborhood, said Kris Saddoris, the company's vice president of development.
Gray's Station aims to turn an abandoned rail yard on the north bank of the Raccoon River into an upscale neighborhood with a focus on walkability in a park-like setting.
Developers have likened the project to a small city within a city.
The $41 million multi-family project will be located along Southwest 11th Street between Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and Tuttle Street.
The Linc at Gray's Station is Hubbell Realty Co.'s first project in its massive 75-acre neighborhood north of the Raccoon River. (Photo: Hubbell Realty Co./Special to the Register.)
Hubbell chose to start development on the northern edge of Gray's Station to establish a link between the neighborhood and downtown.
"It's the only place you can see us from MLK. So for us to be able to introduce our neighborhood to you, it was critical to have this parcel" done first, Saddoris said.
The Linc will have a range of units from studios up to three-bedroom apartments. Many units will have a "bonus room" that can be used as an office, they said.
There will be a courtyard with a pool, dog park and shared community room with a kitchen. Hubbell will re-purpose shipping containers to use as shades for the pool and seating areas in the dog park.

The Linc will have several rooftop patios "aimed at the best view of downtown," Saddoris said. Buildings will lead into a public plaza along Tuttle Street that connects pedestrians to the rest of the neighborhood.
Gray's Station will cover most of the empty land south of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway between Southwest 11th and Southwest 16th streets.
It will have more than 1,100 housing units, some small commercial districts and a network of parks linked by a new pedestrian bridge to Gray's Lake Park. Plans call for both rental and for-sale properties, including detached single-family homes, townhouses, apartments, condos and possibly senior housing.
More:
The dense neighborhood will prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars. The Linc will be a 10-minute walk to most amenities downtown and a 15-minute walk to Gray's Lake.
The $250 million development will take 20 years to build and depending on how many housing units ultimately are built, could bring 3,000 to 5,000 new residents downtown.

A pedestrian bridge over the Raccoon River to Gray's Lake Park is also proposed. Hubbell plans to break ground in 2018. (Photo: RDG Planning & Design/Special to The Register)
Hubbell will take its plans for The Linc to the Urban Design Review Board on Tuesday for an initial review. Construction is expected to begin in May with the first tenants moving in by early 2020.
Plans for the next phase of the Gray's Station project — for-sale townhomes south of The Linc — will be released within 90 days.
Hubbell was given a $3 million grant from Des Moines to assist with cleanup of the site, which is expected to wrap-up in mid-December. That will make way for quicker development of Gray's Station.

The Empire State Building
Today state officials in New York will close the application process to open a dispensary.
According to numbers from the New York Post, the state has already brought in $3 million from the selection process by charging 300 perspective dispensary owners $10,000 a pop to file their bid to attain one of the five permits being distributed in the state.
These permits would allow their holder to open four dispensaries, and 20 dispensaries in total would be allowed to open in a state with a population of 19.75 million. The idea of one dispensary per 1 million residents does not really float with any goals for there to be ease of access, but with how limited the conditions list is, it shouldn't be much of an issue as dispensing kicks off in 2016. However, patients upstate are worried about the travel times that would be required to access their medicine.
Lightly processed flowers, as in trimmed, dried, and cured, will not be available to New York patients. This is due to the ban on smoking medical cannabis -- only oils, edibles, and vapable products will be for sale.
Not everyone in New York is happy with how the state's regulations turned out. State Assembly Leader Richard Gottfried told a Drug Policy Alliance event, "Last June, we were about to pass in both houses and the Governor calls me and Diane Savino down to their office and says 'This is how we've got to change it.' Maybe we should have told them to stuff it and passed it how it was and had them veto it, but we decided to bargain with him. We got a lot of really bad changes into the legislation and when they came out with the regulations they were even worse."
Hopefully after the kinks are worked out in the distribution process, New York's medical cannabis program will redevelop into something a bit more inclusive. Right now, lots of folks will be left out of the loop when it comes to using cannabis as effective medicine.
Fatal occupational injuries involving insects, arachnids, and mites
Although not often associated with fatal workplace injuries, insects, arachnids, and mites were involved in 83 fatal occupational injuries from 2003 to 2010, an average of 10 per year.
View Chart Data Total number of fatal occupational injuries involving insects, arachnids, and mites, by year, 2003–2010 Year Fatal injuries 2003 6 2004 10 2005 15 2006 10 2007 11 2008 10 2009 9 2010 12
Bees were the most common insect involved, with 52 of the 83 fatal occupational injuries over the 2003–2010 period resulting from bee-related incidents. Eleven workers were killed in wasp-related incidents, including 3 incidents involving yellow jackets (which are a type of wasp). In addition, 7 fatal occupational injuries over that period were from spiders and 4 were from ants. Fatal occupational injuries involving insects are often associated with anaphylactic shock. In total, 39 of the 83 case narratives noted the decedent suffered anaphylactic shock.

Insect-related deaths were most commonly associated with three types of jobs: farming, construction, and landscaping. A total of 20 farmers and farmworkers were killed during the 8-year period, as well as 19 construction workers and 17 landscape workers. Together, the three occupations accounted for two-thirds of all workplace fatalities over the 2003–2010 period.
These data are from the BLS Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities program, which publishes annual counts of fatal occupational injuries by demographic and employment characteristics of those killed and selected characteristics of the fatal incident itself.

MISSISSAUGA, Ont. — Ontario's police watchdog says an officer who Tasered an 80-year-old woman in Mississauga twice didn't break the law, but could have waited longer before opting to use the stun gun.
The Special Investigations Unit says officers ordered Iole Pasquale to drop the eight-inch-blade knife they were holding while walking on the road around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 28, but that they kept wandering and made incoherent noises.
The SIU says a supervisor officer equipped with the Taser then arrived and decided to apprehend them under the Mental Health Act because they thought they were suffering from a mental disorder and could harm themselves or others.
It says they considered other use-of-force options including a baton and wrestling Pasquale to the ground, but dismissed these due to the risk they and the officers could be injured.
The SIU says that while one officer successfully ordered Pasquale to extend their arms to reduce the risk of them falling on the knife, the supervisor Tasered them once, then again after they had fallen and broken their hip because they still held the knife.
Director Ian Scott says that while in hindsight the supervisor could have waited longer and tried to convince them to drop it, the use of the stun gun wasn't legally unreasonable, especially since they had them extend their arms to reduce harm.
“The subject officer can be criticized for not waiting longer and perhaps they should have,” Scott said in a release Wednesday.
Though it was “unfortunate” Pasquale's hip was fractured in the fall, the Peel regional police officer couldn't have seen the injury coming, they added.
Scott said the officers “had no reason to believe” Pasquale would become co-operative in the short term, and had no way of identifying them so as to find a family member to speak to them
The subject officer can be criticized for not waiting longer and perhaps they should have
“Coupled with these issues was the fact that they appeared to be suffering from a mental disorder and could have harmed themselves with the knife,” they said.
“This decision does not mean that it was the preferred option, particularly in light of Peel Police's internal directive that CEWs are to be avoided on elderly persons where possible; it simply means that the decision to use a CEW in these circumstances should not engage the criminal law,” Scott said.
The SIU is an arm's length agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault.
Cowboys Stadium No More: With Deal, It Is Now AT&T Stadium
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ronald Martinez/Getty Images
After what is rumored to be a multimillion-dollar naming deal, the iconic Cowboys Stadium will be called AT&T Stadium from now on.
In a press release, AT&T said part of its attraction to the deal was that Dallas is the company's home. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in a statement that the naming deal ties the team with "one of the world's strongest and most innovative companies."
NPR member station KERA reports that the Cowboys have sought corporate sponsors before, but because of a sluggish economy could not find one lucrative enough when the new stadium opened in 2009.
Clarence Hill, Cowboys' beat writer for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, had some harsh words for the move. They said on Twitter:
"i would have been okay with AT&T Cowboys Stadium. But taking Cowboys out the name entirely..Jerry sold out for the cash."
Back in 2011, Bloomberg took a look at naming rights deals in the NFL. It found that "22 of the league's 32 teams played in stadiums with a corporate name."
Bloomberg explained bluntly:
Internet providers have said they won't be able to implement controversial systems to capture UK browsing data until 2018, with BT suggesting the Home Office should cover "100 percent" of the costs.
Bosses from BT, Virgin Media, and Sky told a joint committee of MPs and Lords that it would be difficult for them to comply with sweeping plans to collect records of online activity proposed under new surveillance laws. "This bill potentially could look at all of us having to almost mirror our entire network's traffic to then be able to filter it, that's a huge, huge undertaking," said Hugh Woolford, director of operations at Virgin Media.
"We've put some thought into the timescales. We feel that we could probably, as long as the discussions and detail are worked through, we could start 2017 with the earliest deployment in 2018, depending on the scale of the request," they continued.

The draft Investigatory Powers Bill, which was published by the Home Office in November, will require communications companies to store details of websites accessed by everyone in the UK for 12 months.
Under the law companies would have to keep information on who visited what domain, but not the individual pages they went to. This data would show that someone had visited WIRED.co.uk, for example, but not that they then read this news story. It is expected that the bill will be passed into law next year after it has been scrutinised by officials and voted on by MPs.

However, all three of the UK's major internet providers said the proposed law wasn't clear in the exact requirements it would place upon their services and needed to be clarified as it passed through the House of Commons and House of Lords. Adam Kinsley, director of policy and public affairs at Sky, said the proposed law would force companies to capture a "magnitude of data" about their customers.
The ISPs said it would be possible to collect this information, called Internet Connection Records (ICRs) by the draft law, but added that it would be challenging as it had never been captured before.
Mark Hughes, president of BT Security, told the cross-party group of officials that to be able to capture and retain the data of internet users would be "costly".

Hughes said the funding being proposed by the Home Office to implement the technology would not be enough to roll-out the ability to capture internet records. The Home Office has budgeted approximately £175 million to help internet service providers and communications companies implement the technology needed to collect the masses of web data from users.
Hughes saidthis figure would not be enough for all of the providers to be able to have their costs covered, adding that BT believed "100 percent" of its costs should be reimbursed. "We've worked out for us alone, and I can't comment for others around the table or others in the industry, to fulfil the assumptions that we have been given will cost us tens of millions, so the lions share of that £174 million would be for us alone," Hughes said.
It has previously been stated by Internet Service Providers' Association, the umbrella group for internet service providers, that broadband bills would increase if ISPs were forced to cover the cost of capturing internet data.

When my editor asked me to find the worst bar in Toronto (inspired by this VICE US article) the rules were simple: pick a bar that I think is the worst, go to that bar, ask another denizen of the boozy depths what they think the worst bar in Toronto is, go to that bar and repeat the process until I am a feeble, drunken mess, face-to-face with the bleak realities of alcohol's demonic influence upon us all.
Simple enough.
Where to begin though and what does it mean for a bar to be the worst?
There are of course shit bars. Grungy, anonymous holes in the wall occupied by a smattering of the human equivalents of crunched up empty cigarette packs, nursing corporate lagers and grudges against all who have wronged them whether it's their brother or whatever liberal female politician it's trendy to shit on in MRA circles.
To me though these aren't bad bars. They are merely bars, places for the downtrodden to commiserate. They aren't hurting anybody (metaphorically, I'm sure actually a lot of people have been hurt on their premises). And as Toronto's rapid transformation into a fantasy land for the wealthy continues unopposed, I appreciate the continued existence of these shit bars that act like gnarly food stuck in the shiny condo teeth of the city.
So I wanted to stay away from the dives and the Portuguese sports bars and start at a bar that I truly think is bad for humanity. But where? As I would discover in my travels, determining a bad bar is not always easy but as I sat eating some pizza to gird my stomach for the night to come and wracking my brain for horrible bar experiences I looked up at the TV playing CP24 and there in the background, across the street from the newsroom, was my answer, the first stop on my depraved journey aglow with its own garishness:
EL FURNITURE WAREHOUSE
El Furniture Warehouse if you are fortunate enough to be unaware, is a Canadian chain that specializes in cheap eats, overpriced drinks and an extreme sports/first half of Spring Breakers aesthetic that will make you root for the society destroying effects of climate change.
After waiting in a late afternoon lineup (an afternoon lineup!!!) to get in I saddle up to the bar, order myself a beer and a shot called a Mind Fuck (it was either that or one called Red-Headed Slut) and let myself soak in the ambience, soak being the appropriate verb because it felt like I was being held down and pissed on by a bunch of a marauding jock. The place is loud and bright with cranked music, hard bodies and retro neon-signs pulsing.
The bartenders are the worst part. They are human surfboards dressed like professional wrestlers who, whenever you order a drink, flip the glass into the air in a bid to astound you with how fucking cool they are. Listen man, I just want a glass of water not front row tickets to the X-Games.
Beside me are two women enjoying some of the the cheap eats who I inform about my mission to find the worst bar. One ignores me completely, while the other is shocked at first that I don't like the place before rethinking and agreeing that the service is both bad and hilariously over the top.  They are also the first of a pattern I'll run into throughout the night, people repeatedly unable to name a single bar they don't like and claiming they don't waste their time in bad bars. I drink another pint hoping more time will give them some inspiration for my next destination but they do tell me a story about an Uber driver fucking them over in case I want to write a story about why Uber sucks.
I turn my attention to the young couple on my right. He's from Saskatchewan, has grenade stud earrings and is excited about the upcoming John Mayer concert. She's a student who thinks that the worst bar in Toronto is The Imperial. So I finish my drink, watch one more complementary glass air-flip from the staff and head out on the road alight with the knowledge that El Furniture Warehouse is a blight on the earth and every minute you stay in there you will forget one book you have read.
THE IMPERIAL PUB
My heart dropped when I was sent here because I love this place. I can understand why the young woman who sent me them does not like it, she's young and hence has hope and probably believes in the promise of tomorrow and does not yet understand that existence is continual disappointment carved out of the oblivion that surrounds it on both sides and so does not get the appeal of a place like The Imperial which is comfortably fuzzy, brown and gross like your grandfather's nicotine stained teeth.
Tucked behind the Dundas square and open since 1944, The Imperial Pub is divided into two levels. The bottom consists of a wraparound bar, a fish tank that would give Spielberg nightmares and back room with a stage where I've had some of my bleakest nights as a stand-up. Upstairs is the library, a big room with a pool table that is ringed by dusty bookshelves and where you can get free popcorn. The clientele is a mixture of faded regulars who may be ghosts and older students from nearby Ryerson University.
I head upstairs, with a headache and shot nerves from El Furniture's party or die atmosphere, and am immediately soothed by the grainy yellow lighting and a vibe of casual despair. There is jazz music playing which is appropriate because this is the kind of place where a jazz musician could find a nice corner to curl up and die in obscurity.
I order a beer and a box of poutine hoping for some of that dish's famed curative properties, and begin scoping out for some people to guide me to the next destination. A crew of solidly regular dudes behind turn out to be a bust as two are from LA and the third is another person who for the life of them can't name a bad bar. "Any bar is good as long as you're drinking,"stated the young man, their logic sound and unassailable. I move on to another group who also have a hard time naming a shitty bar ("Why would you go to bar you don't like?") before one woman asks me if clubs are ok. When I answer in the affirmative they say, much to my delight, that, "Croc Rock is pretty shitty." Yes!
CROCODILE ROCK
I have been hearing about Toronto's infamous Crocodile Rock since I moved here. Legend has it that Crocodile Rock is where cougars and silver foxes congregate, where the middle aged gather and get freaky, where moms and dads can get away from their kids and grind like there is no tomorrow. I've always been tempted by the appeal of Croc Rock, maybe tonight would be night where I fulfill my destiny to become a kept love-boy for an emotionally aloof divorced mother of one.
When I show up to the Rock though I am appalled to discover tonight this destiny will not prevail because Crocodile Rock is one of the many bars participating in a bar crawl called The Bunny Hop, which is one of Canada's largest bar crawls. I enter Croc Rock (which looks like a combination between a garage and a Batman villain's lair) to find the place teeming with newly legal drinkers dressed in white t-shirts and wearing bunny tails and ears, wasted on cheap shooters and horrific, youthful horniness.
It's a terrifying scene. Sort of "Lord of the Flies" but with a stripper pole instead of a conch. It's the kind of scenario that, if they could have foretold it, would have inspired Al Capone to turn themselves in.
At one point while I'm sitting alone at a table taking notes (admittedly a creepy look considering there is more grinding going on around me than in my mouth when I'm asleep) a bouncer comes up to and asks what I'm doing. When I explain my evening they go, "That makes sense, some people love us and some hate us." Bonus points to Crocodile Rock for having staff that have no illusions about where they work.
I ask the bouncer if they have any suggestions for the worst bar but he's a little busy. I next turn to a middle aged man who is the ringleader of a group of very uncomfortable looking dads. Not my man though, when I ask what the worst bar is in Toronto, they go, "Life is too short to not have fun. I have a wife and kids at home, tonight I'm having fun," before dragging a miserable looking friend out onto a dancefloor that resembles a club from The Smurf movie universe.
Finally I spot three put upon adults with 'let's get the fuck out of here' printed on their faces. Two are also from out of town ("I've been in Mexico for three months. This is nothing, nobody is naked pouring tequila on themselves.") but the third, a jacked Irishman tells me the worst bar he's been to in Toronto is dbar at the bottom of the Four Seasons in Yorkville. So I say goodbye to Judy Bloom's nightmare and make my way to the tony Yorkville neighbourhood.
DBAR
Dbar is a fancy bar for the rich as hell. Everything in here glitters: the lights, the glass case displays of Prada clothing and jewellery hanging on the wall, the bar and especially the patrons.
I don't belong in here at all. I feel like I'm walking around wearing garbage bags and that at any moment a huge hand will grab me by the collar and best case scenario throw me out onto the curb and worst case scenario toss me in the kitchen and chop up my poor body and serve me up like carpaccio to the hungry-eyed socialites prowling around.
I go to the bathroom to get my head straight. It's the nicest bathroom I've ever been in with high walls and gauzy warm light. It's less a bathroom and more a mausoleum for your body's waste. The paper towels are insane, thick and soft at the same time. I'm tempted to take a stack and see if I can use them to pay off my student loan.
I go upstairs and get a beer and fearfully wander around, not wanting to stay still long enough to be noticed. My drunken paranoia is soothed when I spot a former customer from my coffee shop days. We greet each other and I tell them that I think I'm going to get kicked out, they reassure me not to worry their uncle just bought the place and I can say I'm with him. Yes! Thank you Liberals and your knowledge economy for the hook up.
Feeling less like a mouse caught out in the open, I turn an appraising eye over my surroundings and am struck by one clear fact: rich people suck at having fun. Oh sure people are getting drunk, going to the bathroom in lines and returning sniffing away, but overall this place is lame. There is some dancing going on but it's reserved and awkward. Everyone is too worried about being seen, about who's here and who's not to enjoy themselves. The DJ actually drops a sincere dance remix of the motherfucking Thong Song and everybody cheers. The Thong Song! Between the awkwardness and social stratification, this place is like if someone invested one hundred million dollars into one of my high school dances.
I finish my beer. I delay my exit in the hopes that my coffee shop acquaintance is going to take me on some whirlwind tour of the sweet life but they soon takes their leave off the place and I am off as well. I'm super-drunk and my head is pounding and I just want to go to sleep and what I've learned tonight is Canadians don't like to admit where and when they have had a bad time, El Furniture Warehouse is still the worst place in the city and that alcohol should be illegal. It would probably make the bars better.

Activist Post
After five years of intense fighting and destabilization raging across Syria, Western mainstream press has finally discovered the true cause of the so-called “civil war.” It turns out that all of the analysts in the alternative media suggesting that the situation in Syria was the result of a NATO destabilization campaign and foreign-backed invasion of terrorists in the form of al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and ISIS were wrong. In fact, even those mainstream analysts who have suggested that the foreign invasion was actually a legitimate rebellion were apparently mistaken.
Thankfully, the mainstream press has discovered the true cause of the Syrian crisis – global warming.
No, this is not a joke. Mainstream outlets are actually suggesting that climate change is responsible, albeit indirectly, for the creation of ISIS and the scores of Western-backed terrorists flooding Syria as well as the now international military involvement in the war.
This is merely the latest silly narrative being promoted by the likes of Slate, Wired, The Telegraph, NBC, and The Guardian among many others.
Slate, by no means, is the sole purveyor of such abjectly stupid claims nor are the other media outlets listed above. Still, one need only read the Slate article to see how the “climate change is the real reason for the Syrian war” claim is being presented. Slate writes,
By now, it's pretty clear that we're starting to see visible manifestations of climate change beyond far-off melting ice sheets. One of the most terrifying implications is the increasingly real threat of wars sparked in part by global warming. New evidence says that Syria may be one of the first such conflicts.
We know the basic story in Syria by now: From 2006-2010, an unprecedented drought forced the country from a groundwater-intensive breadbasket of the region to a net food importer. Farmers abandoned their homes—school enrollment in some areas plummeted 80 percent—and flooded Syria's cities, which were already struggling to sustain an influx of more than 1 million refugees from the conflict in neighboring Iraq. The Syrian government largely ignored these warning signs, helping sow discontent that ultimately spawned violent protests. The link from drought to war was prominently featured in a Showtime documentary last year. A preventable drought-triggered humanitarian crisis sparked the 2011 civil war, and eventually, ISIS.
A new study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science provides the clearest evidence yet that human-induced global warming made that drought more likely. The study is the first to examine the drought-to-war narrative in quantitative detail in any country, ultimately linking it to climate change.
At this point, given the detailed nature of “climate science,” I will spare the reader a summation of the thoroughly debunked theory of Anthropogenic Man-Made Global Warming, at least as it relates to the non-existent and entirely invented theory of CO2 as a poisonous and planet killing gas. I will spare the reader historical data that proves the earth was much hotter in the past, thus indicating that we are well within the norm of climate ups and downs. I will also spare the reader the details regarding the fact that global warming has not taken place in the last eighteen years despite the rigging of science equipment and faulty computer models to prove the opposite, thus calling into question whether the planet is actually still warming at all.
Unfortunately, Slate and its peers spared the readers the same information, leading hordes of hapless trendies to believe that CO2-Global Warming is actually a real issue and that it somehow is the guiding force behind terrorist cells, beheadings, and jihad. Leaving behind any and all knowledge of history of any form is generally important in order to be able to follow the logic provided by the recent mainstream press narrative about the Syrian war.
For instance, while US and UK media outlets attempt to suggest that global warming is responsible for the lagging Syrian agricultural sector and the fate of Syrian farmers, it conveniently fails to mention the US sanctions on Syria that helped plunge its economy into despair. While environmental factors undoubtedly play a role it is true that environmental factors always play a role in farming and agriculture in any country of the world at any time period. The false threat of CO2 does not change this fact.
Compounding the normal concerns and economic hardships of farmers with international sanctions, however, is not the result of too much CO2, it is the result of a concerted effort to destroy a sovereign and secular government for the purposes world hegemony.
Of course, these media outlets make no mention of the sanctions or the worldwide economic depression and place the blame firmly on the shoulders of Assad who allegedly “largely ignored these warning signs.”
Thus, Slate writes that “A preventable drought-triggered humanitarian crisis sparked the 2011 civil war, and eventually, ISIS.”
FALSE.
Global warming did not create ISIS. A drought did not create ISIS. The United States and NATO created ISIS.
As I have documented in my article, “The Roots of ISIS,” ISIS is nothing more than a name change in a long line of many name changes for the same terrorist organization (al Nusra, al-Qaeda, IEIL, FSA, etc.) that the US openly funded since as far back as the late 1970s and has continued to fund, direct, control, and use across the world ever since.

The suggestion that a drought, global warming, or any other weather event created ISIS and its cannibal army is atrociously stupid and an unfortunate example of the intellectual depths to which we have sunk as a nation. The fact that such a claim can be written with a straight face by numerous major media publications is more of a sad comment on the state of the American public than it is on the state of the corporate media. After all, corporate media has always been garbage but, in the past, it was somewhat necessary to maintain a professional and respectable air so as to maintain some level of credibility.
Unfortunately, the reality is that the result of these articles and the frivolous study it cites will be that, in discussion of the Syrian crisis with trendies, hipsters, and academics, one will now undoubtedly be forced to endure having to debunk global warming along with the assertion that global warming created ISIS. Well done mainstream media. Well done.
Of course, if the study cited by Slate and other mainstream media outlets are correct in their claim that global warming produces terrorist outfits like ISIS and al-Nusra, then we have much more to worry about than the Syrian crisis. Surely we will soon be overcome by polar bear suicide bombings and penguins shouting “Allahu Akbar!!”
Still, Slate continues,
The study's authors are clear that global warming did not directly cause Syria's civil war—it took a mix of underlying social vulnerability and an antagonistic government to do that. But it does provide compelling evidence that, when combined with the effects of increased population pressure and the poor policies of the Assad regime, the drought made a bad situation worse.
To be fair, it is clear that the lack of availability of food, poor economic conditions and societal tensions can contribute and even cause mass social upheaval. This much is a fact.
However, to go to the lengths to which the mainstream press has gone, i.e. suggesting that global warming was the root cause of the Syrian crisis is absurd.
Its attempts to blame Syria and Syrians in general in regards to “the effects of increased population pressure” are nevertheless typical of Anglo-American population control and reduction initiatives as well as propaganda pieces that have been flooding Western culture in earnest since the early 1970s. Slate and its compatriots are therefore good Malthusians as much as they are good eugenicists because, apparently, the food issue never would have gotten out of hand if there been less Syrians to begin with. Fortunately for the mainstream press, its CIA advisers, and corporate owners, the problem of “too many Syrians” has been thoroughly dealt with.
But the question of the responsibility for the crisis lying with “an antagonistic government” is a bit more difficult to decipher. Antagonistic government? What does Slate mean? Is it referring to the Syrian government who has done nothing but protect minorities and its citizens from the likes of ISIS and the FSA and who was criticized by the majority of the Syrian people early on for not doing enough to destroy the so-called rebels?
Or is it referring to the United States who organized, directed, funded, trained, and facilitated the death squads for the last 5 years and even long before that?
Few days back I found my first Android phone in a drawer, its an S2. I have great memories with it as it is my first Android phone, being an iOS user from years I always wanted to test the latest Android version that is Android 6 Marshmallow. So I had the Android phone now. Next thing was to get the latest operating system in it to test the Android Marshmallow. So I installed it and wrote a guide on how to install Android 6 marshmallow on S2.
General opinion of people is that installing the latest operating system will decrease the performance as it has new and more features. but this concept is totally wrong the latest operating system which is Android 6.0.1 in this case is far better than Android 4.1.2 which is official operating system of Samsung galaxy S2. After installing Android 6.0.1 on my S2, I observed great performance boost, as Android Marshmallow is far better in optimizing apps and its time/ space efficiency is far better than Android 4.1.2. In layperson words, S2 works way faster on Android 6 Marshmallow as compared to Android 4.1.2 jelly bean.
Now lets move on to the guide, I will be using CyanogenMod Custom ROM, AOSP of Android 6.0.1 in this guide. It will give experience of almost stock Android 6.0.1. Now lets move on to how to install Android 6 Marshmallow on S2.

Exxon Mobil's CEO has joined a lawsuit to stop construction of a water tower near their home that would be used in the fracking process to drill for oil.
While fracking has raised complaints from environmentalists around the country, Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson is opposing a project in their own neighborhood despite how deeply Exxon Mobil is involved in the oil extraction process.
Tillerson appeared at a Town Council meeting in Bartonville, Texas, the wealthy enclave near their Dallas home in November to join in the protest over the water tower, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The lawsuit contends the project would make “a noise nuisance and traffic hazards.” Trucks would be needed to haul and pump water.
The tower, being built by Cross Timbers Water Supply, would rise 15 stories, the Journal says. It's adjacent to Tillerson's 83-acre horse ranch and not far from an 18-acre homestead. Tillerson is devoting considerable time to the matter: They sat for three hours in the lawsuit in May and attended an all-day mediation session in September, besides their Town Council appearance.
Among others opposing the project are those who are not exactly known for environmental crusading: Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and their wife are the lead plaintiffs.
An Exxon Mobil spokesperson contacted by the Journal said that the suit is Tillerson's own matter and the oil giant “has no involvement in the legal matter.”
Common denominator: Cell growth may underlie both autism and cancer.
©Eye of Science / Science Source.com
Over the past five years, researchers have become increasingly aware of an extraordinary coincidence: Many of the cellular pathways involved in cancer overlap with those implicated in conditions associated with brain development, such as autism.
Intrigued by this connection, autism researcher Janine LaSalle set out two years ago to fully document the extent of the crossover. They teamed up with researchers from both fields to compile a catalog of the genes linked to both conditions. The result appeared earlier this year in Trends in Genetics1.
“There has been a lot of new genetics done with sequencing with autism and cancer. We figured it was time to try to put together a list of [overlapping] genes,” says LaSalle, professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of California, Davis.
The resulting 43-gene list (see graphic below) is just a start — researchers are continually finding new genes for both conditions — but suggests ways for the fields to collaborate, they say. Mouse models or therapies developed for cancer might be useful for autism, and vice versa. The genes' links to autism vary in rigor, but the list includes 17 genes considered strong candidates for the condition. Another eight genes lead to autism-related syndromes, such as tuberous sclerosis or Rett syndrome.
The list highlights a few key cancer pathways that also appear to play an important role in autism. One of these points of convergence includes proteins that alter the dense DNA-protein complex called chromatin, and thereby modulate gene expression. Another centers around WNT signaling, a group of pathways that translate messages from outside the cell into changes in gene expression.
Cell growth:
WNT signaling coordinates the process by which an embryo's dividing cells develop into parts of the body. Some people with autism have been found to carry mutations in components of the WNT pathway, such as a protein called beta-catenin.
It is unclear why autism and cancer share so many risk genes, but the answer probably lies in the two conditions' ties to cell growth, says Thomas Frazier, director of research at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Frazier studies a long-known cancer gene called PTEN.
In 2001, researchers described a boy with a PTEN mutation who had both cancer and autism2. Since then, some autism sequencing studies have revealed more people with autism and PTEN mutations. PTEN is now among the genes with the strongest causative links to autism.
One of PTEN's functions is to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly. People with autism and PTEN mutations have enlarged heads, which may result from an overgrowth of nerve fibers. In cancer, mutations in PTEN remove one of a series of brakes that stops cells from growing out of control.
“It is not a stretch to believe that genes involved in cancer would also be involved in a disorder of brain development,” Frazier says.
Cancer chances:
The existence of risk genes linked to both cancer and autism does not mean that people with autism generally have an increased risk of cancer. For instance, the specific mutation in a gene such as PTEN may differ in people with cancer versus those with autism3.
What's more, epidemiological data show no link between cancer and autism. In a study published last year, researchers looked at the medical records of more than 1,500 adults with autism and found that, as a group, they were no more likely to have cancer than adults in the general population.
Still, it is possible that some autism-linked mutations increase cancer risk, says LaSalle. Because mutations in the genes the study highlights are rare, the effect of any one of these mutations might not show up in larger epidemiological trends.
Also, most of the participants in sequencing studies of autism are children, and would not yet be expected to have cancer. For example, a 2014 study looked at 15 people with mutations in CHD8, a top autism candidate gene; the two adults over age 40 in the study had tumors.
“We have to almost wait until these kids age to the point where they'd be getting cancers,” says LaSalle. If some mutations do increase cancer risk in adults with autism, they say, “it might be good for their own well-being to know that.”
The Rojiblancos are set to give Fiorentina €10 million and Mario Suarez in exchange for the Montenegro international
Stefan Savic has bid farewell to their Fiorentina team-mates ahead of their proposed move to Atletico Madrid.
The Montenegro international still has four years to run on their Viola contract and had been scheduled to travel with the club to New York on Sunday for the Serie A side's pre-season tour of the United States.
Yet Savic has withdrawn from the squad and is now set to fly to Madrid on Monday to complete a transfer that will see Fiorentina receive €10 million and midfielder Mario Suarez, who will move in the opposite direction.
Fiorentina posted a video on their official website on Sunday showing an emotional Savic saying goodbye to their colleagues at an airport as they prepared to depart for America.
The 24-year-old joined Fiorentina in 2012 from Manchester City and quickly established themselves as a first-team regular in Tuscany.
Cats and dogs; apples and oranges; Linux and Microsoft. Two of these three things do not go together. Would you believe that Microsoft—yes Microsoft—was the fifth largest contributor to the soon-to-be released Linux 3.0 kernel? Believe it.
In a Linux Weekly News story, currently only available to subscribers, an analysis of Linux 3.0 contributors reveals that Microsoft was the fifth largest corporate contributer to Linux 3.0. While only 15h overall, that still puts Microsoft behind only Red Hat, Intel, Novell, and IBM in contributing new code to this version of Linux.
To be exact, Microsoft developer K. Y Srinivasan gets the credit for helping to improve Linux. Of course, as you might guess, neither Srinivasan nor Microsoft are doing this due to any particular love tor Linux per se.
The vast bulk of Microsoft's contributions has been to its own Hyper-V virtualization hypervisor drivers. Hyper-V is Microsoft's 64-bit hypervisor-based virtualization system. It's Microsoft's answer to VMware and Linux's own native Kernel-based Virtualization Manager (KVM).
Microsoft you see wants it to be possible for both Linux to run Server 2008 R2 instances and for Windows 2008 R2 to run Linux instances using its own virtualizaton tools. Microsoft has been working on this for some time with Novell, now SUSE.
At first, this code wasn't open-sourced at all, but in 2009, it was discovered that some GPL code was already in Hyper-V's Linux drivers. So it was that “In a break from the ordinary, Microsoft released 20,000 lines of device driver code to the Linux community. The code, which includes three Linux device drivers, has been submitted to the Linux kernel community for inclusion in the Linux tree. The drivers will be available to the Linux community and customers alike, and will enhance the performance of the Linux operating system when virtualized on Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V or Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V.”
It also helped, of course, that Microsoft, ever so reluctantly, has been forced to work with Linux to try to keep their market share. As Matt Asay, a noted open-source executive and author said at the time, “The news reflects Microsoft's continued interest in lobotomizing its virtualization competition through low prices, but also the recognition that it must open up if it wants to fend off insurgent virtualization strategies from Red Hat, Novell, and others in the open-source camp.”
In the months after that though Microsoft did little to improve its code. Indeed Greg Kroah-Hartman, who oversees code staging to the Linux kernel, has complained at times that “The [Microsoft] developers again seem to have disappeared, this is getting old” and they threatened to remove the code from Linux.
Microsoft seems to have finally gotten the message. In the last few months they've worked hard to improve Hyper-V and Linux interoperability.
This may not last, and it's really only for Microsoft's own goals, but for now, Microsoft, yes Microsoft, is a leading contributor to Linux. Now, in these days of miracles, let me see if I can get my dogs to stop barking at my neighbors' cats.

WISCONSIN RAPIDS - A Dexter man pleaded guilty Tuesday to voting twice in the spring election and received 30-day jail sentence.
Troy A. Schiller, 43, said in court they got wrapped up in too much talk radio and made a stupid decision.
"I would like to say I'm sorry," Schiller said. "I'm sorry I made a careless decision."
Schiller said their actions had set a poor example for their children. It embarrassed and put a strain on their children and their whole family, Schiller told Wood County Circuit Judge Nicholas Brazeau Jr. during a plea hearing and sentencing Tuesday afternoon.
RELATED: Dexter man pleads not guilty to voting fraud​
RELATED: Rapids woman charged with voter fraud​
According to court documents, Schiller told a Wood County investigator they voted once in Pittsville and once in Dexter during the spring election.
The election wasn't just a presidential primary, Wood County District Attorney Craig Lambert said Tuesday. It also was a local election. Our representative form of democracy only works if it's done honestly, Lambert said.
Lambert asked Brazeau to sentence Schiller to 90 days in jail.
"(Schiller's) vote counted two times more than any other," Lambert said. "People inclined to do this need to know there are serious consequences and respect the integrity of our elections."
Schiller's attorney, Gregory Jerabek, said there is no shortage of good things to say about Schiller. Schiller has been married for 23 years and has never had a criminal charge, Jerabek said. Jerabek had letters from Schiller's family, friends and employers stating what a good person they are.
Schiller will be branded as a felon and that will follow them forever, Jerabek said. Carrying the felon label is punishment enough for someone like Schiller, Jerabek said. Jail is unnecessary, they said. Schilling will not be allowed to vote until they meet all the conditions of their sentence.
It doesn't make sense to put Schiller under supervision because Schiller doesn't have any of the normal problems supervision would address, like alcoholism or addiction, Brazeau said.
"You're a good guy," Brazeau said.
A few years ago, Wood County had a couple of races that were decided by one vote, Brazeau said. A vote can decide an election, and voting twice goes against the process, Brazeau said.
Nobody in the courtroom would want to spend even one night in jail, but there has to be a deterrent for voter fraud, Brazeau said. They sentenced Schiller to 30 days in jail and fined them $500.

“How's your day going?” can be a truly personal question. It's banal chitchat if all is well, but if you're going through immense trauma or crisis, it can feel invasive. Once, it might have been possible to brush off the question with a polite “fine” but we live in a world that no longer settles for polite. Instead, we're expected to be cheery and positive, regardless of what we're feeling inside.
“Emotional labor,” namely manipulating your own emotions to meet others' expectations, is most obvious and well-studied in the workplace. As factory line jobs that involve manual work have become less common over the centuries, more and more people are employed in service work, where manner and demeanor are part of the job description. Waiters, shop assistants, baristas, and housekeepers are expected to carry out their job with a smile, masking their feelings to appear gregarious and charming to all customers.
“The constant management of emotion can lead to emotional exhaustion and worker burnout,” says Melissa Sloan, a sociology professor at University of South Florida who has studied the effects of emotional labor. “When you're constantly changing the expression you give off to others, it can interfere with the signal function your emotion serves. It can be consequential to the self because workers are displaying a person to others that's not necessarily congruent with who they think they are.”
Even customers who don't know the term “emotional labor” recognize that service employees are often paid to be friendly—and employees in low-paying jobs are most likely to be told to mask their feelings—and so make an effort to respond with a similarly wide smile. After all, no one (hopefully) wants to be a jerk and it can feel rude not to meet a cheery greeting with an equally positive response.
But this, of course, does nothing to alleviate the burden of being paid to be happy, and instead means that emotional labor is spreading. Those in service jobs have to be happy, so do customers, and every public interaction is crammed with false optimism and forced smiles and cries of “awesome!”
Sociologists recognize that different cultures have varying degrees of managing emotions, explains Sloan. Some have an institutional approach, and dictate what feelings and emotional expressions are appropriate. Others are more impulsive, and believe people should express whatever emotion they feel freely. “In the US, the culture is more and more characterized by these institutional norms of emotional expression,” says Sloan. “There's a big difference between being polite and being forced to be friendly.”
It can sound miserly to complain about being friendly, but the implications can be quite harmful—especially for those who are experiencing strong negative emotions. Recently, when I had a major physical trauma and significant psychological fallout, I became increasingly aware of and distressed by the insistence on happiness. It felt profoundly wrong to buy food in between hospital visits, say, and be told to have a great day. Other demands for gregariousness were more relenting. In an Uber from my therapy session, for example, the driver repeatedly tried to make pleasant conversation. This was a time when I could barely talk to my closest family, and I was simply incapable of making chitchat with a stranger.
I'm sure they marked down my Uber rating. And, while that's hardly important on a small scale, the idea of constantly being rated for friendliness is only increasing the pressure to mask our emotions. Aziz Ansari's recent SNL sketch on ratings pressure is funny precisely because it's so relatable.
But from another perspective, the constant need to put on a good face and charm others can look dystopian. The first episode of Black Mirror's latest season, “Nosedive,” shows a not-too-distant future where every person has an individual score, made up of ratings given by every person they encounter throughout the day. This rating doesn't just affect their ability to get a cab ride, but what property they can rent or jobs they can have. It's a world of constant, forced optimism and no genuine emotions.
As with all social demands, the effects vary according to gender and ethnicity. Sloan's study on the subject shows that African American workers in the US have to put a lot more effort into suppressing emotions than their white colleagues, and that this was directly linked with greater job dissatisfaction. Further research shows that women are far less likely than men to show anger in the workplace, and far more likely to express happiness—and not because they feel happier than men, but due to pressures to appear cheerful. Whereas men are allowed to be brusque or firm, women are under greater expectation to minimize their emotions and appear amiable at all times.
Changing cultural expectations is hardly easy, but Sloan suggests starting where emotional labor begins: the workplace. “There have been calls for workplaces to do away with expectations of emotional labor and give workers more autonomy in their expressions,” they say. Instead of being incessantly friendly back to those in service industries, it's far healthier to demand that everyone should all be allowed to be sad or simply neutral, regardless of profession.
After all, reality dictates that we will all, at some point, experience a profoundly difficult time. But western culture increasingly leaves little personal space for those who've just suffered a major loss or tragedy and want to move through the world without being told to smile. Sometimes you just don't want to tell a stranger how your day's going.
Data drought: Rural Australians find alternative ways to get online despite Sky Muster rollout
Posted
A grassroots internet revolution is underway in regional Australia, as small telecommunications companies and farmers try to help end the data drought.
Some telcos are setting up fixed wireless networks and selling internet plans with unlimited data, a precious resource which rural people consistently say they are crying out for.
Red WiFi in Dalby, on Queensland's Darling Downs, runs high-speed fibre cable from the base of a tower in town, to their first broadcast location at the top of a local grain silo.
Red WiFi co-founder Steve Stephens said the network could keep expanding, as long as they had enough elevated spots on which to place their wireless dishes.
"If there's already existing infrastructure there, so a business owns a bucket elevator or a silo or a building, we will approach them and ask if we can broadcast off their location and, generally speaking, they are very happy," they said.
"In return, they get free internet or we negotiate something.
"And then from there we have antennas right around, 90 degree sector antennas, and that gives the whole town internet.
"From that site we go to our next site, 40 kilometres out of town, with our next wireless link, and that connects those two together and there is another 30-odd kilometres. And so on."
Families, businesses churning through expensive data quotas
Todd Jorgensen from Associated Grain said they were only too happy to help out.
"I already own the infrastructure and we have got a number of tall structures throughout the town," they explained.
"It is no skin off my nose if it does not cost me anything. It enables a small business to get a bit more traction and allows the community that I work with to get better internet connection."
Limited and expensive data is one of the most pressing issues raised amongst rural Australians, particularly for businesses and families who churn through their quotas quickly.
The Federal Government and the National Broadband Network Company (NBN Co) is currently working towards connecting 240,000 rural homes to the NBN through that satellite technology called Sky Muster. Currently, 31,000 are using the service.
The second Sky Muster satellite was launched from South America this week.
But it came after a disastrous time for existing customers, who have battled drop-outs and slow speeds for days due to a wide network outage caused by a system upgrade.
The NBN previously said that the South Australian power outage compounded the problem, but issues like latency, dodgy installations and a shortage of data have meant that more people are looking for alternative ways to connect.
NBN Co's regional affairs spokesperson, Joe Dennis, said the company was working through those problems.
"The last thing anyone wants is frustrated end users. We are doing everything we can to improve that," they said.
"That includes making sure that installers turn up on time and when they say they are going to. We want to make sure that the installation happens right the first time."
Grazier broadcast wi-fi to home from shed
Meg Kummerow, from Bongeen, near Dalby, runs a business selling drones to farmers and churns through lots of data, uploading images and using social media.
But under a fair use policy, internet providers are only allowed to sell Sky Muster customers plans that include peak data allowances of 70 gigabytes.
That is why they chose not to have Sky Muster installed. The grassroots fixed wireless option was cheaper, and did not have any data limits. But their decision was also a moral one.
"I did not feel right taking on Sky Muster when there were people out there who needed it more than what I did considering I had access to other internet such as Vodafone and the likes," they said.
Sheep grazier, Nigel Spoljaric shares that view. They live just outside Bombala, in southern New South Wales, and their house is in a mobile and internet black spot.
When a new wireless tower was built in town, they realised they could get a signal from it from their shearing shed. But the NBN Co maintained that they were only eligible for Sky Muster based on their home address.
"It was easier just to hang up and ring again and finally find someone whose probably more country-orientated in the NBN and knowing how desperate people were trying to get fixed wireless to their place," they recalled.
Eventually, the NBN Co agreed to give them fixed wireless from a newly created address — their shearing shed.
"I set up my little network beams … and shot it over about 5 kilometres across the property, down into our house where are today," they said.
They said the results had been phenomenal.
"Over the school holidays, we had family down and everyone had smartphones, everyone wanted to know the wireless key," they said.
"Everyone was on their social media, the kids were watching movies, we were doing research on other stuff, it was really positive."
Joe Dennis said that NBN Co was working with regional Australians to make opportunities like Mr Spoljaric's easier.
"NBN actually does have Sky Muster demonstration trucks and we are now going around places like the Henty Field days and AgQuip and other agricultural events around Australia so that we actually can get out on the ground and talk to people about how they can connect," they said.

Toni Trujillo, a medical marijuana patient in Los Angeles, was removed from the kidney transplant list at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center earlier this year, patient advocacy group Americans for Safe Access said it has learned. Trujillo is the second patient in the last year to be removed from the hospital's transplant lists for medical marijuana use.
The medical marijuana advocacy group called on the medical center to reconsider its policy on medical marijuana and restore Trujillo to the transplant list. In a letter Monday, the group said Trujillo has had kidney problems for most of their life and has been on dialysis for five years.
"Denying necessary transplants to medical marijuana patients is the worst kind of discrimination," said Americans for Safe Access chief counsel Joe Elford in a statement. "Cedars-Sinai would not be breaking any laws, federal or otherwise, by granting Toni Trujillo a kidney transplant, and it's certainly the ethical thing to do."
Trujillo has been using medical marijuana as an appetite stimulant since they first came to California two years ago. In doing so, she's managed to increase their protein levels, a critical concern for dialysis patients. In April, after waiting for a transplant for six years, they learned they had been delisted for "substance abuse." They said they had never before had any push back from the hospital about their medical marijuana use.
"I don't know why Cedars would deny me a transplant simply because I use a legal medication that works for me," said Trujillo in a statement. "I hope they listen to reason and change their misguided policy, if not for me then at least for the others who will certainly follow."
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trujillo isn't the first patient to be delisted for using medical marijuana. In 2011 medical marijuana patient Norman B. Smith, who'd been diagnosed with an inoperable liver cancer in 2009 and used the drug to mitigate the pain of chemotherapy, was removed from the liver transplant list days before they would have become eligible for a new organ.

NEW DELHI: Gaining momentum, economy grew by 7.9 per cent in March quarter to consolidate India's position as the fastest growing major economy with a five-year high growth rate of 7.6 per cent for the full fiscal on robust manufacturing growth.Enthused by the impressive numbers for 2015-16, as against 7.2 per cent in previous fiscal, the government said the growth rate can go up to 8 per cent in the current fiscal on the back of good monsoon.The farm sector also rebounded to the growth zone, as against a contraction in previous year, although the rate of expansion was low at 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.The industry lauded the numbers and expressed hope that better monsoon and further reforms will help expand the economy at even a faster pace.According to the data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) today, the growth in manufacturing and farm sectors during the fourth quarter accelerated to 9.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively.The core sector data in April too indicated momentum in the economic activity as it grew at rate of 8.5 per cent in the month, the highest in the last four years.Commenting on GDP numbers, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said India can move towards 8 per cent growth with better agriculture production."The various measures that the government has been taking in the last couple of years is beginning to show results and overall there are greenshoots...this year hopefully with good monsoon we should look at a growth closer to 8 per cent," they said.Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa said, "We should work towards seeing this ( GDP growth ) number grow. We are focusing on capital spending in infra and social spending.""Growth rate in the 4th quarter of 2015-16 at 7.9% almost hits the magical 8% mark. Good days ahead," NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya tweeted.The CSO has also revised the GDP growth rate for previous quarters of 2015-16 -- 7.5 per cent for April-June, 7.6 per cent for July-September and 7.2 per cent for October-December.The 7.6 per cent growth rate for 2015-16 is the same as projected by the CSO in its advance estimates of national income earlier in February this year.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee too said that the economy would achieve close to 8 per cent growth in 2016-17, "riding on the crest of strong macro-economic fundamentals, positive business sentiment and pro-growth monetary and fiscal policies"."Growth of 7.6 per cent for the fiscal year 2015-16 is in line with the advance estimates...In the current global economic scenario, this is a commendable performance and comes on the back of comprehensive reform measures undertaken by the government," said FICCI President Harshavardhan Neotia.As per the CSO data, GDP of the mining and quarrying segment grew by 8.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2015-16 whereas electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services recorded a growth rate of 9.3 per cent.Similarly, the construction sector grew at 4.5 per cent, trade, hotels, transport and communication at 9.9 per cent, financial, real estate and professional services at 9.1 per cent, and public administration, defence and other services at 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015-16.According to the new concept of Gross Value Added (GVA), farm sector grew at 1.2 per cent in 2015-16 as against contraction of 0.2 per cent in the previous fiscal.The manufacturing sector accelerated to 9.3 per cent, up from 5.5 per cent in the previous fiscal.However, the mining and quarrying segment recorded a growth of 7.4 per cent in FY2016, down from 10.8 per cent in the previous fiscal.According to data, the Gross National Income at current prices was estimated at Rs 134.19 lakh crore in 2015-16, against Rs 123.41 lakh crore during 2014-15, showing a rise of 8.7 per cent.The per capita income at current prices during 2015-16 is estimated to have attained a level of Rs 93,293 as compared to the first revised estimate for the year 2014-15 of Rs 86,879 showing a rise of 7.4 per cent.The GDP at current prices for 2015-16 is estimated at Rs 135.76 lakh crore, showing a growth rate of 8.7 per cent over the first revised estimates of GDP for the year 2014-15 of Rs 124.88 lakh crore.The real GDP or GDP at constant (2011-12) prices for 2015-16 is now estimated at Rs 113.50 lakh crore showing a growth rate of 7.6 per cent over the first revised estimates of GDP for 2014-15 of Rs 105.52 lakh crore, it added.
With films like Warm Bodies and World War Z hitting theaters next year, I thought it'd be nice to take a bit of an undead cinematic stock with a list of some of the best zombie films of all time.
Of course not everyone will agree with my choices, but it's my list dammit, and you're more than welcome to agree or disagree with me in the comments section below. Well…let's get on with this thing!
10. Night of the Living Dead
The one that started it all. George Romero, inspired by a Haiti voodoo myth, purported this black and white tale of the dead rising from their graves—because their was no more room in hell, of course—and despite it's low budget and shallow performances, there's no question that the claustrophobic nature of the film coupled with an impending sense of sociopolitical doom became the blueprint for all other zombie films to follow.
This is the godfather of zombie cinema, and to leave it out of this list would be to leave The Catcher in the Rye out of the pantheon of sociopath literature lore.
9. The Serpent and the Rainbow
This Bill Pullman starring vehicle is a more boiled-down zombie film, one that's centralized on the Haitian zombie mythos as opposed to an all out zombie apocalypse, but it's an interesting take on the ideal of the dead rising from their graves, and Bill Pullman does an amazingly sweaty job as a man on a mission whose finality is not the kind of answer they ultimately are seeking to experience. The final segment of the film scared the hell out of me as a child and remains chilling to this day.
8. Zombieland
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=071KqJu7WVo[/WatchTrailer2]
Sure, it's a bit of a farcical take on the zombie genre, but how much doom and gloom can this genre take without its batteries fizzing out. It's refreshing to see some humor added to idea of walking flesh-eating corpses, and Woody Harrelson gives a spirited performance—as they usually do—that makes a cameo by Bill Murray all the more exciting.
As far as tongue-in-cheekiness goes in the walking dead sub-genre, this is as fun as it gets. And the slow-motion zombie-kills are just a blood-splattering good time.
7. Ghosts of Mars
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_dFw4mxeI[/WatchTrailer2]
While it's not what you'd call a traditional dead rising from their graves zombie movie, it certainly is a re-animated corpse film, and isn't that what zombies are all about? I love John Carpenter films, even their bad ones (anyone remember Prince of Darkness…ugh) but this is one John Carpenter film that revels in all the things that great B-movies excel in: reluctant heroes that kick-ass, gruesome deaths, exaggerated monsters with excessive facial FX…it has it all. Not to mention it's fun as hell.
6. Pet Semetary
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMja9C6Htts[/WatchTrailer2]
This is a subtle zombie film focused on one family's plight with the horrors of bringing one's loved one back to life despite the self-absorbed act of it all. The film deals with the moral dilemma of accepting death, but of course, our characters are flawed, and they just can't seem to let their loved progress onto the next stage.
So what do we get? Zombified versions of their deceased, and as the genie in Aladdin put it, “I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. I DON'T LIKE DOING IT!”

5. Shaun of the Dead
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDUv3ZjH2k[/WatchTrailer2]
Edgar Wright knows how to mix genres with humor—he did it with the action genre in Hot Fuzz, and they do so here again with the zombie genre in Shaun of the Dead. The appeal of this film is how Wright takes all of the clichés and standardized sequences of the genre and turns them on their ear substituting guttural burps for guttural quenches of brain-thirst.
Not to mention, Wright, their cinematographer and editor do a fantastic job of superimposing your established zombie platitudes with everyman guffaws that work well to both mock the genre and pay homage to it.
4. Dawn of the Dead (2004)
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpjNdQQJirA[/WatchTrailer2]
Perhaps the most stylized zombie film on this list; Zach Snyder really made a name for himself—including a visually striking high-angle, opening sequence—with this remake of the 1978 George Romero film of the same name.
I admit I was hesitant when this film was announced, as Romero's film was just about as perfect as a zombie film can get (more on that later), but I was more than happy with Snyder's handling of the concept and material here. While their version didn't create the kind of horrific tension the original did, there's no denying this is one hell of a fun zombie film.
3. Evil Dead
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtsK7skqk9U[/WatchTrailer2]
The Evil Dead is a gory classic of epic proportions that progressed the zombie genre to the “cabin-in-the-woods” trope, and did so in such a garish and inventive fashion that it sprung several sequels and skyrocketed Sam Raimi's career, and rightfully so.
There's no denying that—despite the low budget—Raimi had undeniable talent with their canted shots, impressive close-ups, and wonderful use of stop-motion effects. You may not like it that this film is being remade, but if you've seen the trailer for the remake, you might just change your mind.
2. 28 Days Later
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eunaclr-WgU[/WatchTrailer2]
Possibly the most artistically and tightly wrought of all the films on this list, there nary a moment in Danny Boyle's film when you're being is not inundated with an imposing sense of dread. Just a wonderfully plotted, acted and directed film—if it wasn't for the next film on this list this would easily be the best zombie film ever made. Also, just a fantastic script by Alex Garland—one of their best.
1. Dawn Of the Dead (1978)
[WatchTrailer2]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpuNE1cX03c[/WatchTrailer2]
It's the film that made me wish there was a zombie apocalypse just so I could peruse the mall and live out the American dream: ultimate consumerism. George Romero's best film and commentary on the over-commercialism of American culture still stands the test of time and contains some truly horrific moments (the elevator scene still makes me rush to push the close door button).
There's never a dull moment in this film, and despite the horror, there's a sense of freedom and joy that you get to live through vicariously as the characters enjoy the emptiness of one of America's greatest creature comforts. Not just a classic of horror cinema, but a classic of American cinema in general.
The tax plan of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE would lower wages and cost the country more than 300,000 jobs, according to an analysis released Tuesday by the free-market Tax Foundation.
The group estimated that the Democratic presidential front-runner's plan would reduce the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) by 1 percent over the long run by imposing higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor.

"This reduction in GDP would translate into 0.8 percent lower wages and 311,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs," the Tax Foundation said.
Clinton's tax plan includes a 4-percent surtax on people making more than $5 million per year, enacting the "Buffett Rule" so that taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $1 million pay at least 30 percent in taxes and capping the value of itemized deductions at 28 percent, the Tax Foundation notes.
The proposal would raise government revenue by nearly $500 billion over 10 years when not considering the broader effects on the economy. When reduced economic output is taken into account, the Foundation said, federal revenue increases by $191 billion.
When not accounting for changes in the economy, Clinton's plan would lower the after-tax income of people in the top 10 percent by 0.7 percent and lower the after-tax incomes of those in the top 1 percent by 1.7 percent.
But when the reduced GDP is taken into consideration, Clinton's proposal would lower all taxpayers' after-tax incomes by at least 0.9 percent, according to the analysis.
"This study shows Hillary Clinton's plan to double down on the failed Obama economic agenda will only keep the American Dream out of reach of more Americans and bury the country in even more debt," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.
"The need for new Republican leadership in the White House couldn't be clearer.”
The Tax Foundation has also scored the tax plans from the leading Republican presidential contenders.
The group has estimated that several of the GOP candidates' tax plans would lower government revenue by more than $1 trillion.

The number of people in the U.S. who are in poverty is on track for a record increase on President Obama's watch, with the ranks of working-age poor approaching 1960s levels that led to the national war on poverty.
Census figures for 2009 — the recession-ravaged first year of the Democrat's presidency — are to be released in the coming week, and demographers expect grim findings.
It's unfortunate timing for Obama and their party just seven weeks before important elections when control of Congress is at stake. The anticipated poverty rate increase — from 13.2 percent to about 15 percent — would be another blow to Democrats struggling to persuade voters to keep them in power.
"The most important anti-poverty effort is growing the economy and making sure there are enough jobs out there," Obama said Friday at a White House news conference. They stressed their commitment to helping the poor achieve middle-class status and said, "If we can grow the economy faster and create more jobs, then everybody is swept up into that virtuous cycle."
Interviews with six demographers who closely track poverty trends found wide consensus that 2009 figures are likely to show a significant rate increase to the range of 14.7 percent to 15 percent.
Should those estimates hold true, some 45 million people in this country, or more than 1 in 7, were poor last year. It would be the highest single-year increase since the government began calculating poverty figures in 1959. The previous high was in 1980 when the rate jumped 1.3 percentage points to 13 percent during the energy crisis.
Among the 18-64 working-age population, the demographers expect a rise beyond 12.4 percent, up from 11.7 percent. That would make it the highest since at least 1965, when another Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson, launched the war on poverty that expanded the federal government's role in social welfare programs from education to health care.
Demographers also are confident the report will show:
_Child poverty increased from 19 percent to more than 20 percent.
_Blacks and Latinos were disproportionately hit, based on their higher rates of unemployment.
_Metropolitan areas that posted the largest gains in poverty included Modesto, Calif.; Detroit; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
"My guess is that politically these figures will be greeted with alarm and dismay but they won't constitute a clarion call to action," said William Galston, a domestic policy aide for President Bill Clinton. "I hope the parties don't blame each other for the desperate circumstances of desperate people. That would be wrong in my opinion. But that's not to say it won't happen."
Lawrence M. Mead, a New York University political science professor who is a conservative and wrote "The New Politics of Poverty: The Nonworking Poor in America," argued that the figures will have a minimal impact in November.
"Poverty is not as big an issue right now as middle-class unemployment. That's a lot more salient politically right now," they said.
But if Thursday's report is as troubling as expected, Republicans in the midst of an increasingly strong drive to win control of the House, if not the Senate, would get one more argument to make against Democrats in the campaign homestretch.
The GOP says voters should fire Democrats because Obama's economic fixes are hindering the sluggish economic recovery. Rightly or wrongly, Republicans could cite a higher poverty rate as evidence.
Democrats almost certainly will argue that they shouldn't be blamed. They're likely to counter that the economic woes — and the poverty increase — began under President George W. Bush with the near-collapse of the financial industry in late 2008.
Although that's true, it's far from certain that the Democratic explanation will sway voters who already are trending heavily toward the GOP in polls as worrisome economic news piles up.
Hispanics and blacks — traditionally solid Democratic constituencies — could be inclined to stay home in November if, as expected, the Census Bureau reports that many more of them were poor last year.
Beyond this fall, the findings could put pressure on Obama to expand government safety net programs ahead of their likely 2012 re-election bid even as Republicans criticize them about federal spending and annual deficits. Those are areas of concern for independent voters whose support is critical in elections.
Experts say a jump in the poverty rate could mean that the liberal viewpoint — social constraints prevent the poor from working — will gain steam over the conservative position that the poor have opportunities to work but choose not to because they get too much help.
"The Great Recession will surely push the poverty rate for working-age people to a nearly 50-year peak," said Elise Gould, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. They said that means "it's time for a renewed attack on poverty."
To Douglas Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor, the big question is whether there's anything more to do to help these families.
The 2009 forecasts are largely based on historical data and the unemployment rate, which climbed to 10.1 percent last October to post a record one-year gain.
The projections partly rely on a methodology by Rebecca Blank, a former poverty expert who now oversees the census. They estimated last year that poverty would hit about 14.8 percent if unemployment reached 10 percent. "As long as unemployment is higher, poverty will be higher," they said in an interview then.
A formula by Richard Bavier, a former analyst with the White House Office of Management and Budget who has had high rates of accuracy over the last decade, predicts poverty will reach 15 percent.
That would put the rate at the highest level since 1993. The all-time high was 22.4 percent in 1959, the first year the government began tracking poverty. It dropped to a low of 11.1 percent in 1973 after Johnson's war on poverty but has since fluctuated in the 12-14 percent range.
In 2008, the poverty level stood at $22,025 for a family of four, based on an official government calculation that includes only cash income before tax deductions. It excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth. It does not factor in noncash government aid such as tax credits or food stamps, which have surged to record levels in recent years under the federal stimulus program.
Beginning next year, the government plans to publish new, supplemental poverty figures that are expected to show even higher numbers of people in poverty than previously known. The figures will take into account rising costs of medical care, transportation and child care, a change analysts believe will add to the ranks of both seniors and working-age people in poverty.
× CHARGED: Sheboygan parents accused of passing out on bridge, leaving daughter to fend for themselves
SHEBOYGAN COUNTY (WITI) — Two Sheboygan parents are charged — accused of passing out on a bridge, and leaving their two-year-old daughter to fend for herself.
25-year-old Robert Alegria faces a charge of obstructing an officer, and child neglect as party to a crime.
34-year-old Brandy Dickey faces one charge of child neglect as party to a crime.
A criminal complaint filed against these parents says on Sunday, November 9th, just after 6:15 p.m., Sheboygan police were dispatched to the 900 block of S. 8th Street for a report of a two-year-old child screaming after that child was apparently left unattended on the 8th Street bridge.
Upon arrival, the complaint says police found Alegria and Dickey passed out, along with a two-year-old child, who appeared to be sleeping on top of Alegria.
An officer tried to wake all three, but was unable to receive any response.
Eventually, Alegria woke and attempted to stand up, but struggled due to the two-year-old child that was on top of them and the fact that they appeared to be highly intoxicated, according to the complaint.
The complaint says a strong odor of intoxicants was coming from Alegria, and as they attempted to stand up, they almost fell several times.
When Dickey woke up, the complaint says they were slurring their speech, and was speaking very slowly. An officer could smell an odor of intoxicants coming from Dickey as well.
In speaking with Alegria and Dickey, police learned they had come to the area to go fishing, and they had been drinking at a bar.
As police tried to convince Alegria to allow them to care for their daughter as the investigation proceeded, the complaint says Alegria refused to comply, and told police to leave the girl alone — using vulgarities toward the officer.
The complaint says police determined Alegria was a risk to their daughter's safety, as they continued to hold onto them while they were unstead on their feet — nearly losing their balance to the point where police had to work to prevent them from falling.
Police had to physically pull the girl out of Alegria's arms, according to the complaint.
The two-year-old girl was taken to the hospital for observation. There, the complaint says the girl informed police that they were very cold, and that they had been outside for a long time.
There are a lot of reasons why Kaley, 23, doesn't go clubbing any more. For a start, it's too expensive, with taxis, door fees and alcohol to pay for. Plus the clubs, even in the capital, are disappointing: they shut at 2am, much earlier than venues in Berlin, and just when you start enjoying yourself it's lighting on.
It's a similar story for Michelle, 24, who says they went out a lot at university but now they prefer chilling at home, and spends their cash on one-off big events such as festivals. “Everyone needs a night out, but it doesn't have to be in a club,” they say.
These are just two stories sent to the Guardian in response to our survey asking millennials (those aged 18 to 35) about their relationship with a once treasured pastime: clubbing.
Studies suggest that today's young have fallen out of love with it, and in its latest trend report the Office of National Statistics dropped the price of nightclub admission from the list of common goods and services used to calculate inflation.
Hundreds of clubs have closed in recent years. The decline of nightclubbing has been attributed, in part, to the smoking ban, and to relaxed licensing laws that make bars and pubs more appealing. But it has also been suggested that many young people, like Michelle, now simply prefer a night in as opposed to a night out, meeting people via online dating platforms such as Tinder instead.
We received 196 responses to our call out on clubbing, with the vast majority (131) agreeing that a night in was now preferable to a night out. What's more, 70 people said generation Y was less interested in clubbing, compared with only 45 who said more. However, not everyone answered this question.
So, why are today's youth no longer keen on clubs? It's not necessarily what you might think: 98 respondents said that their generation was not less interested in face-to-face meet-ups because of the rise of social media (compared to 33 who said they were – again, not everyone responded to this question).
Here are some of the reasons millennials don't want to go out any more, in their own words:
It's too expensive
Many talked about the rising price of a night out. Lucy, 25, from London said: “Why be crammed in a sweaty club or be limited to a handful of mindless nightlife activities when I could be doing a lot more at home for less money, with greater cultural value and without the hassle of trekking out?”
And even those who do enjoy a night out accept that it is at least partly because it's still affordable where they live. Helen, 23, from Newcastle said: “I'm lucky to live in one of the few parts of the UK where a night out is still relatively affordable. A taxi in town will cost you no more than £10 and drinks are rarely more than £3 or £4. The nightclub scene is also more diverse in Newcastle, catering to more genres and age groups.”
Harri, 27, from London pointed out that a night out now costs almost as much as a weekend away. “ I think dancing and sweating gross amounts to loud music is good for the soul. But you can now get cheap city breaks for the price of a good night out that you won't remember in London. And city breaks look better on Instagram.”
Clubs these days are rubbish
A lot of people slammed the fact that music is not what it used to be with Scin, 35, from Australia putting it quite succinctly, “I don't miss nightclubs because music is shit now.”
Tom, 33, from London bemoaned the demise of once great clubbing venues: “Bouncers are always rude and aggressive with no cause; DJs usually play what they want not what people want to listen to; the drinks are overpriced. Last time I went to Fabric, the music was still good but I realised as I was walking out that I'd been robbed.”
Many of those who responded also expressed a preference for big nights or festivals, where they could enjoy quality time with friends, rather than regular club experiences. Blaynos, 26, from London said: “I'd rather spend my money on going to try some new food rather than going to an overpriced nightclub, and spend my down days chilling at home with mates.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘ Last time I went to Fabric the music was still good but I realised as I was walking out that I'd been robbed.'
Clubs are too impersonal
Rather than seeing themselves as a generation stuck staring at phones and not wanting to connect in real life, most of the young people who responded said that clubs were simply not personal enough. At the end of a long week they want to spend time with their friends, rather than shout over music at them.
Sarah, 30, from Bristol said: “I'd much rather make a plan and meet up with friends face to face rather than sit in separate rooms and talk over social media. I don't use Facebook any more and I think my friendships are better now I make the effort to catch-up with people properly...I love live music, and going to see bands play live is the main way to keep them in existence these days.”
Harriet, 26, from Manchester said: “Having finished a masters recently, I'm suddenly in a city where there's not a lot of people I know around, so when I get to see my friends it's nice to sit down and chat with them rather than getting really drunk and not knowing what's going on with them. We're all working and busy so don't get to do the catch up stuff during the week.”
Going out creates anxiety
There was a small majority who found the clubbing scene simply too stressful. Dave, 19, from York said: “I find even pubs to be overwhelming, so nightclubs are just awful with all the noise, sound and crowded people. It's much easier and more comfortable for me to talk to my friends on Skype or Facebook than to force myself into an uncomfortable and intimidating situation.”
Abi, 24, from Bath agreed: “I find clubs totally overwhelming - I can't talk, people get lost or split off and it just generally ends up with me trying to find people rather than dancing ... staying in is more under my control.”
Sirena, 25 said that while previous generations embraced hedonism and were willing to lose three days to a big night out, the desperation to meet all our self-imposed goals makes today's young feel like a night out is an outrageous indulgence. “Plus, I think time with friends is at more of a premium as working days become longer and cities are more sprawled.”
Michael, 33, from Leicester said: “Life at home is far more relaxed nowadays so there isn't the push to get out of the house to talk to friends, and you can talk to anyone over the internet for free. Pre-social media and messenger services it would have cost a small fortune to stay in touch the way we do now.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Abi from Bath finds clubs totally overwhelming.
Safety and health concerns
There were issues that, perhaps understandably, affected women more than men. Ashley, 21, from London summed it up nicely when they said: “As a girl, going out to clubs can be quite annoying and sometimes scary if you constantly have to keep avoiding drunk people who may try to take advantage of you. I don't need to worry about that on a night in.”
Mina, 19, from Walsall agreed: “Not going to a club means you're less likely to get your drink spiked or get chatted up by creep strangers. Instead, you can actually talk to your friends without shouting over music.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mina, 19 from Walsall.
For some, health issues were also a factor. Alex, 27, from Essex said: “The reason we are less interested in clubbing is due to a combination of social media, being over-exposed and obsessed with how we want to be perceived to the outside (virtual) world. This stops us from letting our hair down for fear of candid photos being publicised online. There is also a lot of pressure to not drink, and not relax due to comparing ourselves to our peers with jobs, relationships, healthy lifestyles.”
Alice, 28, from Manchester said: “There is a surge towards being healthy and a night of drinking is a real turn off. A few drinks with friends is nice but better to go out for food.”
We are all too tired
The last reason given by many millennials? Exhaustion. This cropped up a lot, particularly among younger millennials still studying for their exams. Emily,18, from Solihull said: “I am working hard during the week for my A-levels and spend the majority of Saturday playing sport so when I have the chance to go out by Saturday evening I am too tired.”
Leah, 18, from Newcastle agreed: “Going out is too much effort. I'd rather chill in and relax from the stress of studying. It's also a good time to catch up with the things I haven't had time to watch or listen to in the week. It's always too expensive to go out.”
Brie, 21, from Sheffield was in a similar situation, and said that they cannot deal with a headache for a full morning as well as coping with university study. “A cuppa and biscuits in front of the telly is way more comfortable than waiting to be served in a club.”
For older millennials, just as exhausting as work is trying to keep up with competition in the graduate market. Ruth, 22 from Edinburgh said: “With a competitive work environment and everyone looking for graduate jobs, I cannot imagine turning up to work hungover or tired on a weekday and still performing well enough to get ahead. Going to bars and clubs is too expensive, everyone's too busy worrying about whether they will ever be able to afford a mortgage or children to throw away money every week on a club.”
Earlier this week, we got all hot and bothered over a set of spy photos showing the next-generation Subaru WRX STI testing at the Nürburgring. And while pretty still shots of a camouflaged car are always nice to look at, stirring up lots of speculation, having video is even better. Good thing, then, that our trusty spies were on hand to get some rolling footage of that STI as it lapped the infamous German track.Now, as a good majority of the comments on our previous post will point out, it looks like Subaru has dumbed down the design of that decidedly hot WRX Concept from New York for the road-going car. Of course, we need to wait until all that swirly paper is pulled off the body, but from what we can see here, it looks like this new 'Rex will be more akin to the current Impreza than we were originally led to believe So while we wait and hope that what's under the camouflage will be something sexy, have a look at the video below to watch the WRX STI prototype get worked out on the 'Ring.
After jumping forward to the year 2205 and travelling off-world, Blue Byte's city-building economy-o-strategy game is nipping back to Earth and the past once more. Ubisoft today announced Anno 1800 [official site], taking the historical strand slightly closer to the present. This time, industrialisation is in full fling and global empires are being built. Details are thin on the ground for now, this being one of many slim announcements hurled out at Gamescom, but Ubisoft do say Anno 1800 will launch in winter 2018 and share this announcement trailer:
And here's the requisite blurb:
“Anno 1800 brings players to the dawn of the industrial age, a time of industrialisation, diplomacy and discovery. Players will have the chance to prove their skills as a ruler, as they create huge metropolises, plan efficient logistic networks, explore and settle new lands and dominate their opponents by diplomacy, trade or warfare. “Anno 1800 combines the best of what the franchise can offer: a rich city-building experience, including a story-based campaign, a highly customisable sandbox mode and the classic Anno multiplayer experience.”
It's an Anno game, yeah?
Blue Byte are behind this, same as ever. Accompanying development is the Anno Union, a new community site where fans can vote on features and bits – a bit like Ubisoft did for Might & Magic Heroes 7.
A "Garo Creator's kNight" event held in Tokyo unveiled a new key visual and a trailer for the Garo -Honoo no Kokuin- anime based on the Garo Project tokusatsu drama program.
Yasuko Kobayashi ( JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Attack on Titan ) will write the new story and Yūichirō Hayashi will direct. Studio Mappa ( Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis, Hajime no Ippo Rising ) will animate the show this fall.
The Garo drama franchise has a dark story that revolves around humans that have the job of "Makai Knights," people who fight against demonic beings called Horrors. The first television series in the franchise revolves around Makai Knight Kōga Saejima, who tries to save a girl named Kaoru from their fate of death after being tainted by demon blood.
The Garo Project began in 2005, with the first series airing into 2006 with 25 episodes. The franchise has had a total of four television series and various films and specials.

'Rooting out a cancer like ISIL won't be easy and it won't be quick,' Obama said. Obama vows to remove ISIL 'cancer'
President Barack Obama vowed Tuesday to doggedly fight the growing threat coming from Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, even as they promised not to put troops back on the ground in Iraq.
“Rooting out a cancer like ISIL won't be easy and it won't be quick,” Obama told the American Legion's annual convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. “But tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being.”

Again offering their condolences to the family of American journalist James Foley, who was killed last week by ISIL militants, Obama had a message for the group: “America does not forget. Our reach is long. We are patient. Justice will be done.”

U.S. airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq began earlier this month, aimed at protecting American diplomats and military advisers there. “The limited strikes we're conducting have been necessary to protect our people and have helped Iraqi forces begin to push back these terrorists,” the president said.
Targeted attacks will continue, they added, but ground troops won't be part of the equation. Removing U.S. troops from Iraq “was the right thing to do,” they said, and “American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq. We'll not allow the United States to be dragged back into another ground war in Iraq because, ultimately, it is up to the Iraqis to bridge their differences and secure themselves.”
In addition to the airstrikes, the Obama administration is continuing to offer military assistance to the Iraqi government, Kurdish, forces in Iraq and to Syria's moderate opposition.
But Obama didn't say more about how they plan to go after ISIL in Syria, a potential gambit that promises to be much more complicated than efforts in Iraq. Nor has they made any decisions about potential military action there, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday.
( Also on POLITICO: The incredible shrinking defense industry)
Earnest declined Tuesday to confirm reports citing unnamed defense officials that Obama has approved a precursor to potential military action in Syria — U.S. surveillance flights over the country. They did, though, tell reporters traveling aboard Air Force One to Charlotte that the president has not yet made decisions about potential military action in Syria.
Syria's foreign minister said Monday that their government “is ready for cooperation and coordination at the regional and international level to fight terrorism,” but Earnest shot down the notion of working with Bashar al-Assad's regime. “As a matter of U.S. policy, we have not recognized” Assad as Syria's leader, they said. “There are no plans to change that policy and there are no plans to coordinate with the Assad regime.”
The president also used their speech to the veterans group to reiterate their pledge to reform the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. “The misconduct we've seen at too many facilities, with long wait times and veterans denied care and folks cooking the books, is outrageous and inexcusable,” they said. But, under the leadership of new VA Secretary Bob McDonald, they promised, that will change.
“Despite all the good work that the VA does every day, despite all the progress that we've made over the last several years, we are very clear-eyed about the problems that are still there,” Obama said to polite applause. “And those problems require us to regain the trust of our veterans and live up to our vision of VA that is more effective and more efficient and that truly puts veterans first. And I will not be satisfied until that happens.”
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles Times will slash 250 jobs, including 150 in the newsroom, and trim its published pages by 15 percent in an effort to save money in the face of declining revenues, the newspaper said on Wednesday.
The cuts are the latest in a series for the Times, which will have whittled its newsroom from nearly 1,200 reporters in 2000 to just over 700 as circulation and advertising revenues have faded in the face of competition from the Internet.
Most of the business-side positions had already been eliminated and the editorial jobs will be gone by Labor Day, in time for the Times to combine its print and Web newsrooms, the newspaper said.
The Times also intends to roll out new redesigned versions of both its print and Web editions.
“These moves will be difficult and painful,” Editor Russ Stanton said in a memo to the staff. “But it is absolutely crucial that as we move through this process, we must maintain our ambition and our determination to produce the highest-quality journalism in print and online, every day.”
The Times said in a separate story on the website that the editorial cuts amounted to about 17 percent of the staff. Publisher David Hiller told the paper that the goal of the cutbacks was long-term survival.
“We want to get ahead of the economy that's been rolling down on us and get to a size that will be sustainable,” Hiller said, adding that they expected the downturn to “bottom out” by early 2009.
$13 BILLION IN DEBT
The layoffs are part of a wider effort at Tribune to reduce expenses as it labors under some $13 billion in debt — a good portion coming from an $8.2 billion buyout led by Chicago real estate tycoon Sam Zell that took Tribune off the public market.
Some debt analysts say Tribune could default on its debt as early as next year. According to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp, the company needs to repay at least $1.6 billion of its loan facilities in 2008 and 2009.
The Chicago-based company has been selling off properties and is looking to divest even more, including the Chicago Cubs baseball team and Wrigley Field. It agreed in May to sell New York Newsday, its Long Island-based paper, to Cablevision Systems Corp for $650 million.
Morale at the paper has also been rocked by the departure of a string of editors and publishers who had resisted orders from Tribune to lower costs. Former publisher Jeffrey Johnson and former editor Dean Baquet both left the paper in 2006, as did Baquet's replacement, Jim O'Shea.
Before Wednesday, the most recent round of cuts came in February, when the paper lost 100 jobs, 40 in the newsroom.
Tribune's problems mirror that at other U.S. newspapers: revenue is falling, dragging profit margins along with it, as advertisers flee to the Internet. Newspapers in California and Florida are suffering especially as the downturn in the housing market cuts into advertising revenue.
Other Tribune newspapers are sharing in the pain. Tribune will cut 100 jobs at The Sun in Baltimore and 60 jobs at the Hartford Courant in Connecticut.
Elsewhere in the industry, McClatchy Co, which publishes the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee, said last month it would slash about 10 percent of its staff. The Boston Herald and Cox Newspapers also are cutting back, as are the New York Times and Washington Post.
Native Los Angeles band Feels are releasing their debut, self-titled LP on February 26 via Castle Face Records. The album was produced by Ty Segall and features a warm, chin-up, classically grrrl rock vibe (think Garbage). Case in point: the band's new single "Tell Me," a track that uses hook-heavy guitar and a solid beat to lure you into singer slash guitarist Laena Geronimo tenderly pleading (pretty sexily, too, for that matter) for their lover to tell them what the heck it is they want. They sing, Tell me if you want it/ I could hang around/ For you it's true I'd break my brains in two, before the hooks come back and we're full swing into a serious, frenzied smasher.
"'Tell Me' is my 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go,'" Geronimo told The FADER in an email. "There's a strength in vulnerability kind of, in just putting it all out there. Like, 'Look: I love you, I'll wait for you, I would walk 500 miles...but ONLY if you want me to, and I need to know NOW.' We wrote most of that song jamming all together and I just blurted out those lyrics. I definitely didn't think I'd keep them, just needed to get em off my chest, really! But at the end of the day they stuck."

It has been long overdue for me to attend a Barcraft. So in the name of getting a little more proactive in 2012 I decided to watch Saturdays Homestory Cup IV from the Kyoto Lounge in Manchester.
Manchester is a city of secrets one of these happens to be located next to Dominos on Grosvenor Street a place that only gamers in the city seem to know about. Upon entering the Kyoto Lounge down the staircase all seems normal until you walk through the door then the atmosphere has you. That intimate, trendy and guilty feeling found in places with low lighting and enough sofas to have five sleepovers. Throw in six massive TV's, a projector all streaming your favourite eSport (in this case SC2), eight PC's, nerd food and drink then you have the perfect place for a Barcraft.
After the initial om nom nom nom of nachos and milkshakes are out of the way. You then realise what has been missing from your regular watering hole for so long, that comfy gamer atmosphere where you can talk about how you think Terran is op without someone looking at you like your talking a dead language. Yet new comers seem very welcomed even if your eSports of choice is not SC2 the community as we all know is very accepting and even if you play no games at all you can not go wrong with sofas that comfy!
If at that inevitable moment we all feel the sudden urge to play SC2 after or while watching a tournament no problem! PC's provided by Scan are available for your pwning pleasure.
Wait a minute lady I don't live in Manchester how do you expect me to go to the Barcraft for say the next MLG? Well thats simple there is plenty of accommodation available in the northern quarter, plus something for every budget! Thanks to the convenient location of the Kyoto Lounge in terms of nightlife, food, shops and travel making a weekend of it is no problem either.
So there you go I'll most definitely be returning to the Kyoto Lounge for a second round of Barcraft but also trying out as many different Barcraft's as possible. After all 2012 could be the biggest year there is for eSports yet only if we make it that way so why not have a few drinks with good company along the way?
GLHF go pwn and enjoy some Barcraft!

Pulteney Bridge in Bath. James Caspian wanted to conduct the research for a master's degree in counselling and psychotherapy at Bath Spa University Getty
A researcher has been refused permission to study cases of people who have surgery to reverse gender reassignment by a university that said it risked generating controversy on social media sites.
The proposal was rejected with an explanation noting that it was a potentially “politically incorrect” piece of research and could lead to material being posted online that “may be detrimental to the reputation of the institution”.
James Caspian, a psychotherapist, who wanted to conduct the research for a master's degree in counselling and psychotherapy at Bath Spa University, accused it of failing to follow “the most basic tenets of academic and intellectual freedom of enquiry”.
Mr Caspian, 58, a counsellor who specialises in therapy for transgender people, embarked on the research after speaking to…
Police have arrested two teenagers they say tortured a 6-week-old puppy by shooting it nearly 20 times with a BB gun and throwing a knife at it.
The suspects, ages 14 and 17, were arrested Tuesday and charged with cruelty to animals, according to Capt. Mark Bollinger of the Rock Hill Police Department.
De'Monte Ty'Juan Douglas, 17, was placed in the city jail, where they remained without bond Tuesday afternoon. Per state law, the 14-year-old's identity is protected because of their age. They were petitioned to Family Court by detectives and released to a parent pending a court appearance, Bollinger said.

Warrants state Douglas and the 14-year-old shot the puppy 18 times with a BB gun and threw a knife at it, torturing it “without reason or cause.” Both suspects live at Wildwood Springs apartments, where a utility worker on Sunday saw a group of 15 to 20 juveniles playing with a black puppy.
A few minutes later, the worker went to check on the puppy and saw it was “bleeding heavily” from multiple wounds, police said.
Officers spoke with the teens, who told them “someone who stays in the apartment complex had stabbed the puppy and shot the puppy with a BB gun,” the report states.
The puppy was taken to Ebenezer Animal Hospital, where veterinarians found 18 BB pellets lodged in the dog's skin and muscle and a number of intestinal parasites, according to clinic co-owner April Splawn. Medical staff did not find stab wounds on the dog.
They determined the lab-mix puppy is about 6 weeks old and named them Brody.
Brody was doing well just one day after they were rescued, with the veterinarian overseeing their care calling their recovery “remarkable.” Hundreds have already applied to adopt him.
Police say these arrests complete the investigation. Cruelty to animals is a felony under South Carolina law and carries a maximum of five years in prison.
“We want to thank the public for all of their calls with information and concern and willingness to offer a reward in this case,” Bollinger said.
A few weeks ago now I had the chance to meet some fellow personal finance, frugality and coupon bloggers here in the Twin Cities area. It was a lot of fun to chat with a group of people who understand this “blogging thing”, and it was encouraging to hear from some of the group who blog full time and make a living from their online enterprises.
One of the bloggers that I was most interested to meet was Carrie Rocha of Pocket Your Dollars. Carrie has been blogging full time for a few years now, and is something of a celebrity here in the Twin Cities as she's a regular on a lot of the local morning shows.
At the blogger meetup Carrie was talking about how she's extremely busy right now because they just wrote their first book, and the book is now in the process of launching through a traditional publisher. She's doing tons of media appearances, book signings and other publicity for their new book. It was interesting to hear about all the work that goes into launching a book.
When Carrie offered to give me an advance copy of the book to review, I jumped at the chance. So today I'll be reviewing their new book, “Pocket Your Dollars: 5 attitude changes that will help you pay down debt, avoid financial stress, & keep more of what you make“.
Pocket Your Dollars: 5 Needed Attitude Changes To Change Your Finances
Carrie Rocha's new book, Pocket Your Dollars, isn't epic in length, I was able to read the book over a short weekend. But what it lacks in length, it makes up for in substance.
The book would best be described as the book you would recommend that people read before they undertake the endeavor of trying to get out of debt and change their financial lives.
The book delves into the weeds talking about why we get into debt, and explores why we need to change our attitudes about money before we can truly make a lasting change. Debt is often only the symptom of deeper underlying beliefs and attitudes about money.
So what are some of the attitudes that we need to change?
If Only I had More Money
Far too often people believe that if they only had a bit more money, things would start falling in line. They'd be able to pay off their debts, save for retirement and buy all those things they hadn't been able to afford before.
The problem is even people who make millions of dollars often can't out-earn themselves. They end up spending more than they make. A quote from the book that makes the point:
It doesn't matter how much money you make. What makes a difference, financially, is how much you keep.
Take responsibility for your situation, choose to change your behavior and your life, don't keep waiting on a time when you'll have more money (because it might not come).
Carrie writes in the book that making a change was all about taking responsibility, and believing they could make a change with what they had.
I don't have enough money to be able to change my financial life became I have all the money it takes to establish my financial future.
In order to get ahead you have to change yourself, not your income.
I Deserve A Treat
The “I deserve a treat” mentality is another attitude that tends to get people off track. We all work hard, and at times it can be easy to justify rewarding your hard work by buying yourself things, often with money that you don't have.
There's a phsyiological reason we enjoy rewarding ourselves and buying ourselves things. The body releases Dopamine – which activates the pleasure centers in the brain. The problem is that it's temporary. It's like a drug addiction where we have to consistently buy ourselves more things to get that same “high”.
Instead of allowing the “I deserve it” mindset to take hold, there are ways that you can indulge that still allows you to keep a responsible budget. Try giving yourself a small allowance every month that you can spend on whatever you want. Also try looking at why you're not buying things through a positive framework – create a larger goal that you're working towards that will make it all worthwhile in the end.
It Won't Happen To Me
A lot of people don't think to plan ahead for a rainy day. They don't save up an emergency fund, plan for irregular expenses, get insurance or plan for the worst case scenario. Instead they live in a bubble and just hope that bad things don't happen.
In this section Rocha looks at a variety of different regular and irregular expenses that we can expect to see, and talks about why it's important to plan ahead and save up the money for those expenses, before we need it.
They also talk about how it's important to keep those emergency funds segregated and away from our regular checking accounts – making it less accessible – and less likely for us to use that money for something other than an emergency.
Fake it ‘Til You Make It
This is an attitude that says it's OK to spend money that you don't have in order to portray a successful lifestyle. After all – if you want to be successful, you have to FEEL successful, right?
Problem is when you fake success, the negative balance in your bank account will be very real.
Carrie goes on to discuss what the wealthy really look like, and explore attributes that the wealthy have that you can emulate. The truth is the most wealthy folks don't drive expensive cars or live in expensive houses. In fact much of the reason why many of them are wealthy can be linked to their frugal nature.
I Can't Afford It
Another negative attitude to kick to the curb is the “I can't afford it” mentality. In truth there are probably a lot of things that you can afford, but this attitude can keep you from actually ever enjoying any of the money that you do make.
The “I can't afford it” attitude is on the other extreme of the “I deserve it attitude”. It takes a positive ability to delay gratification and “turns it into a refusal to ever be gratified”. It's the place where frugality becomes being cheap and miserly.
The can't afford it mentality is one that stems from greed, from fear of the unknown and from wanting to always have control. Rocha talks about how that can devolve into living a very unhappy life. The remedy? Making sure your decisions are coming from a place to create more happiness, not simply to create more stuff. Also, being generous can help us to feel the joy of giving and of seeing the result of why we work hard and save!
Examining And Changing Attitudes Will Speed Up The Process Of Debt Reduction
The thing that I really think this book gets right is in realizing the great importance of the psychological side of money. Getting rid of debt is about so much more than just creating a spreadsheet and a budget. It's about the emotions, beliefs and attitudes that we hold that can end up getting us in trouble if we're not careful.
Carrie Rocha urges us to examine our attitudes, to take responsibility and realize that while making a change won't happen overnight, it will lead to you living a happier life.
I'd highly recommend this book to just about everyone who is about to embark on the journey of debt reduction. It will give you the psychological boost and the head start that you need before you even get into the nitty gritty of setting up a budget. It will help you to identify and root out those harmful attitudes, and set you up for success.

The debt crisis in Greece has taken on a dramatic new twist. Sources with information about the government's actions have informed SPIEGEL ONLINE that Athens is considering withdrawing from the euro zone. The common currency area's finance ministers and representatives of the European Commission are holding a secret crisis meeting in Luxembourg on Friday night.
Greece's economic problems are massive, with protests against the government being held almost daily. Now Prime Minister George Papandreou apparently feels they have no other option: SPIEGEL ONLINE has obtained information from German government sources knowledgeable of the situation in Athens indicating that Papandreou's government is considering abandoning the euro and reintroducing its own currency.
Alarmed by Athens' intentions, the European Commission has called a crisis meeting in Luxembourg on Friday night. In addition to Greece's possible exit from the currency union, a speedy restructuring of the country's debt also features on the agenda. One year after the Greek crisis broke out, the development represents a potentially existential turning point for the European monetary union — regardless which variant is ultimately decided upon for dealing with Greece's massive troubles.
Given the tense situation, the meeting in Luxembourg has been declared highly confidential, with only the euro-zone finance ministers and senior staff members permitted to attend. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Jörg Asmussen, an influential state secretary in the Finance Ministry, are attending on Germany's behalf.

LUBBOCK, TX - Lubbock Police said officers were investigating a bank robbery Friday afternoon at the Wells Fargo branch at 50th Street and Quaker Avenue.
Police said a woman put their fingers under their sweater in the shape of a gun said they wanted “all the money.”
The teller just stared at them according to LPD, so the woman said, “April Fool's,” and left. There were no injuries and no money was taken.
“It's still a robbery,” said LPD Lieutenant Ray Mendoza.
When specifically asked if it was an attempted robbery Mendoza said, “Whoever did this, joke or not, committed a robbery.”
Police described the suspect as a black female wearing a multi-colored do-rag, a white jacket and pajama pants.
Mississauga Councillor Nando Iannicca called June 21 “one of the greatest days in the history of Cooksville.” Iannicca, who has served the area on city council for 27 years, was elated the day that council moved on their plan for the city to negotiate the purchase of 31 homes over 11 hectares near Cooksville Creek to build a “Central Park” in Mississauga. The resolution passed in camera.

But the plan came as a shock to the people the plan would most directly impact — the homeowners. Michele Alexander, 57, received a letter from the city in June which said the city was interested in buying the home she's lived in for 18 years. Worried about the possibility of expropriation, they were quick to check the news for more information. They didn't learn the details of Iannicca's park plan until early July, when it was reported in the media.

“The first thing that upset all of us is that there was no conversation ahead of time,” Alexander said. “None of us saw this coming.” Now Alexander is among a group of homeowners who are determined not to sell to the city. They say they were blind-sided by their own councillor's “secret” plan. They were among a number of Cooksville Creek homeowners who spoke at a Mississauga council meeting Wednesday, asking for assurance that their homes won't be expropriated. “I would probably be the last person out of there,” Alexander said in an interview with the Star. “I would fight to the very end because it's just wrong.” Iannicca said he's been transparent about their plan to “kill two birds with one stone” — to provide desperately needed park space to the growing city, and buy homes they said that would be hard to sell given the area's risk of flooding. Council gave the green light for the city to purchase the homes, all of which are in the city's floodplain, for their market value — no more than $2 million per home. The money to buy the homes will come from a city fund set aside for the purchase of land for parks. The council decision did not give city staff a mandate for expropriation.
By 2031, 7,000 more people will live in Cooksville and the area will be connected with the future Hurontario Light Rail Transit system. Iannicca said the need for park space will grow along with the neighbourhood's population. The large park would help correct the city's green space deficit and reduce the risk of floods in the area it would occupy, they said.

Alexander is doubtful that the money offered by the city will be enough to motivate them or their neighbours to move, especially since many of them have lived there for decades. The abundant trees in the neighbourhood make “you feel like you're going to a cottage when you go here,” Alexander said. The community is also tight knit — especially since the flood of 2013, when the neighbours helped each other out. “There's no way I could replace this for that kind of money,” Alexander said. Linda Kaszuba-Kostick, a realtor who lives and works in the Cooksville neighbourhood, said that homes near Cooksville Creek form a “high demand pocket;” the neighbourhood has good schools, existing green space and home values have risen in anticipation of the incoming LRT. “I don't think areas suffer from having another park,” they said. “If it's done beautifully, which I'm sure it will be, it will be a good thing.” Kaszuba-Kostick said the values of the properties the city wants to buy are difficult to predict. Some of the homes in the area are on large lots, which could make them worth more than $1 million, but the fact that they are on the floodplain hinders owners from building bigger homes on the lots, which is a trend in the area. Iannicca declined to release details about which properties specifically the city wishes to buy, but said that only 12 of them are occupied by the owners. Laura Piette, director of Park and Forestry, called the prospect of buying residents' longtime homes “a delicate matter.” They said the city intends to meet with all homeowners, and proceed to negotiate with willing sellers only. But enough homeowners refusing to sell could spell the end of Iannicca's years-old Central Park dreams. “That is my cautionary tale for everyone,” Iannicca said. “If this plan does not find favour we'll turn our attention elsewhere.” There are plenty of other homes located in the floodplain, whose owners may be more willing to sell to the city, in the event that Iannicca's own constituents resist, they said. If that happens, “I think many of them will see this as a tremendous opportunity lost,” they said. But Iannica's not planning on that right now. They said the home purchases will take time — up to three years — and that council will have time later to reevaluate if the Cooksville Creek owners don't budge. Iannicca said that they understand the homeowners' wish that they were consulted beforehand, but insists that they abstained from reaching out before the plan was approved to protect their privacy. “Now, dare I say, none of them have lost a damn thing,” they said. “I had no official story to tell until June of this year.” The city is now in the process of meeting with the homeowners.

ALMA Takes Close Look at Drama of Starbirth
Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have obtained a vivid close-up view of material streaming away from a newborn star. By looking at the glow coming from carbon monoxide molecules in an object called Herbig-Haro 46/47 they have discovered that its jets are even more energetic than previously thought. The very detailed new images have also revealed a previously unknown jet pointing in a totally different direction.
Young stars are violent objects that eject material at speeds as high as one million kilometres per hour. When this material crashes into the surrounding gas it glows, creating a Herbig-Haro object [1]. A spectacular example is named Herbig-Haro 46/47 and is situated about 1400 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation of Vela (The Sails). This object was the target of a study using ALMA during the Early Science phase, whilst the telescope was still under construction and well before the array was completed.
The new images reveal fine detail in two jets, one coming towards Earth and one moving away. The receding jet was almost invisible in earlier pictures made in visible light, due to obscuration by the dust clouds surrounding the new-born star. ALMA has not only provided much sharper images than earlier facilities but also allowed astronomers to measure how fast the glowing material is moving through space.
These new observations of Herbig-Haro 46/47 revealed that some of the ejected material had velocities much higher than had been measured before. This means the outflowing gas carries much more energy and momentum than previously thought.
The team leader and first author of the new study, Héctor Arce (Yale University, USA) explains that "ALMA's exquisite sensitivity allows the detection of previously unseen features in this source, like this very fast outflow. It also seems to be a textbook example of a simple model where the molecular outflow is generated by a wide-angle wind from the young star."
The observations were obtained in just five hours of ALMA observation time – even though ALMA was still under construction at the time – similar quality observations with other telescopes would have taken ten times longer.
"The detail in the Herbig-Haro 46/47 images is stunning. Perhaps more stunning is the fact that, for these types of observations, we really are still in the early days. In the future ALMA will provide even better images than this in a fraction of the time," adds Stuartt Corder (Joint ALMA Observatory, Chile), a co-author on the new paper.
Diego Mardones (Universidad de Chile), another co-author, emphasises that "this system is similar to most isolated low mass stars during their formation and birth. But it is also unusual because the outflow impacts the cloud directly on one side of the young star and escapes out of the cloud on the other. This makes it an excellent system for studying the impact of the stellar winds on the parent cloud from which the young star is formed."
The sharpness and sensitivity achieved by these ALMA observations also allowed the team to discover an unsuspected outflow component that seems to be coming from a lower mass companion to the young star. This secondary outflow is seen almost at right angles to the principal object and is apparently carving its own hole out of the surrounding cloud.
Arce concludes that "ALMA has made it possible to detect features in the observed outflow much more clearly than previous studies. This shows that there will certainly be many surprises and fascinating discoveries to be made with the full array. ALMA will certainly revolutionise the field of star formation!"
Notes
[1] The astronomers George Herbig and Guillermo Haro were not the first to see one of the objects that now bear their names, but they were the first to study the spectra of these strange objects in detail. They realised that they were not just clumps of gas and dust that reflected light, or glowed under the influence of the ultraviolet light from young stars, but were a new class of objects associated with shocks created by material ejected at high speeds in star formation regions.

A DePaul University sophomore has been accused of sexually assaulting a female mentally disabled student.Nineteen-year-old Joseph Annel will face a judge Monday.The 22-year-old woman, who has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, lives in a facility in the same building as Annel, but on a different floor run by National Louis University that teaches individuals with intellectual disabilities how to live independently, Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Keating said.The woman was using a computer in the building's computer room about 3:45 p.m. Friday when Annel invited the woman to their room to watch a movie, authorities said.Annel "told them they were cute and put their arm around her," according to court records. In their room, Annel undressed themselves and the woman and sexually assaulted her, Keating said.The woman told a supervisor in their program about what happened and police arrested Annel, Keating said. Annel initially told police he, too, was in the program for the disabled, which they are not, Keating said.Annel admitted that he'd seen the woman several times before and "thought they were kind of slow because of their speech," Keating said. They also said the woman asked them to stop during the incident, Keating said.Cook County Judge James Brown set bail for Annel at $50,000."I was pretty shocked by it," the woman's mother said Sunday. "People who would prey on the developmentally disabled; it's shocking."Asked about their daughter, the woman said: "She's doing fine. She's getting through it."
Prosecutors say Darreck Enciso allegedly posted a Craigslist ad seeking women who would engage in sexual acts. (Photo courtesy OC District Attorney's Office)
SANTA ANA (CBSLA.com) — A Disneyland employee faced charges Monday in offering free tickets to the Anaheim theme park to an undercover police officer who they believed to be a 14-year-old girl in exchange for sex acts.
Darreck Michael Enciso, 27, of Adelanto was scheduled to be arraigned Monday afternoon on one felony count each of attempted lewd act on a child, contacting a child with the intent to commit a specified sex crime and meeting a minor with the intent to engage in lewd conduct.
Prosecutors say Enciso allegedly posted a Craigslist ad dated July 1 seeking women who would engage in sexual acts in exchange for tickets to Disneyland.
A Huntington Beach police officer contacted the defendant and set up a meeting, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.
Prosecutors say when Enciso showed up for the meeting July 9 “with condoms and Disneyland tickets” in hand, they were arrested.
If convicted, Enciso faces a maximum sentence of over four years in state prison and mandatory lifetime sex offender registration.
Disneyland Resort's Suzi Brown released a statement regarding Enciso on Monday evening.
“He was immediately relieved of their duties as a dishwasher.”

For the past few months we've been spreading the word about our shiny new Data Pipeline: a Python-based tool that streams and transforms real-time data to services that need it. We wrote a series of blog posts covering how we replicate messages from our MySQL tables, how we track schemas and compute schema migrations, and finally how we connect our data to different types of data targets like Redshift and Salesforce.
With all of this talk about the Data Pipeline, you might think that we here at Yelp are like a kid with a new toy, wanting to keep it all to ourselves. But unlike most kids with new toys, we like to share–which is why we've decided to open-source the main components of our pipeline, just in time for the holiday season.
Without further ado, here are some stocking-stuffers for the upcoming holidays:
The MySQL Streamer tails MySQL binlogs for table changes. The Streamer is responsible for capturing individual database changes, enveloping those changes into Kafka messages (with an updated schema if necessary), and publishing to Kafka topics. The Schematizer service tracks the schemas associated with each message. When a new schema is encountered, the Schematizer handles registration and generates migration plans for downstream tables. The Data Pipeline clientlib provides an easy-to-use interface for producing and consuming Kafka messages. With the clientlib, you don't have to worry about Kafka topic names, encryption, or partitioning your consumer. You can think at the level of tables and data sources, and forget the rest. The Data Pipeline Avro utility package provides a Pythonic interface for reading and writing Avro schemas. It also provides an enum class for metadata like primary key info that we've found useful to include in our schemas. The Yelp Kafka library extends the kafka-python package to provide features such as a multiprocessing consumer group. This helps us to interact with Kafka in a high-performance way. The library also allows our users to discover information about the multi-regional Kafka deployment at Yelp.
A diagram of different components in the Data Pipeline. Individual services are shown with square edges, while shared packages have rounded edges.
Each of these projects is a Dockerized service that can easily be adapted to fit your infrastructure. We hope that they'll prove useful to anyone building a real-time streaming application with Python.
Happy hacking, and may your holidays be filled with real-time data!

SUCKS, IT DOES: Renee Lee has a tattoo of Princess Leia.
The force is not with us and nor is the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Census figures released last week have shone fresh light on Kiwis' religious faith but tens of thousands of responses were rejected because they were not deemed legitimate.
Among those considered "out of scope" are Jedi and Pastafarians, who profess to be worshippers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
After a public campaign in 2001, 53,715 people declared themselves as Jedi in the census, and 20,262 did so in 2006.
Wellington Jedi Renee Lee said it "sucked" that Jedi were not recorded as followers of a legitimate religion, particularly given it had more devotees than some more accepted faiths.
"Jedi is definitely a valid thing," they said.
"The idea started from a story, but you could say a lot of religions started that way."
Lee has always been a Star Wars movie fan and converted to Jedi a few years ago.
They have tattoos that include Jedi master Yoda and Princess Leia.
As a faith, it was mostly about being peaceful, kind and fighting the dark side, they said.
They and several friends all put Jedi as their religion on the census, although most did not take it as seriously as she.
"I just think they are cool principles to live by."
Craig Thomas, formerly of Auckland, ran unsuccessfully for council on a Jedi platform in 2010, promising to bring "wisdom and balance".
They now live in Australia, and continues to follow the Jedi way.
They were disappointed Jedi did not make the census list of religions. They said the Church of Scientology managed to get on the list with 315 devotees, and was similarly based on science fiction.
"Jedi is just aslegitimate, if not more so."
Statistics New Zealand last did a full review what religions it deems within scope in 1999. Several appeals to include Jedi were received in 2005 but were unsuccessful.
Broadly, Statistics NZ counts a religion as any set of beliefs and practices, usually involving a higher divine power, that people use to guide their lives, practically and morally.
Political beliefs, such as Marxism, or lifestyle choices, such as vegetarianism, do not make the cut.
Census manager Gareth Meech said many of the 28,300 "out of scope" religions - including beer and rugby - were clearly people being silly.
There were no plans to review the classification in the short term but there was no reason why Jedi, or even Pastafarianism, could not eventually qualify.
But Victoria University Professor Paul Morris, who specialises in religious studies, said Jedi and Pastafarianism still had a long way to go.
While some devotees might be genuine, many treated the notions almost as religious satire rather than a set of beliefs about the real world.
"Star Wars, for all its glory - and I am a fan - is still in a galaxy far, far away."
On the other hand, Scientologists were generally genuine believers in a complex mythology and their church was an established institution.
Boss boosted by midfielder's return although it confirms that Kevin Bru will miss out with a knee injury
Town boss Mick McCarthy has been boosted by the return of Teddy Bishop for tomorrow's clash with Brentford at Portman Road.
The Academy graduate has missed the last three games with an ankle injury but should be fine to return, although Kevin Bru will be missing for Town after twisting their knee against Leeds.
David McGoldrick has stepped up their recovery from injury, although you won't be considered to feature, with midfield duo Luke Hyam and Darren Ambrose are still absentees.
“One out, one in so to speak on the injury front,” Mick told the official Club website.
“Kevin Bru twisted their knee on Wednesday night, which was a surprise as we didn't realise until they limped off the bus at 3.30am on Thursday morning!
“Teddy Bishop is back though. He's been out for nine days but they trained yesterday and today and he's fit enough to be in the squad.
“David McGoldrick is back out on the grass, which is fantastic to see, but he's still not fully fit of course.
“Then it is status quo with Luke Hyam and Darren Ambrose, neither of them are fit yet.”
Meanwhile the boss has confirmed that striker Paul Taylor has left Portman Road.
“Paul Taylor's not our player. He's not been back with us and he's not my player,” Mick said.
JAIPUR: Finally, the 15-year-old agonising wait of Ugandan student Mujungu Mark ended, as they boarded plane for their home country with the money collected by some good samaritans on Wednesday.Mujungu Mark had come to Jaipur 15 years back to do their graduation. But they could neither complete their study nor return to their home as the Anti Corruption Bureau booked them in a case of attempt to influence the valuator for revaluation of their answersheet.However, the bureau failed to file any chargesheet against them in the court, leaving them stranded in the country for a long fifteen years.His wait for justice came to an end when they filed a mercy petition in a local court here requesting that either they be put in a jail or allow them to go back to their home country as they were not in a position to get a roof over their head and earn one square meals a day. They struggled to find a living by selling watches on the footpath.Mark said they were stranded in India as the Anti Corruption Bureau refused to give them a no-objection certificate (NOC) even though they did not file any chargesheet against him.Incidentally, three years ago, the Rajasthan University had also closed their case and a local court even allowed them to return to their country.After their mercy petition was heard by court on December 13, the court allowed them to go to their country for two months but they had no money to pay for the ticket and other expenses.Mark's lawyer Sudhir Badetia said they arranged money for their return to their home. They had to deposit Rs 12,000 for overstaying in the country after the expiry of their visa and work permit, besides Rs 30,000 for their flight ticket. We also paid them Rs 4,000 for their own journey expenses. Mark left by promising to come back as the court had given them only two months' permission.An emotional Mark, who is now 38, said: "I don't know whether my family members would be able to recognise me as they will be seeing me after 15 long years." They broke down when they said: "I will never see my mother who died a few months back."
DAVIE, Fla. – School is out for the Miami Dolphins, and summer vacation is officially underway.
After a full spring filled with organized team activities and mandatory minicamp, Miami's players have approximately five weeks off to rest, have fun and recuperate before training camp.
This also can be a nervous time for NFL head coaches. There is no longer structure or schedules for players to work out, practice and stay in shape.

It's every player for themselves for the next several weeks, and Dolphins rookie head coach Adam Gase spoke to their team Thursday after the final minicamp practice about making the right choices.
“You always want them to be smart. I think a lot of times a lot of guys in this profession, they just forget who they are, who they represent,” Gase said. “Understand what kind of situation you are putting yourself in. That's a decision you have to make for the next five weeks: What's the most important thing in your life? Hopefully, they get a chance to take a break, but at the same time, they make good decisions.”
Here are some other notes to wrap up minicamp:
Well, being the unlettered man of toil I pretend to be, I don't have much to right to an opinion in some things but, I must say, what a gnarly old hag of an arboreal specimen I have before me. Scarred, beaten, majestic. Beautiful. This and trees like it are the kind of trees that make me poetic and wistful. They look old and storied. Maybe a tree from the dawn, a seedling at some pre history faerie wedding or Druid ritual. One can imagine the lost bones of a warrior brave hidden in the hollow trunk. Or a child sacrifice to the elder gods.
I picked it up from Cosette at the Multi-Club picnic and auction back in October 2016. I've been waiting until now to work on it.
First step, weeding.
That's better.
It's been a long many months with me just looking, studying, sizing up the angles and site lines. I think I know now what the front is.
This is how it sits presently.
I kinda like this side for the movement.
Not sure if the top supports it though.
But if I choose that front, I'll lose this branch.
This side is cool. And, if I use this side…
…it removes the slingshot effect of the secondary trunk too.
Let me ponder with an orange. Oranges make you think. They focus the grey matter, so to speak.
Let's get to work.
Chop chop chop! First, it needs to be shorter.
Then the crotch branches….
The multiples and, of course those growing down (you'd have thought that the tree would've gotten the memo about geotropism, right?) must needs be removed.
I'm running out of daight tonight but let me point out the pointing branches. What is a pointing branch? Well, it's one that is straight, and pointing.
In bonsai, see, we don't like straight lines much. That's why we invented metal wire, actually. It wasn't for the movement of electricity or industrial purposes. Or for jewellery or anything purty like that. No sirree, it was purely for the artistic pursuit of line and the aesthetic goal of aged, bent branching in Bonsai, that our metallurgic ancestors created copper and then, subsequently, aluminum, wire. Indeed, invented and massed produced solely to make a straight branch crooked. Think about that amazing Factoid whilst partaking of your favorite cold beverage.
“There was a crooked man….”
Speaking of which, Guaracha and Dave repotted the tree for me. Say hi fellas!
Such gentlemen. Let's see if I can make a tree here.
It's gonna be all about the wire now. I have to transform the branches for young straight things into old, bent ones.
I'm not worried too much about the wire scars. That'll make the branches even more mean looking.
The main branches are done. Now to the twigs.
First, I think that too needs to go.
Better.
Onward fearless soldier.
As you can see from this (trees) right side shot, the structure I'm leaving is very non-traditional. Most bonsai stylists would remove that front “trunk”. I'm keeping it for two reasons. One, it's an old branch, it adds to the eccentric nature of this tree. Second, it'll annoy many people. Art, sometimes, should make you uncomfortable. The scars, the structure, the age of this tree should be off-putting. It should be hard to look at. The challenge is to make the structure cohesive, natural, and whole. This, ultimately, is what working on all those little trees is about. Practice. All those little trees are what artists call “a study”. It used to be that when an artist, be them a painter or sculptor or what have you, would practice on small details like a hand, or a tree, or a cow in a field. And when it was time to undertake a major work, the hand and the vision and the skill were already there to add to that work. Here's an example on a small winged elm root cutting. I called it a “study in line”.
It's not the best example of an exposed root bonsai but it looks aged. Just from the movement of the branches. Btw, that finger is for the ignorant ass who didn't know what a “study” was.
Back to our hackberry. Sorry.
Essentially, the tree will have two tops. This one in front. And of course the top, top. On top.
And the parting shot of course. One can't end a blog without one.
Let's see how it grows. Look for an update soon.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Green Bay Packers got a glimpse of what life would be like without Aaron Rodgers.
And it wasn't pretty.
With their starting quarterback at home nursing a head cold, coach Mike McCarthy on Tuesday put the offense in the hands of backups Graham Harrell and Vince Young while B.J. Coleman once again ran the scout team.
Harrell and Young each made a handful of plays that made them look capable of running the offense, but more often they were inconsistent.
In a non-pads practice, Harrell got the bulk of the snaps with the starters, including a lengthy no-huddle period. As usual, they looked fine on the short-to-intermediate throws, but the difference between them and Rodgers was evident on the deep balls.

During that no-huddle period, Harrell had receiver Jarrett Boykin open down the right sideline but sailed the ball over their head. Six plays later, Harrell overthrew receiver Tyrone Walker, who had a step or two on the nearest defender.
Harrell also threw an interception in the red zone when linebacker Terrell Manning stepped in front of a dump-off pass to running back Johnathan Franklin.
“It's always good to get in there with (the starters),” Harrell said. “I missed some balls, but you've just got to go in there and no matter when it is or who you're in there with, you've just got to make the most of your reps.”
Young, who is in their third week since signing with the Packers, took a few snaps with the starters but worked mostly with the No. 2 offense.
“There were some rough plays there,” McCarthy said, “but that's why we watch the tape. … I'm curious to watch it.”
In other developments from Tuesday's practice:
It's starting to look more and more like DuJuan Harris and Eddie Lacy will be a one-two punch in the running game. For the second consecutive day, they took the first two reps of each team period with the starters, followed by rookie Franklin and then veterans Alex Green and James Starks.
Rookie linebacker Sam Barrington, a seventh-round pick, has shown up on more of the top special-teams units of late. On Tuesday, they were on the No. 1 kickoff-return and No. 1 punt-return teams.
Without pads on Monday and Tuesday, there have not been any one-on-one pass-rushing/pass-blocking drills since last Wednesday.
With temperatures in the mid-to-upper 80s, it was one of the hottest practices of camp so far. Said McCarthy: “The only game I'm concerned about weather-wise is probably (at) Cincinnati (in Week 3). Now that I've said that, it's probably going to be hot as hell against San Francisco and Washington, but you can't really plan for that. But it's good to get in the heat.”
Medical report: Other than Rodgers, the only other new injury was to cornerback Loyce Means (ankle).
Cornerback James Nixon tried to return from the ankle and knee injuries they sustained Saturday at St. Louis but couldn't make it through practice.
Others who missed practice were WR Charles Johnson (knee), WR Randall Cobb (biceps), S Sean Richardson (neck), CB Tramon Williams (knee), OL J.C. Tretter (ankle), T Bryan Bulaga (knee), T Derek Sherrod (leg), TE Matthew Mulligan (elbow), WR Jordy Nelson (knee) and DE Jerel Worthy (knee).
What's next: The only full-pads practice of the week is scheduled for Wednesday at 11 a.m.
DOES your favourite app seem to be taking longer to load than it used to? That may be due to ever-richer graphics and overloaded cellphone networks, which take their toll on smartphone apps and increase the time they take to boot and retrieve information from the network on, say, train times or the weather.
A way to make them boot faster, developed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, could mean your app might one day be ready and waiting for you the moment before you need it.
Tingxin Yan and colleagues have borrowed a trick from computer science to achieve speedier loading. Called predictive caching, it involves guessing which software routines are most likely to be needed for the next stage of a computerised process – so that the right app is primed to run when called on, without booting from scratch. The system uses the phone's location and motion sensors to learn when the user typically runs the app, Yan will tell the MobiSys conference in Windermere, UK, which starts on 25 June.
Imagine that, as you walk to a railway station each day, you normally get to a certain street corner and open a train times app to see if the trains are running to schedule. The software checks the time you usually do this, senses that you are walking and preloads the app, with the current train info retrieved by the time you arrive at the corner on which you normally request it.

In tests, the software cut 6 seconds from the average 20-second boot-up time for apps on Windows phones – although it gobbled 2 per cent of the battery per day while doing so.
App author Peter Bentley at University College London sees issues. “This works great if the things being cached are entirely predictable. But what happens in an emergency when you need to use a rarely used but essential app and the phone has preloaded lots of massive apps which then have to be cleared first?”
Your phone's sensors are used to learn when you usually run an app, so it can be primed for next time
It would be better, they say, if coders designed apps to boot faster in the first place. It also depends on the type of app. “I would see this technology better suited to those apps that are designed to be used for 30 seconds or less and which need to go online and download/upload new data.”
CHARLESTON, S.C. — They sat on the same courtroom bench, but worlds apart — the parents of Walter L. Scott, a black man shot to death in 2015, and Michael T. Slager, the white police officer who killed them as they fled after a traffic stop.
And the arguments they heard from lawyers were just as disparate as they pleaded with jurors to settle a bitterly divisive case in their favor: for the government, a rare conviction of a police officer, and for the defense, an acquittal of an officer seen on tape shooting a fleeing man.
“Our whole criminal justice system rides on the back of law enforcement,” Scarlett A. Wilson, the chief prosecutor for Charleston County, told the jury of 11 white people and a black man. “They have to be held accountable when they mess up. It is very, very rare, but it does happen.”
But Mr. Slager's lawyer, Andrew J. Savage III, pressed jurors to resist “a false narrative” — that the officer malevolently opened fire toward Mr. Scott's back on April 4, 2015, when they fled a traffic stop for a broken taillight — and to find that Mr. Slager had acted in self-defense.
According to the received account of the Progressive Era, an enlightened government swept in and regulated markets for goods, labor, and capital, thereby protecting the hapless masses from the vicissitudes of unrestrained laissez-faire capitalism. The Progressives had faith that experts would rise above self-interest and implement wise plans to create a great society. The resulting state-level workplace safety regulations, restrictions on child labor, and minimum wages restored dignity and safety to the trod-upon and exploited workers.
Despite the widespread acceptance of this narrative, there are many reasons to question whether it accurately portrays the motivations and hopes of some Progressive-Era reformers. In a 2005 article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, “Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era,” the economist Thomas C. Leonard offered a completely new historical account of the sources of Progressive-Era labor legislation and the intentions of its supporters. Leonard's work, including an important 2009 article coauthored with legal scholar David E. Bernstein for Law and Contemporary Problems, “Excluding Unfit Workers: Social Control Versus Social Justice in the Age of Economic Reform,” indicates that lurking behind what many people see as humanitarian reforms was something much uglier.
Leonard and Bernstein argue that some of the most prominent of the Progressive reformers were “partisans of human inequality.” They supported interventions as ways to forward their eugenic goal of a purer (that is, whiter) human race by eliminating the opportunities for the “unfit” to get meaningful work. The “unfit” here included not just nonwhites (especially African-Americans) but also the “insane,” immigrants (especially from central and eastern Europe), and in a somewhat different way, women.
In other words, what we today think of as the unintended consequences of laws supported by today's well-meaning but economically uninformed Progressives were actually the intended goals of some of their intellectual ancestors a century ago. Early Progressive economists understood the effects of these interventions, but they thought those effects were desirable.
The Progressive economists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw social science not merely as a means of inquiry and understanding but as a guide to social management and control. The advent and broad acceptance of Darwinism in the late nineteenth century, combined with a more general belief in the power of science and scientific management to solve social problems, led to a fascination with eugenics and the possibility of using public policy to ensure the “survival of the fittest” and the purity and strength of the human race. In the hands of many thinkers at the turn of the twentieth century, Darwinian theory became a rationale for using the power of government to weed out the “undesirable” and “unfit” in much the way that the new understanding of evolution was changing agriculture and animal husbandry. Eugenics clubs and societies grew rapidly and many of the leading intellectuals of the early twentieth century, including a number of well-known economists (such as John Maynard Keynes and Irving Fisher, perhaps the most famous American economist of the time), were active in these groups and saw their work through the lens of eugenics.
Eugenics and Intended Consequences
We look back on the eugenics movement with proper horror. Yet the same ideas that led to forced sterilization also led to restrictions in the workplace, because labor markets were one place where eugenics-oriented economists could combine their two interests. They recognized early on that legislation which excluded the “unfit” from labor markets would advance their eugenic goals. Most of these laws were enacted at the state level during this period, but the New Deal era saw many of the same arguments applied at the national level.
Consider minimum wage laws, for example. Today we tend to think people support them because they believe a minimum wage is a free lunch that will help the poor. Classical-liberal economists have long criticized such regulations, arguing they are a perfect example of the law of unintended consequences and of the disconnect between intentions and outcomes. In a competitive labor market any worker who can produce value is hirable at some wage up to that value. Even workers with limited skills are employable. What the minimum wage and other mandated benefit laws do is create a minimum productivity criterion for hiring, closing off the labor market to workers whose productivity is too low to justify that cost.
Leonard's work shows that some advocates of the minimum wage, including many giants of the early days of the economics profession, such as John R. Commons and Richard T. Ely, understood exactly what minimum wage laws would do and liked it. In addition, various Progressives and socialists who were not economists, such as Eugene Debs and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, also supported minimum wage laws and other interventions into the labor market precisely because they would weed out those who were deemed too stupid or lazy to compete in a market economy—in particular, women, immigrants, and blacks.
Leonard writes, “the progressive economists . . . believed that the job loss induced by minimum wages was a social benefit, as it performed the eugenic service ridding the labor force of the ‘unemployable.'” They quote the Webbs' statement that “this unemployment is not a mark of social disease, but actually of social health.” Further, they quote Henry Rogers Seager of Columbia University, who suggested that minimum wages were necessary to protect workers from the “wearing competition of the casual worker and the drifter.”
A. B. Wolfe, who would one day be a president of the American Economic Association, wrote in the American Economic Review in 1917 (quoted in part by Leonard and Bernstein): “If the inefficient entrepreneurs would be eliminated [by minimum wages,] so would the ineffective workers. I am not disposed to waste much sympathy upon either class. The elimination of the inefficient is in line with our traditional emphasis on free competition, and also with the spirit and trend of modern social economics. There is no panacea that can ‘save' the incompetents except at the expense of the normal people. They are a burden on society and on the producers wherever they are.”
In the context of the early twentieth century this group largely included nonwhites, immigrants, and women, as well as white males with physical or mental disabilities—the very same groups the Progressive eugenicists thought were diluting the quality of the human gene pool. Unlike their modern successors, these supporters of minimum wage laws were under no illusion about the effects of their proposed policies; they understood and intended the negative consequences that economists now go to great lengths to argue will be the outcomes of the policies favored by contemporary Progressives. A great irony of the Progressive movement for a minimum wage is that while it aimed at eliminating the “unemployable,” it in fact created a group of “unemployables.”
Leonard's research shows that even professional economists, including some for whom distinguished prizes and lectures are named today, engaged in a manner of thinking about issues like minimum wages that was profoundly—even obscenely, given their explicitly racist goals—anti-economic. According to some Progressives, wages were determined not by marginal productivity but by the living standards to which a particular worker was accustomed. Competition from women, children, and members of “low-wage races” threatened the dignity of white male heads of households, the robustness of the white genetic stock, and ultimately the social fabric. Leonard and Bernstein quote sociologist Edward A. Ross, who wrote that “the coolie, though they cannot outdo the American, can underlive him.” If society was to endure, white male breadwinners needed protection from outside competition.
Economists today sometimes argue that subsidies or expansion of negative income tax programs like the earned income tax credit are far more efficient ways to help the poor than policies like minimum wages. Leonard and Bernstein point out that according to Progressive economist Royal Meeker, wage subsidies were undesirable precisely because they would create more employment, particularly among “unfortunates.” The virtue of the minimum wage was that it increased the supposed dignity of white labor while separating “unfortunates” and “defectives” from jobs they would have otherwise had. Minimum wages were supported by explicit racists seeking explicitly racist ends.
Fast-forward a few decades and the results are still the same even if the intentions are more noble. In a recent paper, “Unequal Harm: Racial Disparities in the Employment Consequences of Minimum Wage Increases,” William Even and David Macpherson argued that in states fully exposed to the most recent minimum wage increases, the law cost young African Americans more jobs than the recession has. We should judge policies by results, not intentions. As the economist Thomas Sowell might say, whether a policy is deemed “compassionate” or not should depend on its effects rather than the stated goals of its advocates.
Other Labor Market Interventions
Eugenics provided an allegedly scientific pretext for protectionist legislation—specifically, restrictions on immigration. The eugenicists supported immigration restrictions because they believed that members of “low-wage races” would compromise not only whites' living standards but also whites' genetic stock through miscegenation. According to them, immigrants and other outsiders (read: African-Americans) would degrade the labor force and debauch the species. The Progressives proceeded on a model of society in which a (white male) breadwinner earned a “family wage” sufficient to support a (white) wife and (white) children. Women were to fulfill their roles as “mothers of the race,” and children were to be trained to do the same in the following generation.
In their 2005 article Leonard pointed out that restrictions on child labor were enacted specifically to prevent the lower classes from putting their children to work. Presumably this would then cause them to think twice about procreating as well as limit their incomes.
The Progressives used the same techniques to reduce the labor market opportunities of women. Women were seen both as fragile—in need of protection from the rigors of the workplace—and as having a special role in bearing children and managing the household as “mothers of the race.” This was in contrast to the perceived “overbreeding” of nonwhites and immigrants from places like eastern and southern Europe. Progressive reformers tried to keep women out of the labor force by enacting a variety of “protective” legislation at the state level, including maximum hours and minimum wage laws for women, both of which were set differently from those for men. Such laws made women less desirable and more expensive employees, which limited their labor force participation—precisely the goal of the reformers.
The perils of the 1930s provided an opening for additional burdens on the labor market designed to exclude “unfit” workers. Leonard and Bernstein report that the Davis-Bacon Act, for example, was “passed with the intent of preventing itinerant African American workers and others from competing with white labor unionists for jobs on federal construction projects.” The amplification of interest-group politics was evident in the relatively transparent attempts by New Deal Progressives to protect special interests from low-wage competition from the South—from African-Americans and other “low-wage races.”
In the 1930s U.S. Rep. John Cochran (D-Mo.) said they had “received numerous complaints in recent months about southern contractors employing low-paid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the South.” Rep. Clayton Allgood (D-Al.) joined in: “Reference has been made to a contractor from Alabama who went to New York with bootleg labor. This is a fact. That contractor has cheap colored labor that they transport, and they put them in cabins, and it is labor of that sort that is in competition with white labor throughout the country.”
The disemployment effects, for example, of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) were stark. Leonard and Bernstein cite one estimate that the NIRA's “wage provisions directly or indirectly led to the dismissal of 500,000 African American workers.” They also write that “the American Federation of Labor took credit for the failure of the FLSA [Fair Labor Standards Act] to provide for a lower minimum wage in the South,” preventing southward capital flows.
The Progressives, the Modern Left, and the Dismal Science
This history can be read as the American version of what happened earlier in England. David Levy has shown that economics became known as the “dismal science” because classical-liberal economists (such as J. S. Mill) favored racial equality in a free labor market. Reactionary, elitist British Romantics such as Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin argued that the free market, with its underlying assumption of equality, would eliminate racial hierarchies and bring a “dismal” future of racial mixing. It was the classical-liberal economists who were providing the intellectual support for that future.
The moral of the story is that, despite the modern left's continued claim that the pro-market philosophy is racist, sexist, and xenophobic, history demonstrates that classical liberals/libertarians were proponents of equality and opponents of racism, and that those who viewed the races as unequal were likely to seek backing from the State, particularly in labor markets. The historical record of the left on these counts is much more mixed than it is willing to acknowledge.
Despite their odious views on race and the use of the State to enforce their eugenically informed vision of the future, Progressive-Era reformers were ahead of their modern liberal counterparts in one important way. They understood that free markets, especially free labor markets, are the enemy of racism.

For around ten thousand years cereals have been a staple component of human diets. They are ubiquitous, with a cultural and religious significance to many. They permeate our diet. But the component that makes wheat so perfect for making bread dough, with its stretchy, elastic consistency, can also elict a severe autoimmune response for sufferers of coeliac disease.
Gluten proteins split into two subgroups; gliadin (soluble) and glutenin (insoluble), with gliadin proteins contributing the majority of epitopes associated with coeliac disease. The autoimmune reaction results in inflammation of the small bowel resulting in a damaging of the gut lining and vitamin malabsorption. Untreated it can lead to a quadrupling in mortality. And there has been a dramatic increase in prevalence of undiagnosed coeliac disease, with around 1 in 100 people in the UK now affected.
The only current treatment for coeliac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet which is tricky. Gluten permeates the western diet, and there is evidence to suggest that a gluten free diet isn't the shining beacon of health purported by health magazines. It can be high in fat, and deficient in iron, folate and calcium. Once patients are on a gluten free diet they often put on weight.
But not all gluten proteins contain the allergenic stimulatory epitopes. Various groups have been trying to decrease these epitopes whilst maintaining the technical properties important in bread making. Broeck et al investigated the effect of deleting individual gene loci in Triticum aestivum or chinese spring, the first wheat variety to have its genome sequenced. They were able to identify the specific gliadins that could remove stimulatory epitopes whilst maintaining structural properties (the ω-gliadin, γ-gliadin, and LMW-GS loci from the short arm of chromosome 1 of the D-genome, 1DS).
Barro et al were able to go further using RNA interference (a method of using RNA to prevent gene expression by destroying specific mRNA sequences) to down regulate expression of these gliadins. Gluten extracts from three of these transgenic lines samples were unable to elicit T cell responses and six others caused reduced responses.
This is groundbreaking work for coeliac patients. It means that we are coming closer to being able to marginalise the effect of coeliac disease in the day-to-day life of sufferers. Being able to have coeliac specialised wheat without any loss of technical properties will make it much easier for sufferers to enjoy more foods, and live more fulfilled, healthier lives.
Jose Mourinho was involved in a furious dressing-room bust-up with Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson as the Manchester derby descended into acrimony.
Sources claimed the Manchester United manager had milk and water thrown at them after the spat with Ederson.
Mourinho was thought to have gone to the door of City's dressing room to ask their players to show more respect amid apparent disappointment over the way the Premier League leaders were celebrating their 2-1 win, as music blared from the visiting team dressing room.
But a war of words ended up breaking out at that point with Mourinho and Ederson believed to have been yelling at each other in Portuguese as a melee ensued involving players from both sides. There were even reports that Mourinho was hit on the head with a plastic water bottle, with security staff eventually forced to intervene.
The former Everton and Arsenal midfielder, Mikel Arteta, one of Pep Guardiola's assistants, was left with blood running down their face after allegedly being cut above the eyebrow in the skirmishes, which evoked memories of the infamous Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford in October 2004 when Sir Alex Ferguson was hit by pizza after United's game with Arsenal turned ugly.
The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there L.P.Hartley
Hosting the most recent Carnivalesque made me think about the enduring interest of ancient history. You'll know from looking around this blog that I have gravitated toward early modern history in the last few years, but this is a relatively recent return to that subject area. For much of my Bachelor and Masters degree I specialised in Jewish history, and in particular ancient Jewish history. I wrote my first dissertation on the Pharisees (c.50 CE) and my second dissertation on Jewish communities in the Persian period (c.300 BCE), so I was getting further back in time as I went.
Aside from academic study, ancient history has always been one of my interests and I think that this common to many, many people who like history either as a hobby or casual interest; ancient history is cool. Ancient history has Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Celts temples, pyramids, invasions, inventions and the founding of modern philosophy and religion. I would happily place a bet that the first four on that list alone are what drew most of us to history as children, it was certainly true with me. One of my first memories of school is of drawing a Celtic warrior, along with their Golden Labrador (the teacher was kind enough not to point out the slight historical license). You could almost argue that children have an instinctive interest in the long distant past.
But what draws us so instinctively to ancient times? The above quote from L.P Hartley only partly touches on it, the ‘past is a foreign country'. Curiosity about foreigners, about exotic countries with strange and unique traditions is universal, even if it is often driven by fear and suspicion. This instinct to observe, and in some to understand, foreign things is part of what draws us to the ‘foreign land' of history. These ancients, with their strange abodes, myths, imaginative violence and curious customs are aliens to our modern eyes. Because of that we want to investigate and marvel at them.
But, that in itself is not enough, observing something that's different in of itself doesn't go to explain the enduring popularity of looking at our far past. Instead I would argue that it is observing the similarities amongst the differences that draws us there, and the further back we get in time the more fascinated we are in the things we recognise. We love hearing about domestic gossip and curses discovered in graffiti or inscriptions, we love to hear about bravery and folly of soldiers and generals, we love to discover that amongst the sword and scandals were people surviving the same problems that we do today. Coming back to our metaphor, toilets in foreign countries are a constant source of fascination to English people; continental toilet seats, Japanese heated toilets that heat up and talk to you and 100 other things, my goodness how many different ways to deal with the same bodily function. This is true of our experience of the ancient past, they often came up with solutions to, or explanations of, the same issues that we have today that seem unusual now. The further we go back the more we are curious and delighted when we see the parallels.
I never intended to specialise in ancient history, let alone ancient Jewish history, at university but the lure of both proved too much to resist. The Parkes centre at Southampton university is a world class research in the study of Jewish history and culture so that helped. I'll talk about Jewish history in another post, but one aspect of ancient history that I was drawn to was biblical history, or more accurately the history of the people contemporaneous with biblical history. The actual, historical context in which the mythical, semi-mythical, and occasionally historical tales of the bible are set. Why? Well, ideas people had and the decisions that they made, two thousand years ago, still reverberate around our culture today. Like it or loathe it, if you have any significant contact with Europe or America then Christianity, that mix of greek philosophy and Jewish millenarianism, impacts on your life in a thousand little ways. I'm sure that this is not just true of Christianity but also of other ideas, religions and mythologies. My experience just happens to be in that area. So, this is another aspect of the popularity of ancient history, it's enduring relevance to modern life. Understanding what happened then is useful, it sheds light on what is happening now.
The popularity of ancient history isn't just about mummies, gladiators and wars, it is also about the delight in finding empathy with ancestors in a ‘foreign land' and it is about understanding the origins of our modern cultures and beliefs. That said, romans are just cool, and the ancient Chinese buried servants alive, and I totally forgot to mention the vikings! How can the poor old early modern period compete?

People gather round to watch as the greyhound is carried to the boiling cauldron by three men at a busy Chinese market.
But one little boy watches in horror as the dog is lowered on a stick into the water, as many in the crowd laugh.
The dog howls in terror and makes desperate attempts to escape.
It takes two men to hold down a lid until the animal is dead.
Animal rights campaigner Michele Brown said: “This animal died the worst death imaginable.
“You can see raw fear in the dog's eyes as its carried towards the boiling water.
“As they drop the dog into the water it screams for help, skin burning and blistering. It flails around so much, two strong men have to hold on to the lid.
“The young boy is an innocent child and they appear to be repulsed by what they saw.
"He was scared but unfortunately this probably won't be the last time they will see a dog being boiled alive.”
These horrific video scenes have been highlighted by Michele's animal rights group Fight Dog Meat in an effort to pressure the Chinese Government into introducing anti-cruelty laws.
At least 10 million dogs – many of which are stolen family pets – are killed for their meat every year in China, according to campaigners.
But the trail of neglect and cruelty leads back to our shores, claims another activist.
They say – although the exact history of the dog is unknown – the greyhound in the video was probably once a racing dog and could be originally from Ireland.
A British-based animal-rights group has uncovered a disturbing transportation network originating in Ireland and ending up in the Far East.
Rita James, from pressure group Caged NW, said: “The evidence shows Irish greyhounds are ending up there and we believe without the right legislation British dogs could also be sent.
“There is currently no protection for greyhounds that are bred for the racing industry, and no traceability for dogs that are no longer registered to race, or do not make the grade.
“This means they can go off the radar to be destroyed in the most horrific ways.
"The racing industry should be responsible for all greyhounds bred for racing, from cradle to grave.”
The cruelty of this video to Western eyes stems from the beliefs of a very different culture to ours.
"And it must be acknowledged that millions of Westerners eat meats considered offensive to other nations and religions.
But campaigners are angry about the cruelty exhibited in the shocking video shot in Shijiazhuang.
The city, of around 2 million in population, is the capital of North China's Hebei Province.
Many of the dogs slaughtered to be eaten are raised in cages and pens on industrial scale farms.
But animal rights campaigners believe a large number are stolen pets sold on the black market – some with collars still attached.
In China dog is a delicacy and unlike in the Western world tougher meat is considered tastier.
Because of these traders deliberately kill animals in the most painful way possible to fill their bodies with adrenaline.
Dogs are slaughtered by being boiled alive, skinned alive or bludgeoned to death.
Sometimes animals are tied down or have their leg tendons slashed to prevent them from running away.
Michele said: “They say pain at death makes the meat better quality and tougher. It is also seen as a boost to the male libido.
“I have had it said to my face ‘when men eat tough meat, it makes them tough'.
“In the video there were a number of spectators laughing and I find that quite disturbing.”
The video was discovered by the charity on a Chinese multimedia website last month, but it is not known who took the video or when exactly it was filmed.
The sick boiling video is the latest in a string of shocking animal cruelty cases to emerge from China.
Another video from China posted in January this year showed a dog being cooked alive in a boiling wok as it tried to scramble out, and another distressing video showed a fully conscious dog being blow torched to scrape its fur away as it tries to escape.
But the country has no animal cruelty laws, meaning people can torture dogs without fear of punishment.
In Chinese zoos crowds gather to watch live animals, including cows, goats and chickens, being fed to lions and tigers.
And the country's circuses also have a notorious reputation.
One investigation found baby monkeys and bears were chained by their necks to walls from birth.
The shackles forced the animals to stand on their hinds legs for hours on end - enabling them to perform standing tricks.
Michele added: “Unfortunately in China animals are seen as objects that can be replaced.
“I have seen hundreds of videos of dogs being boiled to death in exactly the same way.
“We are making a lot of noise and want to let the Chinese government know that we won't stop until they introduce laws.”
Dogs - and cats - are eaten across Asia, particularly in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and South Korea.

The trade is also active in Africa, particularly Nigeria, although in many countries pets are only eaten as a last resort before starvation.
Supporters say the tradition of eating dog meat dates back 500 years in China, with some believing it helps ward off summer heat.
But the dish has only become popularised in the last three decades, with specialist restaurants and food festivals devoted to it.
Every year over 10,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered for their meat at China's Yulin festival.
Animal campaigners have repeatedly called for the 10-day event - in the rural Guangxi Zhuang region - to be banned.
But Chinese local government officials say they are unable to act because the festival is organised privately.
(Image: Imaginechina / Splash News)
Criminal gangs are known to be involved in the dog meat trade because of its close links to the black market.
Conditions have been improving in modern cities but rural areas of the country still have significant cruelty issues.
The RSPCA's international team has been involved in developing China's proposed Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
They have also carried out an education program involving 300 schools.
An RSPCA spokesperson said: “No animals in China are protected from cruelty because China has no animal protection law like we have here in England.
“For the last eight years, the RSPCA has been working closely with the Chinese authorities and other animal welfare organisations to change this and to introduce the country's first animal welfare legislation.”
﻿A spokesperson for the Irish Greyhound Board said: "The IGB has no control of events outside the jurisdiction of Ireland the IGB emphatically does not support the export of greyhounds to destinations where the standard of care for greyhounds falls below that required.
"The Irish Greyhound Board, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum are committed to working together to ensure adherence to any regulatory and statutory protection for greyhounds, and for the relevant authorities to take appropriate stringent action against those who fail to do so.
"The Irish Greyhound Board is not aware of any recent exports of Irish greyhounds to Macau or China."

India and the world should demolish Pakistan's political strategy around short-range low-yield nuclear weapons
by Pranay Kotasthane (@pranaykotas)
Quartz India carried a piece today titled “Pakistan's army is building an arsenal of tiny nuclear weapons—and it's going to backfire”. As the title suggests, the piece is aimed at convincing the people of Pakistan that:
they should be more sanguine, or even alarmed by Pakistan's development of tactical nuclear weapons.
The piece gives five reasons explaining the problems with Pakistan's nuclear strategy. However, there is one essential issue that the article sidesteps, which is that Pakistani “tactical” nuke has already been deployed as a political weapon.
Given below is an assessment of the political aims and the strategy behind Pakistan's development of short-range nuclear weapons.
The narrative of battlefield nukes serves two political aims. First, Pakistan assumes that given its possession of such weapons, India is more likely to tolerate terrorist attacks or territorial intrusions, rather than risk a nuclear retaliation. Second, it seeks international intervention on its side after escalating a border conflict by reminding the world how every single skirmish is a hair's breadth away from a nuclear war.
If the recent academic debates are any indication, Pakistan is steadily gaining success in its political aims by creating an artificial distinction between tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, and that is a cause of concern for India and the world. The legend of tactical nukes is having the political effects desired by Pakistan in three ways.
First, Pakistan has been partly successful in creating a narrative that tactical nuclear weapons are merely an extension of a conventional war, and that their usage does not necessarily imply a full scale nuclear exchange. This artificial distinction has found support in some Indian quarters as well. Arguments such as “India's nuclear doctrine is not credible enough to deter Pakistan's tactical nuclear weapons” and “India is unlikely to press the nuclear button in response to a tactical nuclear weapon killing 30 odd Indian soldiers on Pakistan's territory” are already being made in India.
Such arguments fundamentally misread the situation. The Indian nuclear doctrine is clear — it commits to massive retaliation in the event that a nuclear weapon is used against it, regardless of Pakistan's marketing strategy around the weapon in question. This is sufficient to deter any move by Pakistan to use a nuke.
Second, a view that has taken shape recently is that somehow, the onus of preventing Pakistan from using tactical nuclear weapons lies with India. The argument goes that India should unilaterally declare that its conventional forces will never enter into Pakistan. Since Pakistan's battlefield nuclear arsenal is primarily meant to counter India's conventional advantage, Pakistan can then be convinced about scaling down the development of such nukes.
This argument is fallacious because it runs against the basic strategy of conventional war on which all modern armies have been based — to conquer territory and achieve stated objectives as determined before or during the war. Hence, it is not prudent to expect that the Indian armed forces, or for that matter any modern armed force, will acquiesce to any such declaration.
Third, Pakistan has introduced an element of plausible deniability into the deterrence equation. Analysts often cite that command and control operations of tactical nukes mean that a single soldier may push the world into a nuclear exchange. Worse still, Pakistan has conveyed that nukes may unintentionally fall into the hands of the terrorists. Again, the fear of command and control problems been hugely exaggerated by Pakistan. The unintended usage of a nuclear weapon on Pakistani soil is of a much greater concern to the Pakistani army rather than to India.
The deterrence in India—Pakistan scenario rests on the principle of Mutually Unacceptable Damage (MUD) — that both countries will find the nuclear destruction of even one of their cities unacceptable. At the low levels of availability and operability of nuclear warheads in both countries, not even a total nuclear exchange will completely destroy India or Pakistan. The Indian side particularly wants the nuclear threshold to be as high as possible so that it does not have to use nuclear weapons ever, knowing that it will halt its primary quest for securing prosperity to its citizens. The question is whether the Pakistani military—jihadi complex considers a nuclear exchange unacceptable to the same extent, or not. As long as it does, we need not worry about Pakistan's fiction of tactical nuclear weapons. India is in a position to manage the nuclear threat from Pakistan by systematically discrediting the political strategy behind Pakistan's “tactical” nuclear weaponry.

One of the seemingly endless variations on the "men today are in crisis and it's mostly women's fault" trope is the idea that most straight guys are completely incapable of figuring out what the other sex actually wants. Pop psychologists assure us that men are evolutionarily hardwired towards promiscuity, simplicity, and the inability to pick up on subtle clues. As a result, the theory holds, men are both easily manipulated and vulnerable to chronic misinterpretation of women's dress and behavior. So vulnerable, in fact, that some advocates for men are calling for a change in sexual harassment law: a change that would force women either to cover up — or put out. This, obviously, is bullshit, but the rationale behind it is even more ridiculous.
The latest iteration of this argument has the Antipodes a-buzzing. Bettina Arndt argued in the Sydney Morning Herald that "everywhere you look, women are stepping out dressed provocatively, but bristling if the wrong man shows they enjoy the display." (Remember, it's summer down under.) Arndt writes:
[Men] are in a total state of confusion… Sensitive males are wary, not knowing where to look. Afraid of causing offense. And there are angry men, the beta males who lack the looks, the trappings of success to tick these women's boxes. They know the goodies on display are not for them. These are the men most likely to behave badly, blatantly leering, grabbing and sneering. For them, the whole thing is a tease. They know it and resent it.
There's nothing new about arguing that scantily-clad women drive helpless men to distraction — or worse. SlutWalkers and Talmudic scholars (among others) have made the case over and over that nothing a woman wears (or doesn't wear) can cause a man to rape her, but their voices are often drowned out by those who ridiculously insist on outsourcing all male sexual self-control to women.
Advertisement
In Arndt's case, they go beyond merely holding women responsible for their own rapes. Them op-ed implies that women who don't cover up are committing an act of cruelty against most men, most of the time. Arndt claims that a conventionally attractive woman who shows off their cleavage "is advertising their wares to the world, not just their target audience, and somehow men are expected to know when they are not on their page… But as we all know, many men are lousy at that stuff — the language totally escapes them."
Arndt's appeal to the universal "knowledge" of men's cluelessness is as casual as it is clumsy. She's right in the sense that our culture raises men to inadvertently confuse a woman's bare skin (or a smile, or direct eye contact) with a sexual come-on. But most men are not biologically incapable of either empathy or intuition. They can learn to distinguish sexual interest from politeness, a fashion choice from an attempt at seduction. Rejection from women (and "correction" from other men) is often how they learn.
Advertisement
Arndt doesn't believe men are capable of learning these non-verbal skills. More importantly, like many in the men's rights movement to which she's sympathetic, they don't think they should have to. They approvingly cite Rob Tiller, an Australian psychotherapist and men's advocate who refers to women who wear revealing clothing as committing "biological sexual harassment." This idea that women who go around "flaunting their bodies" are harassing men has become a pet issue for many in the North American men's rights movement. One site claims: "In many offices across America, women dress provocatively, showing inappropriate thigh and cleavage. This, in itself, is sexual harassment against men — but women get away with it, and men rarely complain."
Sexual harassment, of course, takes many forms. Tiller and their fellow men's rights activists (MRAs) refer seem to think that scantily-clad women are guilty of creating a "hostile environment." The term is the same in both Australian and American sexual harassment law, and refers to a workplace or school culture that tolerates unwanted sexual behavior. The law rejects the idea that a low-cut blouse or a short skirt might constitute a hostile environment, but that hasn't stopped the MRAs — or their allies like Arndt — from arguing that perhaps the law should be changed to recognize the damage that sexually tantalizing dress does to men.
The traditional arguments for women's modesty have been that concealing dress was necessary to protect men from lustful thoughts and to protect women from being raped. But Arndt and the MRAs have a different rationale. They're not offended by skimpy clothing on religious grounds, nor do they all buy into the myth of male weakness that says that bare female skin invariably causes otherwise nice guys to commit sexual assault. Rather, they seem to be arguing that by tempting all straight men while only being willing to sleep with a few, flirtatious or scantily-clad women are engaged in a particularly cruel form of sexualized discrimination. That, the MRAs insist, ought to be seen as sexual harassment.

For Arndt and their ideological fellow travelers, it's sexually unsuccessful straight men ("betas") that suffer the most from a culture in which women are free to display their bodies. Asking women to cover up isn't about protecting purity; for the MRAs it's about protecting betas from humiliation and from self-esteem-destroying reminders that they can look but never touch the bodies for which they long. All of that pent-up male resentment is women's fault, Arndt implies, and it is women's responsibility to consider the soul-scarring cost of the mixed messages their revealing clothing sends.
The kind of particularly male pain that Arndt and their allies describe isn't rooted in women's flirtatiousness, sexy clothing, or presumed preference for "alpha" males. Whether they're genuinely hurting or just petulantly sulking, the confusion and hurt with which men cope is based largely on their own sense of entitlement. The calculus of entitlement works like this: if women don't want to turn men on, they need to cover up. If they don't cover up, they'll turn men on. If they turn men on, women are obligated to do something to assuage that lust. Having turned them on, if women don't give men what they want, then women are cruel teases who have no right to complain if men lash out in justified rage at being denied what they've been taught is rightfully theirs.
The reality is that sexual rejection happens to men and women alike. That's part of living in a world in which for a host of reasons, we are not all equally attractive, and where the people we want to sleep with will not always want to sleep with us. The hard truth men and women alike need to grasp is a simple one: our arousal is not someone else's problem to solve. The sooner we encourage men in particular to grasp that truth, the safer and happier we'll all be.

The first sign that the Alzheimer's disease that ravaged my grandmother was back for their daughter was when Mom began having trouble saying “CNN.” She'd watched the cable news network for years with ferocious interest ever since returning from a life abroad in the Foreign Service to rural New Hampshire. There they nested in their mother's house, saying she'd never move.
It was a distinctly peaceful life. I'd listen to them play the grand piano — the passion that had taken them to Juilliard decades earlier — and marvel at the lightness of their hands on the keys. On Sundays, they were the favorite lector at our church, reading the liturgy with an elegance instilled by their mother and grandmother, both trained elocutionists.
They also wrote and recorded essays on country living for NPR on subjects like “Mahler and Macaroni.” Words mattered a great deal to them They mattered the world to me. I used to say I'd won the lottery when it came to mothers.
After Dad died, my mother continued to live alone in the big white house on the common. It was here in 1988 that she'd written a keenly observed Sunday commentary for this newspaper about their own mother's battle with aging — and the dementia that “erased their life, line by line.”
They wanted me to promise that if their own light dimmed – or as they put it, “when I lose my mind too” – I wouldn't upend my own life to care for them But we never came up with a real plan.
About a year after CNN became “C…D…D…” and the home care team we'd improvised announced my mother's decline was too much for them, my brothers and I barely persuaded them to “visit” sunny California where my middle brother lived.
That visit became a new “post” in a fancy retirement community where, for $7,500 a month, they had their own studio and bathroom. They enjoyed music events and a stately dining room with a menu. There was even a church on the corner.
But like so many living with Alzheimer's, Mom's biorhythms were upside down. She'd often sleep during the day and be up all night doing what is known as “exit-seeking.”
Nights are the Achilles' heel of most eldercare facilities, staffed by the fewest caregivers — and the most inexperienced. Across the country, in many well-meaning Alzheimer's units, memory care residents are treated with confinement.
So Mom “graduated” to the locked Memory Care unit for their “safety.” It broke my heart to watch them on tiptoes, peering through the locked door's porthole across to the dining room they once enjoyed.
Alzheimer's is not a mere matter of Swiss cheese memory and odd behaviors. It is a serious medical condition. It is terminal. It should be known for what it is: Brain Failure.
One morning, Mom emerged from their Memory Care room covered with bruises. The police came. The state came. There was even suggestion of a rape kit because my mother, clearly agitated, could say only, “the man, the man.”
We will never know what happened. But it stands to reason that if you lock up the most advanced Alzheimer's residents with their attendant behavioral disorders, and apply nominal supervision, well, something is bound to happen. On the night in question, one newly hired caregiver attended 17 residents.
So we moved them again, this time to Seattle, close to my eldest brother and me, thereby violating the cardinal rule of Alzheimer's care: Thou shalt not move the patient. Change registers a full 10 on the Alzheimer's Richter scale. The more Mom's brain failed, the more I twirled to try to make things better.
Within a matter of weeks in the new place, they had fallen and broken their hip. Surgery followed, then three months in a rehab facility, and finally a move to a small adult family home with just six residents. They were exhausted and utterly disoriented. I was a wreck.
Still, I knew I was among the lucky ones. Despite the recent scan that showed their brain a mostly blank white slate, my mother somehow always managed to recognize me during our visits (although she'd begun calling me “Mom”).
Where once I'd thought I'd lose my mind if they asked me the same question one more time, now I prayed to hear any full sentence just one more time. Ever the peripatetic family caregiver, I rarely stopped to inhabit my mother's world: the one with no past, no future, just the present.
On our last Mother's Day together, I took them to the big morning Mass at St. James Cathedral. As I attempted a Houdini maneuver getting them out of the car, up the curb and down the sidewalk to the church door, they somehow slithered from my grasp.
My mother sank to the ground in what seemed like slow motion. They never made a sound. They just lay there in the green grass in their rose-colored tweed suit, brilliant white hair glinting in the spring sun, blue eyes open wide, staring straight up into an unusually cloudless Seattle sky.
With church bells pealing through the cool morning air, my beautiful, brilliant mother stretched out their arms and made angel wings in the grass.
And all the doctors and all the medications and all the years of worry that couldn't bring my mother back together again, also couldn't defeat the magic of that moment.
I lay down next to her, threaded my fingers through hers, and for a brief wondrous moment, we held the present.

Alberto Contador has been handed a one-year suspension from competition by the Spanish Cycling Federation (RFEC) for testing positive for clenbuterol during the 2010 Tour de France. They have also been stripped of their 2010 Tour de France win.
Spanish paper Marca reported on Wednesday evening that Contador was given the 12-month ban, and that they now have 10 working days to appeal against the decision.
A definitive verdict in their case is due by February 10, 2011.
Contador was provisionally suspended by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in August after tesing positive for banned drug clenbuterol during the second rest day of the 2010 Tour de France on July 21 in Pau.
A low amount of the drug was found in Contador's urine sample – 50 picograms or 0.000 000 000 05 grams per millilitre – but its use is banned at any level.
The Astana rider quickly blamed tainted meat as the source of the clenbuterol, claiming that a friend had imported a steak from Spain for them to eat. Unscrupulous farmers have in the past used clenbuterol to increase the quality of meat from their livestock, although its use in farming is banned in the European Union.

Print media isn't dead, it's just moved. It may surprise readers outside of South Asia to learn, but the largest circulation English-language paper is not from the UK or the U.S. Instead it is The Times of India.
It turns out that traditional paid-model newspaper subscription readership is alive and well in the sub-continent. Not only that – it is growing. “A recent study from the FICCI [Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry] suggested that the value of the Indian newspaper industry has grown by two-thirds in the past six years,” says consultancy, EY. “In 2005, the total industry was worth $2.64 billion (U.S. dollars). This rose to$4.37 billion in 2010.”
Currently more than 82,000 newspapers combine to give India a total circulation of 110 million daily copies. Consultancy, KPMG estimates that growth rates for regional Indian newspapers are expected to hover between 12 and 14% for the next several years. And the actual current value may be even higher, says EY, as actual readership is probably even higher due to copies being generally shared by several people.
Growth in the Indian newspaper industry is driven by the country's rapidly expanding middle class. Internet penetration remains poor – with 80% of the population thought to still be lacking basic access. Alternative methods for information dissemination, such as radio and TV, are growing but lack a number of the advantages newspapers bring.
Delivery costs less than the equivalent of $2 a month and can be tailored to match the many languages spoken throughout the country. Due to this local advertising spend is on the up. “Advertisers have discovered the vast diversity of vernacular print media and its ability to reach consumers in thriving medium-sized cities,” EY says.
Further advantages from newspapers include classified ads, which have largely traditional matchmakers in finding marriage partners for men and women. The perceived reputation of papers also helps. Newspapers are considered to be an important social tool that is helpful in educating children, EY adds.
Meanwhile books have moved to Mexico. In the nineties, literacy rates in the country shot up from around 10% to 90%. This, combined with significantly increased disposable income has led to serious growth in the sector. Firms involved in the business are now looking to expand internationally. Festivals such as the Guadalajara International Book Festival and a prominent role at the 2015 London Book Fair helped catapult the industry to new heights, according to EY.
However, distribution remains a problem. “In fact, the lack of options exists at every point of the supply-chain, not just the end point,” the consultancy adds. “The scarcity of specialized book distributors and wholesalers within Mexico cramp the flexibility of business between publishers and booksellers.”
Nonetheless opportunities remain for print across the world. Whether its current down-turn in the West lasts remains to be seen. For now startups interested in print media would do well to look elsewhere.
China's SAIC Motor has hired Sherlock Holmes to help solve a mystery: how to breathe life into its flagging sales.
China's largest automaker by sales has made British actor Benedict Cumberbatch the face of a campaign for its new sport-utility vehicle, the MG GS.
Mr. Cumberbatch was nominated for an Academy Award this year for their portrayal of 20th century mathematician Alan Turing in “The Imitation Game,” but they are best known for playing the fictional detective in the continuing BBC series “Sherlock.” That role has made them a heartthrob in China, where they are referred to as “Curly Holmes”—presumably for their curly locks.
Visitors arriving at this year's Shanghai auto show by subway are greeted by images of Mr. Cumberbatch on giant posters along the walls of passages leading from the station.
It's all part of a strategy aimed at emphasizing the British heritage of SAIC's MG brand. SAIC acquired MG in 2007, when it merged with Nanjing Automobile (Group), the Chinese company that had picked up the brand after the collapse of MG Rover Group Ltd. in 2005.
SAIC is also flooding the airwaves and online entertainment sites with its TV commercials that feature Mr. Cumberbatch following a series of clues that lead them to an orange-colored SUV, in which they zip around London and the countryside, seemingly in hot pursuit of a beautiful girl. The hunt even involves Mr. Cumberbatch a.k.a. Curly Holmes propelling the vehicle over the raised drawbridge at Tower Bridge.
The MG brand is coming relatively late to the booming SUV sector, where many Chinese brands are already making inroads.
Research firm LMC Automotive said in a recent report that in the first two months of this year, Chinese-brand SUVs had doubled their sales to around 460,000 vehicles compared with the year-earlier period. Seven of the Top 10 SUVs were Chinese brands, LMC noted.
An SAIC spokesperson said last week that the company had received 5,000 orders for its just-launched MG GS and was “quite confident” about the vehicle's sales prospects.
SAIC would consider it a success if it could maintain monthly sales at a similar level, suggesting annual sales of around 60,000 cars, they said.
SAIC also makes passenger cars in joint ventures with General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG.
Last year, sales of SAIC's own brands—Roewe and MG—were off 22% compared with a year earlier.
“The SUV market is growing very fast for domestic (Chinese) brands,” the spokesperson said. “We're hoping to catch that market.”

Nevada's recreational marijuana industry is expected to bring $1.1 billion in revenue and up to 40,000 jobs over the next eight years, per a 2016 study from Las Vegas-based RCG Economics. While regulations are still being hashed out by the Legislature and Department of Taxation, marijuana businesses foresee potential employees flocking.
What employers look for
Four local marijuana business owners were surveyed, saying that while the new recreational industry will bring more jobs, demand for those openings at dispensaries, production facilities and testing labs is extremely high.
• Loyalty: There may be a lot of applicants, but The+Source Dispensary owner Andrew Jolley said that many seekers of entry-level positions, such as budtenders and desk clerks, don't meet the most basic and important criterium: loyalty.
“Employees who have had long tenures at previous companies are always looked at favorably because it shows that they're loyal,” Jolley said. “Beyond that, we look for honest, hardworking, passionate people that have a passion for medical cannabis.”
David Goldwater of Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary, Frank Hawkins of Nevada Wellness Center and Armen Yemenidjian of Essence Cannabis Dispensary agreed with that.
• Can-do attitude: All four entrepreneurs said that while some of their employees were medical marijuana cardholders, no industry experience was necessary for entry-level positions.
“We hire people that have a big smile, that want to work and want to engage with the patient,” Hawkins said. “We know we can teach the book knowledge.”
• Customer service: Goldwater added that working with marijuana didn't require special skills. “Good customer service, written and communication skills or computer skills — all of those are as important in marijuana as any other field.”
• Specialization: Higher-level positions, such as lead grower in a cultivation facility, require farming experience, albeit not necessarily in marijuana. These dispensary owners say candidates that tout experience growing or selling weed on the black market could actually be harming themselves. That goes for any position across the legal business.
“Being around weed 'cause it's cool, doesn't make you employable,” Goldwater said.
Training
While many medical marijuana facilities in the valley provide internal training, Nevada Dispensary Association director Riana Durrett said most marijuana training programs are available online and are not exclusive to employers.
Durrett recommended that applicants complete an online training program before interviewing for jobs as a way to “stand out.” Some common training programs are:
• Nevada Dispensary Association: The 3-hour training program, unveiled in January and used by a growing number of dispensaries, focuses on current medical marijuana laws in the Silver State and best practices for working in dispensaries. ($125)
• Cannabis Training Institute: The dispensary technician program lasts 6-8 hours and advises dispensary employees on assisting medical patients and details the variety of medical cannabis products. ($299)
• Cannabis Training University: Based on California cannabis laws and regulations, CTU was used in many Nevada dispensaries until the Nevada Dispensary Association rolled out its own program. ($199)
*Hawkins and Yemenidjian are among those who also train employees in-house with their own programs. “It's like any other business — every dispensary has their own way of doing things,” Hawkins said.
Stigma
Goldwater says they warn interviewees of potential damage to their resumes if their careers eventually take them out of the industry. “For your next job, you're either going to have a hole on your resume for the time you worked here or you're going to have to state you were working in a marijuana shop. Good or bad, that's something you need to think about.”
On the flipside, Goldwater said people who worked in marijuana could find unique satisfaction in helping medical buyers treat illnesses through weed. And being “part of the marijuana movement” builds a strong sense of camaraderie.
How to apply
• Online: Employers list openings on general job sites and industry-specific ones, including weedhire.com, 420careers.com and marijuanajobscannabiscareers.com.
• Open houses and job fairs: Dispensary owners project that they might double their workforces to meet the demands of the recreational industry, so expect more fairs to happen at specific businesses and in settings where multiple companies can showcase their brands.
• Personal interaction: Jolley said they met one of their employees — a retired school teacher — while dining at a restaurant, and another — a former Lyft driver — while taking a ride in that person's car.
Taxes and employee benefits
While employees in Nevada's marijuana industry aren't subject to higher federal income taxes, businesses pay about 70 percent instead of the standard 30 percent.
The high tax rate is mandated by IRS Code 280e, which limits deductions from state-legal companies selling federally illegal drugs to just the cost of goods sold.
One Las Vegas business owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while their company would have been able to report a $50,000 loss as a regular business, it instead had to submit tax returns showing a $500,000 profit last year based on 280e regulations. Instead of carrying over a loss into 2017, their dispensary had to pay nearly $200,000 in income taxes last year.
Marijuana employers also have struggled to find competitive health insurance and benefits for their employees.
“Certain companies just don't want anything to do with marijuana, and that's unfortunate,” Jolley said.
“It's a real issue. Everyone in marijuana has run into that same problem,” Yemenidjian added, though they and the other owners are optimistic that insurers eventually will compete for their business. “There's only one direction to go when you have zero providers — you can't fall from the floor. As this industry develops, more insurance companies and other providers will get comfortable.”
Creative spinoffs
Don't want to work in a dispensary? Here are three examples of industry subfields:
• CannaYoga, 10161 W. Park Run Drive: Pairing marijuana with yoga provides “two of the world's greatest healing practices,” said CannaYoga co-owner Irena Jacobson. The business has operated out of Wishing Wellness Medical since September, and has since expanded to offer pop-up classes in local dispensaries. Among the most popular are CannaYin and CannaYinFlow, which allow smoking. Admission is $25, and weed is optional.
• Dixie Chocolates: Made in Silver State Wellness' central valley edible facility, weed-infused chocolates designed by Le Cordon Bleu-trained culinary artists allow users to get sugar and weed fixes with just one bite. The chocolates, which include flavors like “Crispy Kracken” and “Toasted Rooster,” are tempered in-house and distributed to more than 45 facilities across the Las Vegas Valley, Silver State Wellness representative Jacob Silverstein said.
• Cannabis Chapel, 827 Las Vegas Blvd. South: Located on the Strip, the pot-themed wedding hall, branded the “weed-ing chapel,” allows tourists and locals alike to tie the knot or renew vows. With reggae music and a minister ordained by the Higher Power Cannabis Church, the chapel encourages visitors to book their spots at least 24 hours in advance — longer if you're looking to wed at 4:20 p.m., the most requested time.

Schoolgirl's speech exposes Jehovah's Witnesses silence women to protect rapists (Screen capture)
Fed up with the insular religion's protection of abusers, former Jehovah's Witnesses have begun attending Kingdom Hall meetings to confront church members about the abuse they suffered — and the church's dismissal of it.
As reported by Hemant Mehta at The Friendly Atheist, multiple ex-Witnesses have taken a stand at Kingdom Halls (the religion's churches) to inform people in their former communities about the ways in which the church's powerful Watchtower Society silences people who've been abused and fails to punish their abusers.
As Mehta points out, there are many reasons why exposing abuse within Jehovah's Witness communities is difficult. For one, the church has a “two-Witness rule” that claims “church elders shouldn't take seriously a victim's account of abuse unless another person witnessed it… even though the only other person around may have been the abuser himself.”
Another conflating factor is the church's disfellowshipping policy, that instructs current Witnesses not to have any contact with ex-Witnesses, even if they're family. Members are also told ex-Witnesses purposefully bring about lawsuits to defame the church, and that other critics — like an Australian commission that found “adequately protected from the risk of sexual abuse” within the church — are also intent on smearing and damaging them.
That's part of why ex-Witness Youtuber Amy K. went to a Kingdom Hall in Wisconsin this past Sunday to inform the Witnesses there of the abuses the church allows continuing.
“The money that we donate to the organization is going to protect pedophiles,” they said when she'd been given the mic. Although it was soon taken away from her, they stood up and continued speaking for a few minutes until they were escorted out.
“This is important. Protect your children,” they urged the Witnesses in the crowd. “And please, stop shunning your families.”
Before being escorted away, they also told the crowd to Google the Australian Royal Commission's report as well as a judge's $4,000-a-day order for every day the Watchtower Society fails to provide documents on child molestation within their ranks.
The same day that Amy K. went to the Kingdom Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin, multiple ex-Witnesses instigated a “flash mob” at one in Mahwah, New Jersey to tell their stories.
“My ex-husband is a pedophile. They raped two children in the Kingdom Hall… You all can talk to my pedophile ex-husband, but you can't talk to me because I left [and was disfellowshipped],” one woman said. “He beat me for 11 years, [and] you asked what I did to antagonize him.”
“I lost my virginity to a rape and was disfellowshipped for it,” another said. “They told me it was my fault for going to a bar with a ‘worldly' boy.”
Yet another group went to the church's headquarters in Warwick, New York on Sunday to protest their abuse and demand answers — and as Mehta pointed out, they got nothing but sprinklers turned on them and a video denouncing them a few days later.

The congressional GOP's messaging on Obamacare repeal does not make sense. It's completely incoherent, self-defeating and ridiculous. I will allow House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the honor of explaining to everyone just how utterly disjointed and preposterous their party's position is on health care, since they have been the point person on this issue and is largely responsible for crafting the House GOP's message on Obamacare repeal.
Pop on over to Ryan's website and you'll see that they posted some excerpts from a recent talk-radio interview they gave where the Affordable Care Act came up. There are two quotes highlighted by Ryan's office that sum up their position on Obamacare. The first is “This [Obamacare] thing is collapsing under its own weight, and we have to step in and save people from this.” The second is “The rug's not going to be pulled out from under people [post-repeal] . . . There's going to clearly be a transition period.”

So on the one hand, Obamacare is failing and Republicans must act quickly to save people from it. On the other hand, they're going to prop it up for a while so nobody is hurt after they repeal it. Ryan and their colleagues say they are going to save America with their Obamacare repeal, while also simultaneously saving America from their Obamacare repeal.
This internally inconsistent gibberish is the foundation upon which the GOP's health care strategy rests. Republicans are politically obligated to repeal the ACA but have never come close to any agreement about what comes next. So they punt on that question and try to argue that passing a repeal bill will both rescue America and also maintain the status quo while they figure out something else out.
Obviously the problem here is that they can't have it both ways. Repealing Obamacare will have consequences, and the Congressional Budget Office issued a report onTuesday that laid out what those consequences will be. Per the budget office, pushing forward repeal legislation like the 2015 bill that passed via budget reconciliation by congressional Republicans (and then was vetoed by President Barack Obama) will wreak havoc both in the short and long term.
Starting in 2018, the number of uninsured people in the United States would jump by 20 million. Let's pause for a moment and repeat that: Twenty million people, a bit more than 6 percent of the population, would lose health insurance.
“Later, after the elimination of the ACA's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, that number would increase to 27 million, and then to 32 million in 2026,” the report noted. Insurance premiums will also spike as a consequence of repeal, increasing “20 percent to 25 percent — relative to projections under current law — in the first new plan year following enactment.” And premiums will only continue to rise as time passes, the Congressional Budget Office found.
The coverage losses will stem partly from people choosing to go without insurance but will also be driven by insurers' exodus from certain markets that will leave many Americans who want insurance without options. “Roughly 10 percent of the population would be living in an area that had no insurer participating in the nongroup market,” the budget office noted. Premiums will go up because healthy, younger people (no longer obligated to purchase insurance by the individual mandate) will opt to go without health insurance, leaving insurers with a customer base of sick, older people who are more expensive to cover.

Obviously, Republicans object to this finding. But in objecting, they've made clear just how hollow all their promises of “repeal and replace” or “repeal and delay” are. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., tweeted that the budget office screwed up since it didn't take into account the Republican replacement plan that doesn't exist.
Likewise, a spokesperson for Paul Ryan complained that the Congressional Budget Office failed to incorporate into its analysis what the incoming Trump administration has said about health care policy.
That's two members of the House GOP leadership chastising a Congressional Budget Office analysis for not giving enough weight to press releases, talking points and vague promises.
If there were an actual replacement plan that the budget office could have factored in, it might have produced different numbers. But Republicans have been resistant to producing such a plan precisely because the office would almost certainly find that it will cover fewer people than the Affordable Care Act.

Notably, the reaction by Republicans has not been to become serious about producing a coherent health care bill. Rather, they have sought only to bewilder, obfuscate and attack agencies like the Congressional Budget Office that produce these meddling estimates.
VICTORIANS with Alzheimer's disease are the first in the world to receive a new drug aiming to revolutionise treatment of the most common form of dementia.
Unlike other medications, the pill is the only drug designed to relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
One Australian is diagnosed every six minutes with Alzheimer's disease, with cases expected to balloon as the population ages.
Alfred Health was selected by the overseas drug company to lead the first trial of Anavex 2-73 on patients with the disease, giving Victorians exclusive access.
Trial leader, director of Aged Psychiatry at Caulfield Hospital, Associate Professor Steve Macfarlane said the global race to find better treatments meant the phase 2 trial would be fast-tracked and results would be known within a year.
If successful, a second trial would make the drug available to thousands of patients, and it could be on the market in three years.
“It's a great opportunity for Victorian patients, particularly given it's such a novel drug with the potential to modify the course of the disease and give symptomatic treatment,” Prof Macfarlane said.
So far, Alzheimer's disease drugs have only been able to improve symptoms, but have not stopped long-term deterioration in their health.
There are a number of disease-modifying drugs in development, but they only slow the course of the disease without improving symptoms.
Prof Macfarlane said Anavex 2-73 aims to do both by protecting the brain, helping nerve cells live longer and assisting with the removal of amyloid plaque, which builds up in the brains of those with the disease.
The drug works by stimulating the sigma receptor on the cell, which triggers the body to clear up excess proteins, such as amyloid plaque.
It hopes to boost memory by making available cognitive enhancers more powerful.
Anavex 2-73 has been trialled in the lab, on animals and on healthy volunteers, but this month it was administered to the first patient with the disease. Melbourne man Malcolm Baker, 73, is part of the trial, where every patient gets the active drug, and they hope it will improve their long-term outcome.
Alzheimer's Australia Victoria research fellow Dr Maree Farrow said while the trial was promising, it was small and would take several years to establish the drug's effectiveness or otherwise.
More than 30 patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease taking cognitive enhancer Aricept are needed for the trial.

AURORA | Students from Hinkley High School are set to leave the Houston area after spending the past week helping with the massive recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey devastated the area.
The group of 25 seniors and a few juniors have been in Dickinson, Texas, close to Houston, for the past week helping with everything from tearing out the water damaged insides of homes to putting up drywall. The group is set to head back on a chartered bus after finishing up work on Dec. 1
.
“I feel like we're making a huge impact here helping people with homes. The feedback has been very positive. They're grateful we're here,” said Oscar Sarabia, 18, a senior at Hinkley. “It's a whole lot to take in from this experience. We're helping people in need but the thing we all have to remember is there's always someone that needs help.”
Nayeli Martinez, 17, is a senior at Hinckley and has spent the past week in Dickinson working on several projects, including helping a local woman begin the process of rebuilding their home. Martinez said working with someone who has lost everything in the flood but was still so positive and grateful to Martinez for their help was a powerful experience they would be taking back with them to Aurora.
“She went through so much, and it really impacted me. It was really heartbreaking and they had such positive motivation to keep going,” Martinez said. “I'm going to take this experience and not keep it to myself. I want to talk to my community and encourage them to continue this. Everyone needs help. We're all in this country, and we're all in this together.”
The trip's genesis oddly enough started in a math class. Betty Lee, a math teacher at Hinkley who's also down in Texas for the trip, decided to do a lesson plan in their financial algebra class on the extent of the recovery efforts needed to rebuild the Houston area. The students saw just how much time and money would be needed to recover from the storm and that lit a fire in them to do something about it, Lee said.
“They were devastated and heartbroken. They wanted to help,” Lee said.
So the school began raising money for a relief trip. Lee said local businesses in Aurora helped donate money, tools and supplies. Lee also hit up the window installers at the house one day and that sales pitch resulted in a $14,000 donation from Renewal by Andersen window company which helped pay for half the cost of the charter bus.
While the students had seen pictures of the damage in the news, being face to face with just how much was destroyed was a shock to everyone in the trip, said Benjamin Aldana, 18, a senior.
“Honestly it was a lot scarier than I expected,” Aldana said. “On the Internet you only get a brief summary of what happened. but in person you see the totality of it. People have lost everything.”
On paper, the Arc sounds like a capable action camera in its own right. It shoots in 4K, takes 12-megapixel stills, includes g-force and accelerometer data in the video and can pair with GPS and heart-rate monitor devices. The camera is also waterproof to three meters, even without a case. The campaign also says the device will come with a smart video editing app that will create a highlight video based on data from its sensors (similar to how Antix or Blast Motion work). The real selling point, however, is the built-in gimbal.
This idea of putting physical stabilization inside the camera might seem novel now, but it's a sign of things to come. Back during CES I was shown an action camera concept from a different company that used this exact same idea, and the popularity of FeiYu Tech's hand-held gimbals proves regular consumers are willing to pay for a hardware solution (rather than fix it later with software). The problems with current action camera gimbals are that they usually add bulk and are one more thing to charge.
Squeezing the gimbal into the camera solves a few practical problems. It reduces cost (FeiYu Tech's products can cost upwards of $300 alone), and it makes the whole rig smaller. Now, you don't have to find space for a gimbal just to get smooth video. For example, with the stabilization inside the camera, you could attach it to any drone and be able to record smooth aerial video without needing to buy any other kit or worry about compatibility. Right now, you either have to spend out on a separate gimbal, buy a pricier quadcopter with a gimbal and camera built in, or accept that your footage won't have that silky smooth feel.
That said, there's a history of action cameras launching with "GoPro-beating" features that never seem to topple the category giant. Sony is probably the strongest rival, matching most of GoPro's features, while adding its proprietary SteadyShot stabilization. That one feature alone has earned it fans, but not the mindshare that GoPro enjoys. Yet stabilization could still turn out to be the trick that changes the market more than anything. Once you've seen the difference it makes, it's pretty hard to go back. And there's a whole other industry that already knows this: drones.
DJI may have made its name in the drone business, but it's diversifying into cameras. In particular, its Osmo borrows the same gimbal and imaging technology from its Inspire 1 quadcopter, and packages it into a slick hand-held rig. It's arguably a logical step that this method of smoothing out your video shrinks and finds its way directly inside the cameras. When I asked GoPro if such technology might be a feature we could expect to see in its cameras soon, it declined to comment -- but we do know it's already developed the core ideas, as they're a vital part of the Karma drone (as we can see in the video here).
For now, it's looking like the first action camera with a gimbal inside will come from newcomer Revl, but I wouldn't be surprised if such stabilization becomes the new "hot" feature. With 4K becoming standard, and no place else to go on the resolution front, the next best way to improve video is simply making it nicer to watch. In that regard, we can all appreciate a bit of stability.
The Washington Nationals emerged as surprise winners in the Gio Gonzalez sweepstakes, trading four prospects to the Oakland Athletics on Thursday in exchange for the talented left-handed starter.
Suddenly, the Nationals have assembled a pitching trio that will be under club control for several years and figures to put them in the thick of the National League East hunt during that period.
Gonzalez will join 2010 first overall pick Stephen Strasburg and another talented right-hander, Jordan Zimmermann, atop the rotation. Gonzalez earned their first All-Star honor on their way to a 16-12 season in which they struck out 197 in 202 innings.
The trade was first reported by ESPN's Keith Law.
The Nationals did pay a steep price in young, albeit largely unproven, talent. The Athletics will receive two pitchers, Brad Peacock and Tom Milone, who shot quickly through the Nationals system and made major league debuts with Washington late in the 2011 season. Milone posted a 3.81 ERA in five starts, while Peacock had a solid 12-inning audition coming off an outstanding minor league season spent mostly at Class AA Harrisburg (Pa.)
In addition, Oakland will get catching prospect Derek Norris and another pitcher, A.J. Cole, who hasn't pitched above low Class A. Cole, however, was ranked as high as No. 2 on various Nationals prospects lists entering this season and turns 20 next month.
Norris had an excellent 2009 campaign at low-A Hagerstown (Md.), but has been stalled by injuries and ineffectiveness each of the past two seasons. They could profile as a first baseman in Oakland if the A's hold onto incumbent catcher Kurt Suzuki for the long term.
The trade certainly speaks to the Nationals' drafting ability in recent years. Norris and Cole were fourth-round picks, while Milone was a 10th-rounder and Peacock a 41st-rounder.
Add this quartet to the stash of players the A's hope will be maturing around the time they hope to move into a new ballpark. That line of thinking prompted them to trade another young ace, Trevor Cahill, to the Arizona Diamondbacks earlier this month.
Gonzalez attracted significant attention on the trade market because they will be arbitration-eligible for just the first time this season, and can't become a free agent until after the 2015 season. The Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Detroit Tigers were among the clubs making inquiries on Gonzalez at various points this offseason.
If you think living in the present is tough, imagine spending your life in the future. That's what city planners do, and perhaps too well for their own good and ours. The point was made in dramatic fashion this week when the Urban Land Institute hosted a gathering of senior planners from the Greater Toronto Area. Meet the Chiefs, as the event was titled, attracted representation from Toronto, Mississauga, Uxbridge, Whitby, Vaughan and Burlington, to name a few.
Planners have allowed much of the GTA to become textbook suburban sprawl, Christopher Hume argues. ( Bernard Weil / Toronto Star ) A housing development at Ainsbury Avenue and Kerrison Drive in Ajax. Little of what planners have allowed in the GTA is anything to be proud of, writes Christopher Hume. ( LUCAS OLENIUK / TORONTO STAR )
The climax of the evening — we use the term loosely — came when 22 chiefs assembled on stage to speak their minds. The chat was all about densities, transit, growth, development, the usual pieties heard at such discussions. It all made perfect sense, except for the fact that the overwhelming majority of these “cities” are up to their neck in sprawl. For a few hours, however, the vast gap between what planners say and what they have done seemed to disappear. Still, one can't help wonder about a profession that requires practitioners to exist in such a profound state of disconnection. The future may be where we're all headed, but, of course, we never arrive. Perhaps planners are so fixated on what lies ahead that they forget everything else. After all, from a planner's perspective, present might as well be past. Both have already happened and, therefore, lie beyond their grasp. Planning is only meaningful before the fact.

To make matters worse, little of what planners have allowed is anything to be proud of. Thanks in part to their efforts, much of southern Ontario has been replaced by an endless loop of cul de sacs, subdivisions and super-centres. In light of the growing environmental crisis, there's less justification than ever for the suburban planning regimes that still hold sway across most of the GTA. Let's not forget, the onetime Queen of Sprawl herself, Mississauga's long-serving former mayor, Hazel McCallion, ended their term calling for smart growth. The hard truth is that planners have little to say and lack the powers to enforce their schemes anyway. Developers are in control, and only the province has the authority to demand better. Suburban builders argue they provide affordable housing. But as several studies have pointed out, if the cost of cars is included, the real price of suburban living isn't so cheap. Still, planners cling to their illusions. According to one senior practitioner, “Land is our most valuable asset.” And yet we squander land as if there were no ends of it. The “multiplication by subdivision” approach depends on an endless supply of fully serviced but cheap real estate. Many municipalities still see themselves as facilitators, handmaidens to the developers who give money to the planners' political masters when they face election.
It was instructive to hear a planner from Burlington complain about how that city doesn't have enough land left to do many of the things it has always wanted. This is hard to take seriously. Burlington densities are so low, it is made up largely of empty space. Jaime Lerner's name didn't come up Tuesday evening, but the former mayor of Curitiba, Brazil, and author of Urban Acupuncture might have been worth a mention. Lerner's reality-based book examines small “pin-prick” projects that deal with specific city issues, public realm and otherwise. They document pedestrian zones, benches, river cleanups and the like that have transformed cities.

But that requires a sense of experimentation and innovation generally lacking among GTA planners, regardless of where they work. In fact, a city's greatest asset isn't land, but learning how to use it intelligently. Christopher Hume can be reached at chume@thestar.ca
The British government is about to take some serious steps to make it a crime to take money under false pretenses – especially if that pretense has anything to do with calling back dead people from their graves. It's about time. We can only hope that the numskulls in our own government* will get a clue and follow suit.
According to UK sources at www.digitaljournal.com/article/254403
“If British legislators have their way, a series of new EU-inspired consumer protection regulations will be in place to safeguard against fraudulent activity in a widening range of commercial activity. Of course, the mediums and spiritualists are crying foul and feel this move will wreak havoc on their practices of communicating with the deceased and predicting the future.
Also according to this report, on April 18, about a dozen (only a dozen?) British mediums, psychics, healers and Tarot card readers congregated in Trafalgar Square before marching to the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing St. to submit a petition with up to 10,000 signatures requesting that the government maintain the law currently on the books and forget about the new measures altogether.
The most vocal opponents are in favour of retaining the 1951 Fraudulent Mediums Act whereby prosecutors had to prove that a medium or healer intended to commit fraud in order to secure a conviction.
The 1951 Act replaced the more archaic 1735 Witchcraft Act. The latter ended the practice of executing those who claimed to have supernatural powers. Although it shunned executions, it contained no presumption of innocence and automatically assumed mystics were frauds, to be punished with a prison sentence or a fine.
In turn, the 1951 Act carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison or a fine. The law, however, has been rarely enforced due to the reversed legal onus upon prosecutors to prove there was an intention to deliberately deceive a client. As a result, the UK's Guardian reports that there have been fewer than ten convictions over the past twenty years. The new regulations that are expected to be adopted will provide a range of criminal and civil penalties, including two year prison sentences for the most egregious cases.
The aspect most disconcerting to the spiritualist community is that, once again, there will be no need for prosecutors to prove an intention to commit fraud. “
Good I say! We should adopt the same strategies here in the U.S.A.
“The presumption of innocence will be retracted so that spiritualists and mediums must prove they did not mislead, coerce or take advantage of any ‘vulnerable' consumers.”
Now THAT'S a switch. Old UK frauds like Rosemary Altea will have to prove they didn't mislead their sitters.
The article goes on:
“The government appears unreceptive to the spritualists' protest due to the fact that the regulations are aimed at more than simply covering the realms of divination and mediumship. As reported in the Guardian: “If the Consumer Protection Regulations are approved by Parliament, as is likely…the regulations will come into force on 26 May. They will ban 31 types of unfair sales practice outright, including bogus closing-down sales, prize-draw scams and aggressive doorstep selling, and will for the first time establish a catch-all duty not to trade unfairly, closing loopholes that rogue traders have been able to exploit”.
“By lumping spiritualism in as a consumer service, mediums assert they are prone to a spike in lawsuits if customers are somehow dissatisfied with the information they receive. The solution, according to legal experts is to provide a disclaimer up front, making it clear that any communication with the other side is undertaken strictly for ‘entertainment purposes' or as a ‘scientific experiment'.
Oh no. Not that ugly little “for entertainment purposes” again! I confess I have used that one myself a few times. As much as it goes against my character as a “psychic enetertainer” to do it, I guess if I ever perform another seance in the UK, I will have to do a disclaimer.
And then there's that God dodge so popular with Sylvia Browne and other despicable scam artists who hide behind the Bible:
“Spiritualists claim that such measures discriminate against their practices which they believe are religious in nature. Carole McEntee-Taylor, a healer who recently co-founded the Spiritual Workers' Association said in an interview with The Guardian that having to stand up and describe the invoking of spirits as an ‘experiment' was forcing spiritualists to ‘lie and deny our beliefs'. They added: ‘No other religion has to do that. And how can you tell if someone is vulnerable? You would have to ask them if they felt vulnerable, or had mental health issues, or were of a nervous disposition.'
BTW: McEntee-Taylor's website warns:
“The changes in the legislation are a minefield… given Britain's litigation culture. We have to fight it. If not, we will go back to the Dark Ages, where we will be persecuted and prosecuted.”
I
In the present situation we find ourselves in (that I warmly refer to as The Golden Age of the Con), I'd say we are in a New Dark Age right now and a few persecutions and prosecutions may be in order. Please don't call me a Witch-finder General, but I smell smoke. McEntee also breaks my heart with this sentiment:
“This is unfair on genuine spiritualists. Some people are very nervous of entrapment.”
Genuine spiritualists? Other than the fact that you are genuinely conning people out of money and their natural right to grieve, grief vampires everywhere should be nervous. Very nervous. Some of the awakened sitters who have been scammed by you and your ilk will now be turning the seance tables on you. If you don't want to get entrapped in your own bullcrap, get on your brooms and fly away.
I'm confident that anybody without any hope who has had a Robbie Thomas, Kelli Faulkner or Chip Coffey show up at their front door when their child has gone missing felt mighty entrapped by their grief. Taking advantage of it is now going to be illegal – at least in England.
Spritiualism, however, does possess a distinct commercial side to it, so ultimately, the distinction between it existing as a commercial enterprise and a religion is blurred in the minds of many British citizens. If the Spiritualist Church in Britain, founded in the mid 1800s does indeed legally constitute a religious organization, they may have an opportunity to make a case for discrimination before the European Court of Human Rights.
The likelihood of increased civil litigation seems unlikely since plaintiffs will still be held to certain legal standards in bringing their cases forward. Simply claiming nothing more than the defendant misled them will not hold up in any respectable court of law in the country.
Skeptics still abound and they see nothing wrong with the change in law. The website Skeptical Monkey writes: “In order to differentiate themselves from the charlatans, all they have to do is prove their claims are true. Any person who claims to provide a service to the public should first be willing to prove that they can actually provide that service.” And as with any commercial transaction, there exists a buyer beware element. Though the new regulations seek to protect ‘vulnerable' individuals (which is difficult to define on its own), most reasonable people can judge for themselves whether the information they are receiving is authentic or not. And of course, if people feel they have been bilked, they can simply refuse to pay. Nothing and no one is preventing them from doing so in protest. “
So once again, the gauntlet has been thrown. Whether or not we can expect it to be picked up with actions and not just words remains to be seen. Whatever the outcome, this is a newsworthy step in the right direction. Gee, I wonder if ABC or any of their affiliates are covering this story? I can't wait to hear the first case and the creative excuses spiritualists will conjure up as they have for centuries. Hopefully now when they have to prove to the courts that they didn't mislead their sitters, they will have to prove they had psychic powers – or go to jail.
In another article at: www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/06/ :
Emma-Louise Rhodes, a researcher for BadPsychics, which seeks to expose malpractice, said: ‘Hopefully, the new regulations will bring to justice those who have cruelly sought to exploit the bereaved for personal financial gain.'
A legal specialist said: ‘Now there is no difference between a psychic and a double-glazing salesperson in law.'
Good.
A bit closer to home, please read at <http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/iteam&id=7493311> &id=7493311 how San Jose, CA law enforcement caught up with a psychic and how fraud was proved in a case that will hopefully send a message to a few more charlatans here in the U.S.A..
It seems that getting people to not feel foolish about being ripped off and being willing to step up and face the music when it comes to phony psychics and mediums is key to getting convictions. Stories like the two mentioned here are good examples of how the word is getting out that fighting this social menace is the right thing to do.We are making a difference.
And please, before the armchair skeptics who do nothing but find ways to criticize my approach jump all over me for suggesting a “witch-hunt,” there's no need to be too worried about any little old ladies getting badly burned – except legally. It's a different world now and real people are getting hurt in very real ways by the self-styled witches we have to deal with today. There's no hysteria, just common sense. There's no religious agenda, just science. For illumination on the past we have books like Reginald Scot's “Discoverie of Witchcraft” that clearly showed the sordid world of tricksters and cunning that went on without any supernatural help way back in 1570. In the present, we can refer to thousands of other skeptical books that are there to guide us. As for the future; we can all be glad that there are decent people working hard to make it clear that all anyone who claims they can talk to dead people has to do is to get them to talk back – in court.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, Glenn, I want to turn to something NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden said to you nearly three years ago, when they first spoke out against NSA abuses.
EDWARD SNOWDEN: Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything. But I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal judge, to even the president, if I had a personal email.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Glenn, can you talk about that and the response that was received to the leaks of Edward Snowden compared to now, the leaks of intelligence officials now?
GLENN GREENWALD: So, on the question of the eavesdropping powers of the NSA as revealed by the intercepts of General Flynn's communications, we don't actually know for certain what the methodology was that was used to eavesdrop on him. Was the NSA legally, pursuant to a FISA warrant, targeting General Flynn as part of an investigation, either an intelligence investigation or a law enforcement investigation, conducted by the FBI? Were they, as they claim, only doing routine surveillance on officials of an adversary country—in this case, Russia—and just coincidentally and by accident happened to catch the conversation that General Flynn was having with those targets of the surveillance in Moscow? We don't know.
But what this does illustrate is—let's assume for the moment that the NSA and the CIA for once are actually telling the truth and that the way that they eavesdropped on General Flynn was not by targeting him, but by targeting the Russians with whom they were communicating. What this reveals are something very important, which is, when the Edward Snowden story first broke and the debate around the world was triggered, the U.S. government kept saying over and over, “If you're an American citizen, we can't listen in on your calls unless we first get a warrant from the court, and therefore there's nothing you have to worry about.” Now, that was a very warped sort of thing to say, because that meant that for 95 percent of the world who are called non-Americans, what the government was saying: “Oh, for you, you have no protections. We can listen in on your calls at any time without getting a judge to approve,” which is actually true. And that's one of the reasons why people all over the world outside of the United States were so horrified to learn of what the NSA was doing. But the broader and more important point is that what the U.S. government was saying was actually completely false. The U.S. government constantly eavesdrops on the telephone calls of American citizens without getting a warrant of any kind, despite what the Constitution requires. And that's because the law that was enacted in 2008, called the FISA Amendments Act, with President Obama's approval, with—he was a senator at the time, they voted for it—actually authorizes the U.S. government to listen in on Americans' calls with no warrant, as long as they're talking to someone outside of the United States who the government says they're targeting. And that's what this episode shows, is they were able to listen in on General Flynn's calls, if you believe them, with no warrant, because they say that they were targeting someone with whom they were communicating.
As far as the reaction is concerned in terms of how Edward Snowden's leaks were received versus this leak, it's like night and day. I have not yet heard, literally, not one Democrat condemn the leakers inside the CIA or the intelligence community who leaked signals intelligence and, in the process, alerted these Russian officials to the fact that their communications have been compromised. That's what these leaks did. They told these Russian officials with whom General Flynn was communicating, “We have successfully penetrated your communications systems.” And you can be sure that they are now, in response, fortifying the communications that they use and blocking out the NSA and CIA. There was probably harm done by whoever did this leak. I haven't heard one Democrat condemn it on the grounds that it's criminal. I haven't heard one Democrat say that there should be an investigation to find these leakers and put them in prison for violating the law. And yet, all I heard from Democrats—not all I heard, because there were a lot of Democrats who supported Manning and Snowden and Drake—but certainly Democratic officials in D.C. were almost unanimous, under Obama, in saying that leaks—leakers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, that they're traitors. Chelsea Manning just spent seven years in prison under harsh conditions for leaking information way less sensitive than what these leakers about General Flynn just leaked. And, yes, President Obama commuted their sentence, but only after their administration imprisoned her, under conditions that the U.N. said was basically torture, and kept them in prison for seven years, even though there was no harm demonstrated from anything they leaked. So what Democrats seem to think is, leaks under President Obama, even if they show that high-level officials are lying, as Edward Snowden showed James Clapper was, are evil, are criminal, and the whistleblowers should be thrown in jail; leaks under President Trump, by contrast, are heroic and noble, and we should celebrate the people who are doing it and oppose any effort to hunt them down and investigate them and find them and punish them, as President Trump is vowing to do. The reality is that whistleblowers are a very valuable part of our democracy. They should be cherished and heralded and protected, regardless of which party controls the White House.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Glenn, what about the Republican response? You've talked about the Democrat—Democratic Party response, but how did the Republican Party, for the most part, respond to the Snowden leaks versus what's happened now?
GLENN GREENWALD: Well, ironically, the Republican response is actually consistent—consistently heinous, but at least it's consistent. There were a few Republicans, usually former officeholders or some outliers in the Republican Party, like Rand Paul or Justin Amash, people from the libertarian wing, who were somewhat supportive of the Snowden leaks. But, overall, the Republican establishment was contemptuous of Edward Snowden. In fact, Mike Pompeo, the former Republican member of congress who is now Donald Trump's chief at the CIA, called for Edward Snowden's execution. Donald Trump themselves called for Edward Snowden's execution. Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Marco Rubio all called Edward Snowden a traitor. So, in some sense, the Republicans are being consistent, because they're now saying the same thing, which is that whoever leaked this information ought to be investigated, hunted down and punished to the fullest extent of the law, which is more or less the same thing they said about leakers and whistleblowers under President Obama. It's the Democrats who have completely switched their position, as they so often do, the minute that the party controlling the White House changed.
AMY GOODMAN: We're going to break and then come back to this discussion, also talk about what happened at the White House yesterday with the Netanyahu-Trump meeting and so much more. We're speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the founding editors of The Intercept. Their piece in The Intercept, “The Leakers Who Exposed Gen. Flynn's Lie Committed Serious—and Wholly Justified—Felonies.” Stay with us.
Book Description
A Silicon Valley View Of The World
How Many Jobs At Risk?
Business Shifts Or Technology Shifts?
The rise of algorithmic trading (page 113) is just a replacement of market-making operations by brokers by hedge funds. Since their role is to skim profits from the trading of traditional investors, they cannot grow indefinitely at the expense of those other funds. Since market making was not a mass employer to begin with, the net effect on employment was probably negligible. Elsewhere in investment finance, whatever gains improved back office software provided were offset by the increased need to analyse complex new financial products, leading to limited attrition of employment.
There are a number of "sharing economy" companies that are superficially technology companies. However, the secret sauce behind their business plans tend to revolve around regulatory arbitrage (to be polite). For example, some of the "taskification" (as described in this op-ed by Mary L. Gray) of work relies upon contractors not being classified as workers.
The rise of internet based booksellers (one of which I have an affiliate relationship with) is not the sole reason of the demise of mom-and-pop bookstores; most of those stores were run out of business by the early 1990s by chain bookstores using pre-World Wide Web technology.

Concluding Remarks
The Padres are exploring a potential reunion with one of the iconic arms in franchise history.
Sources said the club has had discussions with Jake Peavy, the free-agent right-hander who began their career in San Diego and won the 2007 National League Cy Young Award here.
Peavy, 35, is coming off a down season — after the San Francisco Giants demoted them to the bullpen in August, they finished with a career-high 5.54 ERA over 31 games (21 starts) — and could be a fit on a one-year deal.
Padres General Manager A.J. Preller, following their policy on potential targets, declined to comment on any pursuit of Peavy.
Peripheral numbers suggest that the three-time All-Star can still be effective as a starter, which happens to be the Padres' top need this offseason. Peavy, who posted a 4.36 Fielding Independent Pitching, was the victim of some bad luck in 2016. And though their average fastball velocity dipped below 90 mph, they had one of the higher spin rates in the league.
Peavy is a year removed from going 8-6 with a 3.58 ERA, albeit in only 19 starts.
The former 15th-round draft pick made their debut in 2002 and went 92-68 with a 3.29 ERA over parts of eight seasons in San Diego. They twice finished with the lowest ERA among major league starters, including in 2007, when they earned the Padres' fourth and last Cy Young Award.
In 2009, Peavy exercised a clause in their contract to block a trade to the Chicago White Sox, announcing that San Diego was “the best place for me and my family.” They later agreed to be dealt, just before that year's trade deadline. The return from the White Sox included left-hander Clayton Richard, who would become a rotation fixture and Tuesday re-signed with the Padres on a one-year deal. (Another veteran right-hander, Jhoulys Chacin, also signed a one-year deal.)
Peavy did not experience their previous level of success in Chicago, though they did produce their third All-Star season in 2012. They were traded to Boston in 2013, then to San Francisco in 2014, winning World Series titles in consecutive years.
Over their 15-year career, Peavy is 152-126 with a 3.63 ERA. They made $15 million last season, and while they stand to earn significantly less in 2017, San Diego historically has been a place where pitchers go to rebuild their value. In 92 career starts at Petco Park, Peavy is 38-28 with a 2.75 ERA.
The plight of Kiltimagh, Co Mayo, as depicted in Rosita Boland's recent article “Half-dead – A town in rural Ireland” could be told of countless others that have seen their populations fall and their vitality erode in the half-century since The Irish Times's John Healy first highlighted the decline of rural life in No One Shouted Stop -The Death of an Irish Town in relation to their home place of Charlestown, also in Co Mayo.
The reasons for the decline are complex, but one fact stands out: Ireland's towns and villages are no longer vibrant urban entities. In recent decades schools, shopping, commerce and even civic functions have moved to out-of-town locations, and the bulk of residential construction has been in suburban estates and one-off houses in the countryside.
At least since the publication of the National Spatial Strategy in 2002, planning policy has promoted objectives to consolidate and regenerate cities, towns and villages; keeping them physically compact, and the focus of the social, commercial and civic life of their communities.
However, last week's report from the National Statistics Office that almost 30 per cent of the past year's planning permissions have been for one-off houses points to an acute failure of this policy. Unchecked, the recovering economy and demand for new housing will repeat the mistakes of the past – littering the country with low-density sprawling development.
One ray of hope stands out in the CSO figures. The number of apartment applications has quadrupled, perhaps indicating that the demographic revolution Ireland is undergoing – smaller households, changing lifestyles and greater cultural diversity – might be reflected in a swing in popular taste to “European” urban models. How might this come to pass?
First, the concept that “towns are good for us” needs to be embedded in the popular consciousness: Westport, Co Mayo, for instance, is an example of a place responding to the challenges with a vision shared by all stakeholders. At this year's MacGill Summer School Westport's town architect, Simon Wall, said its successes were founded on the adoption of an Integrated Action Plan in 2000.
Generated by the town council, in tandem with business and community interests, the plan, Wall said, has provided a framework to ensure that the town's heritage was protected while new development expanded its retail, industrial and residential base during the Celtic Tiger years.
Public realm
Towns that have invested in improving their urban environments – Kilkenny, Abbeyleix, Clonakilty and Killorglin, to name a few – have done so out of a conviction that a high-quality public realm is central to attracting investment, employment and tourism to their locations.
Retail development is equally critical to the vitality of towns and villages, not least in promoting the multi-purpose shopping, business and leisure trips that add to the vitality of local economies.
My experience in drafting the design manual that accompanied the 2012 Retail Planning Guidelines suggests that restricting the power of retail multiples to impose their “big box” designs on edge-of-centre sites is one of the greatest challenges we face in halting the decline of rural towns.
Any town without a residential community is doomed. If rural towns and villages are to be attractive places to live, they must provide the type of housing that today's couples, families and empty-nesters aspire to. Despite guidelines to the contrary, there has been virtually no housing construction in core urban areas in the last decades – save for social housing. While people cannot be coerced into living in towns, they might opt for the convenience of urban living if town and village housing was seen as an attractive choice and if they were given an alternative to the suburban models promoted by the construction sector.
Government guidelines have recommended that planning authorities include policies to promote quality design in their development and local area plans. The objective is quite clear: the delivery of high-quality environments requires a commitment that is shared by planning authorities and developers, and the appointment of skilled design teams.
Incentives
One of the oft-repeated quotations from the 2004 National Economic and Social Council report, Housing in Ireland, Performance and Policy, is that the challenge of building high-quality, sustainable cities and towns compares to the greatest challenges that Ireland has faced – and met – in the past. The country's projected population growth indicates that is still one of the greatest challenges that we face.
The question is whether the 200,000 homes required between now and 2050 will be in the countryside, in suburban estates and rural areas, remote from schools, shops and workplaces?
Or can we exploit the opportunities provided by our recovering economy to secure regeneration of the nation's towns and villages as attractive and desirable places to live and work.
If we get it wrong, we will be living with the consequences for decades and beyond. And the costs will be significant – economically, socially and environmentally.

Aside from a love of fancy notebooks, I don't really have much of an attachment to the artifacts of the pre-Internet era of instant communication. That said, the letterheads of the past are a thousand times better than today's neon pink, Comic Sans email signatures.
That's why I often find myself browsing through Letterheady , a site devoted to displaying the beautifully designed stationery of the past . The site's creator, Shaun Usher, has gathered up letterheads from Nikola Tesla to Muhammad Ali , and along the way, he's collected several amazing and interesting pieces related to comics, too! Check out 24 of my favorites, featuring companies, creators and even one notable advertiser after the jump!Usher's collection of letterheads used by Marvel Comics over the years is worth checking out all by itself, if only for the way that it charts the history of design at the company. First up, a simple logo from the early days, featuring the Thing and crediting Stan Lee as "Editorial & Art Director":
As Marvel's stable of characters increased, their letterhead got an overhaul to match, from 1964:
In 1976, things were simplified down for the UK version, which also shows Stan Lee's takeover as publisher from Martin Goodman:
During the Jim Shooter era circa 1982, when Marvel was owned by Cadence Publishing, Spider-Man was featured in a nifty right-hand sidebar design:
And finally, one of a more recent vintage, from 2007, with Spidey joined by their fellow movie stars:
Legendary Peanuts creator Charles Schulz also had a series of beautiful letterheads over the years. 1957's was a strip in its own right:
1966:
And 1997:
The 2007 letterhead for DC Comics looks a little plain...
But the reverse features a nice tower of their super-heroes. It's worth noting, however, that unless this image has been flipped, that's definitely Bizarro there on the bottom:
From EC Comics in 1950, featuring the art of Jack Davis:
But by 1955, EC had given way to MAD Magazine , the year it was rebooted from a comic to its more familiar magazine format:
And circa 1980, complete with an Alfred E. Neuman watermark:
Along the same lines, the letterhead for Trump , the magazine Harvey Kurtzman founded after leaving MAD in 1956:
Batman co-creator Bob Kane 's letterhead design is so awesome that I'm almost certain it was Bill Finger's idea:
The Man of Steel appears on stationery for Macy's Superman Adventure from 1939:
And for Superman, Inc. (hopefully the subject of a future Grant Morrison story) in 1940:
From Fawcett's Captain Marvel Club , 1942:
In 1945, the young fans of All Star Comics could look forward to a letter from The Junior Justice Society :
The same image also appears on the letterhead for Wonder Woman Enterprises :
Harvey Comics , the publishers of Richie Rich and Casper , circa 1956. Richie, of course, just sent letters written on sheets of taped-together hundos, because they have no concept of what money means to their lessers:
Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's Mirage Studios from 1985, the debut year of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
Trina Robbins uses a clever comic-style sidebar for hers...
Calvin & Hobbes creator Bill Watterson :
And finally, while not actually a comic book creator himself, the "Hero of the Beach" Charles Atlas should be a familiar site for anyone reading comics in the Silver Age:

Meet Pastor Charles Worley, of Providence Road Baptist Church ("The Home of old time Religion") in Maiden, N.C. In this video excerpt from one of their recent Sunday morning sermons, Pastor Worley offers their thoughtful suggestion for resolving THE debate over gay rights.
The good pastor's idea for "gettin' rid of all the lesbians and queers" is to build "a great big large fence" around all the gay people, electrify it, and then allow the people penned in by the fence to die.
Pffft. And people thought the gay issue would be difficult to solve.
Of course, Pastor Worley, being a man of the cloth, is hardly inured from compassion. They make this very clear with their suggestion that we "fly over and drop some food" to the masses of imprisoned gay people. So it's not like they want them to just starve to death. That would be cruel. This is, after all, a Christian leader bound by the love of Jesus, not a morally repugnant, astoundingly ignorant, semi-literate, hate-filled meathead who wouldn't know Jesus Christ from Cujo.
Pastor Worley just wants all gay people to live behind an electric fence until they grow old and die. And who doesn't want to be fed for free until they die of old age? It's like social security -- but with electricity. And less travel. And food falling on your head.
Pastor Worley also wants to separate all the gay men from all the gay women: They want to keep two separate electrified pens. Because (one assumes) otherwise some of the gay men might sleep with some of the gay women. And we all know what that would mean: gay babies. And then where would it all end? We only have so much money to spend on fences, airplane fuel and food that bounces. So, in this one instance, separate but equal would have to work.
If you have any thoughts or suggestions about their extremely novel social experiment, please do not hesitate to share them with Pastor Worley, at pastor@prbcnc.com. I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from each and every one of you.
Cockos have been leading up to some exciting new features, including ARA support which is now announced as an upcoming implementation. This has caused waves on Reaper and Cakewalk forums (Cakewalk recently has been discontinued and many users are switching over to Reaper for it's similarities, cost effectiveness, and now ARA implementation). This might seem like a small implementation to some, and others might not even know what ARA is, but it is a long sought after feature that users have been requesting for years.
ARA, or Audio Random Access, is a feature that was created for Melodyne users to integrate Melodyne with Presonus's Studio One. Melodyne is a plugin which is similar to Autotune, it allows the producer to control and lock the pitch of a track as well as edit timings and have complete control. It is a high-end plugin that has been used on countless tracks due to its power and ability to perfect a bad take.
ARA allows Melodyne to work more efficiently for the user. It is the exchange of tempo, pitch, rhythm, and full audio files between the DAW and the plugin. Previously, Melodyne would load up, and the producer would have to play the track through it in real time, so that it could record the audio and make edits. This could be comparable to recording into a different DAW then exporting back in. What ARA brings is the ability to send the audio into it instantly, allowing it to load the entire track, without having to record it in.
Credit: www.gearnews.com
As seen in the gif above, ARA allows edits on Reaper's media items, which are immediately reflected in Melodyne. This massively speeds up the workflow for the user, saving them making necessary edits the re-recording it into Melodyne to reflect the changes.
While ARA isn't widely implemented beyond use in Melodyne, it is available to other plugins, and the widespread adoptance of it in DAWs means that more plugin developers are likely to take it on board. Currently, according to Celemony , “ARA is currently supported by Presonus Studio One, Cakewalk Sonar, Magix Samplitude Pro, Acoustica Mixcraft and Tracktion Waveform”.
No fixed date has been given, but we can surely expect this in one of Reaper's many regular updates in the near future!

Withholding evidence. Government business carried out in secret. Potential criminal investigations.
I'm not talking about the allegations surrounding former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who resigned on Friday. In Florida, a similar cloud has formed around Gov. Rick Scott, who faces three separate lawsuits alleging violations of a number of state laws.
Advertisement:
In any normal political environment, the charges would lead to calls for resignation or impeachment proceedings. But Scott appears insulated by the very expectation of their corruption. In idealistic Oregon, Democrats controlled every level of government, and forced out a member of their own party. In Florida, the governor is supposed to be a scoundrel. But even if Scott survives, Republicans seeking the White House in 2016 might have a problem associating themselves with the leader of the biggest swing state, especially if more of their Nixonian tactics are revealed.
“This governor has completely evaded all public records on everything,” said Matt Weidner, a St. Petersburg attorney who filed one of the three lawsuits against Scott. Their complaint involves the sudden firing of Gerald Bailey, former executive director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and a respected public official.
Scott initially argued that Bailey simply resigned. But Bailey has since spoken publicly, accusing the governor of lying about their ouster (an email from Scott's general counsel demanded that Bailey “retire or resign”) and attempting to politicize the independent FDLE. According to Bailey, Scott's office pressured them to hire political cronies and forced FLDE officers to chauffeur Scott campaign staffers.
This came to a head when Adam Hollingsworth, then Scott's chief of staff, asked Bailey to name Orange County clerk of courts Colleen Reilly in a criminal investigation. “Somebody drafted an order from a judge saying ‘Go release these criminals from prison' and submitted that to the court, and the Department of Corrections let these guys out,” Weidner told Salon, describing a prison break based on forged documents. “Rather than hold the Department of Corrections accountable, which is in the executive branch, the governor directed Bailey to target this clerk. And Bailey said I'm not going to target her, they haven't done anything wrong. And the governor says you're gone.”
Where this turned potentially illegal is in possible violations of Florida's Government in the Sunshine Law, actually a robust series of transparency statutes around public meetings and records. Under that law, conversations between the governor and other statewide elected officials in their cabinet about staffing decisions must be open to the public and recorded with minutes. But through conduits, Scott and the cabinet secretly discussed firing Bailey, and hiring their replacement Rick Swearingen, sidestepping the Sunshine law. Cabinet members say they were told Bailey voluntarily resigned; Swearingen didn't know about the firing either.
Swearingen was hired in a largely ceremonial public cabinet meeting on Jan. 13. In video of the cabinet meeting, which features state Attorney General Pam Bondi parading around a dog for adoption and a series of photo opportunities, Gov. Scott abruptly launches into legal boilerplate about appointing Swearingen. Their nomination approval takes just a few minutes, without any debate. “Why don't we take a picture,” Scott says at the end.

“The suit is enforcing the public's right to know,” said Weidner, who also requested that the state attorney in Tallahassee open a criminal investigation into the Bailey firing. “Reporters are making records requests and saying where is the back and forth? It doesn't exist. The government is being operated in total secrecy.”
Every major newspaper in the state has joined the Weidner lawsuit, though the cabinet has generally shrunk from the controversy. Scott apologized for Bailey's firing in a cabinet meeting last week, maintaining that they did nothing wrong.
But with questions about Bailey swirling, the continuity between this lawsuit and others against Scott add to the pressure. Two years ago, Scott sued Tallahassee attorney Steven Andrews over a land dispute involving a proposed expansion of the governor's mansion. Andrews used the case to ask for all public records around the issue, and in turn, discovered that the governor and top staffers operate a series of secret email accounts.
Scott at first denied the existence of the emails, but then released documents showing Scott's personal Gmail account being used to discuss vetoes and the state budget. Staffers solicited fundraising through the private accounts, using personal cellphones and having checks sent to their homes rather than the office. The final email releases came after their hotly contested reelection campaign; Scott's lawyers successfully delayed court orders to turn over the emails until after Election Day.

This is critical because public officials in Florida must release any emails related to state business upon request (former Gov. Jeb Bush released them preemptively last week). Failure to turn over those emails when asked for violates the law. Andrews got a judge to allow them to amend their complaint to say that the governor knowingly violated public records requests, an impeachable offense in Florida. The administration continues to fight to get the suit tossed.
A third lawsuit comes from George Sheldon, who lost as the Democratic candidate for attorney general in 2014. They accuse Scott of violating state ethics laws by inaccurately reporting their personal wealth on financial disclosures. The lawsuit alleges that Scott's disclosures to Florida vary widely with their disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the SEC documents reflect a net worth of at least $340 million, Scott's Florida financial disclosure from last June lists it at $132.7 million. And Scott's net worth “bounces wildly without explanation,” Sheldon claims in the suit, with selective disclosure from year to year.
Sheldon believes that Scott has maneuvered money through a network of trust accounts to hide it from public scrutiny. Scott has refused to deliver information on the trusts, calling the lawsuit a “frivolous partisan attack” and claiming that the discrepancies with the SEC documents have to do with Scott's wife Ann's money. Scott's lawyers want to move the case out of court and into the state ethics commission, currently chaired by a Republican appointed by the governor.

Scott came to office with a reputation for chicanery. As CEO of Columbia/HCA, they presided over the largest Medicare fraud in history. Their job approval rating is just 42 percent, months after their reelection. But there's a sense that Scott gets graded on a curve, that corruption that would be shocking elsewhere is seen in Florida as normal.
“People who should know better have become conditioned to believe that that's the way it is,” said attorney Matt Weidner. “You're sitting there going this is wrong and somebody needs to do something, but will anybody stand up?”
Because of this bias, the spate of allegations may just sit there. But national Republicans need to win Florida in the 2016 election, and they may not want to get wrapped into the seedy political culture in a GOP-dominated state. They may pressure the party to abandon Scott; you can already see Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a former member of GOP congressional leadership, distancing themselves and questioning Scott's truthfulness.

As the three cases wind through the courts, advocates believe Scott could find themselves trapped, as ugly details of how they run the nation's third-largest state spill out. “Will this be the ultimate of holding people accountable,” asked Matt Weidner. “In a proper world it would.”
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A fake architect named Newman has been sentenced to 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison for posing as an architect in eastern New York.
Paul J. Newman also was ordered Tuesday in Saratoga County Court to pay more than $115,000 to their victims in Albany, Rensselaer, and Saratoga counties.
Newman pleaded guilty in June to grand larceny and fraud after an investigation by New York's attorney general dubbed "Operation Vandelay Industries." Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office said Newman had rendered fraudulent architectural services since 2010. Victims included municipalities and businesses.
Schneiderman dubbed the operation to nab Newman "Vandelay Industries" in reference to a long-running joke on "Seinfeld" about a fictional company by that name. A character named Newman was Jerry's nemesis on the sitcom.
Maro Itoje is in grave danger of missing England's autumn Tests, as Saracens are set to confirm that their lock prodigy broke a hand in the victory over the Scarlets on Saturday.
The 21-year-old European Player of the Year was led off early in the second half of the Champions Cup encounter at Allianz Park, having been in evident pain when the injury was assessed on the field.
They were sent for a scan after the game and Sportsmail understands that it revealed a fracture - although the exact severity is unclear.
Maro Itoje could miss England's autumn Tests after suffering a suspected fractured hand
MARO ITOJE Born: October 29. 1994 (Camden, London) Clubs: Saracens Appearances: 57 Caps: 7
This is a huge setback for Eddie Jones, the England coach, whose plans for the series at Twickenham next month are being undermined by a growing casualty list.
Jones was already coming to terms with the enforced absence of James Haskell, George Kruis, Anthony Watson, Jack Nowell, Manu Tuilagi, Sam Jones and Mike Williams for part or all of the campaign against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia.
The 21-year-old was substituted during Saracens' 44-26 victory over Scarlets on Saturday
The likely loss of Itoje would be a major blow, given their emergence as a world-class forward. They were being considered to fill in at openside, but the loss of Kruis, their second row partner for club and country, has complicated the equation.
If Itoje is ruled out, Jones would surely resurrect the lock alliance of Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury, while Bath pair Dave Attwood and Charlie Ewels could claim squad places.
With a dwindling list of No 7 candidates to choose from, Teimana Harrison may be the leading option again.
The likely loss of Itoje would be a major blow, given their emergence as a world-class forward
The New Zealand-born flanker started on Saturday as Northampton were thrashed 41-7 by Castres in France - a result which brought an angry response from their club captain, Tom Wood.
'We were never in it,' they said. 'The desperation that we brought last week we didn't have this week. I'm ashamed to admit that.
'We need to do a bit of soul-searching this week and make sure we find the answers.'
Northampton's mis-match also caused an injury scare for Wales head coach Rob Howley, as George North suffered a hand injury in the second half.
ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran harshly reacted to President Donald Trump's decision not to certify its nuclear deal with six major powers, and President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran might walk away if the continuing agreement does not serve the country's national interests.

Defying Trump, Rouhani said Tehran will double its efforts to expand the country's defense capabilities, including the country's ballistic missile program despite the U.S. pressure to suspend it.
Trump said in an address at the White House that they would not continue to certify the multinational agreement and warned they might ultimately terminate it.
“No president can revoke an international deal ... Iran will continue to respect it as long as it serves our interests,” Rouhani said in a live television address, adding that Trump's speech was full of “insults and fake accusations” against Iranians.
While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, they gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.
That increases tension with Iran as well as putting Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord such as Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union, who say the U.S. cannot unilaterally cancel the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers .
“The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure... Iran's deal cannot be renegotiated,” Rouhani said.
Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which they detailed a more confrontational approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.
Pragmatist Rouhani backed Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), saying the IRGC will continue its fight against “regional terrorists.
“The IRGC has always protected our nation against terrorists ... It will continue to help oppressed nations in the region,” Rouhani said.
Iran accuses its regional rival Saudi Arabia of fuelling regional tension and the Sunni Muslim kingdom is at odds with Tehran's revolutionary Shi'ite leaders in struggles across the Arab world, including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon.
The IRGC is Iran's most powerful security entity and wields control over large swathes of Iran's economy as well as considerable influence within its political system.
Adding skills and achievements to your online identity
When Mozilla's Open Badges project began in late 2010, it was little more than a demo and an audaciously big idea: what if we could use the web to create whole new ways to “show what you know?”
Today, that big idea is becoming reality, with impressive partners and new Mozilla Open Badges Beta software coming together to test how digital badges can supercharge learning and identity.
Collaborators building badges on Mozilla software
Mozilla's Open Badges project now includes leading partners like the MacArthur Foundation, impressive collaborators (including NASA, Intel, Disney-Pixar, 4H and dozens of others now building badge programs using Mozilla tools) and — thanks to today's new Beta release of Mozilla's Open Badges Infrastructure — publicly available software for badge issuers and developers to get on board and build with.
Integration with Mozilla Persona = adding skills and achievements to your online identity
The new Beta release includes integration with Mozilla Persona (formerly BrowserID). This opens the door for users to create a single user-centric identity across the web, with tools like Mozilla Open Badges adding a “reputation layer” that provides a complete story about what they know and have achieved. All through an open, standards-based infrastructure that puts user sovereignty, privacy and security first.

SHREVEPORT, La. - One teen is hospitalized and another is behind bars after a shooting in the Hollywood area of Shreveport on Christmas Eve.
Jarrett Thigpen, 19, was arrested after they and their 16-year-old cousin were playing with a gun that went off, hitting the younger teen in the stomach.
Shreveport Police Cpl. Marcus Hines said the shooting happened just after 7 p.m. Saturday at a residence in the 5800 block Attaway Street.
Initially, police were advised the victim was shot when armed men broke into the house, but later learned several males inside the residence were playing with the gun when it discharged, hitting the victim, who was transported to University Health with life-threatening injuries.
Investigators immediately initiated an inquiry and learned the shooting was not the result of a home invasion robbery. Following the shooting, Thigpen allegedly hid the gun in a nearby field where police later found it and seized it as evidence.
Thigpen, of the 1900 block of Hickory Street in Shreveport, was subsequently booked into the Shreveport City Jail on a single count of illegal use of a weapon.
BostonBruins.com - It's been about a month and a half with the "new Bruins" like Reilly Smith , Loui Eriksson and Jarome Iginla being added to the forward corps.
And it's also been about a month of those additions fielding questions about "chemistry" with their linemates.
The verdict? It takes time. So, every day, and each time they get asked about it, it's gotten better.
Loui Eriksson knows they get more comfortable the more practices and games they play with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand.
The same was true following Monday's hard session at Ristuccia Arena, with the B's three days away from their next game against Colorado on Thursday.
After joking with the new forward following practice about how tired they were of being asked about how their chemistry is forming, I decided I'd ask him, from their point of view, what that even means.
"It's a matter of knowing where everyone is on the ice. When you get to camp, you don't know exactly where the guys are on the ice. I think we're getting there; practice today, we felt really good. Some good passes," said Eriksson, who sports the gold jersey at practice with their two linemates.
"It's going to be nice to get some more practice in too before the next game and try to work on things."
But it's not just about the work being put in off the ice.
A clip from Episode 2 of the Bruins' all-access TV show "Behind the B" showed Eriksson and Bergeron sharing a locker room conversation before a practice.
"You like me to give it on your backhand more than opening up like that?" Bergeron asked their left-shot right winger, sitting over by Eriksson's stall as they taped their stick prior to a skate.
"Yeah, probably more on the backhand," said the winger.
A simple conversation between the two soft-spoken Bruins, but the more conversations like that they have, the more that "chemistry" will translate onto the ice.
"That's why you have practice, so you can talk to them and see what we can get better at. That's something we need to talk about," said Eriksson. "I think Bergy and Marchy are good at talking to me and explaining how they feel. And I think with a few more games, we're really going to get the hang of it."
From the beginning, Head Coach Claude Julien has stressed that patience.
"It's a matter of time," said Julien, on how they view the new Bruins adjusting. "I keep repeating myself; you can't judge or expect miracles in the first few games of the season."
"Like I said, you give them a good month to get to know each other and play together and you hope that in that month it progresses and so far I've seen that from training camp until now."
And it's not just about getting to know one another; it's also about the Bruins' well-structured system becoming second-nature.
In hockey, a team's "system" isn't often difficult to learn. It's more about the habit of execution.
In Dallas, where Eriksson spent seven full seasons, and on many other NHL teams, they overload their breakouts out of the zone. The Bruins keep their wingers a bit wider.
For Eriksson, and even Smith, though they only spent one season in Dallas before the trade, the repetition of that structure will eventually become more comfortable.
"It's the same adjustment as it was for Jags [Jaromir Jagr] and those guys," Julien said.
"So it's a bit of a change there for this kind of players and it takes a little bit of time just like anything else…You just don't become a good driver overnight, it takes practice it takes time. I think the same thing for those guys."
As much media attention as the new players have gotten, and will continue to receive, Julien remains cautionary with their expectations - even if the Bruins did start the season 2-0-0, with help from the newcomers.
"I think it's going to be important that we don't judge these guys too quickly – all of those guys coming in," said Julien. "Teams play different ways."
"When those things have been ingrained in you, they don't just disappear overnight. It's just a matter of time, and giving them a chance to get more comfortable, and giving them reminders, and I think after a few weeks or a month you've got a better idea of what you've got as a player."
For a Coach and team that hasn't had much turnover in years past, the familiarity may not be what is has been, but there's still a strong core who leads the way (and, if we're sticking with the car analogy here, could probably drive with their eyes closed).
"Sometimes when it's new, you have to think about it a lot," Julien said. "And what I try and create with our guys is a situation where it becomes second nature."
"So, less thinking, more action, and that takes time."
"Tuukka's Been Tuukka"
One Bruin who has wasted no time in getting in sync is Tuukka Rask.
The netminder and their team have only allowed two goals in their first two games of 2013-14. In the 3-1 win over Tampa Bay, Rask thwarted 32 shots and then made 25 stops in the 4-1 victory over Detroit.
“Tuukka's been Tuukka," said Julien, following the team's October 7 practice, as they sit at 2-0-0. "That means he's just been solid, played well, made big saves when we need them."
"And again, in that first game, I thought they did a good job of holding us in there. We didn't have a good start. Last game [against Detroit] I thought we had a much better overall game but against that type of team, you need good goaltending and they gave us that."
"Tuukka only played a few games in preseason so it's an opportunity for them to get some rhythm going."
On Thursday, the European Parliament voted to approve its “Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2013 and the European Union's policy on the matter,” which declares both same-sex marriage and abortion to be fundamental human rights.
The Parliament, which enjoys notable freedom from democratic accountability, continues its legislative activism, pushing member states toward more liberal positions on virtually every social issue, and slinging loose language such as “homophobia.”
The report says it is “regrettable” that women and girls' bodies “still remain an ideological battleground,” and calls for the EU and its member states to recognize the inalienable rights of women, including “the right to access voluntary family planning and safe and legal abortion.”
It also states that “the denial of lifesaving abortion amounts to a serious breach of human rights.”
In the area of sexual orientation, the report urges the Commission “to raise the issue of LGBTI rights in political and human rights dialogues with third countries and multilateral forums” and enjoins its policy-working group, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) to “support organisations defending LGBTI rights by empowering them to challenge homophobic and transphobic laws and discrimination against LGBTI people.”
The report applauds the legalization of same-sex marriage in an increasing number of countries (17 to date), and encourages the EU institutions and the member states to frame “the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue.”
It is “regrettable,” the report states, that in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia “a bill constitutionally banning same-sex marriage is currently being considered in parliament,” claiming that “such developments contribute to a climate of homophobia and discrimination.”
The Federation of Catholic Family Associations in Europe said that the resolution's position on marriage “threatens the right of children to have a father and a mother.” It said children's best interest should be considered, and their needs “should be respected” and “cannot be neglected in favor of adults' desires.”
An overwhelming majority approved the report Thursday, with 390 voting yes, 151 noes, and 97 abstaining, during the plenary meeting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Liberal parliamentarian Antonio Panzeri prepared the report, which has come to be known simply as the “Panzeri Report.”

Rain fury today claimed 11 more lives in the north, taking the toll to 73, even as 71,440 pilgrims bound for the Himalayan shrines remained stranded in monsoon-ravaged Uttarakhand apart from 1700 people stuck in Himachal Pradesh.
Though rescue efforts picked up momentum in flash flood and landslide hit areas of Himachal and Uttarakhand with a let up in the rains and decrease in water level in the Ganga and its tributaries, the whole of Uttarakhand still wore a marooned and devastated look.
Flashfloods, cloudbursts and subsequent landslips have claimed 44 lives in Uttarakhand, left as many injured and fully damaged 175 houses across the state.
Rudraprayag was the worst hit where 20 people perished and 73 building including 40 hotels along the banks of the Alaknanda were swept away by the swirling waters of the river.
A huge number of pilgrims totalling 71,440, who were bound for the Himalayan shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri are stranded in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts with the famous char dham yatra still suspended due to massive damage to the road network.
The maximum number of 27040 devotees are stranded in Chamoli, 25000 in Rudraprayag and 9,850 in Uttarkashi, Disaster Management authorities said.
Officials said water level of Bhagirathi in Uttarkashi and Ganga in Rishikesh had begun to recede.
In Himachal Pradesh, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, who was stranded in tribal Kinnaur district for nearly 60 hours due to landslides triggered by incessant rains, was evacuated this morning even as 1700 people remained stranded at various places.
A chopper hired by Congress party airlifted the chief minister this morning as rains abated and weather cleared this morning and about a dozen persons, including some old and ailing persons were brought to Rampur in the state helicopter, officials said.
In Uttar Pradesh, four persons were killed in rain-related incidents even as the state government issued a high alert in the wake of unexpected increase in discharge in major rivers including Ganga, Yamuna and Shrada.
While three teenagers were killed in Maharajganj after being struck by lightning, a woman was killed and six others were injured when a house collapsed during heavy rains in Muzaffarnagar.
UP Principal Secretary (Irrigation) Deepak Singhal said that in the wake of continuous downpour in the last 24 hours and incidents of cloudburst in Uttarakhand and Nepal, there has been unexpected increase in discharge of Ganga, Yamuna and Sharda.
On Monday, eight lakh cusec water was released in Yamuna from Hathinikund barrage and more than four lakh cusec water discharge passed in Sharda river in Banbasa.
They said that out of the 75 districts in the state, 23 were very sensitive and 11 sensitive from the flood point of view.
A day after normal life was paralysed in a few parts of Haryana, particularly Yamunanagar and Karnal districts, there was a decrease in rainfall activity across the state.
Yesterday, several villages in Yamunanagar district were under flood waters as rain water had entered several houses.
The rains had also led to an alarming increase in the water level of Yamuna, with an all-time record over 8.06 lakh cusecs water flowing through Hathni Kund barrage yesterday, prompting authorities to sound a high alert in districts of Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat and Faridabad.
However today, the water flowing through the barrage continued to decrease since yesterday afternoon and at 10 AM today, it was around 1.73 lakh cusecs.
In Punjab, Amritsar (9.5 mm), Patiala (trace rains), Nakodar (5 mm), besides capital town Chandigarh (1 mm) were among the few places to receive light rains.
The level of water in the Bhakra dam today touched 1595.04 feet. The reservoir's upper limit is 1680 feet.
"There is no reason for any alarm as of now. The present level is normal for the rainy season considering that monsoon has arrived early this season," a Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) official said.
The MeT official said that heavy rainfall activity in Punjab and Haryana is likely to further decrease from Thursday.
California Rep. [crscore]Nancy Pelosi[/crscore] disparagingly referred to President Obama as “the junior senator from Illinois” during a meeting with wealthy Democratic donors just after the party was trounced in the 2010's mid-term elections, according to an email that Sidney Blumenthal sent to then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton.
“When I go to the White House I feel like I'm dealing with the junior senator from Illinois,” is what Blumenthal claimed Pelosi told a group of people gathered at the Democracy Alliance's annual meeting, held in mid-Nov. 2010.
The email was contained in the batch of records released by the State Department on Friday.
Blumenthal added their commentary to a Huffington Post article they forwarded to Clinton which reported that billionaire progressive donor George Soros' had also slammed Obama at the progressive powwow.
“If this president can't do what we need, it is time to start looking somewhere else,” Soros reportedly told the Democracy Alliance. Just weeks before, Democrats had just suffered a major defeat at the polls, losing six Senate seats and 63 House seats to the GOP.
While Soros had reason to criticize Obama — they are one of the Democrats' most prolific donors — Pelosi perhaps had stronger grounds to complain.
The Republican rout ceded control of the House to the GOP. And that forced Pelosi to hand their House Speaker title over to Ohio Rep. John Boehner.
The Messina referenced in the Blumenthal email is Jim Messina, who then served as Obama's deputy chief of staff. Goulsbee is Austan Goolsbee, the chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors at the time.
A search of news articles published at that time returned no other reports of Pelosi's Obama criticism, so there is no way to corroborate Blumenthal's claim.
The former Bill Clinton White House aide frequently emailed Clinton gossip, rumors and intelligence reports gleaned from their vast network of sources. But their rumor-spreading infamously won them the ire of the Obama administration. They were blocked in the early days of Clinton's State Department tenure from getting a job at the agency because of rumors they spread about Obama during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries.
Other information they passed to Clinton has proved to be inaccurate as well. Nevertheless, Clinton frequently solicited them for information, insight, and advice, their emails show.

When SCOM is showing multiple computer objects in a critical state it can be very time consuming to use the GUI to open Health Explorer for each computer and then drill down into what the individual problems are.

Google seems to have backed off of its requirement for full-disk encryption on new devices running Android 5.0 “Lollipop” and higher. No announcement was made to bring this news to light, but the folks at Ars Technica noticed a change that was made to the final Android 5.0 hardware requirements that were finalized on January 11, 2015.
The final agreement adjusts the verbiage to out-of-the-box full-disk encryption as “very strongly recommended” instead of “required,” which it was when the document was first posted back in September 2014. Google hasn't said why they softened their stance on encryption for new devices, but you have to imagine it could have something to do with the backlash that ensued after Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 owners complained of performance issues, all of which was blamed on the encryption for slowing read and write disk speeds.
Here is the new full=disk encryption passage:
Keep in mind that even though Google is no longer requiring encryption be turned on by default in new devices running Lollipop, they are “very strongly” recommending and also mention that manufacturers “should” turn it on. Google also notes that they expect to change this to “must” in future versions of Android.
Now, if they would only allow it to be turned off on the Nexus 6, we would really be in business.
Update: Google confirmed that the change was made because some partner devices were experiencing performance issues.
New findings show that much of the mineral from which bone is made consists of “goo” trapped between tiny crystals, allowing movement between them. It is this flexibility that stops bones from shattering.
Latest research shows that the chemical citrate – a by-product of natural cell metabolism – is mixed with water to create a viscous fluid that is trapped between the nanoscale crystals that form our bones.
This fluid allows enough movement, or “slip,” between these crystals so that bones are flexible, and don't shatter under pressure. It is the inbuilt shock absorber in bone that, until now, was unknown.
If citrate leaks out, the crystals – made of calcium phosphate – fuse together into bigger and bigger clumps that become inflexible, increasingly brittle and more likely to shatter. This could be the root cause of osteoporosis.
The team from Cambridge's Department of Chemistry used a combination of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, imaging and high-level molecular modeling to reveal the citrate layers in bone.
They say that this is the start of what needs to be an entire shift in focus for studying the cause of brittle bone diseases like osteoporosis, and bone pathologies in general. The study is published in PNAS.
"Bone mineral was thought to be closely related to this substance called hydroxyapatite. But what we've shown is that a large part of bone mineral – possibly as much as half of it in fact – is made up of this goo, where citrate is binding like a gel between mineral crystals," says Melinda Duer, who led the study. "This nanoscopic layering of citrate fluid and mineral crystals in bone means that the crystals stay in flat, plate-like shapes that have the facility to slide with respect to each other. Without citrate, all crystals in bone mineral would collapse together, become one big crystal and shatter. It's this layered structure that's been missing from our knowledge, and we can now see that without it you're stuffed."
Duer compares it to two panes of glass with water in the middle, which stick together but are able to slide, "It's the same thing in these flat bone crystals. But you've got to have something that keeps the water there, stops it from drying out and stops the plates from either flying apart or sticking fast together. We now know that thing is citrate."
Citrate is a “spidery” molecule with four arms, all of which can bond easily to calcium – which bone is packed with, explains Duer. This means that citrate can hold the mineral crystals together at the same time as preventing them from fusing, while trapping the water that allows for the slippery movement which provides bone flexibility. "Without citrate, water would just flow straight through these gaps," they say.
The body actually delivers bone calcium wrapped in citrate, to prevent it fusing with phosphate and forming large solid – and brittle – mineral crystals in the wrong places. Bone tissue has a protein mesh with holes where the calcium is deposited. In healthy tissue, the holes are very small, so that when the calcium is deposited, the citrate that comes with it can't escape and is trapped between crystals – creating the flexible layers of fluid and bone plates.
As people age or suffer repeated bone trauma, the protein mesh isn't repaired so well by the cells that try to replace damaged tissue, but often end up chewing away tissue faster than it can be re-deposited. This causes progressively larger holes in the protein mesh, citrate fluid escapes and crystals fuse together.
What happens then is pure chemistry, says Duer, with little biological control.
The body instigates a form of biological control through the tiny holes in the protein mesh that trap the citrate fluid, along with other molecules that normally control the deposit of mineral. These small spaces force the molecules to be involved with the forming mineral, controlling the process. But if you haven't got the confined space the chemical reactions spiral out of control.
"In the bigger holes in damaged tissue, pure chemistry takes over. Pretty much the moment calcium and phosphate touch, they form a solid. You end up with these expanding clumps of brittle crystal, with water and citrate relegated to the outside of them," they say. "In terms of chemistry, that solid clump of mineral is the most stable structure. Biomechanically, however, it's hopeless – as soon as you stand on it, it shatters. If we want to cure osteoporosis, we need to figure out how to stop the bigger holes forming in the protein matrix."
The study is the first in a series of findings, with other studies from the team's work on bone chemistry expected to come out later in the year.
With just about two months to go before the 20th annual Deep Ellum Arts Festival, organizers couldn't hold back their excitement anymore and released the lineup of artists and bands that will take over the historic neighborhood April 4-6.
As usual, more than 100 bands and musicians will perform on five separate stages along Main Street, with around 200 visual artists setting up camp in between stages to hawk their wares. This year you'll have more time to explore everything, because the festival will be open for three full days.
Among the local bands are relatively big names like Nicholas Altobelli, Brave Combo, Fox & the Bird, The Effinays and The Crazy Ivans. No matter what type of music you like, though, you're bound to find something to enjoy, as the genres include rock, folk, jazz, blues, country, pop, R&B, funk and punk. Check out the full list of bands here, with more to be announced soon.
Visual artists will flock to Deep Ellum from across the country, with representatives coming from 25 different states. One painter, Yoram Gal, will even make the long trek from Tel Aviv, Israel.
In addition to bands and artists, the free festival also includes a variety of food options from area restaurants and food trucks, a pet parade, and more.
An Argentine judge has issued an arrest warrant for Justin Bieber on Friday, saying the singer failed to respond to summon related to allegations they ordered bodyguards to attack a photographer in 2013.
Judge Alberto Julio Banos ordered the "immediate detention" of Bieber and bodyguards Hugo Alcides Hesny and Terrence Reche Smalls.
An email sent to a Bieber representative was not immediately returned.
Bieber is accused of sending the bodyguards to attack photographer Diego Pesoa outside a Buenos Aires nightclub. Bieber never returned to Argentina to respond to questions about the incident.
Under Argentine law, Bieber would face from one month to six years in prison if convicted on a charge of causing injuries.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the warrant would extend beyond Argentina. Calls to the judge's office Friday afternoon were not answered.
In comments to local station Telefe Noticias, Pesoa's lawyer implied that the warrant would force Bieber to return to the South American country.
"Now we just need to wait for the police to find them and bring him" to Argentina, said lawyer Matias Morla. "For us, this is a triumph against all those who said this case was a bluff and that we didn't have anything."
Calls and emails to Morla were not immediately returned.
On Valentine's Day, NFL teams can sign players whose CFL contracts have expired, which makes it perhaps the least notable day of the league year? Maybe the Seattle Seahawks will show interest to Calgary's Derek Dennis, who was just named as the best offensive lineman in the CFL (they did find Brandon Browner there after all) but most likely the day will just come and go. It's a day for a red heart, not a red leaf, am I right?
No? Okay.
But on February 15, teams can apply a franchise or transition tag on one of their players who are set to be a free agent. The likely players around the NFL to get tagged are Kawann Short of the Carolina Panthers, Chandler Jones of the Arizona Cardinals, Le'Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dont'a Hightower of the New England Patriots, Kirk Cousins of the Washington Redskins, Eric Berry of the Kansas City Chiefs, and potentially a few more (Melvin Ingram, Alshon Jeffery, Terrelle Pryor).
Do the Seahawks have any candidates for either tag? No, not really.
At one time it seemed like maybe kicker Steven Hauschka could get the tag, but they had six extra points missed or blocked, and the team signed Blair Walsh last week. Their other biggest name free agents are Luke Willson and Tony McDaniel, neither of whom would get tagged.
The next big day of the league year will be February 28, when the NFL Scouting Combine begins in Indianapolis. Other than that, the next two weeks could be pretty boring as far as Seattle news. Who knows though, anything could happen.
Kevin Durant's new shoe pays homage to their home-town county with the initials “P.G.” — which some in Prince George's County find offensive. (Nike.com)
Magic Johnson was corrected for using it. A county judge once chided a police officer on the witness stand for saying it. And now NBA star Kevin Durant, who grew up in Prince George's County, is getting side-eye from county officials for putting the moniker on their high-priced new basketball shoe.
“It's ‘Prince George's County,' not ‘P.G,' ” said Howard Stone, a longtime county bureaucrat who has worked in almost every major local government office. “We should never allow anyone to say it in our presence.”
Nike on Wednesday released Durant's “KD8 PG County” model basketball shoe, a colorful, $180 tribute to the Seat Pleasant native's home jurisdiction. But not everyone in Prince George's is keen on the abbreviation that makes up part of the name of the footwear — a nickname they say is more of a dig than a term of endearment.
Since I was born & raised in P.G. County I need those P.G. County KD 8s 😍🙌🏽 @KDTrey5 that was a good idea ✊🏽 — gwanin wassy (@VXMCMXCVI) November 25, 2015
“As you can imagine, we are very proud of the success of Prince George's County native Kevin Durant, and the pride that they have in growing up in the county,” the office of County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) said in an e-mail sent to Nike. “We do want to make the Nike corporation aware that ‘P.G.' is a term that many in Prince George's County consider pejorative and/or an insult.”
Nike did not respond to a request for comment.
[The moniker Prince George's politicians hate to hear]
For decades, leaders of the country's most affluent majority African American jurisdiction have campaigned against shortening the county's full name to two letters — which insiders say could just as easily stand for “Pretty Ghetto” or “Pretty Grim.”
Stone called the nickname “denigrating,” evoking images of the county as crime-ridden and poor.
Kevin Durant unveils Nike KD8 PG County sneakers and PG County officials offended that Nike did not spell out Prince George's County? SMH — CrimeDocJoRich (@docjorich) November 25, 2015
The county was hard-hit by the recession and still lags behind its more affluent suburban neighbors in most economic and educational indicators. At the same time, it has seen a boom in development and private investment, and continues to boast some of the highest median incomes, education levels and home values among the nation's majority-minority communities.
“We've had our challenges,” Stone said. “But Prince George's is on the move.”
[Kevin Durant's emotional Mother's Day tribute to their own mom]
Not everyone is upset. State Del. Alonzo Washington (D-Prince George's) said the county should be proud of the 2014 NBA MVP not just because they pay homage to Prince George's but because they give back to the community. At the same time, Washington did say they wish the fancy basketball shoes were priced more affordably.
County Council member Derrick L. Davis (D-Mitchellville) said Durant “shouldn't be burdened to carry the added responsibility of formality as it pertains to the perceived pejorative.”
“While I understand others' dismay, the fact that they thought enough of ‘home' to use it, albeit colloquially, makes me, a proud Prince Georgian, proud to claim Kevin as a Prince Georgian.”
Never understood why "PG" is offensive to say. Seems even sillier in the case of "KD8 P.G. County" shoes https://t.co/0rJFnjMcAC — Tiffany Arnold (@TiffanyMArnold) November 25, 2015
Even Baker admitted in a phone interview that they understand that Durant —who many local professional basketball fans hope joins the hometown Wizards next year as a free agent— is “going to call the shoe what they want.” That's fine, Baker added, so long as government officials, reporters and others who refer to the county in an official capacity use the more formal “Prince George's.”
“We are most happy that they think about Prince George's, and wants the world to know this was the community that raised him,” Baker said.
Baker said they would like to own a pair of the shoes, which on Wednesday were available in the county at Foot Locker stores and their affiliates (employees at a Clinton-area Foot Locker, which had the shoe only in child and pre-school sizes, said they had sold about five pairs by late afternoon).
In a text, fellow Democrat Justin Ross, a lifelong county resident and former state delegate who now works as a lobbyist, said they were headed out soon to purchase a pair for himself. “Clearly Kevin Durant named their new shoe out of love and respect for our hometown,” Ross's text said. “Good looking out KD, I'm buying some PG's and wearing them all over the DMV.”
SA Government refuses to sign Gonski 2.0 interim school funding agreement
Updated
More than $1 billion in federal funding to South Australian schools is now in limbo because of a deepening stand-off over the Federal Government's Gonski 2.0 education plan.
Just weeks out from the end of the school year, SA Education Minister Susan Close has written to their federal counterpart Simon Birmingham indicating the SA Government will not sign an interim funding agreement.
The federal plan includes $1.285 billion set aside for SA schools in 2018, with funding due to increase each year over the next decade.
But the SA Government said South Australian schools would be $210 million worse off over the next two years.
"South Australia's public, Catholic and independent schools are also being held to ransom by the Federal Government, which has threatened to withhold $1.2 billion in funding," Ms Close said.
"I want to work constructively with the Federal Education Minister on a future agreement but I absolutely refuse to be complicit in $210 million being withheld from South Australian schools."
In May, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the overhaul known as Gonski 2.0, promising a needs-based system to determine education funding across the country.
But the plan has been criticised by education groups and some state governments, who said it would lead to major cuts.
"Without the original Gonski agreement in place, all three schooling sectors in South Australia would suffer a massive financial loss," Ms Close said.
But Mr Birmingham has accused the SA Government of attempting to "bully" the Commonwealth and putting politics ahead of education outcomes.
"By refusing to sign this agreement state Labor is effectively saying we don't want $1.29 billion for SA schools next year, which I'm sure is at odds with school communities across the state," they said.
"Jay Weatherill's constant desire to have petty political fights with Canberra is jeopardising a federal funding boost to South Australian schools of $804 million."
Mr Birmingham said Productivity Commission data showed SA Labor had slashed "$56 million from government schools" at a time when federal funding was rising.
"The Turnbull Government will never let Australia go back to the 27 special schools funding deals Labor stitched up that the Weatherill Government is trying to bully us back into," they said.

As the afterglow of forming a new government in British Columbia begins to wear off, the provincial NDP still has a problem on its hands: who will be in the Speaker's chair the next time the legislature meets?
It's a dilemma, but not an insoluble one. All three parties have an interest right now in finding a solution short of an election; B.C. voters have made it clear in polls that they have no appetite for another election immediately. If an early election comes, the party deemed responsible may well suffer a penalty at the ballot box, much as we saw in the recent U.K. general election. The Liberals should do their part to avoid an immediate election by offering up one of their own for the job of Speaker.
Appearing co-operative
Arguably, the Liberals have a greater need to appear co-operative now given the way the party lost power. Premier Christy Clark went against both precedent and their own previously stated intentions when they asked Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon to dissolve the legislature. Had Clark's request been granted, the province would be gearing up for an unwelcome summer election right now.
The other two parties might try to exploit the resulting vulnerability. Suppose no NDP or Green MLA stands for Speaker, perhaps citing deference to the convention of Speaker impartiality in doing so. Should no Liberal volunteer to stand for the job either, the party risks appearing serially uncooperative and election-seeking, more interested in the pursuit of power for its own sake than in the good governance of the province.
Beyond such tactical considerations, the Liberals have more fundamental problems. Most notably, they are in an ideological no-man's land right now. Having campaigned on its centre-right platform, the party not so much pivoted as cartwheeled to an entirely different agenda in their recent throne speech.
If there's one thing that can derail a party for a couple election cycles, it's throwing into question its fundamental identity. Not knowing what the party truly stands for, many voters will be unwilling to trust any promises it makes. Even some core supporters may decide to sit out an election or two if they come to feel sufficiently alienated.
After 16 years of Liberal rule, there is big political change coming to British Columbia as a new minority government led by the NDP's John Horgan takes over 1:42
Accordingly, the party could use some time to get its house back in order. The clearest way to turn the page would be to find a new leader. Questions about Clark have been swirling since their party's defeat in the legislature. No definitive answers have yet emerged, though some party supporters have expressed frustrations with the way in which the post-electoral situation played out.
That leads us back to the Speaker question. So long as the party remains on a war footing, it will be effectively impossible to carry out a leadership or thorough policy review, let alone a new leadership campaign.
If some faction of the Liberal party concludes that such reviews are in order, it could buy time to carry them out by putting forward a nominee for Speaker. There are other ways to accomplish the same effect — negotiating Liberal support for certain bills and motions on an ad hoc basis for instance — but none with the same simplicity, freedom and predictability for the Liberals in opposition.
Certainly, there is ample precedent for an opposition member serving as Speaker when the situation calls for it. Long-time Liberal MP Peter Milliken served as Speaker for two successive federal Conservative governments, from 2006 until their retirement in 2011. They received widespread acclaim for their role in steering the Commons through a number of difficult situations.
Costs of obstruction
Some Liberals will resist the idea of giving an inch to the new Green-supported NDP government, preferring instead to oppose everything right up to the point of election. Such obstruction comes with costs, however.
First, the Liberals will lose the chance to appear conciliatory in the eyes of the electorate, potentially undermining the party's pledge in the throne speech and elsewhere to cooperate in light of the close election. Such opposition would require them to somewhat awkwardly vote against other ideas they just proposed in their throne speech as well, deepening their ideological quandary as a result.
Perhaps most importantly, so long as the situation remains uncertain in Victoria, the Liberals must remain disciplined and loyal to their leader. They will lose the chance to engage in either a frank discussion of policy or a leadership review.
Simply put, the Liberals face a choice: obstruct or reorganize. They cannot do both simultaneously.
If a Liberal did stand for Speaker, the party would gain a measure of leverage over the government with the ever-present threat of withdrawal. Solve the NDP's problem in the present, and gain the ability to create a new headache for them down the road— one that could well trigger an election at a more convenient time for the Liberals, or force the NDP down the contentious and potentially costly road of Speaker partisanization.

When Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) heavyweight titleholder Cain Velasquez defeated Brock Lesnar to win the 265-pound strap at the UFC 121 pay-per-view (PPV) way back in 2010, the newly-crowned kingpin was asked who they believed was their "ideal match up."
Their answer was Fedor Emelianenko.
That wasn't lost on M-1 Global executives, who tried to finagle a match between the two shortly thereafter. Unfortunately for mixed martial arts (MMA) fans, UFC President Dana White wasn't having it, and instead tried to lure the former PRIDE deity out of retirement with a super-sized showdown against Lesnar.
And it almost happened.
But if "The Last Emperor" could travel back to their prime, back when they were wrecking shit overseas, their dream fight wouldn't be against "The Brockness Monster," but rather Velasquez, who presents an intriguing match up as a "thinking fighter."
Emelianenko spoke to Calgary Sun:
"Cain Velasquez. They have some technical difficulties, but they have ambition and he's fearless. They want to win so badly and he's in great condition. He's a thinking fighter. I still train, so there isn't much that I miss. A true athlete is someone who doesn't just stop training when they stop competing. It's a way of life and they keep in shape just to keep up that standard. Plus, there are a lot of younger guys who would like to take me down, so I always need to keep up because I definitely don't want that to happen."
Unfortunately for fans, "the greatest MMA fighter of all time" insists he's not coming out of retirement.
Emelianenko -- still only 37 -- called it quits back in 2012 after knocking out Pedro Rizzo in Russia, marking their third straight win after a disastrous run in Strikeforce. The one-time Affliction MMA headliner retired with a 34-4 (1 NC) record after 12 years in the fight game.
Velasquez (13-1) looks to make it five straight when they battle Fabricio Werdum this November.
Animated Black Panther Debuts June 23
Weekly Series on iTunes, Xbox LIVE, Zune and PS Network
Marvel Knights Animation has announced that it's long-awaited Black Panther: Who is the Black Panther? animated series will debut on June 23. The 12-episode series will run weekly on iTunes, Xbox LIVE, Microsoft Zune and the PlayStation Network. Check out two screen shots from the series below.
The series is based on the comic book story-arc of the same name written by Reginald Hudlin and drawn by John Romita, Jr. Black Panther: Who is the Black Panther? retells the origin of T'Challa and their fight to avenger the murder of their father at the hands of Klaw.
In the series, Black Panther is voiced by Academy Award nominee Djimon Hounsou with Alfre Woodard, Kerry Washington, Jill Scott, Carl Lumby and Stan Lee rounding out the cast.
From Marvel.com:
"The positive responses to news of the show have been so overwhelming, it's great to finally make the Black Panther series available to everyone," said Hudlin. "Audiences get caught up on many levels - seeing John Romita Jr's art come to life; the quality of the voice work by an award winning cast; the boldness of the politics, the music and humor. But see it for yourself!"
What did you think of the Who is the Black Panther? storyline in the comic series and will you be downloading the animated series?
That final, inconceivable figure would only apply in the latter years of the block's 999 year lease.
Even so, it is being cited as an illustration of increasingly common, punitive freeholder terms which are "blighting" newbuild properties and storing up disasters for buyers.
In this case the leaseholders clubbed together to buy out the landlord. But lawyers warn that where the terms are so favourable to the freeholder, the cost of buying the freehold is high.
The most dangerous terms for leaseholders are ground rents which are contracted to double at certain intervals, as this triggers exponential increases.
In the case of the Islington block, rents starting at £250 per year were set to double every 25 years.
The Guardian recently reported on a Taylor Wimpey property for which a buyer paid £101,000 in 2010 but which is now unsellable - because ground rents are set to spiral to £8,000. The housebuilder said it did not own the freehold.
Louie Burns of Leasehold Solutions, which helps leaseholders buy freehold, said: "Developers tend to sell the freeholds before they start building. Professional ground rent investors are involved in the process and the terms that are devised can be complex - meaning buyers do not necessarily understand what they are getting in to."
They also said the issue was "hushed up" by many leaseholders, because they did not wish to draw attention to what is effectively a defect of the property.
"Once you realise you've fallen victim to these onerous terms, you tend not to talk about it - because it hits the value of your property," they said. "It's the biggest legitimate scam in Britain."
Sebastian O'Kelly, of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a registered charity which aims to protect vulnerable leaseholders, condemned the term "virtual freeholds" as "marketing cobblers".
"Rather than talking nonsense about ‘virtual freeholds', housebuilders should be providing brief resumes of the key lease terms," they said.
Veteran Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley told the Party Parliamentary Group on leasehold reform this week that these ground rents, while legitimate, were "clearly undesirable" and "sharp practice".
The U.S. government has invested $1.4 billion in HIV prevention programs that promote sexual abstinence and marital fidelity, but there is no evidence that these programs have been effective at changing sexual behavior and reducing HIV risk, according to a new Stanford University School of Medicine study.
Since 2004, the U.S. President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, has supported local initiatives that encourage men and women to limit their number of sexual partners and delay their first sexual experience and, in the process, help to reduce the number of teen pregnancies. However, in a study of nearly 500,000 individuals in 22 countries, the researchers could not find any evidence that these initiatives had an impact on changing individual behavior.
Although PEPFAR has been gradually reducing its support for abstinence and fidelity programs, the researchers suggest that the remaining $50 million or so in annual funding for such programs could have greater health benefits if spent on effective HIV prevention methods. Their findings will be published online May 2 and in the May issue of Health Affairs.
"Overall we were not able to detect any population-level benefit from this program," said Nathan Lo, a Stanford MD/PhD student and lead author of the study. "We did not detect any effect of PEPFAR funding on the number of sexual partners or upon the age of sexual intercourse. And we did not detect any effect on the proportion of teen pregnancy.
"We believe funding should be considered for programs that have a stronger evidence basis," they added.
A human cost
Senior author Eran Bendavid, MD, said the ineffective use of these funds has a human cost because it diverts money away from other valuable, risk-reduction efforts, such as male circumcision and methods to prevent transmission from mothers to their children.
"Spending money and having no effect is a pretty costly thing because the money could be used elsewhere to save lives," said Bendavid, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford.
PEPFAR was launched in 2004 by President George W. Bush with a five-year, $15 million investment in global AIDS treatment and prevention in 15 countries. The program has had some demonstrated success: A 2012 study by Bendavid showed that it had reduced mortality rates and saved 740,000 lives in nine of the targeted countries between 2004 and 2008.
However, the program's initial requirement that one-third of the prevention funds be dedicated to abstinence and "be faithful" programs has been highly controversial. Critics questioned whether this approach could work and argued that focusing only on these methods would deprive people of information on other potentially lifesaving options, such as condom use, male circumcision and ways to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and divert resources from these and other proven prevention measures.
Abstinence, faithfulness funding continues
In 2008, when President Barack Obama came into office, the one-third requirement was eliminated, but U.S. funds continued to flow to abstinence and "be faithful" programs, albeit at lower levels. In 2008, $260 million was committed to these programs, but by 2013 by that figure had fallen to $45 million.
Although PEPFAR continues to fund abstinence and faithfulness programs as part of its broader behavior-based prevention efforts, there is no routine evaluation of the success of these programs. "We hope our work will emphasize the difficulty in changing sexual behavior and the need to measure the impact of these programs if they are going to continue to be funded," Lo said.
While many in the medical community were critical of the abstinence-fidelity component, no one had ever analyzed its real-world impact, Lo said. When they presented the results of the study in February at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infection, they received rousing applause from the scientists in the audience, some of whom came to the microphone to congratulate them on the work.
To measure the program's effectiveness, Lo and their colleagues used data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, a detailed database with individual and household statistics related to population, health, HIV and nutrition. The scientists reviewed the records of nearly 500,000 men and women in 14 of the PEPFAR-targeted countries in sub-Saharan Africa that received funds for abstinence-fidelity programs and eight non-PEPFAR nations in the region. They compared changes in risk behaviors between individuals who were living in countries with U.S.-funded programs and those who were not.
The scientists included data from 1998 through 2013 so they could measure changes before and after the program began. They also controlled for country differences, including gross domestic product, HIV prevalence and contraceptive prevalence, and for individuals' ages, education, whether they lived in an urban or rural environment, and wealth. All of the individuals in the study were younger than 30.
Number of sexual partners
In one measure, the scientists looked at the number of sexual partners reported by individuals in the previous year. Among the 345,000 women studied, they found essentially no difference in the number of sexual partners among those living in PEPFAR-supported countries compared with those living in areas not reached by PEPFAR programs. The same was true for the more than 132,000 men in the study.
The researchers also looked at the age of first sexual intercourse among 178,000 women and more than 71,000 men. Among women, they found a slightly later age of intercourse among women living in PEPFAR countries versus those in non-PEPFAR countries, but the difference was slight -- fewer than four months -- and not statistically significant. Again, no difference was found among the men.
Finally, they examined teenage pregnancy rates among a total of 27,000 women in both PEPFAR-funded and nonfunded countries and found no difference in rates between the two.
Bendavid noted that, in any setting, it is difficult to change sexual behavior. For instance, a 2012 federal Centers for Disease Control analysis of U.S.-based abstinence programs found they had little impact in altering high-risk sexual practices in this country.
"Changing sexual behavior is not an easy thing," Bendavid said. "These are very personal decisions. When individuals make decisions about sex, they are not typically thinking about the billboard they may have seen or the guy who came by the village and said they should wait until marriage. Behavioral change is much more complicated than that."
Level of education
The one factor that the researchers found to be clearly related to sexual behavior, particularly in women, was education level. Women with at least a primary school education had much lower rates of high-risk sexual behavior than those with no formal education, they found.
"One would expect that women who are educated have more agency and the means to know what behaviors are high-risk," Bendavid said. "We found a pretty strong association."
The researchers concluded that the "study contributes to the growing body of evidence that abstinence and faithfulness campaigns may not reduce high-risk sexual behaviors and supports the importance of investing in alternative evidence-based programs for HIV prevention in the developing world."
The authors noted that PEPFAR representatives have been open to discussing these findings and the implications for funding decisions regarding HIV prevention programs.

The Rams are backed into a corner at quarterback.
With the uninspiring trio of Kellen Clemens, Austin Davis and Brady Quinn in the fold, St. Louis at least tried to spice things up under center after Sam Bradford tore their ACL on Sunday.
Amid internal discussions about the possibility of signing Tim Tebow, the team also floated a call to Brett Favre to assess their interest in returning to the NFL, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Favre, 44, reportedly declined the offer.
We're not surprised after the former Packers, Jets and Vikings passer made it crystal clear their playing days are over in a revealing conversation with Rich Eisen and the boys on NFL Network's "NFL GameDay Morning" last Sunday.
On Thursday, Favre told WSPZ-AM in Washington that they received interest through their agent Bus Cook, but the unnamed team (or teams) never contacted Favre directly. They "guessed" that the Rams were interested because he's familiar with offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's offense.
"It's flattering, but there's no way in hell I'm going to do that," Favre said.

Favre also suggested that St. Louis wasn't the only interested party, saying, "I don't know who, but I think a couple teams have inquired."
Something's in the water. NFL Media's Jeff Garcia acknowledged they called the Browns about a comeback, and the Rams phoned a guy who'd rather roam the Mississippi farmlands this autumn on their riding mower.
The upshot: We're in for a bigger-than-desired helping of Mr. Clemens come Monday night against the Seattle Seahawks.

A bizarre suicide is being investigated by police after a Hudson Valley man tied their neck to a pole with a chain, got into their car and revved the gas. Reuters is reporting the grisly scene took place in The Bronx over the Labor Day weekend.
A 51-year-old Port Jervis man was on Longfellow Avenue in The Bronx when they wrapped a chain around a pole. They then got into their Honda Pilot and put the other end of the chain around their neck. After stepping on the gas their head was yanked from their body and landed on the street. The car then crashed into a parked car and the rest of the man's body was ejected from the car.
Reuters reports the man was identified as Tomas Rivera of Port Jervis. Police are investigating whether a note was left and what the reason for the apparent suicide could have been.
Over the last three days I've been Dumpster Diving Across Wisconsin to raise awareness about our massive food waste issue here in the United States. Previous to this adventure I've been Dumpster Diving Across the USA for a year and a half so I expected this week to be a pretty standard for me. I also expected my home state of Wisconsin to do a good job of not wasting food.
But I've been completely blown away by what I've found in the supermarket dumpsters. Every dumpster I have opened has been FULL of perfectly good food. In a front page La Crosse Tribune story I did a few days ago, I confidently said, “If there's a dumpster, there's food in it” and so far I have proved that to be right time and time again. In just three days of biking across Wisconsin living purely on dumpster food, I have found tens of thousands of dollars worth of food. All of this at a time when 1 in 7 Americans is food insecure. This waste of food is also a huge waste of water, fossil fuels, energy, and landfill space and is a root cause to many of the world's most pressing issues.
I just keep saying to myself that it makes no sense for me to buy any more food when every dumpster I open is full of it, and we're talking about good quality healthy food. I've eaten $50 worth of berries alone in the last few days and have hummus for days! When I do purchase food I eat a very healthy primarily plant-based diet and I have had no problem finding all the delicious and nutritious food that I need to maintain that diet. Sure it's hard to turn down all the cookies and muffins in the dumpster but that's a different story.
I really care about this issue and have decided I'm going to be a big part of the solution. I'm a lead-by-example activist and that's what I know how to do best, so yesterday I decided I'm going to give up money for the rest of my tour from Madison to NYC and live solely on food that is going to waste. I am not telling everyone that they should eat from dumpsters, but I am saying that we should cut the waste and use our resources properly. I'm donating the $421 that I have on me to Food Shift, a great non-profit working to reduce food waste and build more resilient communities. I left my home in San Diego two months and 2,500 miles ago with $2,000 cash (no credit or debit card) and have eaten very comfortably at the farmers markets and co-ops, but from here on I'll have 1,500 miles to pedal until I reach New York City on September 26th. Every mile will be fueled by the waste of the inefficient food system in the United States. You might be thinking that money can be used for a lot more than food but I've found as I've cycling across the United States that the only thing I've needed to spend money on is food since I live such a simple life. I'll depend on my resourcefulness and the goodness of others to carry me on to NYC happy, healthy, and free.
I announced all of this on Wake up Wisconsin this morning as you can see in the video below, so there is no going back now. My host Dani Maxwell and I enjoyed some dumpster pomegranate juice together while we got the word out about food waste. Expect to see me on local media outlets from here to NYC raising awareness and waking up the American public to this issue.
What can you do today to reduce food waste in the United States? Go on citizen patrol!
You don't have to dive into dumpsters but you can go look in them and see what you find. If you find a company that is being irresponsibly wasteful, just call them out via social media. Tweet a photo of their wastefulness at them with #WastefulUSA (or #WastefulWI in Wisconsin) and let them know we don't want them wasting food anymore. Anyone in the country can do this to help fight food waste! Companies do listen and they do not want bad publicity, so this is an opportunity for us to very easily make a big dent in food waste.
Bat Bomb is part of an ongoing series of experiments to try to learn how to make aeolian harp type sounds. In this case I used Uhe's Brazille with a patch that manipulated the overtone by adjusting the modwheel. Using my Linnstrument in MPE mode I was able to independently adjust the overtone (13 in total per note) by moving my finger in the “Y” dimension (which was routed to the modwheel channel control) and the root note from Carlos “Super JI” tuning by selecting the pad I played. The original patch had a lot of high ends to it and are some time listening to it I decided to turn the filters down to try to get closer to a sine wave. Then I experimented with tempo. I find the 60 BPM version the most interesting at the time I am writing this post though there are some interesting peculiarities of each version. And, no, I don't feel that came close to the aeolian harp, yet I think the experiment has its merit in learning sound design technique and audio result. Of course YMMV. I present the audio in the order I find most interesting. And yes, the bat bomb was real – click the photo to read about it as you listen.

***WARNING: This video is graphic and may be disturbing to some viewers. Viewer discretion is advised.*** Dashcam video was released of Police Officer Patrick Feaster shooting DUI suspect Andrew Thomas in the neck in Paradise, California. The officer will not be charged. (Published Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2015)
Residents of a Northern California town are outraged over a response to a recent police-involved shooting of an unarmed DUI suspect, which was caught on a dashcam.
Butte County prosecutors announced last week that they will not charge Paradise Police Officer Patrick Feaster, who fired on a driver as they were attempting to leave their car following a rollover crash on Nov. 26. Prosecutors said their findings confirmed Feaster's claims that the gun discharged accidentally.
The decision prompted protests over the weekend and a petition shared on “Justice for Andrew Thomas” Facebook page called for Feaster's firing.
“We're just out here to address the issue that we want officer Feaster fired,” Joshua Turner, Thomas' friend who launched the Facebook page, told NBC affiliate KNVN. “We don't feel safe with them back on the street.”
Feaster followed the driver after noticing them speed out of a parking lot of the Canteena Bar in Paradise with their headlights off, according to police.
The dramatic dashcam footage shows the driver, 26-year-old Andrew Thomas, crashing their SUV after hitting the median. Their wife, 23-year-old Darien Ehorn, was ejected from the car and died at the scene. The video appears to show Feaster calmly walk toward the car and fire at Thomas as they try to get out through the window.
Thomas falls back inside the car and the officer are seen approaching the car and peering inside.
"I've got an unresponsive female, I've got a male in the car refusing to get out," Feaster, a five-year veteran of the department, is later heard saying in the dash-cam video.
District Attorney Mike Ramsey said when Thomas, who had a blood alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit, “popped” out of the SUV, Feaster drew their gun and “accidentally” fired, striking Thomas in the neck, KNVN reported. Ramsey said the officer drew the firearm thinking Thomas would flee.
When first responders arrived on the scene, Feaster did not mention that they fired their gun and, according to Ramsey, notified their commanding officer about the discharge after Thomas' gunshot wound was found, KNVN reported.
Feaster said they may have shot Thomas after the commanding officer suggested an investigator return to the bar to try to find out if Thomas had been shot there. Ramsey said nearly 11 minutes passed before responders learned Thomas had been shot.
Ramsey said in a media release Thursday that several factors led investigators to conclude the shooting was accidental: “The dash cam video shows Officer Feaster was not prepared for and was surprised by the gun's firing. The pistol discharges in mid-stride and the officer both flinches their head to the right and does a stutter step indicative of an officer not prepared for nor intentionally firing their pistol. Additionally, officers normally train firing a minimum of two shots. There was no second shot and the officer immediately holstered their weapon after the discharge.”
An internal investigation into the shooting is underway, according to Paradise Chief of Police Gabriela Tazzari-Dineen.
Meanwhile, Thomas is facing vehicular manslaughter charges in their wife's death and may be paralyzed from the waist down.
“This is a horrible thing and we will get justice for what happened,” Thomas' family told KNVN in a written statement.
Turner told NBC Owned Stations Tuesday that the dashcam video makes it "obvious" that "the shot was not accidental. And if it was, it was extremely negligent for officer Feaster not to call it in right away."
They said over 150 people protested the shooting on Saturday and they expect more people to come out over the weekend. They said they also started a petition to get California Attorney General Kamala Harris "involved in overriding Ramsey's decision not to press criminal charges."
"Police aren't being held accountable for these shootings all over the country, and when it happened to someone I knew, I couldn't sit at home and be silent," Turner said. "A lot of people feel that way in Paradise as well."
Turner added that Thomas is aware that their wife died in the crash and that they "he's ready to face the consequences. We just want Feaster held accountable and to face his."
The family of a Māori Battalion veteran are angry the government refused to provide ceremonial support for their tangi.

Charlie Petera was just 14 when they enlisted with the 28th Māori Battalion.
Although they fought under the New Zealand flag, it was a korowai that was draped on their coffin as they were laid to rest this week.
The family of Mr Petera, who was the last surviving member of the 28th Māori Battalion's A Company, were upset after an appeal for ceremonial support to lay the 92-year-old soldier was turned down by Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee.
Family spokesperson Rudy Taylor said a request was made to Mr Brownlee for ceremonial and logistical support at the tangi, but it wasn't granted.
Mr Taylor said "Whether it be a bugle or whether a gun salute that soldiers do, or whether a cloth or the flag that hangs over him, nothing, nothing whatsoever."
Labour's Defence spokesperson Phil Goff sent the request to Mr Brownlee on behalf of the family and said they believed it could have been granted.
"I think there is a lot of discretion that the minister has. This was something that I think was a stand-out ocassion, it was the passing of the very last member who served actively in the A Company of the 28th Māori Battalion, and the reputation of that company is, really, legend.

"They did incredible things for New Zealand and I think this would have been not only a way of ackonledging not only Charlie but all of those who served in A Company and the people of the North who sent their sons to fight and die on New Zealand's part of the Second World War."
"It was one that might have met the minister's discretion for providing Defence Force assistance."
Mr Brownlee argued that only a certain number of hui or tangi were supported each year.
"In a long standing agreement between the Ministers of Defence and Māori Affairs, the latter can declare up to three hui or tangi to be of national significance annually.

"While the passing of a Second World War veteran is sad, there are still over 2000 veterans living, including members of the 28th Māori Battalion.
"To accord ceremonial courtesies or provide logistical support to Mr Petera's tangi would set in my mind an unacceptable precendent for those who live."
When approached by RNZ News about the request, Mr Brownlee said they hadn't received any representation from Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell and was in no position to direct the military outside of protocol.
Mr Flavell's office said they had never received a request from the family and was not consulted by Mr Brownlee on the request they received.
Mr Taylor said they were disappointed with the official response.
"This was the last of the Battalion A Company from Te Tai Tokerau - an answer like that from a minister, then I question what is this government up to when it comes to deciding who gets funding. You're only dealing with the last you're not dealing with anymore after that."
There are just seven members of the 28th Māori Battalion still living and Mr Petera was the last from Company A.
Mr Goff said the Defence Minister had discretion.
They said they wrote on behalf of the Petera family and was disapppointed the government did not consider the tangi had sufficent status to provide the support.
About 3600 men served in the Māori battalion. Of those, 649 were killed or died of wounds.
Their marriage ended in a divorce in 1994, nine years after they wed, but music legend Billy Joel and model Christie Brinkley will continue to be friends until the end.
Case in point: They were spotted dancing in the front row at their Madison Square Garden concert this week while they sang "Uptown Girl" during their four-song encore.
Mashable, in the audience Thursday night, saw the "Piano Man" singer waving down their camera crew to capture the moment. Soon, a dancing Brinkley and their smiling face were displayed on the large screens in the stadium, inciting cheers and applause.
Brinkley shared this Instagram photo from the show with the caption, "He's still got it!"
They memorably starred in the 1983 music video for "Uptown Girl":
While married, the couple had one daughter together.
Most recently, after Joel's mother died last month, Brinkley wrote an emotional tribute to their late ex-mother-in-law Rosalind Nyman Joel on Instagram: "At sad times we look for ways to find the good to lift our spirits, so I have only to imagine what Rosalinda's Eyes have seen to find cause celebrating a life well lived," Brinkley, 60, wrote to accompany this photo.
Joel, 65, was performing for a sold-out crowd as part of their monthly residency at Madison Square Garden, where in December they were named as a new franchise, meaning he'll do a concert every month until they can't attract massive crowds to the venue.

CHICAGO — Inspired by Michael Tatum's Downloader's Diary, where Tatum has so far published two full-artist reviews, I tried my hand at this form, and this is where it got me. It's a great excuse to extensively play records I otherwise wouldn't have enough time for, not to mention a way to understand a type of chronological progression that most people listening to music retrospectively often miss. Why I picked this one specifically I'm not quite sure, but it was worth it. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Run-DMC, the hardest-rocking band in hip-hop.
Run-D.M.C.
Profile, 1984 [BUY]
The loudest, simplest, and most aggressive of the hip-hop groups so far: if Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five is closer to pop, and Afrika Bambaataa closer to techno. Run-DMC's strategy is much more straightforward — they shove their music at you, command you to like it, and you will. They have yet to prove their significance, but even the weakest bands in a style as up-and-coming as this can have lasting impact, and these guys are pretty strong.
Authoratative yet quite austere, the chief innovation on this album is formal. Centered around Jam-Master Jay's primitively heavy drumblasts, the mix always asserts itself whether kicking in the killer guitars on “Rock Box” or sticking to synthesized percussion on most of the other tracks. The rappers practice a certain kind of bigheaded opportunism characteristic of privileged pop-metalists, among whom it's a sickening attitude, no doubt about it. But these college kids belong to a subculture that at least in theory embodies the lower-middle-class. That's why their various social protests ring true, why they get away with a sound whose various vulgarities would wear thin in almost any other context, why it's a miracle they manage to be this emphatic. Their tight sonic impositions thrill like going on a roller coaster for the first time.
Telling you to get an education one moment, calling you a sucker the next, they already have the makings of great rock stars. Their aesthetic is summed up in the way they shout at the top of their lungs, rejecting vocal/lyrical nuance in favor of energy, energy, more energy. A-

Profile, 1985 [BUY]
If you liked the first album, you'll like the second one too, which follows the same formula pretty closely. Since nobody else sounds remotely like them, it's easy to mistake this elaboration of their basic style for mere repetition. But even so, their basic style is so raw, so spare yet powerful, that I'll take all I can get.
Their up-and-coming crew-that-can-never-be-beat routine suits the blunt percussive violence that fuels even the more musically complex tracks, but they've shifted perspective a little. In terms of hip-hop society, their place in a working-class subculture is naturally undercut by commercial success, which has not only made their gross ambition harder to take, it's made them complacent in the manner of the biggest multiplatinum titans: now that they know how great they are, they're no longer rubbing it in our faces. Still, Eddie Martinez's bristling guitar riffs add a fierce musical potency very much in tune with the rappers' vocal bravado. And Jam-Master Jay rocks with a drive that's pointless to deny, whacking each note like he's beating up the turntables.
Compared to the debut, this good-not-great record lacks focus somehow. But come on. Can you really resist lines like “I'm the king of rock/there is none higher/sucker MCs should call me sire/to burn my kingdom you must use fire/I won't stop rocking till I retire”? I don't think so. B+
Raising Hell
Profile, 1986 [BUY]
They're a great band on a mission, and their biggest-sounding record is at once more consistent and more musically varied than anything else they've done. As their sound gets more intense, so do they, saying much not only to their street-oriented college audience, but to the middle-class establishment whose values they share and whose aesthetic they disdain. They also make a bunch of good jokes and boast a whole lot.
The blasting guitars and beefy beats would make this album a giant piece of muscle regardless, packed so tightly together it explodes in your face by default and then takes it from there. But despite the arena-rock ambition typified by the Aerosmith cover/cameo, this is where they reveal what I've always suspected was the driving force behind their music: tough, uncompromising moralism. Other rappers fuck bitches and smoke cheeba and drink malt liquor, but Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell stick to the straight and narrow — endorse education, reject drugs, preach about race, yell at “stupid sex fiends.” Even better, they're arrogant about it. Usually puritans like these are guilty of the worst sort of misanthropy. But the delight with which they bellow their peerless rhymes makes it clear they're enjoying themselves a great deal and would like you to join them. As long as you accept their terms.
Incorruptible but still funny, they really work hard. It's rare for pop stars to have such an uncompromising worldview. Rarer still for the worldview in question to make sense. A-
Tougher Than Leather
Profile, 1988 [BUY]
The kind of formal intensity these guys specialize in is simply too great a trick to sustain for an extended period of time, so it's no surprise that on this album they suddenly run out of things to say. Old-school rappers have always accused them of expedient crossover, and on this record, marked by commercial aspirations that get less and less charming the more they succeed, those suspicions are confirmed.
Though they still rhyme spectacularly, they've started fussing over technique. After five years of changing the game for the better, the Beastie Boys have stolen their guitars, Public Enemy has one-upped them with political rhetoric, and the kings are a little worried their sound no longer belongs in the modern world. So here they make some minor adjustments to their sonic attack so as to pander to a larger audience for once, a rock audience. The rappers are now using microphone effects; the beats are coated in electronic polish. As far as egotism goes, always a crucial factor with this band, they've been slicked up enough to avoid any semblance of being principled. In short, they're a couple steps closer to the pop-rock smugness previously dispelled by their strong work ethic.
“Run's House” and the rest of the singles are highlights, which is to be expected on an album as pro forma as this. The rest is great product, but nothing more. B
Back From Hell
Profile, 1990 [BUY]
Musically, this is a departure from the smarmy minimalism of Tougher Than Leather, but like the previous album, they're mindlessly following a trend. Although they could never wholeheartedly buy into the gangsta ethos, here they come as close as they can without sacrificing their youth culture heritage, which in a way is worse, as it implies they've taken up the deceitful opportunism they used to be too good for.
I mean, really. This is 1990. Dozens of rappers are out there fucking da police, playing the pimp game, and telling freaky tales, and what are the genre's three honest moralists doing? Shooting each other over cocaine. Even if you can tolerate N.W.A.-style hostility, an attitude whose severity they never match, it's hard to hear this record as anything but a pointless, depressing attempt at going ghetto. Cluttered with extraneous background noises that never quite mesh with each other, the layers of murk splattered all over the synthesizer-swing are almost as dull as their violent tales of breaking the law, which play out like a bad action movie, cop sirens and all. This new style is marked by a pervasive loss of principle that removes the edge regardless of how often they claim street cred.
If this is supposed to be some sort of social statement, it trivializes a subject these guys, of all people, should know to take seriously. Keeping up with the times has knocked them off their game. C+
Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983–1991
Profile, 1991 [BUY]
Released right in the middle of their career, this compilation cashes in on the eight years they've been around rather than making a definitive statement. It's a decent illustration of their hallmarks and idiosyncrasies, with some dynamite material on it.
This includes all of their great songs, as well as some really good ones. Though each one steamrollers you in its own distinct way, they all belong to a unique sound that, whether you love the guitar shredding or the drumshots or the heavy vocal attack, is about power first and foremost. The sheer physicality of the music is a force to be reckoned with. But the songs are sequenced in no particularly compelling order, which does too make a difference. It sounds like a list of singles, not the great album you'd expect to cohere, and anyway, there's no way these guys could ever be a single band – if only for their lower-middle-class authenticity, their style is opposed to what's intrinsically a commercial artform. The end result is considerably shallower than individual tracks would imply.
You don't get a good sense of their focused energy or even their musical dependability here. Still, this is an album that includes “It's Like That,” “Rock Box,”“Sucker MCs,” “King of Rock,” “It's Tricky,” “You Be Illin,” “Walk This Way,” “My Adidas,” and “Run's House,” so I should probably shut up and enjoy the thing. B+
Down With the King
Profile, 1993 [BUY]
Though I'm glad they've ditched the ghetto posing of Back From Hell, they're still creatively confused: ever since the ‘90s started, they've been mortally afraid of becoming irrelevant. Commercially, this is a comeback, as “Down With the King” is their best song since “Run's House,” if not “It's Tricky.” But it's also an explicit attempt to show the world that they haven't lost their puritanical ideals. It winds up way too puritanical.
Demonstrating their hard edge yet again, they've bulked up the music as they haven't for years. The rhymes are entertaining even by their standards, and they're careful about who does the guest verses. But with the exception of the awesome title single, this album is just a bunch of beats, and austere ones at that. No sharp one-liners, no explosive hooks, not much of anything besides percussive DJ scratching that obscures the rhythm rather than foregrounding it. Occasionally some weird jazz sample will rise above the heavy turntable dynamics, but that's it. Either Jam-Master Jay was in a sour mood when they cut the record or their discipline has devolved into a dubious asceticism. Or maybe DJ Run's new religious conversion has turned them from the best kind of moralists to the worst kind of moralists.
Unlike the last one, this is obviously a Run-DMC record, with their trademark shouting and tough musical assault. But they're just not saying anything compelling, which is what matters when we're dealing with revered elders like these guys. B-
Crown Royal
Arista, 2001 [BUY]
I have no idea why they recorded this. They've been inactive for eight years, preaching and fighting depression and whatnot. Why would they suddenly make a record that sounds nothing like them? The beats are bland, clean, sounding fresh off the production line; all they talk about is how they still matter, which just goes to show that they don't.
Though they never rock out here like they used to, the music's electronic smoothness asserts itself plenty. They've started foregrounding the hooks a little, and the Steve Miller cover is a nice throwback to “Walk This Way” and “Mary, Mary.” Even the orchestral horns, whose regal grandiosity completely opposes their artistic vision, somewhat fit the new groove. All this might add up to a good album if there were more of the kings themselves on it. Guest verses dominate: despite Nas and Method Man's respective talents, they don't make up for Mobb Depp, Kid Rock, Fat Joe, and Fred Durst. Each one proves the record a half-assed attempt at a comeback. The pioneers are suddenly fawning on any young rapper who tells them they're great, and their own personality gets crowded out. The overall effect is that of a bunch of sucker MCs blabbering about how much they love Run-DMC.
Most revealing factoid: DMC himself, apparently disillusioned with the record, shows up on only three tracks. Most of the work is left to DJ Run and the hangers-on enjoying their hospitality. Maybe now that Run's become Reverend Joseph Simmons, he's opened their house to all and sundry. B-
Greatest Hits
Arista/BMG Heritage, 2002 [BUY]
Run-DMC's second greatest hits package has even better sequencing and selection than the first. It flows from track to track more compellingly, and there's not a single clinker. With the exceptions of “Christmas In Hollis” and “Down With the King,” everything is from their first and best four albums. Since their hits were mostly where they let out their pent-up intensity, it's even sturdier than Raising Hell.
Arranging all their classic material so that every track builds on the next one, this configuration clearly and confidently demonstrates what made them great. DJ Run and Darryl Mac rapped straightforwardly, opting for a nearly matter-of-fact vocal energy. Everything was guided by the hand of Jam-Master Jay, whose less-is-more approach to the harsh, muscular beats provided the music's backbone. Compressing turntable minimalism, awesome heavy-metal riffs, and rhymes bellowed at the top of their lungs into explosive musical powerhouses, they synthesized respectable middle-class principles and street aggression, and in doing so vindicated both – an attraction for the crossover audience and hardcore ideologues alike. Because of this, they rocked harder than anyone else in hip-hop.
I once suspected them of expediency, but here it's clear their blatant ambition has paid off triumphantly. If you don't believe that having good judgment and having a powerful aesthetic are compatible, Run-DMC will blast their music at you until you do. A
According to Evan Blass a.k.a @evleaks, the Galaxy Note 6 (also known as the Note 7) will be announced “exactly two months” from now. As we're already into the second day of June, we're bound to believe that Samsung will unveil the new phablet some time by the first week of August, or the 2nd of August to be precise.
Blass has been pretty accurate with leaks before, so there's no reason to doubt this particular revelation. But we suggest you take this with a grain of salt for now until more evidence emerges. As for the features to expect from Samsung's latest Note flagship, it has been rumored that it will come with a dual-lens camera, which sounds like a bit of a stretch at the moment, but cannot be written off.
We broke the exclusive story about the Galaxy Note 6 featuring a BlackBerry Hub like feature known as Samsung Hub, so a lot will be different with this year's Note flagship. In terms of display, the Galaxy Note 6/7 should be sporting a 5.7-inch 4K or Quad HD Super AMOLED display. There's talk of a Galaxy Note 7 edge as well, though no concrete evidence has come up to support the rumors.
If you have been up-to-date with the scientific-medical news this week, you will have seen how the media have crashed to death talking about news that has crossed borders: “Alzheimer's could be contagious.” The MedCiencia team learned in the first instance through El Confidencial (whose title is the most sensationalist I've read lately). But to this great digital medium have joined others no less known as 20minutos (who has treated the news better, but not convinced). At least some have been able to focus better, such as ABC or ScienceXplora .
Today we are going to call for calm, and we will not only call things the way they are (as the term “contagious” is a dumb one in this case), but we will try to give some arguments against the same original study published recently in Prestigious journal Nature .
The controversial study on Alzheimer's and its possible transmission between humans
First, let's get into the matter. The study was the origin of the controversy by Dr. John Collinge and colleagues at University College London , who investigated by autopsies eight British patients between 36 and 51 years who died from a prion disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . This was because in 1985 30,000 individuals with growth hormones from cadavers were treated, a technique soon abandoned because of the discovery of the development of this disease, which developed in up to 6.3% of children treated with Hormones according to the country after an incubation period of between 5 and 40 years.
This transmission of prions was precisely due to the use of pituitary glands from cadavers, because they were contaminated by prions, a type of pathological protein that had not been proven to be able to transmit (and repeat, transmitted, not spread) through medical procedures such as this one case.
It was speculated on whether other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, could also be transmitted through medical or surgical procedures. And that is what the study says, that the eight bodies investigated could have received another type of pathological protein, beta-amyloid , precursor of Alzheimer's disease according to current knowledge of the disease.
Broadcaster Art Bell. *
Photo: Joe Pugliese * Nearly 20 years ago, Art Bell created the wildly popular radio program Coast to Coast AM, a wee-hour forum for weird science. We asked them why the show entertains, even encourages, the crazies.
Wired: You were hosting a political talk show before you jumped to the supernatural. What inspired the switch?
Bell: I was crushingly bored talking about politics 30 hours a week. So one day I said, "The hell with it," and I brought on John Lear, a very outspoken ufologist. The audience just went nuts! The phones lit up.
Wired: How did your bosses react?
Bell: They had heart attacks. But when the ratings came in, we were overwhelmingly number one. I was lucky because the show was on at night. There's a different breed of person awake at those hours. And the world is a quieter place, with less to distract us from esoteric thought. I think—no, I'm sure—Coast to Coast wouldn't work with a daytime audience.
Wired: Why are people so drawn to the paranormal?
Bell: The same reason we're drawn to God. The greatest question of all is whether our experience on this planet is "it" or whether there is something else. Things in the supernatural realm give support, strangely perhaps, to the things we take on faith. Like ghosts, for example—they underscore the possibility of an afterlife.
Wired: Do you believe in ghosts?
Bell: I've never seen one, so I'm skeptical. But I do believe in the paranormal, that there are things our brains just can't understand.
Wired: As you're listening to callers, how often do you think, "No f-ing way"?
Bell: Oh, all the time. But if you're into a really great tale, then it doesn't actually matter if it's true or not.
Wired: The funny thing about radio is that you never have to show any evidence.
Bell: That's right. That's why radio is "the theater of the mind."

With its unorthodox movement and timing scheme, stylized graphics, and fun take on destroying enemies, Superhot VR has been a breakout favorite since Touch launch. Today, we're excited to share a first look at the new features coming to the game in its first big update of the year.
Master New Modes
The Forever update adds hours of gameplay, thanks to multiple new play modes and challenges!
• Test your aim where only headshots take out enemies
• Race against your best score in bullet time and real-world time
• Try to complete the game without shooting
• Get hardcore with faster enemies and less reaction time
Perhaps the most insane addition is the 10-minute challenge, where you have—you guessed it—exactly 10 minutes to complete the game. It took the Superhot Team's best player two days to master the challenge when their co-workers finally found them laid out on the floor.
That's just a taste of what the update has in store.
We asked Lead Designer Cezary Skorupka what inspired the new content. Their response: “The community is awesome at this game—way better than us! We need to keep them happy, so we looked for ways to make Superhot VR even more challenging.”
Mission accomplished! Stay tuned for the Superhot VR Forever update's arrival next month.

The world lived for half a century with the constant specter of nuclear war and its potentially devastating consequences. The end of the Cold War took the potency out of this Armageddon scenario, yet the existential dangers have only multiplied.
The world lived for half a century with the constant specter of nuclear war and its potentially devastating consequences. The end of the Cold War took the potency out of this Armageddon scenario, yet the existential dangers have only multiplied.
Today the technologies that pose some of the biggest problems are not so much military as commercial. They come from biology, energy production, and the information sciences — and are the very technologies that have fueled our prodigious growth as a species. They are far more seductive than nuclear weapons, and more difficult to extricate ourselves from. The technologies we worry about today form the basis of our global civilization and are essential to our survival.
The mistake many of us make about the darker aspects of our high-tech civilization is in thinking that we have plenty of time to address them. We may, if we're lucky. But it's more likely that we have less time than we think. There may be a limited window of opportunity for preventing catastrophes such as pandemics, runaway climate change, and cyberattacks on national power grids.
Emerging diseases. The influenza pandemic of 2009 is a case in point. Because of rising prosperity and travel, the world has grown more conducive to a destructive flu virus in recent years, many public health officials believe. Most people probably remember 2009 as a time when health officials overreacted. But in truth, the 2009 virus came from nowhere, and by the time it reached the radar screens of health officials, it was already well on its way to spreading far and wide.
“H1N1 caught us all with our pants down,” says flu expert Robert G. Webster of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Before it became apparent that the virus was a mild one, health officials must have felt as if they were staring into the abyss. If the virus had been as deadly as, say, the 1918 flu virus or some more recent strains of bird flu, the result would have rivaled what the planners of the 1950s expected from a nuclear war. It would have been a “total disaster,” Webster says. “You wouldn't get the gasoline for your car, you wouldn't get the electricity for your power, you wouldn't get the medicines you need. Society as we know it would fall apart.”
Climate change. Climate is another potentially urgent risk. It's easy to think about greenhouse gases as a long-term problem, but the current rate of change in the Arctic has alarmed more and more scientists in recent years. Tim Lenton, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter in England, has looked at climate from the standpoint of tipping points — sudden changes that are not reflected in current climate models. We may already have reached a tipping point — a transition to a new state in which the Arctic is ice-free during the summer months.
Perhaps the most alarming of Lenton's tipping points is the Indian summer monsoon. Smoke from household fires, and soot from automobiles and buses in crowded cities, rises into the atmosphere and drifts out over the Indian Ocean, changing the atmospheric dynamics upon which the monsoon depends — keeping much of the sun's energy from reaching the surface, and lessening the power of storms. At the same time, the buildup of greenhouse gases — emitted mainly from developed countries in the northern hemisphere — has a very different effect on the Indian summer monsoon: It makes it stronger.
These two opposite influences make the fate of the monsoon difficult to predict and subject to instability. A small influence — a bit more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and a bit more brown haze — could have an outsize effect. The Indian monsoon, Lenton believes, could be teetering on a knife's edge, ready to change abruptly in ways that are hard to predict. What happens then? More than a billion people depend on the monsoon's rains.
Other tipping points may be in play, says Lenton. The West African monsoon is potentially near a tipping point. So are Greenland's glaciers, which hold enough water to raise sea levels by more than 20 feet; and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which has enough ice to raise sea levels by at least 10 feet. Regional tipping points could hasten the ill effects of climate change more quickly than currently projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Computer hacking. The computer industry has already made it possible for computers to handle a variety of tasks without human intervention. Autonomous computers, using techniques formerly known as artificial intelligence, have begun to exert control in virtually every sphere of our lives. Cars, for instance, can now take action to avoid collisions. To do this, a car has to make decisions: When does it take control? How much braking power should be applied, and to which wheels? And when should the car allow its reflex-challenged driver to regain control? Cars that drive themselves, currently being field tested, could hit dealer showrooms in a few years.
Autonomous computers can make our lives easier and safer, but they can also make them more dangerous. A case in point is Stuxnet, the computer worm designed by the US and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear fuel program. It is a watershed in the brief history of malware — the Jason Bourne of computer code, designed for maximum autonomy and effectiveness. Stuxnet's creators gave their program the best training possible: they stocked it with detailed technical knowledge that would come in handy for whatever situation Stuxnet could conceivably encounter. Although the software included rendezvous procedures and communication codes for reporting back to headquarters, Stuxnet was built to survive and carry out its mission even if it found itself cut off.
The uranium centrifuges that Stuxnet attacked are very similar in principle to the generators that power the US electrical grid. Both are monitored and controlled by programmable-logic computer chips. Stuxnet cleverly caused the uranium centrifuges to throw themselves off-balance, inflicting enough damage to set the Iranian nuclear industry back by 18 months or more. A similar piece of malware installed on the computers that control the generators at the base of the Grand Coulee Dam would likewise cause them to shake, rattle, and roll — and eventually explode.
If Stuxnet-like malware were to insinuate itself into a few hundred power generators in the United States and attack them all at once, the damage would be enough to cause blackouts on the East and West Coasts. With such widespread destruction, it could take many months to restore power to the grid. It seems incredible that this should be so, but the worldwide capacity to manufacture generator parts is limited. Generators generally last 30 years, sometimes 50, so normally there's little need for replacements. The main demand for generators is in China, India, and other parts of rapidly developing Asia. That's where the manufacturers are — not in the United States. Even if the United States, in crisis mode, put full diplomatic pressure on supplier nations — or launched a military invasion to take over manufacturing facilities — the capacity to ramp up production would be severely limited. Worldwide production currently amounts to only a few hundred generators per year.
The consequences of going without power for months, across a large swath of the United States, would be devastating. Backup electrical generators in hospitals and other vulnerable facilities would have to rely on fuel that would be in high demand. Diabetics would go without their insulin; heart attack victims would not have their defibrillators; and sick people would have no place to go. Businesses would run out of inventory and extra capacity. Grocery stores would run out of food, and deliveries of all sorts would virtually cease (no gasoline for trucks and airplanes, trains would be down). As we saw with the blackouts caused by Hurricane Sandy, gas stations couldn't pump gas from their tanks, and fuel-carrying trucks wouldn't be able to fill up at refueling stations. Without power, the economy would virtually cease, and if power failed over a large enough portion of the country, simply trucking in supplies from elsewhere would not be adequate to cover the needs of hundreds of millions of people. People would start to die by the thousands, then by the tens of thousands, and eventually the millions. The loss of the power grid would put nuclear plants on backup, but how many of those systems would fail, causing meltdowns, as we saw at Fukushima? The loss in human life would quickly reach, and perhaps exceed, the worst of the Cold War nuclear-exchange scenarios. After eight to 10 days, about 72 percent of all economic activity, as measured by GDP, would shut down, according to an analysis by Scott Borg, a cybersecurity expert.
These scenarios are not inevitable, of course, and perhaps they're not even likely. But they are certainly not beyond the pale. Sustaining a world of 7 billion people — on its way to nearly 10 billion by the end of the century — cannot be done without risk. Dealing with these risks is going to take every good idea we have. The first step knows what those risks are.
The threats were hollow, related to reloadable prepaid cards, but police are forced to react every time.
By Matt Skoufalos
Phone scammers looking for some quick cash have upped the ante into making threats, as two Cherry Hill pharmacies have been targeted in three days.
The most recent incident occurred at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Walgreens in the 1800 block of Route 70.
A customer called the store, demanding cash be added to a Green Dot MoneyPak card. When employees refused, they were warned that the building was surrounded by explosives.
In response, the store was evacuated, and authorities responded.
Cherry Hill police barricaded entrances to the parking lot on Haddonfield Road and Route 70, while the K-9 unit of the Camden County Sheriff's Department sniffed for bombs. A news helicopter circled low over the area for some 30 minutes.
Cherry Hill Lieutenant Amy Winters said that a similar incident occurred at 5:40 p.m. on Sunday at the CVS in the 600 block of North Kings Highway. No one was harmed in either instances, but police resources were engaged in each.
“We have to take it seriously,” Winters said. “We have to investigate.”
Detectives are conducting an ongoing investigation into the identity of the callers. Winters said police do not know whether the two cases are related.
‘If anyone asks for your number, it's a scam'
Prepaid cards are the latest mechanism in a number of scams, the Better Business Bureau reports, at least in part because of their broad acceptance.
Walgreens advertises its cards as being available for a variety of uses, including shopping, bill paying, transferring money, getting cash at an ATM, and receiving direct deposits of payroll and government benefits.
A Green Dot MoneyPak can only be used to reload a Green Dot prepaid debit card, add cash to a PayPal account, or make cash payments where accepted, said a company spokesperson.
Some 4.7 million cardholders have a Green Dot card, which is linked to an FDIC-insured bank account.
“These prepaid debit cards are very important financial tools for consumers that can't get or don't want traditional bank checking accounts or credit cards,” the spokesperson said.
“If anyone asks for your MoneyPak number, it's a scam.”

Musa velutina, the hairy banana[1] or pink banana, is a species of seeded banana. These plants are originally from Assam and the eastern Himalayas.[2] They are also cultivated in greenhouses and places like Australia.[citation needed] Its fruits are 3 in (8 cm) long, pink, and fuzzy. They are borne on erect flower stalks with a pink inflorescence. Musa velutina flowers at a young age, doing so within a year. The fruits peel back when ripe. It is often grown as an ornamental plant, but has soft, sweet flesh that can be eaten. The seeds are quite hard and can chip a tooth. To sow, first soak the seeds in warm water for 24 hours. They should be planted in fine compost and kept at a constant temperature of 20°-24 °C with full natural light. They may take up to 6 months to germinate. Plants may be placed outside during warmer months but should be taken in to a conservatory or greenhouse and protected in winter.[citation needed]

I talked about it all the time. People would say "You're too hard on HR and staffing departments. You're too hard on recruiters. Job-seekers have to understand that there are a lot of them, and not nearly as many of us!"
Now the crisis in recruiting is out in the open. Now it is well understood and acknowledged that most if not all of the traditional recruiting process is broken -- and bad for employers, their customers and their shareholders.
Watch on Forbes:
The traditional recruiting process drives the best candidates away.

1. Job openings are designed based on the Essential Requirements needed for the job (many of which are untested, arbitrary and not even close to Essential) rather than on the work itself. This happens because managers want more highly-credentialed people on their teams to vault them up in status -- or because HR has already defined every job in the organization and assigned Essential Requirements to it. Talk about the tail wagging the dog! Maintaining the bureaucratic system becomes more important than hiring a smart and capable person to do the work.
2. Job ads are written in a terse, unfriendly and talent-repelling language that signals job-seekers "Don't even think about wasting our time if you don't have every qualification listed here!" HR and Staffing departments tend to know little or nothing about marketing. Many do not understand that their job is a sales and marketing job. No one pays Staffing people to screen out resumes, a task that has no business value. They are paid to hire great people, fast!

3. The Applicant Tracking systems that use keyword-searching algorithms to screen resumes are ancient technology deployed in a pointless, slow and expensive way. We will never hire great people by sifting keywords. We have had twenty years or more to realize this and act on that knowledge. Luckily, the best employers are beginning to experiment with non-ATS recruiting using talent pools, recruiting pipelines and social networks.
4. We do not force our prospective customers to fill out fields in an endless 'customer application' form, but we do require job-seekers to fill out creaky, insulting online application forms. We send them the clear message "If you want to work for us, start begging." We expect job-seekers to take tests for us, complete questionnaires and tolerate unexplained delays on our end. We make it clear: "You are just another job-seeker, so sit down and be quiet."
5. The interview process itself is broken. From every other area of our lives we know that having a human conversation is the best way to get to know someone. In a flowing conversation, we will see how a person's mind works, but many interviewers cannot put down their nineteen-fifties-era interview script and talk to a job-seeker the way humans do. They don't have the conversational skills for that -- nor the discernment to simultaneously vet and woo job-seekers the way modern recruiting requires. In that case, why are they interviewing people in the first place?

6. We treat the subject of salary as something that a job-seeker must earn the right to discuss. Why doesn't every job ad clearly state the salary range for the position? It's because employers won't give up the negotiating advantage that an undisclosed starting salary range gives them.
7. We signal to job-seekers that if they want to work for us, they must relinquish personal information starting at the beginning of the application process. We demand their past and current salary details as though that information had anything to do with the hiring decision -- but it doesn't. Then we are surprised when qualified and eager job applicants don't show up in droves.
8. We do not track or worry about the number of talented candidates who stop by our website to learn about career opportunities and maybe even start an application -- but then run away in horror and disgust. E-commerce marketers stress and obsess about shopping cart abandonment. When someone is considering buying from our company, we hate to see them leave the store without buying anything. When it comes to job applicants, though, we say "It should be hard to get a job with our company. Anybody who leaves the process is not someone we would have wanted, anyway." This is a sign of crushing fear -- right out in the open!
9. We design and execute the recruiting process not to hire the most capable or creative person but the most docile and pliable one. Then we complain that we don't get the out-of-the-box thinking our organizations need. If you weed out independent thinkers in your recruiting process, you don't get to complain when you don't see or hear them at staff meetings.

10. At every stage of recruiting, we send the clear message "We are the employer, and we are big. You are the job applicant, and you are small. We have the big decision to make -- which one of you job applicants is good enough for us." This mindset kills us on the recruiting front every day. It kills our ability to compete.
Broken recruiting is damaging to employers -- so why do they hang onto the failed systems that cause them so much grief?
They do it because they put a lot of time and money into the current process over the past two decades, and they don't want to change things now.
They do it because the pain their broken recruiting apparatus causes them is "soft" pain. It's human pain, and they cannot put a dollar figure next to it.
They do it because the nature of bureaucracy is to reinforce itself against outsiders and new ideas. Leaders around the world find it easier to complain about "talent shortages" than to look at their own accountability for designing jobs that living humans can fill, and then finding those people.
It's because it is easier to keep doing things -- even pointless and destructive ones -- that you have been doing forever than to stop and look.
That's why job-seekers get treated like dirt on the job-search trail.

The good news is that they don't have to settle for bad treatment. There is no clearer sign of a company's culture and the value they place on people than the signs you'll get in the hiring pipeline.
If they don't show you the love when they're trying to recruit you, they never will!
Run away and find another employer who understands that only humans and their mighty brains and hearts have ever powered any great adventure.
U.S. Added 156,000 Jobs In December; Hourly Wages Rose 10 Cents

The U.S. added 156,000 jobs last month and hourly wages rose by 10 cents, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The unemployment rate was little changed; it ticked up slightly to 4.7 percent, compared to November's 4.6 percent.
Economists had been watching closely to see if the jobs report reflected a rise in wages.
The 10-cent increase pushed average hourly earnings to $26; in November, they had dipped slightly, by 2 cents. Over the course of the year as a whole, average hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent, the BLS says.
The labor force participation rate changed little, both in December and over the course of the year as a whole.
In addition to the 156,000 new jobs in December, job growth in November was revised up significantly — to 204,000 from 178,000. The October report was revised downward, to 135,000 from 142,000, but the overall change for the two months was still positive: 19,000 more jobs than previously reported.
For the year overall, the U.S. added 2.2 million jobs — an average of 183,333 jobs per month.
"Job growth last year slowed from its pace in 2015, when growth averaged nearly 230,000 [per month]," NPR's Yuki Noguchi tells our Newscast unit. "Part of the drop-off in hiring is coming from smaller firms, which hired the majority of workers during the economic recovery. Partly it is also that producers of goods — manufacturers and miners — have seen a continued contraction in their industries."
Manufacturing jobs actually edged up slightly in December, their first increase in months, but remained down by 63,000 compared to last January.
The industries that saw noteworthy job gains in 2016 include the health care sector, social assistance, professional services and food services.
Friday's jobs report was the last report of Barack Obama's presidency. That has put some economists in a reflective mood, looking back on the first report under Obama.
On Twitter, FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman notes that the February 2009 report showed 598,000 jobs lost in a month — which was later revised to 791,000.
With the latest jobs report, the U.S. has now seen 75 straight months of job growth, which The Washington Post reports is the most extended streak of job growth since 1939.

See you in the Eastern Reach!
The bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) is in freefall after Chinese bitcoin exchange ViaBTC became the second exchange to shut down domestic trading amid news more announcements are forthcoming.
As per CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin price has lost more than 20% of its value in the last 24 hours.
Week-on-week, the world's largest cryptocurrency is down 29%. On a monthly basis, BTC has lost 28%. Perhaps even more notably, the price of bitcoin has shed almost $1,000 over the last 48 hours.
For a time, it appeared that the oversold intraday technical conditions could yield a relief rally to $3,700 levels. However, the bulls continued to exit the market on fears other exchanges would close down their Chinese desks.
More announcements are now only likely to amplify fears and trigger further selling.
USD strength to complicate matters
When discussing cryptocurrencies, the other side of the story, i.e. the US dollar, is often ignored.
While the record rally to $5,000 levels was more due to bullish bitcoin stories (SegWit activation, heightened institutional interest), the fact that the greenback was being sold across the board isn't a mere coincidence.
Dollar Index and BTC/USD Comparison chart
The chart above shows the Dollar Index topped out in early January, around the time that bitcoin began its record rally in mid January.
By no means are we trying to suggest that bitcoin rally was the result of USD weakness, but the chart does suggest that the broad based USD sell-off could have amplified the bitcoin rally.
Forex market experts are calling for an interim bottom in the dollar index as the China reflation story is gathering pace again. The US also reported a higher inflation number on Thursday, which means the Fed could maintain its gradual pace of policy tightening.
Again, a strong US dollar does not mean bitcoin would continue to fall. However, it would certainly amplify the bearish move or make it difficult for the digital currency to revisit its yearly high of $5,000
Is there a scope for recovery in bitcoin?
Technical studies say the sell-off is overdone and bitcoin is poised for a minor relief rally.
Daily chart
As seen on the chart above, both RSI and Stochastics are oversold [under 30.00], which means an extended price move to the downside. When price reaches these extreme levels [under 30.00], a reversal is possible.
4-hour chart
Both RSI and Stochastics are extremely oversold. A minor recovery could confirm a bullish divergence, which occurs when price forms lower lows, while the oscillator (in this case RSI and Stochastics) forms higher lows.
The bullish divergence would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle hits fresh lows, but ends on a positive note.
A minor technical correction could follow, although fresh offers could hit bitcoin around the falling trend line 1.
Key levels to watch
Weekly chart
$3,027 – 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July low to September high
$3,000 – June high
$2,855 – 50% Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low – high
$2,350 – support of the trend line sloping higher from the March low and the July low
View
The oversold nature of the daily indicators suggests potential for a corrective rally to $3,300-$3,400
The sell-off could be easily extended to $2,350 if Chinese exchanges continue to shut down BTC trading desks.
A rally back to $5,000 would be easier said than done as the US dollar seems to have found a footing. Seasonality study shows, the greenback is usually strong in the third and fourth quarter.

BISMARCK – Fargo business person Doug Burgum has raised more than $964,000 for their gubernatorial campaign since entering the race in mid-January, including a $100,000 gift this week from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, campaign finance disclosures show. Burgum filed their pre-primary statement on Thursday, a day before the deadline, reporting $842,384 in contributions, with $31,202 coming in gifts of $200 or less. The statement, which covers the period from Jan. 1 to May 5, listed $175,475 in cash on hand.
More Doug Burgum coverage
In the past week, Burgum also received $100,000 from Gates and $22,150 in additional contributions, for a grand total of $964,534. Burgum led Great Plains Software in Fargo through its $1.1 billion sale to Microsoft in 2001, staying on as a Microsoft executive until 2007.
They have mounted an intense campaign to defeat the GOP's endorsed candidate, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, in the June 14 primary. Oilfield consultant Paul Sorum also is running as a Republican after skipping the party's endorsing convention in April.
Stenehjem and Sorum hadn't filed their pre-primary statement as of 7 p.m. Thursday, nor had Democrat Marvin Nelson, a state representative from Rolla. Libertarian candidate Marty Riske of Fargo reported $100 in contributions.
Stenehjem, who began accepting contributions for their gubernatorial bid in October, reported contributions of more than $244,000 last year and had more than $239,000 on hand at the end of the year. They also had $150,538 in carryover from their attorney general campaign account, which could be used for the governor's race.
“John Wick: Chapter 2” picks up shortly after the events of the first film, as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) tries to return to a quiet life of retirement with their new dog. However, they are visited by Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) who demands that they assassinate their sister to satisfy a blood oath. After Wick reluctantly completes this task, D'Antonio double crosses them and sets up a contract of $7 million for their death. Wick then goes on a manhunt to kill D'Antonio and anyone who gets in theirs way.
The first film was not only one of 2014's biggest surprises, it also introduced audiences to a unique underground society of assassins and mobsters with a universal code of rules. This is one area that the sequel took advantage of, by further exploring the rules of this international society. The film is able to explore this world in a way that understands that the audience might find the world ridiculous, so the film has enough moments of humor for writer Derek Kolstad and director Chad Stahelski to have fun.
Stahelski, a former stunt coordinator, has a great eye for action scenes. They film their sequences in a way that allows the audience to appreciate the time and effort that went into prep work of the set pieces. The camerawork and editing never becomes disorienting and is easy to follow. The climactic scene involving a mirror maze is one of the most impressive action scenes in recent memory.
Stahelski never forgets that there's still a story that needs to be told alongside the flying bullets. Their choice of bright neon-colored party scenes and luxurious lounges and hotel rooms adds a nice visual flair that sets it apart from bland colored mega blockbusters like “The Expendables” franchise.
Keanu Reeves, at the age of 52, still manages to amaze viewers with their commitment to do as much of their own stunts on camera. Their fighting choreography and gunplay skills are more brutal this time around, as the character of Wick is frustrated that he's stuck in a world he's so desperate to escape. Their performance as Wick is easily one of their best.
One piece of advice that must be given is that viewers might want to bring some earplugs as the film can get ear-shatteringly loud during action scenes. While guns are obviously extremely loud in real life, there's no reason that the film should have to be so loud that the audience's ears will be ringing for the next couple of weeks.
“John Wick: Chapter 2” does what a great action sequel should do: crank up the action in a way that fits what was previously established and expand the characters and the world of the narrative. If the second film can live up to the charm of the first film, then it's to be expected that the third installment shall be just as good.
MADISON — Wisconsin's unemployment rate has dropped to 7.3 percent for September.
That is down from 7.5 percent in August.
The state Department of Workforce Development reported the latest figures on Thursday.
The state added 1,500 private sector jobs for the month, based on the survey of roughly 3.5 percent of Wisconsin businesses. For the year, the state has added 4,100 private sector jobs.
Gov. Scott Walker promised to add 250,000 private sector jobs by 2015. Since they took office in January 2011 the state has added about 32,000 private sector jobs.
The numbers reported Thursday are subject to significant revision month to month. Walker's administration has downplayed the significance of the numbers in favor of quarterly data based on a census of nearly all of the state's businesses.
Two developments are focusing fresh attention on battleground Virginia's role in the presidential race.
First, former U.S. Sen. John W. Warner, the respected elder statesman of the Virginia Republican Party, bolted their party to endorse Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, calling them qualified to be commander in chief, unlike GOP nominee Donald Trump.
This is the second time that Mr. Warner, 89, has snubbed a GOP nominee. The first was endorsement of current U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, no relation. Their action symbolizes the party's split over the selection of the controversial Mr. Trump.
Mr. Warner joins an array of seasoned Republicans with experience in national security and the military who have abandoned Mr. Trump.
Meanwhile, 68 miles west of Richmond, Longwood University in Farmville is preparing for next week's debate between the two major party candidates for vice president, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.
The televised debate is scheduled to take place from 9 to 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 4.
Some testers are always leaders. Others see a project challenge that demands positive action and step into a leadership void because somebody has to. You may never seek or be given a formal role as a test leader, and yet be a trusted leader in the minds of your co-workers and managers. What is tested leadership? What are the specific personal qualities and skills that distinguish a true leader in testing?
This interactive workshop shares some experiences and attempt to answer those questions. Together, we'll explore the characteristics of a test leader and learn how to begin developing a set of positive heuristics that can help us become more effective leaders in our daily work.

The New York State Assembly approved legislation Tuesday that would finally add gender identity and gender expression to the state's non-discrimination law.
It is the seventh time the measure has passed in the Assembly, but has yet to be approved by the New York Senate, according to Assembly Member Richard N. Gottfried, sponsor of the bill.
"This is a long overdue protection of human rights," Gottfried said in a statement. "Every year my colleagues and I speak for transgender human rights and equal protection under the law — and every year, opponents spin imaginary horror stories, none of which have anything to do with this bill. Local GENDA laws have been on the books in large parts of the state for years, and no one has pointed to any of these hypothetical events actually happening. It's time to protect all New Yorkers' right to fair housing and employment."
Assembly members voted 78-44 to pass the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, or GENDA, which would strengthen the state's human rights law to prohibit discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, public accommodations, and education because of a person's gender identity or expression. It would also expand the state's hate crimes law to include crimes against transgender people.
The bill will now be referred to the New York Senate Investigations and Government Operations Committee. Gottfried, along with LGBT advocates and other proponents of the bill, called on the Assembly to act and stand with the Assembly "for equality."
"We are thrilled that this passed through the Assembly with bipartisan support for the seventh time," Allison Steinberg, director of communication at Empire State Pride Agenda, told BuzzFeed. "It is now overdue for the New York Senate to pass this and make it law."
Current state law provides such protections on the basis of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, or marital status, but there are no existing protections for transgender people.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has previously said they would sign the legislation into law, according to the Empire State Pride Agenda.
Just last week, Cuomo announced that state officials will make it easier for transgender people to correct the gender markers on their birth certificates.
