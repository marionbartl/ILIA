Oakland, California's Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (MADE) has announced its latest exhibit, called "Women in Game Development." The exhibit, which aims to increase awareness of women's contributions to gaming by celebrating their works, will open this coming Sunday, April 12.
"Since the days of Atari, women have made some of the most influential and important games, despite the perception that only 'men make video games,'" the museum writes on its website.
MADE calls "Women in Gaming" a playable exhibit, in that a range of games worked on by female developers such as Roberta Williams and Amy Hennig, among others, will be available to play.
The full list of women being featured in the exhibit and their games are listed below.
MADE, which was originally funded through a successful $20,000 Kickstarter campaign, is run by volunteers. It is located at 610 16th St. Suite 230, Oakland, CA. For more on the Women in Gaming exhibit and MADE itself, check out the museum's website.

Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control.
Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children.
Obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.
Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage is allowed, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.
Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.
Gay marriage should be decided by people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.
Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.
Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.
Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.
Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.
Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to things like cars or longer life-spans.
Getty Northern Irish will still be able to become EU citizens
The latest position paper, released yesterday, has placed the protection of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement as one of four top priorities regarding Northern Ireland. Under the agreement, people in Northern Ireland are allowed to choose either or both British and Irish citizenship. In the Government's position paper on Northern Ireland, it states: “As long as Ireland remains a member of the EU, Irish citizenship also confers EU citizenship, with all the rights that go with this. “This is as true for the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens — or who hold both British and Irish citizenship — as it is for Irish citizens in Ireland.”
As long as Ireland remains a member of the EU, Irish citizenship also confers EU citizenship UK position paper
The European Commission had previously demanded those living in Northern Ireland continue to have EU rights after Brexit. By allowing Northern Irish people to continue to be able to obtain Irish - and therefore EU - citizenship after Brexit, the issue of the border between the two countries will be made easier for both the EU and the UK. Britain's proposal to keep the Good Friday Agreement is sure to anger Scotland where the majority of the electorate voted to stay in the EU. Since the referendum last June Scottish politicians, especially First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, have been fighting to remain in the bloc while the rest of the UK leaves.

The question of residency and work rights for EU citizens who are not Irish will be addressed later in the Brexit negotiations, the British Government said. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK also wanted to protect the Common Travel Area for those travelling between the two Irelands. They said the UK did not want any physical infrastructure on the border, with Whitehall confirming this means no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition systems.
When it comes to the movement of goods across the border, the paper proposed a customs partnership with the EU so there would be no tariff implications on the border at all. If, as many expect, a less fulsome agreement is reached, the Government still wants 80 per cent of Irish businesses to avoid tariffs. It proposes small to medium-sized operations which criss-cross the border as part of localising daily trade should continue to do so unfettered.
Getty Irish leader Leo Varadkar welcomed the proposal

Yesterday, former Scientology spokesperson Mike Rinder posted a statement about Scientology's homophobia which not only collected founder L. Ron Hubbard's statements about homosexuality's “perversion” but also explained, from their personal experience, how Rinder observed the organization's baked-in hate for gays and lesbians.
It was a remarkable personal essay and we highly recommend that you read it and bookmark it for whenever Scientology's attitudes about homosexuality come up in future news stories. We're thinking of a recent attempt by Scientology celebrity Laura Prepon to claim that the situation was otherwise.
We've also written about Scientology's homophobia. One of the more intriguing stories we got to look into while we were at the Village Voice described the struggles of a man named Keith Relkin. In that 2011 piece, we explained that Relkin, who lived in West Hollywood, had taken on the role as the church's token gay guy, and tried to convince the press that Scientology was actually gay-friendly. Privately, however, they complained to friends that the church undermined them at every turn, had them spy on other people in the film business, and denied them any chance to move up to the courses offered only in Clearwater, Florida because of their orientation.
Also, we got to know the singular Derek Bloch while we were at the Voice. We were struck by what an intelligent young man they are, and what a good writer. But he'd committed the crime of writing anonymously at a web forum about how he'd failed out of Scientology's “Sea Org” because they were gay. Scientology's spy wing then figured out who was behind their anonymous online writing, confronted their parents about it, and they then disconnected from him.
As we explained in those stories, and as Rinder explains in even better detail, L. Ron Hubbard classified homosexuals as “1.1” on their “tone scale” of emotion, which equates to “covert hostility.” Auditing in Scientology is supposed to move you higher on that scale, into better emotional states. So, as a consequence, Scientology is a “cure” for homosexuality as gay members are expected to audit their way out of their covert hostility and into a happier, non-gay state. And since Hubbard died in 1986 and their writings are set in stone (or “source”) to Scientologists, the organization can't change its outdated ideas about gays and lesbians.
Sunny Pereira reminded us that they experienced a telling example of this thinking. We met them in Dallas during our book tour, but they were already well known to us because of their appearance in the 2010 Tampa Bay Times story, “No Kids Allowed.” Pereira was one of three women — the other two were Claire Headley and Laura DeCrescenzo — who came forward about Scientology forcing young women in the Sea Org to have abortions in order to enforce the Sea Org's “no children” policy.
Today, Pereira is happily married with children. But they told us that they still had the documents describing why they got kicked out of the Sea Org in 2004: “I kissed a girl,” they said.
The documents they gave us refer only to “Out-2D with a staff member.” That's Scientology's jargon for “out-ethics” on the “second dynamic,” which is code for illicit sexual activity (but could be anything from flirting to outright sexual intercourse). On page 2, however, there's a slip when the document refers to Sunny failing to report the staff member and refers to “her.”
And Pereira isn't the only one who was kicked out of the Sea Org for a same-sex kiss. Nora Crest has talked about how they also ended up getting punished and ultimately left the Sea Org because they had kissed another woman.
We told Nora that we were going to put together this piece, reacting to Rinder's post, and asked if they wanted to say something about Scientology's homophobia.
Well, they did a lot more than that. They quickly put together a video, and we were stunned when we saw it. Brace yourself, because this is one for the ages. We think Nora is incredibly brave for making it, and we'll let you find out what they reveal in it as they talk about how Scientology demonizes and punishes gay people.
Laura Prepon, we dare you to watch it.

Since its first steps in the 1970s, the B.C. film industry has grown so much that it stands alongside traditional resource sectors like forestry and mining when it comes to economic benefits
In January 2015, when Postmedia closed its Kennedy Heights printing plant in Surrey, which produced the Vancouver Sun and The Province, the cost-cutting measure was a blatant sign of the troubles facing the newspaper industry. Enter Skydance Media, the producer of Star Trek and Mission: Impossible, which moved into the 220,000-square-foot facility and opened Skydance Studios this past September.
Film studios have been taking over industrial spaces since the late 1970s, when crews filmed in unused parts of the closed-up Dominion Bridge steel plant in Burnaby. By 1979, when Hollywood began to decentralize production and the exchange rate favoured Canadian locations, B.C. hit a “breakthrough,” according to Hollywood North author Mike Gasher. That year, the province was the backdrop for 16 films that created $50 million in direct spending. Just a few years later, B.C. was dubbed Hollywood North when productions starring some of Tinseltown's biggest names, such as Sylvester Stallone and Mariel Hemingway, set up camp.
Today B.C.'s creative sector, which includes film, television, interactive media, music, magazine and book publishing, generates $4 billion in annual GDP and supports 85,000 jobs. CreativeBC has declared that the industry is now shoulder-to-shoulder with other industrial sectors such as mining, agriculture and forestry.
The new Surrey studio is expected to generate 400 jobs and inject $100 million into the local economy. As for Skydance Media, the facility will play a key role in the company's plans for new film and television production, CEO David Ellison said in a statement: “We are incredibly excited about putting down new roots in Surrey and becoming a part of the community's future growth.”
This story has been corrected to acknowledge that B.C.'s entire creative sector, not the film industry alone, generates $4 billion in annual GDP and supports 85,000 jobs.
1987
The creation of Bridge Studios in the former Dominion Bridge plant was the result of lobbying efforts by film unions, guilds and suppliers. Under pressure, the B.C. government agreed to renovate the site to create a permanent studio facility. Larco Investments bought the property from the province in 2007 for $40 million.

Formerly Lions Gate Studios, North Shore Studios rebranded after Bosa Development Corp. bought it in 2006. Industry veterans credit the original founder, the late U.S. writer and producer Stephen J. Cannell, for transforming B.C. into a popular production centre. “He was the first to prove that a quality product could be made here,” says Vancouver producer Joseph Finn. “When they opened North Shore Studios in 1989, it triggered a domino effect: their productions such as 21 Jump Street and Wiseguy were major prime time successes.” (BCBusiness)

Northstar International Studios was bought and rebranded as Vancouver Film Studios by the McLean Group of Companies. In June 2016, VFS launched its own production company, 50° North Productions, with Los Angeles-based EveryWhere Studios.

Branded as studios “built for producers by producers,” the Canadian Motion Picture Park was born out of necessity, when owner and former producer Alec Fatalevich ran into difficult times financially as a producer. The studio's big break came with the production of I, Robot, Fatalevich says. “That movie gave us an incredible push with credibility… after that, we figured we did something right, said, ‘Let's look at the bigger picture,' and I moved from being a producer to a developer.” (Burnaby Now)

Formerly concentrated near Vancouver, film production facilities now extend as far as the Ridge Studios in Maple Ridge. Owner and manager John Wittmayer says the three studios are popular among lower-budget television shows and movies broadcast on the Hallmark Channel, UPtv and the Lifetime channel. Productions in Maple Ridge receive an additional six per cent regional tax incentive for Canadian and foreign productions on top of the province's 28 per cent tax credit.

Crews looking to film in Metro Vancouver studios will have one more option to consider with the recent opening of Surrey's Skydance Studios, owned by parent company Skydance Media. The studio is expected to create 400 jobs and contribute $100 million to the nearby economy.

Over the course of that hour, as Rob Dorzek held their unconscious girlfriend in their arms, the dispatcher instructed them to start a signal fire that accidentally spread in the dry conditions, igniting the boat and killing their friend, Michael Kritz, as Dorzek attempted to stanch the flames.
The sole survivor of a boat crash on Sudbury's Lake Wanapitei phoned 911 to get help for themselves and their three friends but instead wound up enduring an hour-long rescue effort on the line with a dispatcher who struggled to figure out their location despite being sent a map that pinpointed it through GPS.
Nickel Belt MPP France Gélinas, who represents that area of Sudbury, said the accident has left a lot of people feeling they cannot count on 911 for help. “We need to reassure people that, no matter where you live, when you dial 911 rescue will come.”
An internal report from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care documents a timeline rife with confusion and delays, noting there were “communication issues” between the branches of emergency response throughout the call.
The events chronicled in an internal government report obtained by the Star and recounted by family members, a survivor and officials have raised startling questions about the effectiveness of the response to the boat accident on June 30, 2013, that ultimately claimed the lives of three young adults.
“This would obviously indicate serious flaws with the emergency response system in our area,” said Kritz. “We would therefore suggest that the public should be fully informed of the circumstances of the deaths in this case in order to make known, and thereby attempt to correct, the shortfalls of our current emergency services system.”
“We believe that if emergency services had not been contacted that night, it is very likely that there would have been more survivors of this accident, since according to the coroner's report ‘but for the fire' Michael ‘would most likely have survived,' ” said Toni Kritz, Michael's sister.
Stephanie Bertrand, 25, and Matthew Humeniuk, 33, died as a result of injuries from the accident. Kritz, 34, was killed when the small signal fire lit by Dorzek at the 911 dispatcher's suggestion set nearby underbrush aflame and eventually reached the boat.
The families of the dead are calling for an inquest to determine what was done wrong — a request that the provincial coroner's office is still deliberating. Dr. David Eden, the regional coroner for Sudbury, is expected to release a decision this week on whether they will call an inquest.
In an interview with the Star, Dorzek said that within minutes of their first call they sent the dispatcher a picture from their phone of a map that clearly showed their location near the town of Skead, where a rescue boat was stationed. Yet rescue crews would not reach them for another hour.
Dorzek placed their first call to 911 at 12:30 a.m., according to the ministry report's timeline. The rescue boat did not leave until 1:30 a.m. and was able to locate the accident scene in eight minutes.
The Health Ministry report obtained by the Star includes recommendations such as enhanced training for dispatchers, more scripted questions to help them determine the location of a caller and a suggestion that local dispatch centres develop search-and-rescue plans with local agencies. The internal report commends the work of the dispatchers who handled the call.
“To anyone involved, even the volunteer firefighters who would have been involved, you show it to any one of them and just because they're from that area, they know where that accident was, just from that blue dot on a big map,” said Dorzek, 29.
The four people were on their way to a party, having spent the evening together with drinks on one of the islands in the lake. Dorzek remembers seeing both Humeniuk and Kritz standing, looking over the windscreen before the boat struck a small island, less than 10 minutes from Tony's Marina — a facility owned by Kritz's family where the rescue boat was stationed. The pair were lifelong boaters.
“Everyone says the only reason they hit that thing they hit was because it was so dark. They were just a few feet more to one side than they should have been,” said Dorzek.
The coroner's autopsy of the bodies found that Humeniuk, the driver of the boat, had a blood-alcohol level that “would be expected to cause substantial impairment and which significantly exceeded legal limits for operation of a boat.” Dorzek said they disagreed with the finding and that they did not feel unsafe getting in the boat prior to the accident.
Dorzek was knocked unconscious when the boat struck land. They came to inside the small front cabin. They tried to pull their girlfriend, Bertrand, out through a hole in the damaged boat. They were in frequent contact with the 911 call centre, located in downtown Sudbury, during the hour-long rescue effort, though the signal on their cellphone sometimes cut out.
The dispatcher immediately scrambled two ambulances on land, according to the report, but Rob Hyndman, president of the Sudbury Professional Firefighters Association, told the Star that the fire crew needed to operate the rescue boat did not learn about the emergency from the dispatcher but through a chance encounter.
The force's platoon chief that night, Terry Larocque, was at a burning house in another part of the municipality around 12:50 a.m. An EMS worker watching fire remarked to Larocque that they must be having a busy night and mentioned the accident on Lake Wanapitei. Larocque appeared not have heard about the accident through regular channels.
“(Larocque) is basically the senior officer responsible for the fire department on-shift,” said Hyndman. “He would have access to all the information of all the calls that are going on all throughout the city. Under the normal circumstances they would have had that information coming through their radio.”
Larocque immediately rallied the volunteer firefighters in Skead, said Hyndman.
Bob Humeniuk, Matt's father, was among them but stayed on shore while others went out on the boat, Dorzek said.
The ministry report shows firefighters got to the rescue boat at 1 a.m. but were told by dispatchers not to leave until met by the paramedics. It took the paramedics another 20 minutes to find the rescue boat, according to the report. According to its chronology, the paramedics, despite being in the area since Dorzek's call came in, had difficulty locating the marina.
“There were communication issues throughout the call between the allied agencies, such as fire communications not confirming that a fire boat was available in Skead and not providing information as to its location. When fire communications told (a dispatcher) at approximately 00:59 hours that the firefighters are at the boat launch, fire communications did not say where the boat was located and (the dispatcher) did not ask,” the report says.
Meanwhile, the dispatcher instructed Dorzek to start a signal fire on the island. They were still holding onto their girlfriend, Bertrand, who they had been trying to free from the boat.
“When (the dispatcher) demanded that I start the fire, I told them I can't because it means I have to let go of Stephanie,” said Dorzek. “She insisted that was the only way we're going to get help. That's what they said. So I had to go do it.”
They took a cushion from the boat to the other shore of the small island and set it on fire. For a time the fire burned small and bright but then it spread to the underbrush. Dorzek tried to fight it back with a wet T-shirt but the flames reached the boat and the fibreglass hull quickly went up. They managed to pull Bertrand free, but Humeniuk and Kritz were still inside.
“That's when the worst thing you'll ever hear happened. For about an eight- to ten-second period, Mike (Kritz) screamed and then stopped,” said Dorzek. “Just moments later is when finally the fire boat showed up. The fire probably wouldn't have been a bad thing if there were no delays, but even in this case they should never have talked me into turning the scene of an accident like that into the bonfire it turned out to be.”
The autopsy report of Kritz's body found that they suffered a broken rib and contused lung in the accident — survivable injuries, according to their sister Toni.
“It was (June), so dry season. It was windy. (Rob's) telling them there's a boat crashed up on the shore full of fuel and they tell them to light a fire,” they said. “I don't believe that was a reasonable option.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Aug. 4 that the Justice Department will escalate its crackdown on leakers and whistleblowers.
They indicated leak investigations have tripled in recent months and the Justice Department will seek to throw sources of journalists in jail.
Sessions' comments about "reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas" represents a dangerous escalation of the administration's war against the press, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
The group said, "The Department of Justice is explicitly threatening to haul journalists before grand juries and force them to testify about their confidential sources or face jail time.
"Sessions' suggestion that journalism is a threat to national security is particularly concerning. Journalists play a crucial role in our democracy, informing the public about the government's activities.
Sessions' comments seem intended to have a chilling effect on journalism, by making reporters and their sources think twice before publishing information that the government does not like. That will leave leave all Americans less informed about what the Trump administration is doing behind closed doors."
Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, issued this statement:
“Every American should be concerned about the Trump administration's threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists. A crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole.
“Our founders understood that democracy depends on an informed citizenry, and leaders can't be trusted to disclose vital information that reflects poorly on themselves. These first months of the Trump administration dramatically illustrate that point. Can anyone seriously argue that our country would be better off if the public received all of its information through official channels alone?”
Jesselyn Radack, director of the Whistleblower & Source Protection Program — or WHISPeR — at ExposeFacts, stated:
"The Justice Department's crackdown on leaks wrongly targets and punishes national security whistleblowers, who have no meaningful internal channels for dissent or meaningful protection from retaliation. The crackdown is a backdoor way of attacking journalists on whom the public relies to be informed about government misconduct.
"Insider Threat Programs have proven discriminatory against legitimate whistleblowers and foster a destructive, McCarthy-esque culture within the federal government.
"Attorney General Sessions fails to distinguish between whistleblowing in the public interest and other leaks and fails to address the rampant over-classification problem plaguing the national security community."
The merger of two of Wales' commercial news websites risks "trashing" well-established brands, according to Labour assembly member Lee Waters.
The South Wales Evening Post website has been scrapped, with its journalists now publishing on Wales Online.
But the Evening Post's editor said the change would offer a "much-improved" experience for audiences and advertisers.
Both brands are owned by the publisher Trinity Mirror.
The media group operates many of Wales' newspapers and their websites.
Llanelli AM Mr Waters sits on the assembly's culture committee, which will investigate the news industry later this year.
"I think there's a real danger that we are trashing well-established, trusted brands," they said.
"The Evening Post has spent generations building up credibility. I am a former Evening Post newspaper boy and people trust what they read.
"There is a real danger, in trying to shift this into a different setting which is a Wales Online site, that they will lose audiences and they will lose credibility with those audiences, all in search of clicks."

Stories generated by the South Wales Evening Post news team will now appear on the Wales Online website, while the Post's social media presence has been re-branded Swansea Online.
The Evening Post newspaper is not affected by the changes.
Editor Jonathan Roberts said the online merger would be better for its audiences.
"The South Wales Evening Post news team is now going to join with our colleagues at Wales Online and will become one editorial team serving the whole of Wales.
"The Swansea site will now merge into Wales Online, which is a bigger and better website and will provide a much-improved user experience for our audience. So we are pretty excited about it."
Image caption Jonathan Roberts said the changes would allow them to keep the print titles relevant
Mr Waters sits on the assembly's culture committee, which will investigate the print and digital news industry later this year.
They said: "I think it's right that politicians do get involved, because this is ultimately about accountability and power. But we also need to recognise that we don't have any easy answers to this."
What the Evening Post are doing was "understandable", they said, but added they were concerned about the "quality" of the news and journalism.
But Mr Roberts said Wales Online's "phenomenal growth" meant audiences in south west Wales would be better served by the changes.
"I think if you look at Wales Online, it is a success story in its own right. Its growth over the last decade has been phenomenal, really.
"What you have is a digital brand for a digital audience. Its print products that are produced in Cardiff - the Western Mail, the South Wales Echo, the Wales on Sunday - those brands continue to retain a strong profile within the industry, within the country and within the minds of readers. So no, I don't see any dilution of the brand necessarily.
"It's a digital brand for a modern-day audience."
Trinity Mirror said the merger decision was designed to create a "thriving digital Welsh news brand" and "will have no negative impact on any of our print titles".
A spokesperson for the media company said it would protect the quality of its journalism and added: "The regular audience figures we have for Wales Online shows that this is a trusted brand, and people are going there time and time again because it is a reputable source for news in Wales.
"We are investing heavily in journalism in Wales and the transition of the site into Wales Online will free up more resources for capturing the stories that matter to people.
"There's going to be an increase in our coverage of the region, not less."
Prosecutor to Cop: “Please Help Me Hide Evidence”
July 6, 2016 (Fault Lines) — Colleen Janssen[1] was a prosecutor with a secret. In their zeal for victory, they may have backed the wrong victim. And they didn't want the jury to know.
The jury was faced with two stories. In the first, Marcus Smith was an innocent club promoter who, as part of their job, happened to carry large amounts of cash around. Barshiri Sandy and Henry Surpris came to their home and robbed them of their jewelry and over a thousand dollars in cash. Acting in self-defense after being shot in the arm, Smith returned fire and wounded both men, who then fled. Their getaway driver testified against them at trial.
In the second, Marcus Smith was a drug dealer. They had accepted payment from Sandy and Surpris for marijuana, but had never gotten around to giving it to them. In the absence of a customer service rep, the two men came over, negotiated with Smith, and agreed to accept $1153.00 and a ring to settle the debt. Then, once Smith handed the money over, they started shooting, figuring that they could kill three birds with one stone by canceling the debt and eliminating the witnesses.
On the face of it, this was a pretty tough call. As the prosecutor, Colleen Janssen repeatedly pointed out to the jury, there was nothing but the defendants' “self-serving” testimony to establish that Smith was even involved in the drug trade. Maybe the two men were just lying about their interaction to smear the victim and make their own home invasion more palatable.
As Janssen put it:
There has been absolutely no evidence from the witness stand outside the Defendants' testimony that this has anything to do with drugs . . . . The Defendants are the only people who've been talking about drugs . . . . From that, the defense wants to make you believe that Marcus Smith is apparently a drug kingpin. But while Janssen was basking in the defense's lack of evidence that Smith was involved in the drug trade, they were desperately trying to hold back the evidence that might sink their case. Here's one e-mail from them to a detective with the Raleigh Police Department: I am . . . reaching out to you because Marcus Smith is the victim in a fairly nasty home-invasion case of mine that is set to go to trial in the very near future, so I'd like to talk to you a bit about it, as well as educate myself on what your investigation entails, before anything too much further happens.
They kept the detective up to date on when trial was set, hoping they would delay raiding Smith's stash house until after the trial:
Please don't hate me, but we've set the trial date for 10/6. Good news is that I will do all three of my defendants [Defendants and Mr. Baldwin], so once we're done, we'll be really done! I'm sorry – but I really appreciate your understanding and willingness to work with me on this .
The detective started to get impatient:
I have located the stash house for Mr. Smith and have obtained P.C. [probable cause] to apply for a search warrant for it. I would like to execute the search warrant on the home this week when Smith is not there. It is not Smith's house. They do not maintain any utilities there. I would not be charging Smith with any crimes. Please get back to me when you have time.
Fortunately for Janssen, the detective apparently held off until after they secured their convictions. Unfortunately for Ms. Janssen, the feds were not quite so accommodating. After the defendants' convictions, their lawyers learned that Smith had been indicted, and that Janssen may have sent e-mails to the detective to forestall the raid. They asked for anything they had sent him, but they informed that she'd never spoken to the man.
Then, darn the luck, they “remembered” something. All of their e-mails to the detective had been through their private Yahoo account. A cynic might suggest that they were trying to evade detection, but they assured the attorneys that it had just suddenly “dawned on her” that they didn't use their official e-mail to conduct official business.
The Court of Appeals of North Carolina didn't waste time. It held that Janssen violated Brady and Napue, and that their misconduct was obviously prejudicial enough that they wouldn't even need to look into the additional evidence that they had deliberately hidden the truth from the jury to secure a conviction.
In earth-shattering news, Janssen's boss does seem to care that they did this. They did not contest the authenticity of the e-mails in the appeal. They placed Janssen on paid administrative leave which, yes, is kind of like a vacation, but is far more serious than the usual half-hearted public statement by a District Attorney. It is possible that someone from the State Bar could consider the ethical ramifications of deliberately lying to a jury and opposing counsel for the sake of winning a conviction. Amazing stuff.
Only time will tell whether Janssen will face any professional consequences for their misconduct. If they do, it will likely be at a hearing that provides them with far more transparency and due process than they were willing to provide to others.

“I'll get you out of the way to where you'll be safe, and that will be jail.”
Mike Sawyer
August 10, 2014
Bryce Weber walked out of their house to find an unmarked police car sitting in the road, so they became curious.
Weber, well aware of their first amendment right, walked outside with their camera rolling. They then simply asked the officer if everything was alright, being that they were parked right outside of theirs house.
They established that everything was indeed “okay,” the officer got back in their car and Weber, well within their rights, continued to film.
This cop must have been camera shy, so they felt it necessary to exit their vehicle and demand that Weber stop filming. Weber tries to inform the officer that they are not doing anything wrong.
Soon another officer shows up to prevent this dangerous man from standing on a public sidewalk and filming.
It is decided that Weber will walk across the street and continue filming. However, these egomaniacs were compelled to violate someone's rights, so they walked back across the street and placed Weber under arrest, and handcuffed and detained them for 40 minutes, according to Weber.
The logic applied here by these police is that Weber was somehow a hindrance to their investigation as they passively filmed them from across the street. Ironically the only one hindering their ‘super important' police business was them!
Apparently their ‘official business' was less important than violating the rights of an innocent person. Job well done Bountiful and Wood Cross police departments, bravo.

For those in waiting for low-cost Lumia smartphones that come packed with New-Age Windows 10, there is still some time as the company is now focussed on re-branding and launching new generation smartphones to take on big players, a top Microsoft executive has said.
"We are sort of re-building so we will start high. New generation smartphones first and then you will see a scale overtime," Steve "Guggs" Guggenheimer, the chief evangelist at Microsoft Corporation, told IANS in an interview here.
"I do not have a timeline for new range phones as of now. One step at a time and you can assume it to be logical for us to scale the Lumia line to other price points over time," Guggenheimer told this reporter on the sidelines of "Think Next 2015" - a day-long event that brought innovation and technology leaders under one roof in the capital this week.
Talking about the current trends in where Android has a lion's share owing to the new launches in mid-price bracket ranging from Rs.6,000 to 10,000, they said has broad Android users but as we go on releasing next generation phones, you will see a definite change.
In a one-on-one interview, Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Developer eXperience & Evangelism (DX) group, also talked about new features and Microsoft's future plans with upcoming Lumia 950 and 950 XL smartphones for the Indian market.
Microsoft, which bought Finnish teleco Nokia last year, has launched two models of Lumia - 950 and 950XL smartphones with Windows 10 - for the Indian consumers.
Priced at Rs.43,699 and Rs.49,399, both models are available at the company's resellers, retail chains of Croma, Reliance and Sangeetha and Microsoft Store on Amazon.in.
"Lumia has stretched from really low end to medium to high. The truth of the matter (of introducing high-end costly phone) is that globally, the company that takes the most margin for phones is Apple. We want to put a little dent in that," added the executive who is responsible for enabling the development of industry leading applications and services globally across devices.
While discussing the app crunch that Lumia users face, the soon-to-be-released Microsoft Office 2016 and use of technology in sports, Guggenheimer said it could differ from user to user.
"If you use the phone as a business tool, the way our phones work with Microsoft Office, the way it helps users create calendar and emails and all those things seamless is awesome," they told IANS.
Shedding light on the new "Continuum" feature for phones that turns them into a big-screen projector, they said this new feature is a big-time productivity tool.
"The unique Continuum feature makes you use your phone as your primary device. I can attach my phone to a keyboard or a mouse or a monitor and use it like a PC. It does the same work with the same output. For a country that is mobile first, the new phone offers a unique option to act as a personal computer," they explained.
According to Guggenheimer, the new security feature "retina scan" is just like a biometric log in.
The "retina scan" uses the retina to unlock the Lumia 950 and 950 XL phones without a password.
When asked about the solution to the crunch of famous apps in Windows app store, they stated that there are very less Windows-based phones and "asking developers to make an app for a phone becomes hard sometimes".
"I wish I had a date. Part of the reason is due to the universal app model (that) is to give developers good reasons to build experiences from PC to TV to phone. So if we just go to a developer and ask to make an app for phone, it becomes hard sometimes, but if you say please make an app for Windows that works on phones, tablets and PCs, that's actually an easier conversation," they told IANS.
Talking about the new Office 2016, Guggenheimer said it not only gives you a fresh client version with new features in email, outlook and excel but also allows you to update on a regular basis.
"Ultimately you are sort of getting a mix of traditional client service and cloud mobile version," they explained.
When Guggenheimer is not thinking about technology, they enjoy watching rugby matches and cheering on their hometown Seattle Seahawks.
In a recent blog post, they talked about how International Motor Sports Association used Microsoft Azure and Visual basic in Motor Sports in creative ways to transform fans' experience.
"It is fun to watch new start-ups using technology and apply it to areas which need to be refreshed. We don't say 'here are some products for sports'; we'll say here are some tools and some technologies to start-ups. Let them have the creative ideas. And then we bring them together," they said.
The "Think Next 2015" forum not only saw the participation of more than 800 delegates from leading companies, investors, thought leaders and delegates from Microsoft who partnered to push the collaborative innovation agenda for the ecosystem but also witnessed the graduation of Microsoft Ventures' Winter batch 2015.

It's been two weeks since the Department of Justice arrested seven employees of Megaupload and shut it down. After all of the back and forth discussion about how this landmark case affects our online rights, the actual users of the site have been forgotten.
While the story of Megaupload conjures up thoughts and feelings of the Napster downfall, the site had over a million users, and surely not all of them were downloading or storing “illegal” files. With rumors that all Megaupload data would be wiped this Thursday, the site's lawyer tweeted that the data would be held onto for an additional two weeks:
Carpathia and Cogent agreed to preserve consumer data for additional time of at least two weeks so #Megaupload can work with US on proposal — Ira Rothken (@rothken) January 30, 2012
Whether you believe that Megaupload carried out an elaborate and illegal scheme to make money, as the DoJ contests, innocent users of the site have lost information that they currently can't access. Not only is that a scary thought if you relied on the site, but it's a black mark for future cloud services and the industry in its entirety.
In hopes of representing these users, the Electronic Frontier Foundation along with support from hosting provider Carpathia, has set up a website for those who are seeking legal representation to get their legitimate Megaupload files back.
The site is called MegaRetrieval, and is offering free legal assistance to Megaupload users:
When the United States Government shut down access to Megaupload, a multitude of innocent users who stored legitimate, non-infringing files on the cloud-storage service were left with no means to access their data. If you believe you are one of these users, are based in the United States, and are looking for legal help to retrieve your data, please email the best contact information for you to the EFF at: Megauploadmissing@eff.org Please do not send us the details of the materials you have uploaded. Also, please note that EFF is a small donor-supported nonprofit and does not charge for its legal services. It may not be able to represent everyone who inquires.
With the two-week stay of deletion for the Megaupload files, the EFF hopes that it can come to some agreement with the US government to help some of these users access their files and information. Imagine how you'd feel if you stored personal things like photos or business files on the service. It's easy to cast judgement on the service after reading media reports, but until Megaupload's employees are found guilty, it's unfair to withhold data from its rightful owners.
➤ MegaRetrieval
Tell us what you think in the comments, should Megaupload users be able to get their files back?

The abandoned Cincinatti subway. Image: Wiki
Baltimore's Red Line was not a flashy high-speed rail project or nationally contested infrastructure upgrade a la New York City's Access to the Region's Core plan. It was a mild light-rail line bridging the city's isolated and often impoverished west-side with its relatively opportunity-rich east side, in the process offering a crucial third leg to a transit stool consisting of a single pre-existing light rail (north-south) line and a single pre-existing subway line (northwest-southeast). For Baltimore, a city of 630,000 located less than an hour north of one of the nation's best subway networks, the Washington DC Metro, it seemed like not too much to ask.
After a decade of careful planning and analysis, millions of dollars in investment, and just weeks before crews were to actually break ground, Maryland's newly elected governor, a Republican no-name who oozed into one of the nation's most powerful gubernatorial seats courtesy of low voter turnout, nuked the project. Nothing was offered in the Red Line's stead and the governor was sure to note that he, on behalf of the state, had formally rejected the $900 million in federal funding the project was set to receive, effectively returning Baltimore to the very back of the line funding-wise and dooming any chances the city might have of a major transportation investment for at least a decade.
What happened in Maryland is hardly exceptional. One might even say that it's become something of a norm in the United States, as transit projects are greenlit and sometimes even already under-construction before abruptly being axed the moment the political wind shifts. It's an environment that not only dooms public transportation, but public infrastructure in general. The right's war on public investment will be won when advocates and planners start asking why bother? and, given the recent history of axed transportation projects below, it's difficult to argue that we're not there already. And, no, there is no Uber model for public transportation investment, not really.

Project: The Red Line
Location: Baltimore
Years: 2002 - 2015
Cause of Death: Governor-initiated cancellation.
The Red Line was to traverse Baltimore from east to west along a 14 mile corridor including a new tunnel underneath the city's downtown core. By 2030 the Red Line was forecast to serve 54,000 people. It was to be the first major transit investment undertaken within the city after 20 years of neglect. On June 25, Governor Larry Hogan announced the project's tabling, calling the Red Line a "wasteful boondoggle." At the same time, Hogan announced plans to invest $2 billion in roads and highways in the state, tweeting a Maryland state map with Baltimore city conspicuously absent.
Penn Station tunnel portal. Image: Wiki
Project: Access to the Region's Core
Location: New York, New Jersey
Years: 1995 - 2010
Cause of Death: Governor-initiated cancellation.
The ARC project would have doubled rail capacity underneath the Hudson River between Penn Station and New Jersey, allowing for a vast increase in the number of "one seat" (e.g. no connecting trains) commuter trips from Manhattan to locations served by New Jersey Transit's sprawling suburban rail network. It would have furthermore increased layover capacity for trains within Manhattan—currently, trains often have to return to New Jersey empty to wait for later Penn Station departures—further reducing delays attributed to the current, inadequate cross-river link.
Unlike Baltimore's Red Line, New Jersey had already begun receiving federal funding and had broken ground when Governor Chris Christie pulled the plug, citing rising costs and the likelihood of increased state spending on the project. The federal government wanted its money back, demanding a remittance of $271 million from the state of New Jersey, as required by federal law. Chris Christie, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to the sad cartoon fantasyland that is Chris Christie, refused, instead preferring to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars contesting the feds' demands in court. Where they (and New Jersey) lost hard. An agreement was eventually reached in which New Jersey would return $95 million and pledge to spend the rest of it on DOT-approved transit projects.
The ARC project has been superseded by Amtrak's Gateway Project, an $8 billion plan to replace the trans-Hudson tunnels and develop a high-speed rail link between Penn Station and Newark, New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to the inside walls of the existing tunnels, which will eventually need to be shut down for repairs—a potential catastrophe given that the two bores are already at capacity. President Obama has called the Gateway Project the most urgent transit project in America, which surely means that some halfwit will try to derail it.
Project: The Florida High Speed Corridor
Location: Miami - Tampa - Orlando
Years: 1992 - 2011
Cause of Death: Governor-initiated cancellation.
It's sort of hard to believe now that President Obama's high-speed rail initiative has become something of a punchline, but said initiative involved a lot of real money. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $831 billion economic stimulus package passed as the American economy sank, offered $8 billion in federal investment for rail projects, with an emphasis on high-speed rail. Florida campaigned aggressively for these funds, hoping to revitalize a high-speed rail plan that was once mandated by a voter-approved state constitutional amendment (repealed in 2004 thanks in large part to the efforts of Jeb Bush). In 2010, it won $1.2 billion in federal dollars for the project, approximately half the cost of the high-speed rail line's first operating segment between Tampa and Orlando, with an additional $342 million coming later courtesy of federal rail funds rejected by Ohio and Wisconsin (below).
In 2011, Governor Rick Scott formally rejected the federal funding awarded to the state only a year before. Florida's $2.2 billion was then redistributed by the Federal Railroad Administration across 22 projects in 15 states.

Project: Wisconsin High-Speed Rail
Location: Madison - Milwaukee
Years: ? - ?
Cause of death: Governor-initiated cancellation.
Thank cool-guy Scott Walker for this one. In 2010, they rejected $810 million in federal funding for a high-speed rail link between Wisconsin's central nodes of Milwaukee and Madison. Like all of the ARRA-supported rail projects here, the state had campaigned for the money just a year before. It's important to emphasize that these aren't projects being dictated from Washington, but are usually voter-supported schemes long in development and even longer in demand. As in Baltimore, Wisconsin was a classic case of a rural- and suburban-supported governor fucking over blue-voting cities. Good work.
Amtrak is currently studying an upgraded corridor between the Twin Cities and Milwaukee and Chicago, which will come courtesy of rail investments undertaken mostly by Minnesota.

Project: M-1 Rail Line
Location: Detroit
Years: 2006 - 2011, 2011 - ?
Cause of death: Debatable
Despite being the classic archetype of auto infrastructure, Detroit is a pretty reasonable place for urban passenger rail, owing in some part to its well-defined radial corridors. One of those is Woodward Avenue, the 12 o'clock spoke that traces from downtown Detroit through the city's university-dominated midtown to its trendier northern neighborhoods/inner suburbs. This was the route the M-1 light-rail/streetcar was supposed to follow for 9.3 miles and 19 stops. The route's projected cost was $500 million and the city sold $125 million in bonds toward that end, with $35 million more coming from the Kresge Foundation and $25 million from the federal government. Supposedly as the result of discussions between Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing, and Governor Rick Snyder, the feds pulled funding for the project, declaring that the city did not have the capability of operating such a rail line and instead recommended a bus rapid transport system. The project existed for four months between initial approval and cancellation.
As a meager consolation prize, a consort of private developers is building a scaled-down version of the project with limited federal funding: a 3.3 mile streetcar running from downtown to midtown, connecting to at least the city's isolated Amtrak station, set to become a stop on Michigan's eventual high-speed rail trunk and a proposed commuter line. It will open in 2016.
Project: 3-C Corridor
Location: Ohio
Years: 2002 - 2010
Cause of Death: Governor-initiated cancellation.
This is exhausting, isn't it?
Ohio is currently barely served by passenger rail, offering a few stations on long-distance Amtrak routes connecting New York and Chicago. Cincinnati is served in each direction three times a week, while Cleveland is served by trains passing through only in the middle of the night. Columbus doesn't have shit.
The 3-C Corridor was to fix all of that—or start to, anyhow—connecting the state's three largest cities with rail service at least a few times a day. It was a modest plan and the federal government offered the state $15 million to make it happen, which, once again, was nuked by an incoming Republican governor, John Kasich, whose CV boasts time at both Fox News and Lehman Brothers. A true leader and hero of the common man, Kasich trumpeted, "[t]hat train is dead. I said it during the campaign. It is dead. Passenger rail is not in Ohio's future." In the black hole of the American right-wing, this is a boast.
Colorado Springs sprawl. Image: Chris Watts/Flickr
Project: Front Range Commuter Rail
Location: Colorado
Years: 2004 - ?
Cause of Death: Atrophy
Colorado's Front Range has in a very short amount of time become a sprawl crimescene stretching for hundreds of miles from the near-south of the state all the way to the Wyoming border. It is also catastrophically car-centric. Denver and its suburbs have made impressive efforts at developing rail mass transit, but the yawning subdivision void south along Interstate 25 is the heart of the right-wing Intermountain West, a population as likely to consider itself residents of the local megachurch as it is a heathen city or state. And the heart of this heart is Colorado Springs, a city of almost half a million that, until 2014, didn't offer bus service on Sundays. It's beautiful and horrible—I was born there!—featuring a comically regressive tax structure and an approach to city services that's made it a national punchline. Other right-wingy locales in the West have actually gone deep on rail transit (Phoenix and Salt Lake City, at least), but this one might be just too much.
Anyhow, Colorado Springs and Denver and the suburbs in between are growing together and will soon enough eclipse the sprawl nightmares of Arizona if they haven't already. Rail seems like a natural way to cope with that.
And so we have a mash of different groups studying and studying again prospects for commuter rail service between the cities, which would connect with rail services being developed between Denver and neighboring locales like Boulder and Golden. A 2010 study confirmed that a Front Range commuter rail line would indeed be feasible, but I can't find much more recent than 2013 about the proposed link's progress, but, hey, it's been proposed.

What did we learn here? Something is clearly broken, fundamentally, with how we do infrastructure in America. If a governor—one dude—can derail decades of planning and investment to woo their spoiled but disaffected base, then, you know, that's just it. We're fucked. It's not just our trains but everything else we might ever want to, as a society, invest in. In conclusion, try to not forget that there are those not just willing to but salivating at the thought of burning it all down.
Cliven Bundy talks about their sons' arrests in Oregon. "This will be a wake-up call to America." (Keith Rogers/Las Vegas Review-Journal)
Cliven Bundy sits inside their ranch house 10 miles south of Bunkerville during an interview Tuesday night, Jan. 26, 2016, about the arrest of their sons and death of LaVoy Finicum, of Moccasin, Ariz. Keith Rogers/Las Vegas Review-Journal
Hours after a man was shot dead and their sons were arrested in Oregon, defiant rancher Cliven Bundy discussed the incident in an exclusive video interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
“This is a total disaster to be happening in America,” they said standing in the kitchen of their home, south of Bunkerville. “My sons were there to do good.”

Why are airships the dream that never dies?
After three-quarters of a century of neglect, only a few dozen airships remain in the world today. But if two companies succeed, that number will soon double, and airships will be hauling hundreds of tons of cargo from the Arctic to the Amazon.
A rigid framework encasing lighter-than-air gases provided the first powered flight in 1852, and airships were deployed widely in World War I. But they used highly flammable hydrogen to stay aloft, and several dramatic catastrophes—”oh, the humanity!”—had put the giant floating cucumbers in mothballs.
Today's airships use helium to provide their lift. Those remaining in service ply the skies mainly for advertising, research or surveillance purposes. Many are made by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, a German company that suceeds the firm founded by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who is credited with inventing the modern airship in 1900 and deploying it in the Germany military. The company made Goodyear's fleet, whose website boasts that passengers riding in them experience “the flight of dreams.“
But plans to deploy zeppelins in transit haven't had much luck. In the 1960s, US firm Aereon Corp. attempted to develop a flying “deltoid pumpkin seed“ that would use a lighter-than-air vessel's lifting power to bring heavy cargo to hard-to-reach areas, an enterprise that ultimately failed for lack of funds. In 1966, a Boston University professor proposed a never-built nuclear-powered airship for “the jet age.” In 2000, another German company, Cargolifter, held an initial public offering to finance its attempt to build a cargo-moving blimp, but was bankrupt by 2002. The enormous dome it built to house its airship has been turned into a tropical spa and resort.
The industrial zeppelin business offers an array of challenges. Between air travel for passengers and sea and rail for freight, there's just not as much demand for airships, which are neither as fast as airplanes nor as capacious as ships and trains. Zeppelins traditionally don't handle heavy weather too well, and aren't that maneuverable. Landings require a large crew of people to assist in pinning to the ground a vessel designed to float away from it.

Two companies, Worldwide Aeros Corporation in the United States and Hybrid Air Vehicles in the UK, say they have solved many of these problems. Both have developed airships that require minimal, if any, crew, can haul tons of cargo, and can land and take off almost anywhere without outside assistance, infrastructure or ballast. And these ships are energy-efficient, using a third as much fuel as cargo planes and 10% as much as helicopters to haul the same cargo the same distance, according to the manufacturers. New materials and technology have helped make the difference, including modern meteorology and satellite navigation to dodge heavy weather.
Perhaps more importantly, there is clearer demand for their airships' unique qualifications: Shippers and miners in areas with little infrastructure, like the Arctic, say they could be more economical for moving large cargoes—some of Worldwide Aeros' planned ships can hoist as much as 250 tons (226 tonnes)—than other kinds of transit. They could also carry supplies to disaster areas when infrastructure is destroyed, as many of the Philippines' ports were after Typhoon Haiyan came ashore. And, let's face it, it'll only be a matter of weeks before luxury blimps are the new trend in Silicon Valley and San Francisco.
Hybrid Air's Airlander
Hybrid Air has built a number of airships, including one for the US military to use in Afghanistan. It has plans to build several more for mining concerns in Canada that could carry as much as 200 tons. It also has built a zeppelin drone—a terrifying concept—which can stay aloft for surveilling for 21 days, or five days with passengers on board.
Worldwide Aeros, meanwhile, has signed deals to manufacture 24 of its Aeroscraft airships larger than the prototype in the video above by 2021. Its partners include Luxembourg's Cargolux Airlines and Icelandair Cargo. The company will provide piloted, 500 foot (152 meters) long, 100 mile-an-hour (160 km/h) blimps-as-a-service. Renting out a 66-ton carrier will cost $25 million for a year's use and the 200-ton model will cost $55 million, according to Frederick Edworthy, the company's head of business development. Aeros, originally founded in Ukraine before its CEO, Igor Pasternak, immigrated to the United States, has already obtained Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) experimental certification for its prototype and hopes to have full FAA certification in 2016, a major hurdle for the new breed of airship.
One of the problems for airship makers is that helium is being used more and more often for a variety of high-tech purposes, sending its prices higher. Those prices almost went up some 35% last September when the US contemplated shutting down its national helium reserve, originally set up in the 1920s when blimps were still strategically important weapons of war. A few days later, US lawmakers reversed the decision.
That was a lucky break for an industry not known for its good fortune. Zeppelins have been the vehicle of the future since the 19th century. Perhaps the time has come for them be more than romantic billboards.
Earth Day has been a major theme all this week—here at OurValues and in lots of communities around the world. The Face of Climate Change is this year's theme, chosen by the Earth Day Network to personalize environmental threats and heroes. Today, I conclude the week with the overarching question: Do you believe climate change is real?
On Monday, I showed one face of climate change—an image I picked from thousands on the Earth Day Network web site. It was a photo of a small boy in Bilaspur, India, whose community is threatened by pollution from a sponge iron plant. On Tuesday, I offered Dr. Seuss' fictional character the Lorax as another face of climate change. My son had watched the DVD in school on Earth Day. Then I suggested two inanimate objects—a green recycling bin and a napkin dispenser—for two more faces of climate change. The design of each of these can change human behavior, increase recycling, and reduce paper waste.
Today, let's conclude with a core question in this whole effort: Do you believe climate change is real?
The number of Americans who say it is has been rising recently, though the figure is still below the record numbers in 2006 and 2007 when 90% of Americans agreed that climate change was happening, according to an Environmental and Energy Study Institute (ESSI) Fact Sheet. Just over a third (38%) says that climate change is a very serious threat, with another 46% saying that it is a somewhat serious threat.
There's less agreement about the role of human activity as cause of climate change. In 2007, a Gallup poll showed that six of ten Americans say that human activity is at fault, but since then the figure has wavered around 50% or less.
The majority of Americans support regulating power-plant emissions and greater use of clean and renewable energy sources, ESSI reports. But there isn't much support for a carbon tax.
Do you believe in climate change?
Is it caused by human activities?
How far are you willing to go to halt climate change?

Braves use Prado to acquire another Upton
MLB.com/blogs Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 24, 2013
By Mark Bowman
The Braves have reached a preliminary agreement to acquire Justin Upton from the D-backs in exchange for four players, including Martin Prado.
According to a Major League source, the Braves will get Upton and Chris Johnson in exchange for Prado, shortstop prospect Nick Ahmed and right-handed pitchers Randall Delgado and Zeke Spruill. This deal is pending the completion of physicals.
With this trade, Braves general manager Frank Wren provide their club the game's best outfield. They began this offseason by signing Justin Upton's older brother, B.J. Upton to a five-year, $75.25 million contract. Their projected outfield over the next three seasons will consist of Jason Heyward and the two Upton brothers.
To complete this trade, Wren had to part ways with Prado, who is one of the Braves' most popular players among the fans and their teammates. But they were able to acquire Upton without giving up either of their top two pitching prospects, Julio Teheran or J.R. Graham.
The departure of the versatile Prado signals that the Braves will likely enter the season with Juan Francisco and Johnson sharing the third base duties.
Upton has hit .278 with 108 homers and a .832 OPS since making their Major League debut during the 2007 season. The 25-year-old outfielder was one of the game's top outfielders as they hit .289 with 31 homers and a .898 OPS in 2011 with the D-backs. A thumb injury limited them this year as they hit .280 with 17 homers and a .785 OPS.
So it's good news:
Carolina Panthers DT Star Lotulelei leaves with ankle injury | CharlotteObserver.com
X-rays on the ankle were negative, and Panthers coach Ron Rivera said nothing was broken. Lotulelei will be further evaluated in Charlotte.
You can bet though it is a bad sprain and they will miss at least a couple games if not more. I will qualify that statement by saying I am not a doctor and have zero credentials in the medical field. The replay gave a pretty clear view of the injury. Star stepped on Kuechly foot and rolled their right ankle over about 90 degrees but then was able to pull up. You can watch the video here (not for the squeamish). It's a common basketball injury actually.
Basketball type severe inversion (low) ankle sprain stepping on a teammate foot for STAR LOTULELEI @Panthers. Hope x-rays negative. — David J. Chao, MD (@ProFootballDoc) November 11, 2014
So I send out good vibes to Star and hope for their speedy recovery. If they secretly hope they sit the rest of 2014 out I would understand.
Art from Pretty Deadly by Emma Rios Credit: Image Comics
After making a name for themselves with books like Avengers Assemble, Captain Marvel and Osborn, Kelly Sue DeConnick and Emma Rios are taking a ride on a pale white horse into the wildest Wild West you've ever seen with the upcoming creator-owned series Pretty Deadly.
Set to debut on October 23, Pretty Deadly promises a mix of magic of Sandman with the brutality of Preacher. It's star is the is literally Death's daughter, a grim woman named Ginny whose face bears the tattoo of a skull and rides on a horse made out of smoke and ash. Newsarama spoke with Rios about the upcoming ongoing series, from the dirty deeds death's daughter is contemplating to how they and DeConnick dreamt up this world of westerns and warlocks.

Newsarama: Pretty Deadly has been teased and hyped for going on a year now, Emma. What can you tell us about the book?
Emma Rios: It's not a regular western. I define it as a “dark fantasy tale in the Old West.” There are some classic elements common in the genre but feels more like a fairy tale.
I think the atmosphere, in general, is inspired by cinema the most, with Sergio Leone as our main muse. If you think for a bit about their movies, there is definitively a surreal and disturbing vibe, in the austerity of each frame. We are going for that, and even if “surrealism” is quite a big concept for me, more in the line of what Alejandro Jodorowsky does.
Its true that we are playing with some symbolic elements and building a world that makes its living half from the classic stuff, and half from some made up folklore that helps us to gain some mood... You know, spiritual stuff.
So yep, not a regular western, not regular horror, and it's basically a tale about family.
Nrama: The star of this is Ginny, a Western gunslinger who happens to be Death's daughter and a reaper of vengeance. Tell us about them
Rios: Ginny is what we would call our “solitary hero of the west”, although they are not actually a hero.
I see them in conflict against the system of this weird world we are creating. I want them to look quite elevated and magnificent... even if they are our main character is the mysterious one. This kind of characters are not transparent neither easy to explain, like the Pale Rider.
Art from Pretty Deadly by Emma Rios Credit: Image Comics
Nrama: Speaking of their looks, visually Ginny has a very striking design. Can you tell us how they developed, from their face tattoo to how they dress and carries herself?
Rios: The skull face tattoo was Kelly Sue's idea. At the beginning my first thought went immediately to Fever Ray´s Karin makeup, which is incredible, but finally I ended up simplifying it a lot transforming it into line tattoos. Ginny's quite stoic, which means we have to use very subtle expressions to build them up. Kelly Sue and I really care about the acting and the psychology of the characters, so, the lined tattoo make things easier.
Nrama: She's called a reaper of vengeance. What exactly does that entail?
Rios: That they are the person to call if you need some retribution.
Nrama: I hear promises in future issues of gunfighters with swords; what kind of opponents will Ginny cross in this series?
Rios: Family.
And yep, I like sword fighting, I actually practice fencing myself so, I'm glad to have some of that. I just couldn't restrain to include a Confederate cavalry saber in Ginny's equipment and making them use it quite a lot.
I'm definitively trying to depict the fights as nuanced action sequences, with reasonable choreographies. It is fun stuff to do. I don't like how this kind of action is filmed nowadays, with all those close shots that doesn't allow you to see how the actors are actually moving. My two favorite duels are in The Duelists and in Seppuku. The first one was choreographed by Bob Anderson, who was the fencer legend who did among others Star Wars and The Princess Bride, the second by a kendo professional champion and even more, they used real swords. Both examples are perfect because they feel difficult, dangerous and real – and that's what I'm looking for.

Nrama: In passing in an interview with ComicsAlliance you mentioned that the dead bunny in the previews plays a big role in the series. What can you say about that character?
Rios: It's a character pretty attached to Ginny, to their childhood, and they guide us through the story.
Nrama: At the beginning of our conversation we talked about how Pretty Deadly isn't a plain western. I see some strands of supernatural as well as modem fashion creeping into this; the same way Sergio Leone made their own “western” as well as the movie Sukiyaki Western Django. What's the world like here in Pretty Deadly?
Rios: It's definitively closer to Leone than to Takeshi Miike. I actually have a love/hate relationship with Miike that it's unrelated to this but, oh well...
My supernatural muses for building the weirdness of Pretty Deadly atmosphere are the movie Kaidan, directed by Masaki Kobayashi which depicts some tales of Lafcadio Hearn. And Daisuke Igarashi, who is a Japanese creator whose work is really magical and oneirical.
As I mentioned, the stuff feels more like a fairy tale than the regular extreme horror or zombie stuff.
Nrama: You've worked with Kelly Sue on two prior occasions, but what was it about this project that made you want to go out on a limb from work-for-hire to do creator-owned work?
Art from Pretty Deadly by Emma Rios Credit: Image Comics
Rios: I come from a small press environment in Spain, and I think owning your work is important.
Working together on those previous books at Marvel, Kelly and I were able to develop a pretty special relationship from the beginning. We are pretty much into the same stuff, the same level of enthusiasm about work and we also understand and trust what each other do completely.
We started talking about doing some creator-owned stuff after the third issue of Osborn, our first project together. That was pretty soon, but when they asked me I didn't' hesitate because I already knew they were the perfect partner in crime. I feel so lucky, so lucky, to have them
I think we are able to help each other to be steady among all this freedom we have now.  They are damn good and I'm learning things nonstop. They inspire me and makes me try to bring my “A” game all the time.
Nrama: For Kelly Sue it's their first creator-owned work, but for you I think it's your second – after the European self-published book you did call APB in Spain years ago. Can you tell us what you've learned about doing your own work from that and now with this?
Rios: Well, that was ages ago and even if I learnt a lot self publishing I wouldn't count that as real pro stuff.
I helped to build a self-publishing association here in Galicia called Polaqia that was active for ten years. When you publish yourself and help others do the same you get to know how difficult these things are, and how responsible you are about your own stuff. The process, the insecurities, the promo...
Right now I'm incredibly excited as if I'm reliving that, learning again, and trying to show all I got. I'm under the impression that some things are changing, and Image looks like a perfect platform to make that possible.
Gold Butte, Nevada (Photo: Bureau of Land Management)
The GOP plans to restore control of more than a million acres to the people of Utah and Nevada.
In the waning hours of their presidency, Barack Obama has designated more than 1.5 million acres for two new national monuments — Bears Ears in Utah and Gold Butte in Nevada. State lawmakers in the region have for years debated creating these monuments and had yet to reach a conclusion before Obama made their controversial move Wednesday.

The Bears Ears monument will take up an astounding 1.35 million acres, a region bigger than the state of Delaware, and the Gold Butte monument will cover nearly 300,000 acres in an area often referred to as Nevada's portion of the Grand Canyon. In a statement, the president asserted that these monuments “will protect places that a wide range of stakeholders all agree are worthy of protection.” They also claimed that their administration “worked to ensure that tribes and local communities can continue to access and benefit from these lands for generations to come.”
But many state lawmakers disagree, arguing that this decision puts vast pieces of land into the hands of the federal government alone, removing power from state lawmakers and thus removing control from the people of Utah and Nevada. These new monuments aren't the first occasion for such concerns to surface, especially in the western part of the country. The federal government controls 25 percent of all land in the U.S., 50 percent of land west of the Rocky Mountains, and 85 percent of the land in Nevada.

Several Utah politicians have outspokenly opposed the Bears Ears designation, both before the White House made the decision official and after the president announced the move. In a Fox News interview last week, Utah representative Jason Chaffetz said they are firmly opposed to the Bears Ears designation. “It's one of the biggest land grabs in the history of the United States, and it was done as this midnight monument in the waning hours of the Obama administration,” they said.
Chaffetz expressed the hope that President Donald Trump and their administration will reverse course on these monuments in the coming months, but it's unclear whether the president's decision is reversible. In designating these monuments, Obama acted under the authority granted to them by the Antiquities Act of 1906; they have used the Antiquities Act 29 times during their presidency to enact similar executive decisions about land. Franklin Roosevelt is the only president to have acted under the authority of this measure more frequently.

When the Act was first created in the early 20th century, it allowed the president to keep historical or prominent archeological sites from being immediately destroyed, in times when such destruction might come too quickly for Congress to prevent. Monument designations such as those made by President Obama present no emergency and thus ought to fall under Congress's purview. As GOP lawmakers have argued, the Act was never meant to authorize this type of presidential overreach.
Supreme Court decisions outlining the power granted to the president under this Act suggest that a president can designate land, but they might not have the authority to reverse land designations that have already been made. This would suggest that President Trump will not be able to stop these latest designations in Utah and Nevada.

Even so, Senator Mike Lee of Utah is dedicated to limiting the scope of this decision, whether or not it can be fully undone. For example, it might be possible to narrow the Bears Ears monument to a few hundred acres, which would protect the actual site from destruction but wouldn't take up the vast expanse of 1.35 million acres. But Lee doesn't plan to stop there. In a recent op-ed, they promised to fight to repeal the Antiquities Act to prevent future presidential overreach.
Utah's senior senator, Orrin Hatch, also criticized the decision, calling it an “attack on an entire way of life” and an “astonishing and egregious abuse of executive power.” Like Lee, Hatch plans to work with the new administration to reverse the decision. Meanwhile, Utah's attorney general, Sean Reyes, has already announced their intention to file a lawsuit against the federal government over the Bears Ears designation.
It might be possible to narrow the Bears Ears monument to a few hundred acres, which would protect the actual site from destruction but wouldn't take up the vast expanse of 1.35 million acres.
In Nevada, protestors have already gathered to express disapproval over the Gold Butte monument, even as environmental-protection groups and the state's Democratic lawmakers laud the new designation. For their part, Nevada governor Brian Sandoval lamented the fact that the president “bypassed Congress and the public” in making this decision. The state's attorney general, Adam Laxalt, called the designation a “unilateral land grab,” saying that Obama's decision made a “last-minute attempt to cement their environmental legacy by undermining local control of Nevada's communities, and damaging our jobs and economy.”
We will soon learn whether the incoming administration can completely reverse President Obama's overreach. Whatever ensues, Republican lawmakers intend to remove both this power and this land from the federal government in order to restore it to the people of Utah and Nevada.
I'll preface by saying that I am a student of social sciences from Australia and I have some questions to ask. I have highlighted the questions from within the framework to aid in addressing them directly, as I find people often struggle to actually answer my questions in this type of communication.
Firstly I find it difficult to see how discriminating against obesity is unfair discrimination (such as discrimination based on homosexuality or gender), as it is a persons life choices that lead to their obesity. How is it different from discriminating against drug addicts or alcoholics? People can choose to exercise and eat well or they can choose not to and the consequences are theirs to bear, and one of those consequences is perhaps not undeserved discrimination.
Of course there are people who have disorders which make it impossible for them to maintain a healthy weight, and I would concede that some people at a healthy weight would be discriminated against if their weight was perceived to be unattractive.
This attitude of allocating responsibility to overweight individuals is, it seems, the predominant attitude held by individuals I have encountered, how do you go about affecting sympathy for your cause when such attitudes predispose people more to disdain and a lack of sympathy to overweight individuals?
One last thing, it seems from my encounters with overweight individuals and being an overweight child growing up (which is no longer the case) that weight problems correlate with things such as immaturity/emotional maturity and a lack of intelligence/low SES. Now while this is probably not the case with all overweight individuals, it seems as though these could be causitive factors, and if that is the case, would that not justify some discrimination based on weight as an indicator of these problems?
I will make a note about low SES, I have observed that low SES populations tend to have a higher density of overweight individuals, and that these lower SES individuals who are overweight also seem more likely to remain in low SES situations, although this is largely conjecture on my part.
One last thing, do you think it is possible that your perception of these issues is biased?

A Los Angeles judge Tuesday struck down teacher tenure and other California laws that offer job security to educators, a decision that is expected to trigger widespread challenges of teacher job protections nationwide.
Plaintiffs in the case argued that California children who are poor receive an inferior education because they are saddled with the weakest teachers, who are entrenched in their jobs and are difficult to fire. Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu sided with the plaintiffs against some of the most powerful labor unions in the country, striking down California's teacher employment laws because they determined that they violate students' civil rights.
Calling it a landmark decision, attorneys for the plaintiffs said that California was just the start of a planned effort to knock down tenure in a state-by-state campaign across the country. Those who have opposed tenure — from the right and the left — have long said that the protection is an impediment to stronger U.S. education because it keeps bad teachers in the nation's classrooms. Tuesday's decision could mark a new front in national education reform, with attacks on tenure moving into the courtroom.
“This is going to be the beginning of a series of these lawsuits that could fix many of the problems in education systems nationwide,” said plaintiffs attorney Theodore Boutrous, who was joined in the effort against tenure by former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson. The same legal team won a U.S. Supreme Court victory that allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California. “We're going to roll them out to other jurisdictions.”
Boutrous and Olson were among several prominent lawyers hired by Silicon Valley mogul David F. Welch, founder of an optical telecommunications firm, who created Students Matter, an advocacy group, to challenge teachers unions in California. Welch pumped several million dollars into the effort. Students Matter is considering similar lawsuits in New York, Connecticut and other states with teacher job protections similar to those in California, Boutrous said.
Read the ruling A California judge ruled that the state's teacher tenure rules violate the civil rights of students, as the worst teachers end up in the highest-poverty schools, creating unequal conditions. Read it.
The ruling was a serious blow to labor unions, whose core mission is to protect teachers' jobs. The judge issued a stay pending an appeal by the unions, and a final resolution could take years.
John Deasy, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District and a witness for the plaintiffs, called it a “historic day.”
“We can rectify a catastrophe,” Deasy said. “We can and will and must assure that children have the most effective teachers in their classrooms every day. Not some children, not most children, not even nearly all children. But all children.”
Labor leaders said the case is part of a broad assault on unions, since government workers make up more than half of the nation's union membership.
“Let's be clear: This lawsuit was never about helping students, but is yet another attempt by millionaires and corporate special interests to undermine the teaching profession and push their own ideological agenda on public schools and students while working to privatize public education,” Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, said in a statement.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the lawsuit focused on the relatively small pool of “grossly ineffective” teachers — estimated at 1 to 3 percent of California's 275,000 teachers — and ignores other factors that affect the quality of education, especially for poor children.
“It's surprising that the court, which used its bully pulpit when it came to criticizing teacher protections, did not spend one second discussing funding inequities, school segregation, high poverty or any other out-of-school or in-school factors that are proven to affect student achievement and our children,” Weingarten said.
Tenure and related employment laws in California protect teachers from arbitrary firings, reward experienced teachers and make teaching an appealing career option, Van Roekel said. The ruling will make it more difficult to attract and retain high-quality teachers, they said.
But the plaintiffs argued that California's laws make it too difficult to get rid of ineffective teachers, costing $450,000 and taking 10 years in one case, according to one trial witness.
In a 16-page ruling, in the case of Vergara v. California, Treu struck down three state laws as unconstitutional. The laws grant tenure to teachers after two years, require layoffs by seniority, and call for a complex and lengthy process before a teacher can be fired.
Treu said the evidence presented at trial “is compelling. Indeed, it shocks the conscience.”
Defendants in the case, including Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and other state officials, were joined by the California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers.
In many ways, the case was a proxy fight for some of the national conflicts over the teaching profession.
Backing Welch were some of the most incendiary players in the fight over the future of public schools, including Michelle A. Rhee, the former schools chancellor in Washington who got rid of tenure in the District in 2009 and went on to form an advocacy group aimed at eliminating it across the country.
“It is my hope that this movement continues on the national stage for all of our students,” said Rhee, who is now chief executive of Students First.
For the unions, the ruling poses a serious threat to tenure, which was first adopted by New Jersey in 1909 to protect teachers from firings on the basis of race, pregnancy, politics or other arbitrary factors.
The California unions have staved off attempts to change the laws through the legislature, leading Welch to try through the courts.
Welch used a novel civil rights approach, arguing that poor and minority students in California are being denied their right under the state constitution to equal access to public education because they are more likely than affluent white students to be taught by “grossly ineffective” teachers.
Under the laws struck down by the court, school districts have about 18 months after a teacher is hired to award tenure. That is not enough time to make a valid decision, the judge found, noting that California is one of only five states with a period of two years or less. Thirty two states have a three-year period and nine states have four- or five-year periods. Four states have no tenure system.
The complaint also attacked seniority rules and “last in, first out” policies, which say the newest teachers are the first to be laid off when jobs are cut, regardless of performance.
Since 2010, Republican governors and legislatures have been trying to eliminate or weaken teacher tenure laws. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and a potential Republican presidential candidate who heads an education foundation, applauded the ruling, saying, “Its impact will be felt well beyond California.”
Some Democrats also joined in cheering Tuesday's verdict.
Rep. George Miller (Calif.), an old-school liberal and the top Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, suggested that the anti­tenure movement ought to spread beyond California. “It is not only Californians who should celebrate today's decision, but families in every state and school district across the country,” Miller said. “Unfortunately, school districts nationwide have policies in place that mirror those challenged in Vergara. . . . This is simply indefensible. Today's ruling puts every school with similar policies on notice.”
U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan also criticized tenure laws.
“The students who brought this lawsuit are, unfortunately, just nine out of millions of young people in America who are disadvantaged by laws, practices and systems that fail to identify and support our best teachers and match them with our neediest students,” Duncan said in a statement.
Workers with disabilities saving tonnes of waste from landfill each month
Updated
Every month the Geelong Disabled People Industry (GDP) prevents 50 tonnes of waste going into landfill by recycling everything from polystyrene to old electronics.
"We're doing something right, not only for us, but for the earth, for the world," GDP employee Daryl Lohman says as they climb off a forklift.
Mr Lohman has spent the morning cutting up leftover wood from local constructions companies, which GDP then sells as firewood.
But wood recycling is just one of the many ventures at the vast warehouse.
Production manager Tye Cummins says GDP recycles polystyrene — a product that is not regularly recycled — from local businesses.
It also recycles spools of nylon string from a local carpet manufacturer, barbecue gas tanks and e-waste.
"We do anything we can do to save a bit of landfill going in," Mr Cummins says.
"Around about 50 tonnes per month is what we save going into landfill, which equates to around 400 cubic metres."
GDP has 80 employees and Mr Cummins says they all appreciate the importance of recycling.
"Some of them might not realise how big an impact we are making," they say.
"But they've all worked out that we're getting things that other companies throw out, and making a job and earning a few bucks and keeping people employed with it."
Inside the noisy wood workshop, Graham Baltetsch is using a bandsaw to cut up disused fence palings to be made into seed trays.
Turning off the machine to stop for a chat, Mr Baltetsch explains that for the last 46 years, GDP has given them purpose.
"It gives me something to do every day, get out of bed, instead of sitting around doing nothing," they say.
Mr Baltetsch says they enjoy the feeling of recycling something once considered rubbish.
"That's pretty good, because it's only going to be thrown away, and in today's society we've got to recycle because the tips are getting over-full," they say.
And it seems the message is spreading.
"We're always looking for what we can recycle and I think a lot of Geelong companies are getting conscious of it as well," Mr Cummins says.
"They're looking at ways they can recycle, and a lot of the time they come and see us to see whether we can assist them."
GDP has been operating for the past 50 years.
It began repairing crates for Coca-Cola long before the current recycling trend.
Eric Smith, the general manager, says while recycling is the focus of the organisation, their employees are the top priority.
"The most important thing that we believe, is making sure that people with a disability at GDP have got clean work … that they've got a place in the community," they say.

America has come far in securing liberties for every citizen. From fighting off the tyrannical British, to the abolition of slavery, to the civil rights movement, and more recently LGBT rights, the United States has always been a beacon of freedom in the world. Over time, however, the government grew and liberties eroded. Americans forgot what unfreedom meant, and in doing so, began to trust in the government. Only now they trust in it too much. Founding Father George Washington once said, “Government is not reason; it is not eloquent; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.” The keyword there is force. Ever before Anarcho-Capitalists and other Voluntaryists, they and America's other founders understood very well the value of non-aggression. The problem with America today is that we have not be careful with the fire that is government.
But as government grew, so did reaction to such big government grow. Throughout the 1900s, the libertarian movement gained popularity and flourished. Austrian economists such as Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek furthered the cause through their works, giving a case for a restrained government, and civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. fought the system on social issues. The movement really exploded in 1971, when the ones who would be the founders of the Libertarian Party realized, upon examining Nixon: the Republican Party is not the small-government party anymore; we need to fight for freedom in social, political, and economic issues.
Here I will give a case for why a libertarian society would be better than our current system, where we have strayed from the liberty that gave us the quality of life we have today. I will go issue by issue, starting with…
Property- Libertarians believe that one may use their property for their enjoyment in any way they wish, unless that infringes upon the rights of others to do the same thing. And we're not just talking about material property; we believe every person is their own property and is sovereign over themselves. And property includes money; we believe in a free market of voluntary exchange where one may use their money in any way they wish and use any commodity as money. This is in contrast to American society today, where property is riddled with restriction and regulation such as controls on wages, prices, profits, production, etc. and legal tender laws. On an everyday basis, Americans' rights to private property and freedom of trade are being violated. If we were to restrain these violations, people would be able to live their lives as they want, not as some central ruler wants.
Self-defense- Since we believe everyone is their own property, we believe in whatever measures they take to protect themselves and their property so as long as they respect the rights of others. The non-aggression principle is opposed to the initiation of force, but if one person is initiating force by violating another's life or liberty, we believe that the victim (or anyone working on behalf of the victim, say, a private police force) has the right to violate the boundaries of the aggressor only as much as it takes to have the aggressor stop violating the rights of the victim (any force used greater than that in retaliation is itself an initiation of force). This is opposed to America today, where there is a constant push from the left to regulate and restrict the ownership, manufacture, transfer, and sale of firearms. In all honesty, most of the left's pressure to take action against guns is done with good intention. They feel that the danger of having a firearm outweighs the use of them as a tool of self-defense. This is however, a mistake; every day somewhere around 30 people are murdered by someone using a gun. When this is multiplied to a year, you get about 10,950 people dead a year. This is a tragedy, but it overlooks the fact that annually, anywhere from 65,000 to 2.5 million people use guns in self defense each year– under Bill Clinton the Department of Justice put that number at 1.5 million. While the possible range of use varies greatly, even the lowest estimate is still almost six times higher than the murder rate, and 98% of the time the victim merely has to brandish the weapon. And we weren't given the Second Amendment for personal self-defense only; it was also meant for us to fend off tyranny, whether that come from a foreign power of from our own government. If people were given the right to unhindered self-defense, the nation would be a much safer place.
National Defense- Libertarians believe that we should have strong military- powerful enough to defend the country if a foreign power were to initiate an act of aggression against the United States. That said, we believe that the U.S. should stay out of entanglements with alliances and we should stop policing the world. Before the U.S. went into Iraq, Al-Qaeda was not much of a presence there. Since we have invaded however, recruitment has exploded. In fact, one thing that rallied so many Middle Easterners to Al-Qaeda's cause was the fatwa titled Jihad against Jews and Crusaders. This document attacked America for its constant military involvement in the region. These terrorist sects got so big over there in reaction to U.S. foreign policy. I am most certainly not blaming America for jihad. The guilty party is obviously the one that carried out such horrible attacks. No terrorist is justified doing what they do, although the U.S. can minimize blowback by scaling down involvement. A libertarian society would be a peaceful society.
Marriage- Libertarians believe that no one has the right to tell you who you can marry and to restrict one's liberty based on gender identity and/or sexual orientation and preference. We believe that the government should not even take this account at all in their actions. We believe that homosexual and bisexual people should be treated no differently from heterosexual people than blue-eyed and brown-eyed people are. As long as both parties are consenting, they should be able to choose how to run their relationship. Most libertarians, in fact, believe that that the government should not be involved in marriage at all, whether heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. Nevertheless, we believe that as long as government is in the marriage business, no one should be treated differently based on these factors. In American society today, there are countless restrictions on personal relationships imposed by conservatives mostly (that said, the Democrats didn't start supporting gay rights until somewhere around the year 2000. Let liberals not forget that it was Bill Clinton who signed into effect the DOMA). In a libertarian society, people would have the right to choose their partners themselves.
Healthcare- I'll keep this one short, because I think the answer's pretty obvious. Believing in the free-market, libertarians also believe in a free-market healthcare system. We believe that people should be able to decide how much health insurance they want and what kind of healthcare they want, if they even want any healthcare. In just 9 days, the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) will take full effect. I don't think I even have to explain all the problems that will create. While Obamacare is supposed to increase the availability of health insurance to more than 10 million people, the American Enterprise Institute estimates 100 million people will lose their insurance whether they “liked their health insurance” or not. In a free society, people would have the ability to make their own healthcare decisions.
Privacy- Libertarians believe in the Fourth Amendment. We are against NSA-type massive surveillance. Anywhere that had or has this type of spying in place didn't end up very free (see: Soviet Russia -or- STASI). While the National Security Agency was purported to have been created to prevent terrorist attacks, a White House panel member says has “stopped no terrorist attacks.” The same panel went on to say that the NSA is “not essential to preventing terrorist attacks.” So why does the Obama Administration maintain these programs? Edward Snowden, the ex-NSA contractor who leaked the information that started the controversy, says, “These programs were never about terrorism; they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.” No major advance in liberty could ever have been made unless they started in secrecy. In a libertarian society, people would have the right to do as they please without there leaders spying on them.
Crime- Libertarians believe crimes should be considered only to be actions that use force or fraud or actions that put others at significant risk. We believe that a “victimless crime” is not a crime at all, and that people should be able to decide their own actions and accept responsibility for said actions. We believe that the use of voluntary actions that only affect oneself, such as the use of drugs, should be up to the discretion of the individuals partaking in said actions. Unlike post-Nixon America, where police can raid your house, just like raiding that of a murderer, for you smoking some plant while you sit at home watching some TV and eating (a lot). If people were allowed to do anything as long as their actions didn't violate the liberty of others, it would be a much freer society.
There are a bunch more things that I didn't cover nor do I feel like covering (I'm not a political writer– why do you think the article's written so crappily!). I just wanted to lay down what I believe for anyone who has enough time on their hands to read some random person's unknown blog. But basically this is why, contrary to what you may have learned from school, the media, etc. growing up, more freedom is better.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a tea party favorite, will speak at a homeschooling rally in Iowa next month, signaling their continued interest in a possible 2016 presidential bid.
The event, which will take place on March 18 at the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, will be hosted by the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators (NICHE), a politically-engaged group that has previously hosted presidential contenders. In 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) spoke at a similar "Homeschool Day at the Capitol," as did pizza magnate Herman Cain and former member of congress Ron Paul (R-Tex.).
Vicki Crawford, a NICHE organizer, confirmed the appearance in a phone interview, and said the group is excited to welcome Cruz back to the Hawkeye State and offer them its headlining speaking slot at the rally.
"Senator Cruz is very supportive of educational freedom," Crawford said. "He's a perfect match for us. He's been a courageous voice in the Senate." And, they added, "I think he'd be a wonderful choice to step into the ring in 2016."
Cruz's upcoming appearance underscores their popularity among Iowa Republicans, especially social conservatives, said Chuck Laudner, a veteran Iowa GOP consultant who advised former senator Rick Santorum's 2012 Iowa campaign.
"The home school event will have hundreds of people there, it's a huge event, and these are the people who organize, communicate, and build a ready-made foundation for any caucus campaign in Iowa," Laudner said. "They are looped in and they will fight for you, if you can win them over. I know a lot of them already like Cruz, and this will be a big forum - a red-letter date."
Cruz traveled to Iowa several times last year, including a stop in October, when they headlined the Iowa GOP's Ronald Reagan dinner. During that visit, they also traveled to western Iowa, where they went on a pheasant hunt with Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a key political figure in the run-up to the Iowa Republican caucuses, the first nominating contest of the presidential race.
Steve Deace, a conservative talk-radio host in Iowa, said Cruz's flurry of Iowa visits over the past year are "very helpful" to them as conservatives mull over what could be a large Republican field.
"People are doing a much earlier vetting process, since they don't want the establishment to pick the nominee," Deace said. "I think their base is as strong as anybody else. It's not in the bag yet, but they have the ability to put together a coalition. Speaking at this particular event is smart."
A Washington Post-ABC poll last month showed Cruz's support among Republicans nationally at 12 percent, in fourth place behind Rep. Paul Paul Ryan (Wis.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Among tea party supporters — who made up about one-fifth of the Republicans polled — Cruz had the lead, with 28 percent.
A recent study reveals that women who fail to conceive post infertility treatments are less likely to stay with their partners.
The researchers from Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology in their latest research have tried to evaluate the post-effects of infertility treatments.
The women receiving infertility medications were followed for 12 years post their treatment. Twenty seven percent of the female participants in the study were found to be no longer staying with their partners following the treatment if they did not succeed in their first attempt.
The researchers have based their findings on the data collected on Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish IVF (in vitro fertilization) Registry, which involved 47,515 women, who underwent infertility treatment between 1991 and 2006. The women were mostly aged above 32 years or more.
Fifty-seven percent of the women succeeded in their first attempts and give birth to a child. The rest 43 percent failed to conceive in their first attempts.
During the 12 year follow-up period, the researchers found that women who failed to conceive were three times more likely to leave their partners compared to the one who conceived.
"Our findings suggest that not having a child after fertility treatment may adversely affect the duration of a relationship for couples with fertility issues," said Dr. Kjaer, co-author of the study, in a press release.
Earlier studies have pointed out that infertility problems lead to separations, stress, and anxiety in couples. But the present study is unique, the researchers claim, because for the first time scholars have looked into the psychological after-effects of infertility treatments.
Further interventions on marital quality and relationship wellbeing of couples are required to have a complete understanding of the extent of psychological impacts, stated the researchers.
Kurt Zouma could be on their way to Stamford Bridge (Picture: Getty)
Chelsea have agreed terms with St Etienne defender Kurt Zouma, according to reports in France.
Le10Sport suggest the Blues and Zouma have provisionally agreed a five-and-a-half year deal, with Chelsea just needing to finalise a fee with the 19-year-old's club.
Speculation has been mounting this month over Chelsea's interest in the youngster, with Zouma's agent suggesting Inter Milan and Monaco were also chasing their client.

But if the reports emerging from France tonight are to be believed, it looks as though Jose Mourinho has won the race for their signature.
Zouma is expected to come at a price of around £10m, although it remains unclear where they will spend the remainder of the season should they put pen to paper in west London.

In Austin, Texas, a project to offer affordable housing to some 200 chronically homeless citizens is on the move. Community First! Village, which has been in the planning stages for nearly 10 years, is set to soon break ground on a 27-acre property sprinkled with tiny houses, mobile homes, teepees, refurbished RVs, a three-acre community garden, a chapel, a medical facility, a workshop, a bed and breakfast, and an Alamo Drafthouse outdoor movie theater.
Supporter Alan Graham, of Mobile Loaves and Fishes, notes that the price of not housing these folks costs taxpayers about $10 million a year, not to mention the emotional and psychological tolls on the homeless themselves. Graham says that, for the most part, local residents seem to be in favor of the project, “We haven't converted everybody, but when people come out here they go, ‘Oh!' They see a chapel; they see medical and vocational services on site, and they learn that residents will not live there for free; they'll pay a monthly rent.”
Graham has been working with the homeless in their community for more than 14 years and cites broken families as the leading cause of homelessness. With Mobile Loaves and Fishes, Graham has not only helped feed the homeless all these years, but they have helped transition them into homes and jobs, as well. And they have given them hope. Graham views Community First! as the next step in that mission and the next step toward solving homelessness in the U.S.
As the local NPR station (KUT) reports, Alamo Drafthouse's founder Tim League is another outspoken cheerleader for Community First Village. In fact, they enthusiastically call it “the very first ‘yes, in my backyard' project!'”

India became the sixth largest contributor to the increase in global wealth in 2011, the Indian Express reports.
Just in time for the Hindu holiday of Diwali -- a celebration of wealth that marks the biggest shopping season of the year -- a new report by Credit Suisse Research Insitute found that India's total wealth rose $1.3 trillion to reach $4.1 trillion in 2011, the paper said. The bank expects India's wealth to cross $8.9 trillion by 2016 -- a percentage increase equivalent to the amount that the United States grew during the three decades between 1916 and 1946, the paper said.
China, Japan, Australia and India figured among the top six contributors, said the report.
Nevertheless, the “Global Wealth Report” cautioned that India continues to confront significant wealth disparity. It said 43 percent of Indian adults possess assets of less than $1000, well above the world average of 27 percent, the paper said. Meanwhile, 0.4 percent of Indian adults possess more than $100,000.
The same study found Australia to be the wealthiest nation in the world, with half its citizens possessing a net worth of more than $216,000, the World Today reported.
Total global wealth has risen 14 percent to $231 trillion in June 2011 from $203 trillion in January 2010, the paper said. Emerging markets contributed the most to the increase, with the fastest growth seen in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In the next five years, Credit Suisse expects global wealth to rise 50 percent to $345 trillion, with wealth per adult rising 40 percent to $70,700, the paper said.
Asia-Pacific accounted for 36 percent of wealth created since 2000 and 54 percent since 2010, the paper said. North America accounted for just 9.2 percent, and Europe contributed just 4.8 percent over the same period.
A big change is coming to the way medical students are paired (matched) with post-graduate training positions (residencies). Historically, there have been two “matches”: the smaller Osteopathic only match, and the larger ACGME match that allows both traditional Allopathic (MD) and Osteopathic (DO) graduates to participate. The two different match programs also have two separate governing bodies, each having their own requirements for training. While this has worked out okay in the past, it presents several challenges for both medical school graduates and the governing of the residency programs themselves.
For medical students, the primary frustration is that the Osteopathic only match occurs one month prior to the general ACGME match. This may seem trivial at first, but it often forces Osteopathic medical students to either settle for their second (or third, or fourth…) choice in residency training or to only participate in the ACGME match and possibly risk not matching. For example, say my number one choice is ACGME, but my second favorite program is Osteopathic (a fairly frequent occurrence). I now have to choose to either give up a chance at my favorite program, or skip the Osteopathic match completely and risk not matching at either (and ending up farther down my list). Additionally, Osteopathic residency do not allow MD students to apply. Although unfair, this has been less of an issue as the number of Osteopathic residencies make up less than 15% of all training positions, and are usually thought of as being less prestigious.
Residency programs, on the other hand, had a very different problem, although many of the AOA regulators will deny it. The ACGME accrediting body updated its residency requirements in 2015 and there was a possibility that graduates of an Osteopathic residency would not be able to apply or complete an ACGME fellowship. Regardless of the reasons, the AOA and ACGME have worked together to outline a process by which the two programs will merge together to provide a single match system for both Osteopathic an Allopathic graduates.
Who wants the merger?
Overall, the Osteopathic support for the merger has been almost completely divided by age. Older physicians (especially those whose jobs are dependent on keeping the Osteopathic match separate) seem to be overwhelmingly opposed to this process. Norman Gevitz, one of the most outspoken opponents to the merger, continuously spells out doom and gloom for the Osteopathic profession regarding the merger. They actually predict that Osteopathic medicine will ultimately cease to exist as a direct result of combining the accrediting bodies. Ironically, in their position speech they compare Osteopathic medicine to homeopathy and herbal medicine, and states that the collapse of Osteopathy will mirror the decline of those professions. Maybe they do have a reason to be concerned if they feel that DOs are comparable to homeopathic practitioners. (Just to be clear, I do not feel that way at all. But I do find it hilarious that they used that analogy to justify their position)
Students, on the other hand, are in almost complete support of the merger. A survey of 5,307 Osteopathic students (roughly 25% of all those currently enrolled) found that over 82.5% supported the merger, and only 5.6% were opposed. Seeing these results, it seems funny to me that there is a debate at all. The only reasons that I can think of that the previous generation of physicians are so against this process is that a) They will lose money in some way and b) they are so rooted in tradition that they cannot see past their own experiences. When I speak to the faculty/advisors at my (Osteopathic) school, the dialogue almost always degenerates into them telling us that students can't understand why it's so terrible, but we will. Essentially: you'll understand when you're older. In the end, the merger is happening, and it will come with growing pains.
Will residencies survive the merger?
With the January 1st deadline for surgical specialties to apply for ACGME accreditation, one question is on the front of every fourth-year medical student's mind: Are Osteopathic surgical hopefuls doomed? The answer is that you're not doomed, but it's complicated. On September 16th of this year, the AOA released a response to highly negative position held by Norman Gevitz (discussed above). In the release, they outline a rosy picture and state that they are “on-track” in regards to programs applying for accreditation. As of September, over half of the Osteopathic programs had applied for accreditation, and programs that are 3-years or less in length have more than a year to still apply.
Despite the initial good news, there has been some concern over the surgical specialties. In the September update, the AOA reported that 58% of general surgery, 64% of orthopedics, 52% of ENT, and 44% of OBGYN programs had submitted applications for pre-accreditation. The major outlier was ophthalmology, where only 2 of the 14 programs had applied. Other than ophthalmology, these numbers are encouraging. However, it is important to note that when this was published there was only approximately 3 months left for these programs to apply. If the program directors are anything like me, these applications will come in at 11:59PM on December 31st, but it still concerns me a little.
So, have these numbers improved?
As my rank list is coming due, I wanted to see how the Osteopathic surgical specialties are faring. I interviewed at both AOA and ACGME programs, but am greatly concerned about the future of some of the AOA programs. Here is an update as to how many programs have applied per specialty:
Overall, the Osteopathic surgical specialties look to be surviving the merger, with the notable exception of Ophthalmology (which is getting destroyed). The drop in OBGYN is also alarming, as these programs fit into the primary care category that DOs are strongly supportive of. It does, however, seem that Osteopathic applicants this year have a reduced likelihood of matching into the “cutting” specialties, especially if you want to be an eye dentist. To be fair, this chart was created based on information from the ACGME website as of December 7th. It is entirely possible that more programs will be added right before the deadline, making these changes less extreme.
Why are surgical programs on the chopping block?
This is going to be purely anecdotal, but I asked this question (tastefully) to any program director I could, and got answers from 3-4 of them. The overall consensus was that there is a significant cost associated with meeting the pre-accreditation guidelines, the man hours in paperwork, forging new agreements between departments etc. One program director that I spoke with estimated the cost to be somewhere between $60,000-$120,000 per resident when all was said and done. Surgical residents are at the higher end of that range, while non-procedural specialties are on the lower end. All of the program directors agreed that hospitals are prioritizing the specialties they require to keep the hospital running: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Family Medicine, General Surgery etc. This which explains why the surgical sub-specialties may lag behind, but does not explain who OBGYN is so far behind, or why all of the ENT programs are surviving. One thing is certain – the future is a little bit murky for students currently applying for the Osteopathic surgical programs this year.
Do you think the merger spells doom for the Osteopathic profession? What about the surgical specialties? Let us know in the comments!

While the Miami Hurricanes remain focused on the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, there's no getting away from the week's biggest story—the NCAA's investigation and case against the University of Miami finally coming to a close.
The span between Charles Robinson's Yahoo! Sports expose and today's announcement took a whopping 798 days. In the end, time served in a sense, with the NCAA giving Miami much credit for two self-imposed bowl bans, as well as sitting out last year's ACC Championship Game.
During that time, the University of Miami was also said to have been "incredibly cooperative" in the process, per NCAA president Mark Emmert, despite corrupt behavior by NCAA investigators that turned the entire case upside down.
The above video shows how far this story has evolved over the past 26 months—beginning with professional journalists and media members calling for the "death penalty" days after the Robinson piece was released in August 2011.
All the while, head coach Al Golden and their players stayed the course. The punches kept coming, in the form of heartbreaking losses, players being removed from the program and negative recruiting by rivals that cost the Hurricanes on the recruiting front.
Despite all the finger pointing, corruption and they said/she said involved with this intricate case, a true testament to the current coaching staff and players who never flinched during the process.
News of this story broke weeks before Golden coached their first game at Miami, and now 30 showdowns later, the Canes will play their first game of the Golden era without this constant distraction.
Whatever side of the ledger an individual is on in the wake of this groundbreaking case, it's impossible to not be happy for Golden and their kids—none of which were involved in any improprieties.
These current players and coaches forfeited two bowl games and a shot at a conference crown and BCS game last year. The result: poetic justice as Miami now sits undefeated at 6-0 and No. 7 (AP/BCS) going into this weekend's home showdown with Wake Forest.
Safe to say Sun Life Stadium will be rocking a little bit harder than expected this Saturday come noon, and with good reason. The city of Miami can finally exhale after holding its collective breath for way too long.
Intel raised its full-year outlook and reported quarterly earnings that easily topped analysts' expectations on Thursday.
Here's how the company did compare with what Wall Street expected:
Adjusted EPS: $1.01 vs. 80 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters
Overall revenue: $16.15 billion vs. $15.73 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters
Client computing revenue: $8.86 billion vs. $8.68 billion expected, according to StreetAccount
Data center revenue: $4.88 billion vs. $4.79 billion expected, according to StreetAccount
Intel said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion. That's up from its previous forecast for earnings of $3.00 per share on $61.3 billion in revenue.
The company reported net income of $4.52 billion. That figure represent's 34 percent year-over-year growth.
In the year-ago quarter, Intel reported adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on $15.78 billion in revenue.
Shares of Intel gained more than 1 percent in after-hours trade.
The stock has been on a tear this year, gaining 14 percent as of its Thursday close. During the normal session, shares of Intel set a fresh 52-week intraday high of $41.58.
While the client computing group still brings in the lion's share of overall revenue, Intel has been shifting its focus away from the personal computer market amid declining PC shipments. The segment reported better-than-expected revenue of $8.86 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year.
The company has instead highlighted its opportunities in new markets such as artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure.
Earlier this month, Intel said it is collaborating with Facebook to develop artificial intelligence chips for data centers.
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorPelosi warns GOP: Next president could declare national emergency on guns Ousted GOP lawmaker David Brat named dean at Liberty University business school Trump, GOP seeks to shift blame for shutdown to Pelosi MORE (R-Va.) on Wednesday amplified vows that Congress will provide emergency aid to victims of Hurricane Irene, but they declined to say whether Republicans will insist the funding be offset with cuts elsewhere.
“I believe there's an appropriate federal role, and the monies will be there,” Cantor told reporters in their district, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

In a tweet later in the day, they doubled down on that promise.
“As I've said continuously, we will find the monies for disaster relief,” they tweeted.
Cantor churned headlines this week after telling Fox News that congressional lawmakers “are going to have to make sure” that federal aid in response to the storm is accompanied by “savings elsewhere” in the budget.
Asked by Fox on Monday if “any federal money that comes out for Hurricane Irene needs to be met dollar for dollar with spending cuts,” Cantor responded, “Well, yeah.”
“Just like any family would operate when it's struck with disaster, it finds the money to take care of a sick loved one or what have you, and then goes without trying to buy a new car or [putting] an addition onto the house,” Cantor told Fox.
Cantor's office softened that position Tuesday, saying Congress should “find offsets whenever possible,” because “that is the responsible thing to do.”
Still, the Fox remarks caught the attention of the White House, which questioned why Cantor didn't push harder for offsets under the Bush administration, when Republicans ran up trillions of dollars in debt on unfunded programs.
In 2004, Cantor helped secure nearly $20 million in federal help for their district in the wake of Tropical Storm Gaston. At the time, there was no call for offsetting the funds.
Cantor on Wednesday said the controversy surrounding their Fox remarks has been blown out of proportion.
“The attempt to try and portray this as some kind of political issue — it's not,” Cantor told the Times-Dispatch. “We have a budget issue for sure, we all know that.”
The arrival of Irene — coming just days after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit Cantor's district — has left the Virginia Republican in a tough spot. On one hand, he's emerged as a national figure and Tea Party favorite, which puts pressure on them to rein in deficit spending at every turn. On the other hand, he's also under pressure to bring home the bacon for a district hit with two major natural disasters in the course of a week.
Cantor on Wednesday suggested no tension between those dual roles, noting that Republicans have already passed additional funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency as part of the GOP's Homeland Security appropriations bill — funds that were offset by cuts elsewhere.
“The House has approved funding,” they tweeted; “the Senate needs to act.”
Still, Senate Democrats are opposed to some of the cuts in the GOP bill. Sen. Mary Landrieu Mary Loretta LandrieuLobbying world Former New Orleans mayor: It's not my 'intention' to run for president Dems grasp for way to stop Trump's Supreme Court pick MORE (D-La.), who heads the Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security, has scheduled a markup next week of the Democrats' version of the FEMA funding bill.
But a House Democratic leadership aide said Wednesday that it's “highly unlikely” the parties could agree on reconciling the two bills in time to help Irene victims.
“Are House Republicans willing to shut down the federal government in order to satisfy their demands for offsets on disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Irene?” the Democratic aide asked.
Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) warned Wednesday that a delay in aid could have dramatic effects on victims of the storm. In a letter to Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerEx-GOP lawmaker joins marijuana trade group Crowley, Shuster moving to K Street On unilateral executive action, Mitch McConnell was right — in 2014 MORE (R-Ohio), the New Orleans lawmaker called on Republican leaders to abandon thoughts of demanding offsets.
“If this was the policy after Hurricane Katrina,” Richmond wrote, “survivors would have been waiting for months or even years for assistance.”
Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) sounded a similar note Tuesday, saying deficit-reduction concerns should take a back seat to getting aid to victims.
“My concern is that we help people in need,” McDonnell said during their monthly radio address. “For the FEMA money that's going to flow, it's up to them on how they get it. I don't think it's the time to get into that debate.”
Even before the storm hit, McDonnell had appealed to FEMA for emergency aid to 10 Virginia districts, including Cantor's. The agency granted all of those requests this week.
McDonnell spokesperson Jeff Caldwell said Wednesday that officials are still in the early stages of assessing the damage left by Irene. If there's enough damage “of the eligible kind,” Caldwell added, “then we'll more than likely be applying for more [help].”
Caldwell and federal officials have indicated that the final assessment could take a week or two.
A few updates:
Shortly after sending my complaint to Uber, I received a favorable response and apology from customer service, including an adjustment of the fare from XL to X. I also learned that to protect rider and driver privacy, riders and drivers cannot view ratings for a specific trip. Driver-partners will never see exactly which rider or which trip received a specific rating and vice versa.
For those commenters questioning the fact that it was indeed just my husband and I in the car, I can assure that we didn't get *that* lucky in Vegas.
For those commenters who think it's ridiculous that I even gave them a 4, I wholeheartedly agree with you. Looking back, they deserved a 2.
For those commenters who think there are pieces missing to my account, you're right; somewhere in the middle of the ride, we learned that they were a part-time sushi chef and was good friends with the owner of our favorite local restaurant.
In general, it's always sad when a few bad apples ruin things for the masses. I've always been an Uber loyalist, and have always raved about the service I've used for years.
Even though I've had some less than stellar experiences (everything from being in a car that was side swiped, the occasional rude driver, and even a “kidnapping scare” during my brother's first ride), I still love Uber, and I have close to 100 rides under my belt.
The good thing about Uber is that both drivers and passengers are rated at the end of the ride to help weed out “bad apples”. We all know how important maintaining a good rating is, and I always make sure I rate honestly and accurately to encourage good service.
For example, you're not getting a 5-star rating from me if you're rude, you're smoking, chatting on your phone while driving me, or engaging in other unprofessional activity.
Sadly, it looks like I've encountered a bad apple 2 days ago when my husband and I rode home from Newark airport. It was 1:30 in the morning, and we just returned from Las Vegas. We were tired, and couldn't wait to get home to the kids. We called an Uber and were assigned a driver with a 4.7 rating.
The driver called immediately and said “can I pick you up somewhere else? There are too many police at arrivals.” Fine, no problem. We went upstairs to the departures level to meet him. When we entered the car, we weren't greeted at all, and for the entire ride, they were asking us to navigate for them because they were too busy talking loudly on the phone in another language while they were driving.
I was getting annoyed after they almost missed an exit for the 3rd time. Midway through the ride, I texted my husband, who was sitting next to me, saying “Wow. 3 stars. 4 at most”.
When we arrived home they said, “Make sure you give me 5 stars.”. I took it with a grain of salt and got my ride receipt of $40 and change. I decided to be nice and give them 4 stars, even though that's a stretch.
I guess they didn't like that too much.
About an hour ago, I received an email in my inbox saying that I would be charged the UberXL fare based on the number of passengers in the car. My new bill was $72 and change. So their interpretation of my rating was telling Uber they drove 4-6 passengers?!? Um no. I was fuming.
I remember hearing about plenty of sneaky driver scams, but this one takes the cake. I later researched and learned through an Uber drivers' forum that drivers do this to customers as a way to “get back at them”.
I immediately contacted Uber and shared my complaint, and if this doesn't get resolved, I will absolutely file a chargeback. This type of fraud should be taken very seriously, and I hope this driver is permanently removed from the program.
Have you ever been a victim of a similar scam while using Uber?

The major league trade deadline has come and gone, leaving in its wake a flurry of activity that saw pitchers such as Zack Greinke, Anibal Sanchez, Ryan Dempster and Wandy Rodriguez change teams.
In ESPN standard leagues, however, the trade deadline is still a week away, with all deals needing to be accepted before Friday, Aug. 10, at noon ET. The question is this: Exactly how much does your fantasy team stand to benefit from making a blockbuster move similar to the ones made by major league teams?
Team chemistry doesn't come into play. The decision to make a deal or not comes down to one thing and one thing alone: cold, emotionless mathematics. To that end, let's take a quick look at the numbers to see if it makes sense for you to go after that No. 1 starting pitcher, and if so, how much you should give up to make the deal happen.
Although we recognize that not every league uses the same rules, for the purpose of this discussion, we're going to look at a standard 12-team 5x5 ESPN league. At this stage of the season (almost at the two-thirds mark), an "average" team might expect to have the following statistics:
"Average" team: 930 IP, 3.79 ERA, 1.26 WHIP, 822 K's
We're going to ignore wins, since it's the one category a pitcher has little control over. For instance, a starter can give up six runs in the first two innings and end up winning (see Ervin Santana versus the Rockies on June 10), or they could pitch 10 shutout innings and get a no-decision, a la Cliff Lee on April 18. So let's stick to the categories that pitchers have some control over.
First off, let's take a look at the absolute ceiling for success. Let's assume that the "average" staff continues to produce numbers the rest of the way that are similar to what they have done so far this season. Furthermore, let's assume that the top pitchers in the league will make 12 more starts in 2012.
The best they can do, obviously, is throw 12 perfect games. So if we were to add 108 perfect innings (and for the sake of argument, we'll also add a sterling 13.5 K's/9 rate) to the expected final numbers instead of the expected statistics you might get from a No. 5 starter, you would end up with the absolute dream scenario for your team.
In this experiment, we will use Bronson Arroyo (No. 60 among starting pitchers on the ESPN Player Rater entering Thursday's games) as our "No. 5 starter" to be replaced by our imaginary automaton. Doing so would yield the following final stat lines:
That's your maximum return on trading for an ace at this point of the season. An improvement of 0.10 in WHIP and a 0.28 ERA boost. But of course, you're not going to get that. Let's scale back those expectations to the realm of reality. Let's swap out Bronson Arroyo for someone you conceivably could trade for: Justin Verlander.
In that scenario, your improvement is not nearly as marked:
We've just swung a deal for the No. 1 pitcher on the Player Rater and gotten rid of Bronson Arroyo and all it got us was 0.02 in WHIP and 0.13 in ERA. And those numbers will hold true regardless of what your starting ERA and WHIP might be, so long as you keep the number of innings pitched constant. Unless your team's current IP total is way off from our estimated 930, you're not going to see much variance in these ratios.
Of course, we're assuming that all of your current pitchers pretty much continue at the same pace they've been on thus far this season. In all reality, some will likely surpass those expectations by a bit, while others will regress a bit. At the end of the day, that will probably all come out in the wash.
Verlander, on the other hand, gives you one shot at catching the goose that lays the golden egg. If they don't keep up their current pace, you've traded away for even less of a return than the paltry amount their projected 0.99 WHIP and 2.66 ERA would net you.
Is that worth what you're giving away?
My guess is that it is not, but a quick look at your league's standings will settle that argument once and for all. How many points do you truly stand to gain from such a move? Now factor in the counting stats you might lose from the hitters you are giving up in the deal to get a guy like Verlander.
I'll ask you again: Is that worth what you're giving away?
Now, let's say you are the one who owns Justin Verlander and are getting offers to try and lure them away from your clutches. Should you let the Detroit Tigers ace go? Again, let's look at our projected numbers, this time from the other angle: replacing Verlander with Arroyo on your league-average squad.
Once you build up a big enough cushion in the ratio categories of ERA and WHIP, it's hard to lose too much ground, even when you go from a Verlander to an Arroyo. In fact, given the possibility that Verlander could end up regressing closer to their career 3.44 ERA and 1.17 WHIP, does Arroyo's projected 3.82 ERA and 1.23 look all that frightening?
Now add in the value of the guys being offered to you for Verlander, say a package that includes Matt Holliday. Because hitters can give you four categories worth of counting stats (versus only two for starting pitchers: strikeouts and those elusive wins), how can you possibly say no?
The fact of the matter is, unless you're in a keeper league where "next year" comes into play, by the time we've reached the fantasy baseball trade deadline, in terms of pitching, the die has firmly been cast. Unless you find yourself in a multiple-team logjam in ERA and WHIP where the tiniest improvement could net you several spots in the standings, you really have no place to go.
So, don't go giving away your offensive weapons in search of a holy grail that simply doesn't exist. And don't hold on to those Cy Young favorites at the expense of upgrading your hitting statistics simply because they're the best at what they do.
At this stage of the season, starting pitching simply isn't worth as much as it was back in April. If you don't realize that, you're going to have a very long September.
This post gives a short review of the aggregate function as used for data.frames and presents some interesting uses: from the trivial but handy to the most complicated problems I have solved with aggregate.
Aggregate is a function in base R which can, as the name suggests, aggregate the inputted data.frame d.f by applying a function specified by the FUN parameter to each column of sub-data.frames defined by the by input parameter.
The by parameter has to be a list . However, since data.frame ‘s are handled as (named) lists of columns, one or more columns of a data.frame can also be passed as the by parameter. Interestingly, if these columns are of the same data.frame as the one inputted as x , those columns are not passed on to the FUN function.
The function to apply has to be able to accept a vector (since it will be called with parts of a column of a data.frame as input).
The sub-data.frames defined by the by input parameter can be thought of as logical indexing:
d.f <- data.frame(rating = c("AAA", "A", "A", "AAA", "BB", "BB", "AAA", "A")) i <- 1 by <- d.f$rating sub.data.frame <- d.f[by == unique(by)[i], ]
and do this for every i between 1 and length(unique(by)) . Note that the by variable doesn't have to agree with one (or more) column of the data.frame but could be anything. Hence, one can reproduce the aggregate functionality by a for cycle running the cycle variable over the unique values of the variable passed as by and an sapply applying the function passed as FUN to each column of the data.frame sub.data.frame. Such a workaround however would be very difficult to document, as it would be unclear what (and why) this code is actually doing.
Aggregate always returns a data.frame as a result. This data.frame will contain the (now unique) values from the input parameter by as the first column and then columns containing the results of the call to the function in the FUN parameter applied to the parts of the columns of the inputted data.frame . It is interesting to note that if the function FUN returns multiple values, the class of the columns of the result data.frame will be list or something a list can be cast to (see the last example below).
It is important to note that the function call is applied to nameless vectors rather than named columns of a data.frame and hence referring to the names of the data.frame will not work, nor will column references such as s.d.f[,1] .
Basic Examples
The most basic uses of aggregate involve base functions such as mean and sd . It is indeed one of the most common uses of aggregate to compare the mean or other properties of sample groups.
Recently I reproduced calculations from an Excel sheet. Most formulae were subtotals and grand totals. The Excel sheet was not very comfortably organized for this purpose: sums over rows, columns and totals of those sums were used. In R, I have changed the data to a star schema representation (when all metadata are represented row-wise and every value gets its own row) using reshape2 package and melt then used aggregate along different variables to get the different totals. The fewer variables you use in by the more aggregated the end-result: the grand total along a dimension is simply using that dimension as “by”, while subtotals can be achieved using multiple variables as by . The FUN in this case was of course sum .
One handy use of aggregate and a base function is getting the number of appearances of the various values:
values <- data.frame(value = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "c")) nr.of.appearances <- aggregate(x = values, by = list(unique.values = values$value), FUN = length)
My favourite use of aggregate with a base function is getting the last day of each month in a series of dates. To do so, one can use the following code (assuming your dates are stored in a “YYYY-MM-DD” format as strings or as Date ):
dates <- data.frame(date = as.Date("2001-01-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d") + 0:729) dates last.day <- aggregate(x = dates["date"], by = list(month = substr(dates$date, 1, 7)), FUN = max) last.day date 1 2001-01-01 2 2001-01-02 3 2001-01-03 4 2001-01-04 ..... month date 1 2001-01 2001-01-31 2 2001-02 2001-02-28 3 2001-03 2001-03-31 4 2001-04 2001-04-30 .....
This came in very handy when working with banking information where the last day of the month depended on banking holidays as well as weekends.
Advanced Uses
More advanced uses of aggregate depend on writing your own function , e.g. anonymous functions passed on as the FUN parameter. To do so, one can use the syntax
# do not run the syntax aggregate(x = d.f, by = by.list, FUN = function(s.d.f){y <- s.d.f; return(y)}
The possible uses range from calling complex portfolio risk metrics for the homogeneous risk groups of a portfolio via fitting a distribution to categories of samples to anything you can image, really.
Here is an example with a “complex” portfolio risk metric (exposure to different counterparties in different asset classes):
assets <- data.frame(asset.class = c("equity", "equity","equity", "option","option","option", "bond", "bond"), rating = c("AAA", "A", "A", "AAA", "BB", "BB", "AAA", "A"), counterparty.a = c(runif(3), rnorm(5)), counterparty.b = c(runif(3), rnorm(5)), counterparty.c = c(runif(3), rnorm(5))) assets asset.class rating counterparty.a counterparty.b counterparty.c 1 equity AAA 0.9026004 0.6029417 0.8629453 2 equity A 0.8834034 0.5809589 0.4654721 3 equity A 0.1007586 0.9368537 0.3090811 4 option AAA -1.0508915 0.7171532 0.2224984 .....
Here is the use of aggregate() function.
exposures <- aggregate(x = assets[c("counterparty.a", "counterparty.b", "counterparty.c")], by = assets[c("asset.class", "rating")], FUN = function(market.values){ sum(pmax(market.values, 0)) }) exposures asset.class rating counterparty.a counterparty.b counterparty.c 1 bond A 1.0038714 0.6382029 2.2822936 2 equity A 0.9841620 1.5178126 0.7745532 3 bonds AAA 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 4 equity AAA 0.9026004 0.6029417 0.8629453 .....
Next up: fitting a Gaussian distribution to observations by categories:
library(MASS) categories <- data.frame(category = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "c")) observations <- data.frame(observation = c(rnorm(5, mean = 3, sd = 0.2), rnorm(5, mean = -2, sd = 0.4), rnorm(4, mean = 0, sd = 1)))
Below we use the aggregate() function to find the mean and standard deviation by categories.
distr.estimate <- aggregate(x = observations, by = categories, FUN = function(observations){ fitdistr(observations, densfun = "normal")$estimate }) distr.estimate category observation.mean observation.sd 1 a 3.0606926 0.1779962 2 b -2.1446040 0.1658481 3 c -0.1881841 0.5613013
This last example showcases several interesting properties. First, the data.frame to aggregate and the list of by variables don't have to be the same. While this is implied in other places of the post, this is an explicit example of such a setup. Secondly, the function passed as FUN is not only an anonymous function, it is curried from a function with more than one input parameter. A function of a single input variable observations has been created from the two-input variable function fitdistr : fixing one of the input variables by setting densfun = "normal" . Thirdly, rather than returning the full return value of the fitdistr function, the return value is restricted to the element estimate from the return value. And last but not least, the return value of the anonymous function passed to FUN consists of two variables and not only one. Interestingly, aggregate casts the return value from list to a matrix and names the elements for us. However, these names can't be used to reference the columns of the matrix. You can however reference them as follows:
distr.estimate$observation[1,][["mean"]] [1] 3.016988
Closing Words
I hope that you have found the above useful. Now that you are more familiar with aggregate , it is time for the truth: everything above and much more can be done with data.table , and with a much faster performance. However, data.table has a complex syntax and one really has to understand how things work under the hood, while aggregate is simple and insightful. Until you are comfortable with both the logic of aggregation and the syntax of data.table , it is a worthy investment to first write the code using aggregate and then optimize it by rewriting it using data.table .
For those of you who are interested, a dedicated post is coming where the above is redone with data.table , along with some additional use cases specific to data.table .

I will start by saying if this build shares similarities with other ppls build It's because there are only so many ways to make a dual obliteration build life based berserker.
This ONLY person i want to thank is Milkyslice as it was their vid that made me adjust my tree for more jewels and also dropped mine dmge and switch from Bladefall to BV. Plus it not that i want POE fame It's that i want to share this build with ppl to allow them to do any content without following the current meta of did mathil do it....
If this build existed prior to milky posting it then kudos to the guy that did it, just saying from my experience thats the only place i got ideas from.
Why the name? well things go POP and i recently had the pleasure of seeing this
So why a berserker? coz cloaked in savagrey and vaal pact is broken as fck but im using the tools provided to me by GGG so i have no issues in using it, aspect of carnage fits perfectly with the core goal of this build which is to stack as many "more" multipliers as possible.
Main goal of this build
Main goal of this build is to utilise a fast hitting skill to apply as many stacks of poison as possible, then combine this with as many more multiplying double dips as possible.
Whats a doubledip? if by now you haven't heard of it, its basicaly any dmge multiplier that impacts the initial hit and also impacts the poison that follows.
there are other ways of amplifying the poison dmge that are not direct MORE dmge type such as grabing the inc skill effect duration nodes this is because the longer the poison stacks remains the more stacks we can apply, for example applying a 1000 dmge poison stack once every .2s give u 10k poison dmge in the base duration of 2s if we extend that duration to say 4s we double our poison dmge! granted the extra dmge wont be noticable if your killing everything within a few seconds.
The other goal is to keep it as cheap as possible, with room to scale if your rich.

Kill OR Alira up to you really depends on how far you wanna lvl.
Kill
Gear
Gem set up
Wand B-B-G = AA + Blas + Vuln
Wand B-B-R = Wither + SpellTotem + Vaal Lightning Trap
Helmet R-R-R-B = CWDT + Imm Call+Inc Dur + Vaal Clarity
Chest G-G-G-B-B-B = BV + Poison + Void Manip + Added Chaos + Controled Dest + (Inc duration if your easy mode mapping or Inc area eff or Faster casting depends on what YOU like - Bosses put in Conc eff.
Boots R-R-G-B = Rallying cry + inc Duration + vaal haste + Light golem
Gloves B-B-G-R = Flamedash + (CWDT + Bladefall HIGH LVL) + fastercasting OR conc effect.
How to level Start by using a bow.. thats right ranged is faster than melee so a bow + flame totem will get you to 15 in no time.
for skill tree pathing immediately head for the jewel socket near the life cluster and slot in a hidden potential, start using BV ASAP with nothing but blue gear and running BV (using DPS supports like added light, added cold etc) you will just walk through normal , cruel and most of merc.
Use two wands (blue) with Spell Damage and cast speed.
You will need mana pots like mad early on but its worth it. Path to inc skill duration nodes ASAP then over to VP.
dont dilly dally around just run run run through to objectives even if you are 10 lvls under the area you will still destroy everything once you hit lvl 56 grab two obliteration wands and start popping :).
SAVE YOUR ALTS TILL YOU HIT LVL 71 MAPS!!!!! hope that got your attention, you will need them ALOT of them so save em up you can get to lvl 71 maps with the worst gear so you dont need to use them yet.Once you hit lvl 71 maps map out what base items you need based on your resists on jewels start alting them for T1 HP + any res or craft a res in there.
@ lvl 65 start hitting the jewel nodes craft jewels with 7% HP + damage + Area dmge + res if you need it. Once you have around 20-30c buy as many +15% phy to chaos obliterations as u can and colour link them then start Vaaling to get + culling as its global and is basically a 10% more multiplier. (not really but 10% less hp same effect)
Dream gear
6L Cospri's would free up a gem slot and enable you to keep the nice inc dmge from vuln in hexproof maps and allows you to run a defensive curse like temp chain or enfeeble.
getting tier 1 HP and res on your blues will eventually enable you start dropping res for things like Str and cast speed.
a full set of jewels with Inc Area Dmge , Dmge , 7% hp and , 10% All ele would allow you to get your gear to nothing but life+(str , cast speed , chaos dmge etc etc).
Getting a set of Vuln on hit gloves would free some mana up for maybe a res aura or if you already using 2x curse to bring back AA.
the obvious +1 gems 6l chest would be tits also even if its not a Cospri's.

(gods of celestial realm)(accomplished mystic beings with supernatural power), and(revered sages) were offered their prayer to Lord Ramacandra in Yogisvara Ramayana or Javanese Ramayana. The language used here was archaic Javanese called Kawi, the language of the poets (Kavi). Yogisvara Ramayana might be the oldest of all Itihasa ever translated to Javanese Kawi language. You can see many Sanskrit words still used in these Ramayana's slokas. This translation of Srimad Ramayana was considered by many scholars as the most beautiful among all Javanese ancient Hindu literary works. As I said in previous posts, these Ramayana truly presenting Vaishnavite tenets by establishing the supremacy of Lord Vishnu in Their Form as Lord Ramacandra.“Lord, You have assumed these various forms, but actually They were non-different from Your very Self. You are the sole shelter of the three worlds; You are the life and soul of everything, moving and non moving, the highest and the lowest.”“There is no creation without You. Since You are the very cause and life of everything. You are the origin of the highest Brahma and all other beings, even the tip of a blade of grass. That is You, the supreme consciousness of all living beings.”“Our mind only could grasp You that far O Great Self. Your divine qualities are very deep and fathomless. You are subtler than the subtlest. Even for the great rishis, You are remained a deep secret. Whatever we could say were just a few words full of limitation and nothing more than a little bit mantras to glorify Your Self.”“Since Your Divine Form is inconceivable, all rishis cannot speak anything more about You. As the limit of the unlimited independence, unlimited power, and unlimited prowess, such the limitless nature of Your Self, The Supreme Person. Thus speak all rishis in one voice.”“Thus we pour our heart only to reveal Your Truth. So the whole world may gain all goodness and the wicked will vanish. Let all holy personages become ever blissful as fully blossoming flowers, as the rain of jewel in the autumn.”“Thus all rishis glorify and worship The Lord. All devas, siddhas, caranas, etc. in thunderous voices proclaim all victory (jaya jaya) to the Son of Raghu Dynasty (Lord Ramacandra). The rain of flowers and fragrant powder were showering from the sky and outer space.”This Ramayana was the masterpiece of literary work of Central Java Mataram civilization and the Trinatha temple of Prambanan (Parambrahman) was the masterpiece of sacred architectural work. Both were constructed under the patronage of pious Javanese Hindu King, probably Raka i Pikatan and continued by their descendant, Raka i Kayuwangi (Sri Maharaja Sajjanotsavottungadeva or Dyah Lokapala (856 – 886 ce). The acts of Ramayana were sculpted on Prambanan temple's wall.After the reign of Raka i Wawa – Sri Vijayalokanathottunga (924 – 929 ce), the capital of Javanese Hindu Kingdom and the centre of civilization was removed to East Java from Central Java. This was the beginning of the reign of Ishanavansa established by mPu Sindok or Sri Maharaja Ishanottungadeva, the heir of Central Java's Sanjayavansha. The growing power of Srivijaya in Sumatra and natural disasters supposed to be the cause of this resettlement of Javanese Hindu Kingdom. Srivijaya was the greatest kingdom at that time, with powerful maritime domination in South East Asia region. Even the name Suvarnabhumi, the greater India, land of golden lustre became the sole name of Sumatra under Srivijaya.
OLYMPIA, Wash. - Lawmakers say they have reached agreement "in principle" on a new two-year operating budget, but won't release any details.
After budget negotiators met throughout the night, Gov. Jay Inslee released a statement about the agreement Wednesday morning, saying that legislative leaders were confident they would have a vote on the budget before the end of the day Friday. That would put them within hours of a deadline to avert a partial government shutdown.
The rest of the Legislature wasn't expected to be briefed on details of the agreement until Thursday, and the public won't see the information until after that occurs.
The Democratic-controlled House and Republican-led Senate have been struggling for months to find compromise on a budget that addresses a state Supreme Court mandate on education funding. They are in the midst of a third overtime session, and if a new budget isn't signed into law by midnight Friday, a partial shutdown starts July 1.
Deal In Principle Reached On State Operating Budget #waleg pic.twitter.com/8QXUeKTJMI — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 28, 2017
While lawmakers are optimistic a shutdown will be avoided, Washington State Parks is still planning on closing parks Friday just in case the deal is not signed by the Friday night deadline.
"If we don't hear something definitive from the governor's office, then we'll start down that path," said Mike Sternback, assistant director of Washington State Parks.
John Lester, from Bellingham, was planning on spending the weekend camping at Millersylvania State Park. Planning for a potential shutdown could cut their camping trip short.
"That is silly," said Lester, "That seems like a waste of resources because they (lawmakers) can't get their stuff straight."

Greg Dashnaw, trainer for the Siena College men's basketball team, figured he'd seen the last of the 1988 National Invitation Tournament ring that was stolen from their Albany apartment in 1991.
That's why Dashnaw was “stunned” last week when they got a call from the Siena human resources office last week to tell them an anonymous visitor had dropped off the missing ring, which is colored silver with a green stone.
“He said something about they found it in their house in a cup,” said Dashnaw, adding the man didn't leave a name or number. “It may have been sitting in this cup for years. I'm just glad to have it back. It still fits. How about that? … Whoever expects to get something like that back, especially after (23) years?”
Dashnaw, 55, has worked for Siena for three decades. Though they didn't know the monetary value of the ring, Dashnaw attaches great sentimental importance to the jewelry, which honors the 1988 Saints who won the North Atlantic Conference regular-season title before losing at Boston College in the first round of the NIT.
“First of all, it's still got the Indian logo on it,” said Dashnaw, referring to Siena's old nickname. “And it was the first championship ring I ever had. And that was a good team, one of our best teams.”
Dashnaw's name is misspelled on the ring, which is missing the ‘n.'
Also still missing is Dashnaw's 1989 NCAA Tournament ring that was taken in the same theft in 1991.
Jet Airways has initiated an internal inquiry into the matter (File picture of a Jet Airways plane taking off)
While the plane they were flying plunged 5,000 feet, a Jet Airways pilot was asleep and the co-pilot was busy on an iPad checking out flight information. Both have been suspended by aviation regulator DGCA which is now investigating the incident.280 passengers were on the flight from Mumbai to Newark via Brussels when it fell from 34,000 feet to 29,000 feet, according to the Press Trust of India.A spokesperson for Jet, however, told NDTV that the descent was of about 2,000 feet. While the plane was in Turkish airspace, Air Traffic Controllers noted the descent and sent an emergency message to the aircraft ordering it to climb back up. The co-pilot then woke up the commander.Both pilots were summoned by the DGCA yesterday for questioning. While the commander said they were on "controlled rest", a short nap inside the cockpit which is allowed by flight operation procedures, the co-pilot testified that they were working on their iPad which had aircraft documents loaded on to it, said unnamed sources to the Press Trust of India.Confirming the incident, an airline spokesperson said Jet Airways has initiated an internal inquiry into the matter."The airline is also extending all co-operation in the matter to the DGCA by providing all necessary assistance for the inquiry," the spokesperson said.The DGCA is now dissecting Jet Airways' training procedures for pilots.The regulator also wants to know why the airline or the pilots failed to report the incident to it - an anonymous message to the DGCA disclosed the mid-air scare.While both the pilots kept flying until they were grounded two days ago, they did not file a flight safety report, which is a mandatory exercise to document any unusual incident during the course of a flight

"Trump Force One" received a special send-off at New York's Laguardia Airport this morning.
Two Port Authority vehicles gave the Boeing 757 a "water salute," spraying massive hoses to form arches over the president-elect's aircraft while it taxied on the runway.
Trump was departing the Big Apple for Washington, D.C., where they were set to meet with President Obama at the White House.
The water salute is typically done for Air Force One, visiting world leaders and military officials. It was also done for heroic pilot Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, Jon Scott said on Happening Now.

A little after 1:00 pm on Tuesday, September 3, 1878, Charles Stannard saw their twenty-two-year-old daughter, Mary, leave their home in the Rockland, Connecticut carrying a tin pail; they were off to pick berries, just a few hundred yards away. Mary never reached their destination. At 6:00 that evening, Mary's father found their lifeless body lying in the path leading from the house. They had been stabbed in the throat and left lying on their back with their hands folded across their stomach. As the news spread through town, so did rumors and speculations as to their killer. By Thursday all speculation pointed to one man: Mary's Methodist pastor and onetime employer, the Reverend Herbert H. Hayden.
Mary E. Stannard was described as “a very simple, easy-minded girl.” They were known to be honest, but easily influenced and manipulated by others. Around two years before their death, Mary gave birth to a son out of wedlock. The father was a married man living in another town. In the 1870s most women in this situation would be treated as outcasts, but Mary was more an object of pity than blame. Mary's friends and neighbors made it clear that they saw them not as a sinner, but one who had been sinned against, and did what they could to help them
Reverend Herbert H. Hayden, the thirty-eight-year-old, newly appointed Methodist minister of Rockland took a special interest in Mary's case. In the winter of 1877 they were preaching and teaching school in Madison, ten miles away, requiring them to be away from their family much of the week. They and their wife hired Mary Stannard to help with the chores and keep their wife company while the Reverend was away.
Neighbors began to suspect that Reverend Hayden's relationship with Mary went beyond that of employer and employee. They had been seen together “in lots, and other unfrequented places, evenings.” One instance that many remembered was an oyster supper to benefit the Rockland church in March 1878. The Haydens had left their three children in Mary Stannard's care as they attended the supper. The site of the supper was not far from the Hayden's home, and at one point in the evening, Reverend Hayden excused themselves and went home to check on the children. It was alleged that during their absence they were engaging in improper intimacy with Mary Stannard.
In August 1878 Mary, in a despondent state, went to live with their friend, Mrs. Jane Studley, in Guilford, Connecticut. When Mrs. Studley questioned Mary as to the cause of their sadness, Mary admitted that, beginning one night in March 1878, they had been “criminally intimate” with Reverend Hayden, and believed themselves to be five months pregnant. Mrs. Studley told Mary they should confront Hayden and ask for assistance. Mary took their advice and wrote a letter to their half-sister, Susan Hawley, explaining their situation and included a letter to be delivered to Reverend Hayden. They told Mrs. Studley that they had requested Hayden to pick them up and take them to New Haven for an abortion, then leave them at the Studley's to recover. When Mr. Studley heard of this plan, they wanted no part of it. They sent Mary packing.
Mary went to Susan Hawley's house where they intercepted and destroyed the letter to Hayden; they had decided to see them in person. The result of this meeting, according to Susan Hawley, was that Hayden had told Mary that they had seen a doctor in Middleton and gotten some “quick medicine” to end the pregnancy. The afternoon of Tuesday, September 3, Mary had been on their way to an appointment with Hayden.
On September 9, a hearing began to determine whether there was enough evidence to try Reverend Herbert Hayden for the murder of Mary Stannard. The hearing, which lasted seventeen days, was extremely contentious. The prosecution asked for more time to continue their investigations but the defense wanted to push ahead, with no break in the proceedings. The defense moved to have the testimony of Jane Studley and Susan Hawley disallowed as hearsay. In both instances, the judge ruled for the defense. The prosecution had a knife belonging to Reverend Hayden which, according to their expert witness, had traces of human blood. They wanted to admit it as evidence, but only if it was kept out of the hands of the defense attorney. When the judge said all should have access to the knife, the prosecution decided not to enter it, and all but directly accused the defense of wanting to tamper with evidence, resulting in a prolonged and bitter argument between opposing counsels. In the end the prosecution realized that they did not have the evidence necessary to indict Reverend Hayden for murder, and public sentiment briefly turned in the Reverend's favor.
A postmortem examination had been performed on Mary Stannard's body at 3:00 am, on September 4, where it was determined that a blow to the head, leaving a star-shaped wound, was inflicted before their throat was stabbed. It would be the first of at least four postmortems before and after the hearing, and by the end, all of Mary Stannard's vital organs were preserved in glass jars. Two significant pieces of information had been revealed after the first hearing: Mary Stannard was not pregnant at the time of their death, and their stomach had contained enough arsenic to kill twenty people.
It was known that on September 3, the very day of the murder, Reverend Hayden had purchased an ounce of arsenic in Middleton. The new information, was presented to a grand jury who indicted the Reverend Herbert Hayden for the murder of Mary E. Stannard.
The trial of Rev. Hayden, commencing more than a year after the murder, was just as contentions as the first hearing. All of the witnesses called in the hearing were called again in the trial and subjected to intense questioning. This time the prosecution's case was dominated by medical and scientific experts. More than a hundred witnesses were called to testify, including fifteen doctors and at least four Methodist clergymen.
The defense floated a number of alternative suspects, including Mary's father Charles, sixty-year-old Ben Stevens who had been staying at the Stannard house, and various local indigents. All had sufficient alibis and insufficient motive. At one point the judge subpoenaed every male citizen of Rockland to testify to their whereabouts on September 3, hoping to determine who could have killed Mary. It brought them no closer to the truth.
Twelve distinguished professors from Yale University, and three more from the University of Pennsylvania, were called by the prosecution to testify on the chemical and medical properties of arsenic. In the eyes of the press and public, their academic expertise was overshadowed by the arrogance and erudition of their testimony, which ran the gamut from superhuman intellectual certainty to reluctance to admit the certainty of anything. Professor Edward S. Dana (who “never used a word of one syllable when one of five would answer the purpose.”) during a question concerning the microscopic measurement of arsenical octahedrons stated that it was something that “no ordinary mortal could understand.” At the other extreme was Prof. Moses C. White who refused to be pinned down on anything. When asked if they had seen a certain object they replied, “my eyes saw it,” but would not state with certainty the, themselves had seen it.
Hayden had admitted to buying an ounce of arsenic for killing rats, and told investigators they could find it in their barn. Sure enough, they had found an ounce of arsenic, in an unlabeled tin, in Hayden's barn. What the experts proved, through microscopic analysis of the arsenic crystals, is that the arsenic in the barn was not from the same batch as the arsenic Hayden had bought in Middleton on the day of the murder.
But it was the testimony of Reverend Hayden and their wife that had the greatest impact on the jury. They were relaxed, reasonable and poised, in a way that their accusers were not.
The trial went on longer than three months and cost the town more than $30,000. The case was given to the jury on January 16, 1880 and they deliberated for eighty-two hours before telling the judge they could not reach a unanimous verdict—they were a hung jury. It was later revealed that only one juror was not swayed by the testimony of Hayden and their wife; they believed that they were lying and could not be convinced to change that belief.
The State Attorney agreed to release Reverend Hayden upon payment of a nominal bond. Hayden was welcomed back the Methodist ministry, where they remained briefly before returning to their original occupation of carpentry. Hayden was never retried for the crime, and no one was ever convicted of murdering poor Mary Stannard.

New Clues for Overcoming Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer
CINCINNATIA University of Cincinnati (UC) cancer biology team reports breakthrough findings about specific cellular mechanisms that may help overcome endocrine (hormone) therapy-resistance in patients with estrogen-positive breast cancers, combating a widespread problem in effective medical management of the disease.
Cancer Research Xiaoting Zhang , PhD, and their colleagues have identified a specific estrogen receptor co-activatorknown as MED1as playing a central role in mediating tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer. The team reports its findings in the Nov. 1, 2012, issue of, a scientific journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.
According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 227,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually in the United States. About 75 percent have estrogen-positive tumors and require adjuvant hormone therapy such as tamoxifen, a drug that works by interfering with estrogens ability to stimulate breast cancer cell growth.
Despite advances in hormone therapy drugs, cancer surveillance research has shown that 50 percent of patients will develop resistance to the drug and experience a cancer relapse.
The hormones estrogen and progesterone can stimulate the growth of some breast cancers. Hormone therapy is used to stop or slow the growth of these tumors. Hormone-sensitive (i.e., positive) breast cancer cells contain specific proteins known as hormone receptors that become activated once hormones bind to them, leading to cancer growth.
Based on new findings, UC Cancer Institute scientists believe that tamoxifen resistance may be driven by a novel molecular "crosstalk point between the estrogen and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) signaling pathways.
Testing in both pre-clinical models and human breast cancer tissue samples showed that MED1 co-amplifies and co-expresses with HER2, a gene that has an increased presence in 20-30 percent of invasive human breast cancer and plays a major role in tamoxifen resistance.
HER2 over-expression led to MED1 activation while reduction of MED1 caused breast cancer cells that were otherwise tamoxifen-resistant to respond and stop dividing. Further mechanistic studies showed that HER2 activation of MED1 resulted in the recruitment of co-activators instead of co-repressors by tamoxifen-bound estrogen receptor. This, explains Zhang, drives expression of not only traditional estrogen receptor-positive cancer target genes, but also HER2 and those estrogen receptor target genes abnormally activated by HER2.
"Together, these findings suggest this crosstalk could play a central role in mediating tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer, especially because recent published data also indicated that high MED1 expression levels correlate with poor treatment outcome and disease-free survival of patients who underwent endocrine therapy, explains Zhang, an assistant professor of cancer biology at the UC College of Medicine and breast cancer researcher with the UC Cancer Institute.
"We are currently utilizing RNA-based nanotechnology to target MED1 in an effort to simultaneously block both estrogen and HER2 pathways to overcome endocrine-resistant breast cancer.

Making branches in Git is easy and fast, but they should eventually go back in the master. Rebasing is both an alternative and a companion to merge.
Pulling vs. branching
Let's start with a simple observation. When you clone a repo and work on your own copy of the code, you have forked it. Even if there is no fork with your name on github: it's natural and it was also done with Subversion or CVS.
Pull and push are really disguised merges: your master is different from the master on origin: they are actually two different branches. You can try executing git checkout origin/master to see how Git conceptually distinguish between remote and local branches with the same name.
So rebase can be used for pulling/pushing, but also in general for reconciling two branches, being it one remote and one local, or two locals.
How Git works in a minute
You can think of git commits as photographs taken when you issue the command; they also have one or more parent commits, which in the linear case is the last commit made on a working copy before the new git commit execution.
Branches are just labels, put on particular commits; the label changes as new commits are made, keeping up with the last commit. When you branch, in the majority of cases you maintain a common ancestor with the original branch:
Each commit in a branch points its parent, forming a chain. When you merge, the parents for the new commit are exceptionally two:
So what' the difference?
During a merge, a new single commit is made, with two parents: the branch you are merging from and the current one.
During a rebase, the commits on your current branch are applied sequentially to the branch you're rebasing to; the parent of your branch becomes the current HEAD of the target. This explains the name: instead of basing your branch on when you forked it off, you're basing it on the HEAD of master (assuming you branched off from master).
In both cases, only the label for the current branch is updated.
The metaphor of merge is that the two trees are tied together in a point: they can diverge with other branches, but your development will continue by having as parents both of them.
The metaphor of rebase is that you cut away your branch, and reattach it at the top of the tree with some Acme glue. It's hard to see a real tree surviving this treatment, but since after rebasing you usually merge the branch back in master, the result is that the tree is always linear:
A possible workflow that makes use of rebase is the following:
git checkout -b mybranch # fork from master
...do some work and some commits...
...meanwhile master goes on with their life and several new commits are made...
git rebase master # your branch is cut out and applied to the more recent version of master
...resolve possible conflicts created by master... # run unit tests for example)
git checkout master && git merge mybranch # immedita, should be a fast-forward)
In the origin vs. local version, you substitute git rebase master with git pull --rebase.
This rebase plus merge technique end result is just like if you performed a pull, all your N commits in just two seconds, and then updated the master.
However the original metadata of the commits are preserved. This means that you may see them out of temporal order in the logs: the ones on master will be down on the list, superceeded by chronologically older commits that you have made on your branch.
In merge, you would see only one auto-generated commit in git log; with rebase plus merge, you will see all the different commits as the second operation, merge, becomes a fast-forward (pulling up the HEAD label of master up without any further commit):
The end result is that the history of your master (or of any other branch where you rebase to and merge in) is always linear. You will be able to use git-bisect as cleverly suggested here, and continue using git log instead of visualizing a complex tree of code.
– F4WOnline.com are reporting Karl Anderson and The Young Bucks will be at ROH and NJPW's May shows and will be representing top Japanese stable Bullet Club. Many are asking what the status of Prince Devitt is and as of this writing they still aren't announced and hasn't made a comment on the event, but this could be because he's Irish so New Japan would have to work out their work VISA through the Irish embassy which they'd want confirmed before they announce them for the event.
Devitt commented in a recent interview with CultureCrossfire.com that they refuse to travel without a work VISA as they don't want to be black balled from the United States just to work some dates.
It is rumored that Prince Devitt has been offered a WWE contract and is considering their options.

While the majority of Californians cast their ballot without any problems on Election Day, a few unlucky voters hit discouraging snags.
The problems ranged from poll worker mistakes to missing voting machines to ID confusion. Like some who had registered to vote through Rock The Vote, LA-based writer Aaron Waltke, 28, had problems casting a ballot on Tuesday.
Both Waltke and their girlfriend had registered to vote through the Rock The Vote site more than a month ago, but they didn't receive any confirmation by mail. Minutes before California's voter registration deadline on Oct. 22, Waltke decided to chance it and register a second time through the state's site.
While they say they didn't opt for a mail-in ballot, they received one anyway, as well as instructions for how to drop it off at a polling place in Koreatown. Figuring that they could still vote in person if they wanted, Waltke arrived at the station early Tuesday morning to cast their ballot, and was told they couldn't because they were on the "mail-in" list. If they wanted to cast a vote normally, he'd have to go home, retrieve their mail-in ballot, and then return so that poll workers could destroy it. Waltke opted to fill out a provisional ballot because they were already late for work, but they were disheartened that their vote would be counted almost a month after Election Day.
"I suspect we were victims of a buggy online registration system that put us in the wrong box," wrote Waltke in an email to HuffPost LA. "The polling volunteers were extremely helpful... but I can't shake the feeling these issues wouldn't have happened, though, if this weren't the first time California was using untested software. C'est la vie."
Rock The Vote President Heather Smith told the Los Angeles Times that their organization had received numerous calls from voters who found that they still weren't registered, after signing up through their site.
Below are a few more reported voting problems from throughout California:
A tea party-affiliated voter monitoring group was flagged for their "unpleasant interactions" with voters, reports the LA Times.
Twitter user Juan Romero found the ballot that was handed to them at a polling place in Palm Springs was already filled out with a presidential pick -- and it wasn't his. "Check your ballot carefully to make sure it is not already marked," Romero tweeted. "One I was handed this morning was PRE-MARKED, but not with my choice!"
Another Palm Springs voter wanted to choose Barack Obama on an electronic voting machine, but the machine showed they had selected Mitt Romney, reports the Desert Sun. They were given a paper ballot and the machine was shut down.
A poll worker told HuffPost LA editor Sasha Bronner that they aren't on the list to vote at their assigned polling place in West Hollywood, and asked them to fill out a provisional ballot instead. It turns out that they were on the list and the poll worker made a mistake.
A reader emailed LAist with the same problem.
A polling place in South Los Angeles had poll workers, ballots and voters, but no voting machines. Some voters waited in line for an hour while machines were being delivered before giving up, reports the Los Angeles Times.
A new U.S. citizen reported to a polling station only to find that they couldn't vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. A formal complaint was filed.
Two "thug-looking" men were harassing Redwood City voters as they waited in line, asking for official ID. They left when a poll worker called the police, reports Redwood City-Woodside Patch.
To report voter fraud or misconduct, call the California Secretary of State's confidential voter hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).
Without realizing it, in an interview with the National Review, Rand Paul came out not just against marriage equality, but marriage entirely:
I'm an old-fashioned traditionalist. I believe in the historic and religious definition of marriage. That being said, I'm not for eliminating contracts between adults. I think there are ways to make the tax code more neutral, so it doesn't mention marriage. Then we don't have to redefine what marriage is; we just don't have marriage in the tax code.
The problem with this “old-fashioned traditionalist” sentiment is that marriage is, historically, a civil function, and mostly exists in the tax code. Here are many of the pieces that, if Senator Paul had their way, we would be getting rid of, per the U.S. Tax Code:
Inheritance
This may seem like a no-brainer, but we are talking Rand Paul here. The largest portion of marriage in the tax code has to do with inheritance. A spouse can inherit their counterpart's estate without a severe tax penalty. And let's not forget that the primary purpose of marriage when originally created (as documented in the Code of Hammurabi, roughly 1780 B.C.) was to deal with inheritance. It dedicated several paragraphs to inheritance issues, for both a spouse and children, and gave the spouse special dispensation in dealing with their dead husband or wife's estate.
Retirement Savings
A married couple can save twice as much for retirement as a single person; again, a no-brainer. However, this is true regardless of working status; a one-job household would, therefore, be able to save twice as much while married as otherwise. Rand Paul is arguing here for expanding the welfare state, to make up for cutting the amount able to be saved for retirement in half.  They are also arguing to socialize the healthcare system, as healthcare savings plans work through the same mechanism. Eliminating marriage from the tax code eliminates this advantage.
Home Sale Tax Advantage
Married couples have twice the exemptions of a single person, enabling a massive deduction in their taxable income from the sale of a home. Rand Paul here is arguing to penalize people who purchase or sell their homes, all in the name of forcing-his-religious-views-on-you.
Divorce
This may surprise people, but the tax code is designed to make divorce, the separation of assets, simpler. Without the tax code for marriage, disengagement from a long-term relationship becomes a lengthy, complex, and expensive affair, with considerable tax penalties applied. Imagine trying to split a joint retirement account for a moment. To split it, without the marriage tax code, would require liquidating it and splitting the revenue. But, tax wise, it would be considered a withdrawal, with sizable tax penalties of up to 15% on top of the general income tax. And this is only a singular example of the numerous tax advantages tied to just divorce. Everything from home ownership, to vehicles, to stock and bonds, are all simplified, thanks to marriage in the tax code.
What Senator Paul is doing here is making a nonsensical argument for the ill-educated. Eliminating marriage in the tax code would not be freedom, it would directly hurt almost everyone in the United States. Rand Paul is revealing themselves to be unqualified for the office they hold.
But that's nothing new.
What Rand Paul ultimately fails to grasp is that marriage is mostly defined by the tax code. To eliminate it from the tax code would, in turn, effectively eliminate it, because it would eliminate most of what marriage brings about in the first place. Without the tax code, inheritance, owning a home, even raising children would be a major problem for couples. Rand Paul is spouting inane rhetoric in an attempt to rally people to their cause, which is the destruction of our society, the undoing of the social contract, and the elimination of the United States of America. That they would even suggest eliminating marriage tells us, ultimately, what they believe: that if they do not get special rights, they want to eliminate all rights for everyone.
We call that “taking my ball and going home” syndrome. That a sitting U.S. Senator would directly harm marriage in this country rather than allow marriage equality, tells us this is coming down to a fight between those who demand special, exclusive rights vs. equal treatment under the law. Senator Paul has clearly comes down against the side of the U.S. Constitution, and the intent of this great nation. And it is time to tell Rand Paul precisely what we think of their plan to eliminate marriage for all people in the United States.

MILAN (VN) — Cycling's class of 1990 promises to lead the way in 2015 and beyond based on its progress and results so far. Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) dominates the headlines after their recent world championship win, but many other 24-year-olds are at their side.
Peter Sagan (Cannondale) won the green jersey at the Tour de France. Nairo Quintana (Movistar) took the Giro d'Italia overall victory, and Fabio Aru (Astana) won stages in the Giro and the Vuelta a España. Along with Kwiatkowski, they sit at the top of the list of talented millennials in the peloton.
Sagan and Kwiatkowski have a history that goes back to their days as juniors. Slovakia's Sagan won one Nations' Cup and Poland's Kwiatkowski two in 2008. Sagan raced junior world mountain bike championships in Val di Sole, Italy that year, and won a rainbow jersey. Later that year, they both were unsuccessful in the junior world road race championships in Cape Town, South Africa, but Kwiatkowski turned it to win the junior world time trial. They finished eight seconds ahead of Taylor Phinney, also born in 1990.
Sagan then joined Liquigas/Cannondale and immediately tasted success. Kwiatkowski matured slower and this year, they finally out-performed their longtime rival. Both, however, have shown that they will dominate the classics to come. Sagan is favored on the cobbles against Tom Boonen (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) and Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory Racing), while Kwiatkowski will aim for the Ardennes Classics against Philippe Gilbert (BMC Racing) and Simon Gerrans (Orica-GreenEdge).
In grand tours, Colombian Quintana sent a warning message to their older rivals at last year's Tour de France. They placed second to Chris Froome (Sky), 29, and beat 31-year-old Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo). In the wake of their 2014 Giro victory, the 126-pound climber is targeting the Tour de France next season.
Italian Aru may be a step behind, but they promise just as much. They placed third to Quintana at the Giro and won the stage to Montecampione. At the Vuelta, they won two mountain stages, one in front of Froome and one over Alejandro Valverde (Movistar). Astana now wants Aru to lead its Giro team to victory in 2015.
The grand tours will include other cyclists from 1990. France's Thibaut Pinot (FDJ.fr) and Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) showed their capabilities with a third and sixth place overall, respectively, at the Tour.
Esteban Chaves (Orica), another Colombian, finished third in the recent Tour of Beijing and won stages in the Tour de Suisse and the Amgen Tour of California this season. Orica said in a statement last week that Chavez exceeded expectations in the first week of the 2014 Vuelta, “showing plenty of promise for the future.”
When the roads are not so steep, Australian Michael Matthews (Orica) and Frenchman Nacer Bouhanni (FDJ.fr) will be fighting for victories. Matthews won one stage and held the pink jersey for six days in the Giro d'Italia. Bouhanni sprinted to three stage wins in the same race.
Phinney, Rohan Dennis (BMC), and Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Shimano) — all born in 1990 — are showing promise in time trials. Racing in the Netherlands' orange colors, Dumoulin placed third behind greats Bradley Wiggins (Sky) and Tony Martin (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) at the worlds in Ponferrada, Spain. Australian Dennis was fifth.
Phinney, who missed half of 2014 recovering from a broken left leg suffered at the U.S. nationals in May, wants to return to win time trials and battle in the classics with Sagan. They told VeloNews, “If I can come back and do Paris-Roubaix, that would be the best thing, but the Tour is a massive goal for me, especially with the short, punchy prologue.”
You might remember Cut from a video it released a few years ago that depicted three grandmothers smoking marijuana together. To date that video has nearly 27 million views and has spawned an entire series called Strange Buds. It includes episodes like former cops smoking weed together, parents smoking with their kids, and even a Trump, a Stein, and Clinton supporter hitting a bong.
Now Cut has revamped everyone's favorite joke premise and invited a priest, a rabbi, and an atheist to enjoy some some pot together. The results are hilarious, enlightening and, at times, downright sweet.
The Rabbi is Jim Mirel and they begin the video by saying he's there to “Experience one of God's creations.” The priest is Rev. Chris Schuller, who made waves a year ago when they created a pro-marijuana video and posted it to Facebook. The atheist is a self-described “conservative homosexual” named Carlos.
Once the gentlemen are good and stoned, the stories start to come out. Carlos begins by saying at the age of 14 their priest denied their conformation because they had engaged in “homosexual acts,” and they were then excommunicated from this church. This lead to them questioning not only religion, but the existence of God. At one point, he's visibly upset and demands “Why are there 37,000 kids dying every day? That's not miraculous!”
screengrab via WatchCut Video/YouTube
After their story, Rabbi Mirel says that although Carlos might not believe in God per se, they seem to be a spiritual person who has faith in some sort of higher power, and to this, Carlos agrees.
screengrab via WatchCut Video/YouTube
Lest you think this is a video where two old guys try to convince a young man to come back to the church, the conversation feels much more like a freeform discussion about universal truth and the nature of God, so like basically the same shit everyone talks about when they're super high.
One of the best moments occurs when Mirel is informed that he's been holding a joint forever and someone finally asks if they need a light. This cracks up Schuller and Carlos, and it's a nice reminder that, oh yeah, these guys are really really stoned.

Screengrab via WatchCut Video/YouTube
Schuller has perhaps their most enlightened moment when they say “Maybe this will work for all of us. Just think of God as all things true, knowing we don't know all things.”
Screengrab via WatchCut Video/YouTube
At this point, a twist is introduced and we find out it's Ash Wednesday, which leads to Schuller using ash from their joints to put a cross on Carlos's forehead. Unbeknownst to him, Schuller indulges in one of the most stereotypical stoner clichés when they get super excited about the beautiful color of the ash.
screengrab via WatchCut Video/YouTube
Carlos returns the favor and gives Schuller a cross and, for good measure, Mirel gives Schuller and Carlos both a traditional Jewish blessing.
In the end, no one converts anyone, but the three men certainly walk away with something to think about and a perhaps a new set of friends. Add to this a butt load of free weed, and it's not a bad day's work.

As I noted earlier in the series, attaching input queues puts you back into the world of coöperative multitasking, where the two attached threads need to work together to get anything done.
Back in the old 16-bit days, when input was synchronous, there was only one active window, only one focus window, only one window with capture, only one caret, only one cursor show count, only one keyboard state, only one input state. Furthermore, if you called Set­Focus , you had to wait until the previous focus window responded to the WM_ KILL­FOCUS message before your Set­Focus call returned.
With asynchronous input, these sorts of operations are now local to your input queue. If you call Set­Focus , then that steals focus only from other windows which belong to your input queue. Windows which belong to other input queues are unaffected. (Conversely, you can set focus only to windows which belong to your input queue, since those are the only windows your input queue has access to.)
This is probably not very exciting, until you look at the one thing that can reach across input queues: The foreground window.
The concept of the foreground window was introduced when input was desynchronized in order to express the "really global active window", as opposed to Set­Active­Window , which continued to refer to the local active window. It's something that was originally intended to be used only in emergencies since it violates the isolation of input queues, but as we learned before, eventually nothing is special any more, and what used to be the special function for stepping outside the box has become the function you use every day for getting things done.
What most people don't realize is that Set­Foreground­Window is still subject to the rules on synchronous input. If you call Set­Foreground­Window , and the previous foreground window also belongs to your input queue, then your call to Set­Foreground­Window will wait until the previous foreground window processes its WM_ ACTIVATE( WA_ INACTIVE) message.
A lot of people use Attach­Thread­Input thinking that it's a Get Out of Jail Free card, letting them manipulate windows of other programs and bypass the normal rules for focus and activation. But in fact it's a Get Into the Same Jail card, because you tied your thread's fate to that other thread. If that thread has stopped responding to messages, then your thread will also stop responding to messages, since you are sharing the same input queue and operations within an input queue are synchronous.

RICHMOND, Va. – Richmond Police are asking for the public's help to identify the suspects involved in a sexual assault that occurred last week in Belle Isle.
A female victim reported a sexual assault that happened between 2 and 4 p.m. on Thursday, March 9.
Police said the incident occurred near the Hollywood Rapids by the Porta Johns on the north side of Belle Isle, when the victim was approached by three men, one of whom with a dog.
Investigators said the young woman was then sexually assaulted inside a Porta John.
Police are looking for two suspects and one person of interest in the case.
The first suspect is described as a black male in their late-teens to early-20s with a light complexion, possibly Hispanic.  They are approximately 6' in height, average build with short, dark hair.
They were seen wearing a gray, long-sleeve crew neck performance shirt and white tennis shoes.
The second suspect is described as a black male in their late-teens to early-20s with a light complexion, possibly Hispanic, with short, dark hair.  They are approximately 5'7 in height, 200 pounds in weight. At the time they were wearing a red shirt and a gold watch.
The person of interest is described as a black male in their late-teens to early-20s with a medium complexion, possibly Hispanic, with short dreadlocks or braids, and some facial hair.  They are approximately 6' in height with an average build. They were seen wearing a white T-shirt and khaki pants. They were last seen with a 6-week old grey and white pit bull puppy.
Detectives ask anyone with any information about this incident to call Major Crimes Detective P. Mansfield at (804) 646-6996 or contact Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000, online at http://www.7801000.com or by texting Crime Stoppers at 274637, using the keyword “ITip” followed by your tip.
HARRISON, N.J. – There was a feeling of capitulation with the way New York City FC's head coach Jason Kreis played their substitutions against the New York Red Bulls Sunday evening.
However, each move was made for a reason — and none more damning than Mix Diskerud's ouster.
The U.S. Men's National Team player did not perform to snuff under the bright lights of the Hudson Derby. That wasn't lost on Kreis, who made the difficult call to pull their star midfielder in a match that was begging for a spark.
“I thought Mix was just not great tonight,” a candid Kreis said after the match. “I thought they were kind of in and around things and not making plays, either in the attacking half or the defensive half.”
Much of that may be due to the discipline of the New York Red Bulls defense. Even as New York City gained momentum and possession, the Red Bulls put pressure on their ball carriers, choking out options and forcing turnovers throughout the field.
“I think New York is a very well-disciplined, well-put-together team,” Kreis acknowledged. “They defend extremely well and hit you on the break extremely well.”
Nevertheless, more is expected of Diskerud, and they were not able to deliver. That failure was palpable after the match, as the Norwegian-born playmaker sat at their locker with their head in their hands before departing, declining media interviews.
“We need to recognize that we're all not going to have great games all the time,” Kreis said of their star midfielder. “We've got guys in the bench that we believe in so we'll make those changes if we need to.”

It's 45 days since the disaster on the Deepwater Horizon rig and the oil spill still isn't fixed, but just how angry are Americans at BP?
There's been blanket coverage on American rolling news stations. Every national politician in the US has the spill at or near the top of their or them agenda.
And BP itself is already fighting a PR war to try to minimise the damage to its reputation from the oil starting to ravage the northern Gulf of Mexico coast.
SOCIAL MEDIA
If Facebook groups are a good indicator of rage, then the US is very angry indeed.
The group dedicated to "Boycott BP" is gaining over 30,000 members every day and is already around the 350,000 mark.
BP invests in a $50m ad campaign, NOW? Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already??? Facebook commenter
Many vow not to buy BP petrol or products again and express visceral anger towards the oil firm. Some have designed their own logos, satirical takes on BP's green and yellow livery, featuring dripping oil and skulls.
This is an environmental crisis that ordinary people have been able to get to grips with online in a way not possible during the US's other notorious oil spill, the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989.
Now the webcam of the broken pipe with the oil gushing into the sea has proved to be compelling viewing. Hundreds of thousands of people have also watched the footage of robot arms doing their work.
THE BOYCOTT
Florida resident David Kearns has launched a one-man campaign of direct action against BP.
They have posted videos on YouTube under the alias Stanley Morton III. One shows them spreading rubbish from their garden over the forecourt of a BP petrol station.
Image caption Hundreds of thousands have joined a Facebook group demanding a boycott
And they attach banners and placards on fences adjacent to the stations in an effort to get people to stop buying.
"I'm outraged. We live here for our beaches, for our seafood," they say.
"If you get people not to buy the gas at the pumps that hurts them. It is an 'annoycott'."
They perceive success when they see the price of BP petrol go lower than that of its local competitors.
"If the price of gas has gone down, it's hitting their bottom line."
BP is cagey over the effects on sales of the oil spill so far, and it has yet to be suggested that they are devastating.
The issue will be complicated for many, and such situations can lead to a "mild consumer response", says Prof Monroe Friedman, author of Consumer Boycotts: Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and Media.
They say disastrous environmental incidents caused by companies, such as the spill, "do not necessarily lead to no-buy [action]. They lead to symbolic kinds of action, things short of boycotts.
"Few of these gas stations are actually owned by offending companies, most of them are owned by independent operators.
"You are a consumer and you may be offended by the corporate actions but you may continue to buy the gas at your neighbourhood station. One thing is convenience, you have been doing it for years. You may know the guy who owns the station."
It's a point that has been made by many, who have suggested protesters should only boycott BP products, like Castrol motor oil, but Mr Kearns is not convinced.
"The proprietors are used as human shields," they say.
TONY HAYWARD AND THE PR DRIVE
One lightning rod for anti-BP rage has proved to be chief executive Tony Hayward.
Remarks they made at the weekend, when they suggested they wanted the spill to be over and said "I'd like my life back" generated a wave of ire.
By Wednesday they had to apologise, but bloggers have unkindly noted that BP has had a second gusher in the form of Mr Hayward's gaffe-prone mouth.
Some newspaper and television commentators have demanded their resignation. One national station ran a segment called "Fired Up! He's Gotta Go".
And the idea that BP is spending money on print and television adverts has also drawn criticism - a case of a PR drive proving to be bad PR.
One Facebook commenter captured the mood, saying: "BP invests in a $50m ad campaign, NOW? That is a huge waste of $50m that should be going towards the CLEAN UP. Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already???"
BP has already had to explain that no money is being diverted from the clean-up effort.
OTHER PROTESTS
Image caption Mass demonstrations are yet to occur
While on the Gulf coast it is easy to see banners and placards attacking BP, the signs of rage may not be visible everywhere.
The umbrella group seizeBP.org, which wants the federal government to take all of BP's assets as punishment for the spill, is organising nationwide protests.
But a demonstration at a BP-related site in Washington DC on Thursday only attracted a couple of dozen protesters.
Whether the anger will build into mass demonstrations is unclear.
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE MORE ANGRY?
While it is clear that millions are outraged, their response is not always visible, particularly away from the Gulf states.
Image caption Where the oil is, or is headed, feelings run high
"People don't feel at liberty to speak of it [in Louisiana], they are dependent on BP to pay them," says David Kearns.
"In Florida, people don't want to say too much because it's going to hurt tourism."
But they think the longer the effects of the spill last, the more rage will build.
"It's true we need to be more angry," they say.
One primary employer on a growth spurt is leaving Longmont, but another will quickly take over the 60,000-square-feet space being left behind.
Creative Foam Corp., which makes the composite material that goes into wind turbine blades, is moving this summer to an 80,000-square-foot space in Berthoud.
The company has been leasing 60,000 square feet at 1800 Pike Road, which also happens to be the headquarters for Oskar Blues Brewery.
Creative Foam opened its Longmont location in 2009 to be geographically closer to its biggest customer, Vestas, which manufactures wind turbines. Just months earlier, Oskar Blues moved its brewing operations to Longmont from Lyons.
Since then, Oskar Blues has grown, swallowing up every available inch in the rest of the building.
"Our office is on one side, and then there's (Creative Foam), and then there's the brewery," said Oskar Blues founder Dale Katechis. "So this is going to help out immensely in a lot of ways."
Dave Stuck, the director of operations for Creative Foam, said, "It was obvious that between both our businesses together, collectively, we were outgrowing that building."
Stuck said their company hopes to be in its new facility, at 2221 Clayton Place in Berthoud, by July 1. The company's lease is up at the end of July.
Building owner Wendell Pickett said they tried but couldn't find space in Longmont that would suit Creative Foam's needs.

Moving to the larger facility will lower the company's monthly lease and help the company grow "about 100 percent" in production, revenue and number of employees by the end of this year, Stuck said. Creative Foam now employs about 30.
Oskar Blues employs about 100 at its brewery in Longmont, the company reported.
Through the first quarter of 2014, revenues have grown 40 percent and production nearly 39 percent, Katechis said.
"Ten a thousand of that (new square footage) will get used on August 2nd," Katechis said. Along with dry storage, Oskar Blues will install new tanks this summer and into the fall.
Immediate plans are to use about half of the former Creative Foam space to start with, Katechis said.
"This allows us to expand more in Colorado," Katechis said. "We don't have to build the space in North Carolina" — where Oskar Blues opened a second brewery 16 months ago — "that we thought we would since this space is available."
Creative Foam has been a good neighbor in the building but its moving out really does benefit both companies, Katechis said.
And what about the other 30,000 square feet of new space that Oskar Blues does not have immediate plans for?
"We miss some of the amenities we used to have before we filled it up — the batting cage, the basketball court. So I'm excited," Katechis said.

Philips release their new 349X7FJEW 3440x1440 21:9 FreeSync display
Philips have released their new 349X7FJEW 3440x1440 FreeSync display coming with a VA panel and covers 117.3% of the sRGB colour gamut.
On their official website, Philips lists this display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a price of £759 in the UK, though AMD lists a Philips "349X7" display as having a 40-100Hz FreeSync range via DisplayPort in their FreeSync support page. At this time it is unknown if this range refers to a different display or the 349X7FJEW, though after some frantic Googling we couldn't find Philips' 34" 3400x1440 349X7 display.
This display will come with support for 100x100 Vesa mounts, coming with support for both HDMI and DisplayPort connections. This display also comes with a three-way USB 3.0 splitter. This display will also come with an 1800R curve, with built-in 5w speakers.
You can join the discussion on Philips' 349X7FJEW 3440x1440 Freesync display on the OC3D Forums.

The U.S. Office of Government Ethics called on the White House to discipline adviser Kellyanne Conway Tuesday.
The office, controlled by democrats, also called for an investigation in a series of tweets.
“Executive branch officials should use the authority entrusted to them for the benefit of the American people and not for private profit.” — House OversightDems (@OversightDems) February 14, 2017
“There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted.” — House OversightDems (@OversightDems) February 14, 2017
“I recommend that the White House investigate Ms. Conway's actions and consider taking disciplinary action” by Feb. 28 — House OversightDems (@OversightDems) February 14, 2017
[BACKSTORY]: WASHINGTON – The White House on Thursday said a top adviser to President Donald Trump had been “counseled” after using a television appearance from the West Wing to promote the clothing and jewelry line sold under the brand of Trump's daughter.
The endorsement, in which Kellyanne Conway told Fox News Channel viewers to “go buy Ivanka's stuff,” appeared to violate a key ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products. The White House reaction was a rare acknowledgment of an ethical misstep.
Conway's remarks drew a sharp and unusual rebuke from a top Republican lawmaker, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who said Conway's comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line.”
Chaffetz, who has resisted calls by Democrats to investigate potential conflicts related to President Trump's businesses, joined with the Oversight Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), in sending a letter to the Office of Government Ethics calling Conway's comments “unacceptable.” The letter asked the agency to recommend discipline given that Trump, who as Conway's agency head would ordinarily take action, holds an “inherent conflict of interest” due to the involvement of their daughter's business.
In a terse comment to reporters Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had been “counseled on the subject” but did not say whether they would be disciplined. Spicer did not say why Conway's statements had required the intervention, and the White House declined to answer further questions.
Speaking on Fox News Thursday evening, Conway declined to comment but said Trump supports their “100 percent.”
“All I can to America's women is, at some point in your life, you ought to have a boss who treated me like the president of the United States treated me today,” they said.
The incident was the latest illustration of how the Trump White House has struggled to grapple with long-established ethics rules as the president has attempted to balance the potentially competing interests of their new public position and their family's vast business holdings.
The matter has grown politically thorny in recent weeks as many opponents of Trump's policies have waged a campaign to boycott the family's brands and protest at its properties. The tensions underscore the difficulty Trump faces in carrying through on their vow to separate their presidency from their businesses – particularly given that they and their daughter have refused to divest their ownership stakes.
The president has faced criticism from ethics experts and Democratic lawmakers who have warned that their public power could be misused to enrich them and their family. Trump has turned the management of their businesses over to their two adult sons and a longtime executive.
While Trump has said that most ethics laws and rules do not apply to the president, Conway's stumble Thursday served as a reminder that staffers are nonetheless subject to those provisions.
The Conway episode followed other instances in which Trump's political rise and their presidency have provided a promotional platform for the family businesses.
On Monday, first lady Melania Trump filed a lawsuit accusing a British news company of publishing an inaccurate story that hurt their ability to take advantage of a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to build their brand of jewelry and accessories. The lawsuit said that the August 2016 article, which falsely suggested Melania Trump had once worked for an escort service, damaged their ability to build “multimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term” and damaged their brand during a time when Trump “is one of the most photographed women in the world.”
A day later, after ethics experts criticized the notion of Melania Trump attempting to make money from their public role, their lawyer and a spokesperson issued statements saying the first lady “has no intention” of using their position for profit.
The first family has struggled to cleanse its public appearances of private entanglements.
In their official White House online biography, Donald Trump boasts of the success of the business they still own and cites their book “The Art of the Deal,” which remains for sale.
Melania Trump's initial online biography referenced their jewelry line, once sold on the cable television channel QVC, and noted its trademark, a registration now overseen by a federal office led by their husband.
Ivanka Trump, whose brand includes dresses, shoes, skirts, handbags, jewelry and accessories, much of which is sold online and at dozens of the United States' largest retailers and department-store chains, mixed their business and newly elevated political profile shortly after the election.
Hours after they were interviewed by “60 Minutes” about their father's victory, their jewelry line alerted journalists to the fact that they were wearing an Ivanka-brand diamond bracelet, which viewers could buy for $10,800.
Conway's endorsement of Ivanka Trump's brand followed a tweet Wednesday by President Trump complaining that their daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped their clothing line, citing slow sales.
Conway touted Ivanka Trump's “wonderful line” of clothing and shoes during an interview Thursday morning with “Fox & Friends” from the White House briefing room.
Responding to national boycotts of Ivanka Trump merchandise, Conway said, “Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you.”
“I'm going to give a free commercial here,” they added. “Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”
Experts quickly seized on Conway's remarks as a direct violation of Office of Government Ethics rules. Don W. Fox, a former OGE general counsel and now the office's acting director, said Conway's statements were “jaw-dropping” and “a clear violation of rules prohibiting misuse of public office for anyone's private gain.”
Peter Schweizer, who has worked closely with Trump chief strategist Stephen Bannon and wrote a book, “Clinton Cash,” that was critical of donations to the Clinton Foundation, said, “They've crossed a very, very important, bright line, and it's not good.”
“To encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,” Schweizer added. “Clearly, the Trumps feel some of this is related to politics. But whether that's true or not, these marketing battles need to be fought by Ivanka and their company. They cannot and should not be fought by government employees and the White House.”
Schweizer said it was time for Trump “to move beyond the mind-set and the role of a business person and assume the mantle of commander in chief.”
Federal law states that the director of the Office of Government Ethics can advise the White House and Conway of the violation and recommend disciplinary action. But the OGE's recommendations are nonbinding, and the ultimate decision resides with the White House.
OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment. By midmorning, the agency's website had crashed, and the OGE's official Twitter account said that the office's phone and email systems were receiving “an extraordinary volume” of citizen input about “recent events.”
The office tweeted that its role is to help prevent ethics violations but not to investigate allegations that rules have been broken – a job reserved for the FBI, inspectors general and other watchdogs. Still, the OGE notifies agencies of possible ethics violations and asks for reports on any action taken, a process the office indicated it is “actively following,” according to the OGE's tweets.
Experts said a typical executive-branch employee who violated the endorsement rule could face significant disciplinary action, including a multi-day suspension and loss of pay. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees, for instance, face a five-day suspension or termination for using public office for private gain.
But enforcement measures are largely left to the head of the federal agency – in Conway's case, the White House. Conway's counseling, independent lawyers said, could have included a meeting with members of the White House counsel's office, but it remained unclear what disciplinary steps would be taken.
Independent ethics groups and Trump critics targeted the endorsement as a make-or-break moment for how the White House will address future ethical concerns.
Noah Bookbinder, director of the liberal Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed an official ethics complaint, called Conway's comments “just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president's family and supporters.”
Conway's endorsement of Ivanka Trump's business also highlighted an awkward reality for a White House threatening U.S. companies seeking to move jobs or operations overseas. Nearly all of Ivanka-brand merchandise is manufactured in low-cost-labor countries, including China, Indonesia and Vietnam.
The president and their daughter have taken steps to put distance between their private companies and public ambitions. Both resigned their official leadership roles in the Trump Organization.
Ivanka Trump retains a financial interest in their separate business. The Trump company says the president does not have a financial interest or ownership stake in the Ivanka brand.

A single blood pressure test, or even several readings over a short period of time, may not be enough to gauge the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
Many researchers predict a subject's risk for cardiovascular risk with a single blood pressure reading, but a new study has tracked blood pressure over 14 years beginning at age 41 in more than 61,500 men and women, most not taking blood pressure medicine. The paper was published online last week in Circulation.
Men who developed hypertension during middle age had a 70 percent lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease or stroke, compared with a risk of 35 percent among men who had lower blood pressure.
Among women, those who had hypertension from age 41 through 55 had a lifetime risk of 49 percent, compared with 22 percent among middle-aged women with lower blood pressure.
“This study has shown that changes in blood pressure early in middle age affect your lifetime risk,” said the lead author, Norrina Allen, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University. “We need to think about hypertension much earlier in life, around age 40.”
About 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women had increasing blood pressure over the 14 years; about a fifth of men and a tenth of women had decreasing readings.
The official launch of the Moto X has come and gone, but the only people that can pick one up are the customers on AT&T. Motorola has been vocal about plans to bring the device to all the major carriers in the US, but we haven't heard anything close to a solid date for when we can expect them. Punit Soni, Motorola's VP of Product Management has taken to their Google+ account to drop a hint that it might not be too long before we see more Moto X launches.
Apparently, the AT&T launch of the Moto X was only step one. Soni's post reads, “Step 1 of rollout. Dev editions, other carrier versions rolling out in days.” Days is a pretty interesting choice of words, but Soni reiterated “days” in the comments of their G+ post. You wouldn't necessarily use that term if we were a month or two away from other carriers launching the device. We will keep our ears to the ground for any news on when Verizon and the other carriers can expect a launch.

Creating the Mosaic Jesse Tree.
I used to be an artist.
Praise and thanks to God who gave me the passion. And the talent to go along with it.
In high school I honed my painting skills.
And in college I delved into drawing.
I even painted an undersea mural on our basement stairwell during winter break one year.
Then, after I got married but before I had kids (a very small window) I began this mosaic project.
I thought it would be a good idea to spend countless hours tearing paper into teeny tiny pieces then glue them back together on wooden ornaments to depict scenes from the Bible… This was the beginning of my Jesse Tree.
The Jesse Tree is my favorite Advent tradition. Every day of December, we hang an ornament on the tree depicting a certain personage in Jesus' genealogy.
Then, starting December 17, we peruse the O Antiphons: each celebrating a different name for Jesus. A different way They fulfill the prophecies of the Messiah from the Old Testament.
We finish off with Christmas Eve and Christmas. Days on which we celebrate the closeness of Jesus, the Light of the World, and the incredible joy of Their Incarnation.
Every year, I feel the anticipation of swiftly moving through years of Old Testament history, ushering in the coming of the Messiah.
But the years spent handcrafting these ornaments were anything but swift.
Once my first child was born, the long afternoons dedicated to creating visual masterpieces were over. My project quickly lost momentum, and I wondered if I would ever complete it.
But every year, as Advent approached, I would feel my motivation renewed and my enthusiasm and determination to make progress on my Jesse Tree returned.
So I'd pull out my cardstock and my modpodge, my rubber stamps and my India ink, and carve out a few minutes here and there to take baby steps towards completing my ornaments.
One year, disaster struck. In a flurry of post-Christmas cleanup, I stored my ornaments incorrectly. The summer heat rolled in and softened the glue on the completed faces.
As Christmas drew near, I was horrified to open the box to discover the ornaments fused together. Hot tears rolled forth, and disappointment choked up my throat. I thought I had lost years of dedicated work.
I cried out to Mother Mary and instantly felt a wave of calm and reassurance wash over me. I spent hours coaxing the pairs of ornaments apart, softening the glue over a steaming pot of water. By the end of the day tears were flowing again. This time, tears of relief and gratitude to Our Lady for restoring my ornaments to me with minimal damage.
Finally, five years after my first sketch, the end came into sight. My youngest was almost 2 years old. They played independently for short stretches, and for longer ones with their 3 year old sister. My oldest was 5, and had the patience and ability to help me. They ripped paper, cleaned stamps, and opened string cheese for their sisters.
After 5 long years, I finished the project of my dreams. I'm not gonna lie, a few more tears were shed. Tears of love for the beautiful turnout of years of patient work.
I guess you could say I'm still an artist.
The masterpieces I devote most of my time to were sketched deep within my body. Nurtured and molded every hour of every day. And will remain unfinished until they meet their Creator in Heaven someday. These masterpieces are my children.
They are my life's work.
But every now and then, I squeeze in a few moments with my paint. My charcoal. My paper and glue.
I may be a little rusty. And my work rolls at a snail's pace. But the joy of creating is worth every laundry pile left unfolded. Every lost hour of sleep. Every mess created by children unattended for a few minutes.
Purchase the Mosaic Jesse Tree
As excited as I am to display my completed Jesse Tree in my home every year, I'm even more excited to share it with you.
I transformed my ornaments a product available for purchase in my Etsy store. Each set includes 25 cardstock ornaments and a 6×9 booklet with scriptures, reflections, and prayers for each day.
The Jesse tree is available in two formats: one for the craft-enthusiast with some assembly required, and the other ready to hang.
Each day, add one ornament to your tree, hang it from your stairway banister or across your mantle, or tape it to your kitchen window.
I hope you love this Mosaic Jesse Tree, and that it blesses your Advent as much as it blesses mine every year. May your heart overflow with the joy and excitement of the coming of Christ! Amen.

BEIJING: In an interesting move, China is displaying a nuclear powered attack submarine to the public to boosts the people's confidence in the country's growing naval power. This is part of efforts by the Chinese authorities to enhance the image of president Xi Jinping ahead of the upcoming Plenum of the Communist Party , which will take crucial decisions which including giving Xi a second term as president.China also announced on Thursday that the country's first domestic-built aircraft carrier is at an advanced state of development. Its hull has already been assembled in a shipyard, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday. Design work on the vessel has been completed,while workers are currently installing equipment to the ship' s body.No navy in the world has ever put a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine on display in a museum, they added. Government experts said that displaying advanced ships, submarines and weapons at domestic maritime exhibitions would establish a closer connection with the public. The announcement will also add to the rising nationalism, which is an important plank in Xi's efforts to reinforce their influence over different sections of the party, the government and the military.The state media is equating them to Mao Zedong , who is regarded as the founder of the party and the main architect of Communist China since its formation in 1949. No other Chinese leader has been held in such high status since Mao.The country's first nuclear-powered submarine was towed to a port of the Chinese Navy Museum in Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong province, in mid-October, according to the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army 's Navy." This boat, which sailed oceans for more than 40 years, will soon be presented as an exhibit to you at the museum. Before arriving at the museum, the submarine's nuclear parts have been removed, in accordance with international standards, so the boat is completely safe," it said.Official media said the decommissioning of the submarine, together with the safe disposal of its nuclear reactors and waste, indicates China is able to not only develop and operate nuclear submarines, but also properly handle them when they retire.

Centrelink's online system asked Michael Griffin to confirm their earnings, and that's when their problems began
Centrelink's debt mistake: 'There's no way I could explain to them'
When Centrelink's letter arrived two weeks before Christmas, Michael Griffin instinctively knew they were going to be unfairly trapped.
So they meticulously documented, step-by-step, how the system wrongly deemed them to have a $3,197 debt.
Griffin's ordeal began when they received the standardised letter from Centrelink, telling them there was a discrepancy between income information held by the Australian taxation office, and what they had reported fortnightly while claiming the dole in 2013.
Government backs Centrelink debt system despite 'incorrect' $24,000 demand Read more
They were told to go online to their MyGov account to confirm their income details.
Griffin originally claimed benefits between February and May in 2013, receiving a total of $3,754 from Centrelink.
They reported working small amounts in three fortnights within those months.
In two fortnights, they worked 24 hours and earned $618 a fortnight, and in the third they worked 15 hours and earned $386.
Griffin has provided payslips to Guardian Australia that clearly show they reported this income accurately.
They boosted their working hours in the rest of their year, while not claiming welfare, and ended up with a total income of $26,642 for the 2013-14 financial year.
Centrelink's online system asked them to confirm that they had earned $26,642, which Griffin did. This is where their problems began. Screenshots show how Centrelink's system then averaged out their $26,000 yearly income across every fortnightly reporting period.

It wrongly assumed they had consistently earned $1,021 every fortnight across the year, including between February and May, instead of different amounts in different fortnightly reporting periods.
That wrong assumption made them ineligible to claim welfare for that period, and they were told they must repay almost all of the dole they claimed, a total of $3,197.
“I knew that this would happen when I went on the site, but there is no way for it not to happen – no way that I could pre-emptively explain to them,” Griffin said.
“Surely my situation is the default – how many people is this happening to?” they said.
Guardian Australia continues to receive dozens of similar complaints about Centrelink's compliance system, which is automatically comparing income reported to the agency with information held by other areas of government, principally the Australian taxation office.
It then asks welfare recipients – at a rate of 20,000 a week – to prove they are entitled to claim benefits from up to six years ago.
A key complaint about the system is that it reverses the onus of proof onto Australia's most vulnerable and poorest groups.
Victoria Legal Aid has noticed a significant jump in those coming to them for assistance on welfare debts since the system began in July.
But Legal Aid lawyer Joel Townsend fears most people are not even questioning their debts, and are failing to seek legal help.
“I think that one of the larger issues is the impact of automating this kind of debt collection process on the most disadvantaged people, people with mental health problems, young people, people without a good grasp of the English language,” they said.
“Those people are likely to be the people who are the least able to handle a system that puts the onus on them to disprove a Centrelink debt.”
“Lots of people who should be seeking help with this legal issue are not doing so. And people who should be seeking reviews by Centrelink are not doing so.”
The government continues to maintain confidence in the system.
The Department of Human Services said it allows customers the chance to contest the discrepancy.
The vast majority of people, the department says, resolve the issue online and without the need for payslips or letters of employment.
Wedding Mason Jars: 3 DIYs!
Last week's 4th of July Mason Jar DIY made me think back to my wedding! I used Mason jars in a few different ways, and had even more ways that I had wanted to use them (but simply ran out of time to do so!) Since we are smack in the middle of Wedding Season right now, I thought there would be no better time to share some great do-it-yourself ideas on how to use Mason jars at your own rustic shabby chic wedding!
If you are looking for some wedding décor that is less DIY but still super personalized, you have lots of options to help you plan your wedding. Put your engagement photos to good use by featuring them on some of your wedding decorations! Sites like Shutterfly have got you covered for tabletop decoration ideas that you and your fiancé will love! (They've even got some pretty amazing gift ideas!) No matter what you end up choosing, as long as you love it, everyone else will too!
All of my ideas down below would make a fabulous wedding favor, as well as a really cute centerpiece or decoration on the tables! I love when things have a dual purpose, don't you? I used 4-ounce quilted Jelly jars for these projects, but other sizes would work too! Just adjust your materials to fit. Here are each of the three ideas, complete with photos, tutorials and even a recipe thrown in the mix! Enjoy!
Floating Candle Votive
These romantic vintage-style Mason jars will definitely set the mood for a wonderful evening! Swap out whatever colors will match your own big day, and get creative with the ribbons/lace/twine!
Materials for one:
4 oz Mason jar
Small tea light
Two different sized/colored ribbons (in your color or theme)*
Twine
Glue (Elmer's, or something similar)
Scissors
Water
*I used a sheer cream ribbon and a satin sage green ribbon.
Instructions:
First up, you'll want to ditch the lid. You won't need it at all for this project!
Next, put a small dot of glue on your jar where the first ribbon will go.
Place the ribbon on the glue dot and let it dry.
Wrap the ribbon tightly around the jar, add another glue dot to hold it down, and snip the excess ribbon. Let dry.
Glue, let dry, wrap and glue the second piece of ribbon on top of the first. Center it if you like, as I did! Let dry.
Tie a piece of twine around the center of it all.
Fill 3/4 of the way with water.
Add tea light to water, and light! Watch it float dreamily in the votive!
Candy Jar Favors
The 4-ounce Mason jars are also known as Jelly jars, since that is what they were made for! Homemade jelly or jam is definitely an option (a delicious, delicious option) but may be a bit of work for the busy bride-to-be. This DIY is much quicker, mega cheap, and crazy cute! Stack them adorably on their own table by the escort cards, or use them as an element of decoration on the dinner tables! Use whatever candy and fabric match your theme: I chose strawberries for a fun summer wedding!
Materials for one:
4 oz Mason jar
Candies (in your color or theme)
Square of fabric (in your color or theme)
Twine or ribbon (in your color or theme)
Pinking shears
Pencil
Instructions:
Remove the lid from your Mason jar and discard the inner piece as you won't be needing it.
Turn the fabric over so the patterned side is face down on your table.
Using your lid as a guide, sketch a circle around the lid about an inch and a half from the lid. (It's hard to see, but the pencil is pointing towards it!)
Now fold your fabric in half, and in half again, as shown.
Follow your penciled sketch and cut the fabric with your pinking shears.
Unfold completely and you'll have a circle!
Fill your jar with your candies.
Place the fabric circle centered over the top of the jar, and screw the outside portion of the lid right on top of the fabric.
You may pull the fabric down to make it more taut after it's been screwed on.
Place a piece of twine or ribbon around the metal lid to jazz it up!
Distressed Chalkboard Shaker with Lemon Rosemary Sea Salt
This is another great favor that doubles as cute table décor for a rustic shabby chic wedding! You can swap out the chalkboard paint for any acrylic paint in your color/theme. Just use a paint marker instead of a chalk marker to label your jar. When stored in an airtight container, the lemon rosemary sea salt can last up to two months! That means you can make a giant batch a month before your wedding, and simply fill all your pre-made distressed jars at the last minute so your guests may enjoy it for an additional few weeks post-wedding. First, I'll share how to make the super fun vintage-y jars, and then we'll go onto the sea salt recipe!
Materials for one:
4 oz Mason jar
Chalkboard paint
Chalk marker
Hammer
Small nail
Sandpaper, extra fine grit
Paint brush
Twine (optional for decoration)
Sea salt (recipe below)
Instructions:
With lid firmly on jar, gently make 6 dents (one in center with five in circle around it) using the nail and hammer.
If you are satisfied with the placement of the dents, go ahead and carefully use the nail and hammer to make holes where you've dented the metal lid.
Use a corner of your sand paper to gently remove any loose tiny shards of metal that may be on the back of the lid.
Wash your lid (very carefully!) and jar thoroughly and dry completely.
Do one coat of paint on the outside of your jar. It will be streaky- that's okay! If you are using acrylic, it will be dry quite quickly. If you are using the chalkboard paint, follow the instructions on it for how long to let it dry. Placing it in front of a fan will help “cure” it much quicker, as it takes awhile for the chalkboard paint.
Once dry (or at least mostly dry!), do a second coat of paint to cover up the streaks. Let dry completely.
When your jar is totally dry, use the sandpaper to go over the raised areas of glass. This will give it the distressed vintage look! If you are using a jar with raised text on it (such as Ball), then you can gently scrape away the paint from the word so it becomes visible. Because I used the quilted jars, I was able to distress many spots! Do this to your heart's content- it is up to you how you want it to look.
Use a cloth or paper towel to wipe off any of the sand/paint bits when you are finished distressing.
Use chalk marker to write name of contents on front.
Fill with sea salt, close jar and tie twine around if you please!
Time for the sea salt recipe! A fun idea to incorporate this favor further in to the wedding theme is to make it more of an interactive piece of décor. Place one in front of each person's place setting with a sign on each table that unsalted french fries or chips (or something just as fun!) would be served and to feel free to test out their new shaker on the food!
Ingredients for one:
1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest (approx 1/5th of the outside of a medium lemon)
1/2 teaspoon of fresh rosemary (shown in photo)
4 Tablespoons of course sea salt
Instructions:
Add all ingredients to food processor with metal blades.
Grind on “fine” for 20-30 seconds or until rosemary and lemon are ground up evenly with the salt.
Keep in an airtight container for up to two months.
Recipe makes enough to completely fill one 4-ounce Mason jar.
Which of these three do-it-yourself Mason jar projects do you like best? If you make any for your own wedding (or another occasion), share your photos in the comments!
On Project Scorpio–exclusive titles
At E3, Xbox head Phil Spencer said that all games and accessories will support all versions of the Xbox One, including Project Scorpio. I said at the time that this statement was not true, because only Project Scorpio will support a VR headset (an accessory), and there will definitely be VR-only games that work only with Project Scorpio. Greenberg shed some light on this, saying that the main reasoning behind Spencer's making this point is that everything that works on Xbox One will work on Project Scorpio, rather than the other way around.
They added that while Microsoft is "not going to have console-exclusive games for Project Scorpio," it doesn't "think of [high-fidelity VR] as console gaming, and so with the VR experiences those will be new things that you will get on Project Scorpio."
Here's the full question-and-answer:
Q: Phil Spencer said that all accessories and all games work across all versions of the Xbox One. But they also said Project Scorpio is specifically the only Xbox that's powerful enough to run VR. I don't quite understand how those two statements can coexist.
Greenberg: The idea was, first, how can we innovate with hardware without sacrificing compatibility? Generally when you bring a new iteration of console hardware you lose compatibility with their games and accessories. So we're saying, if you bought games and accessories for your Xbox One, or you buy an Xbox One S, those games and those accessories are going to work on Project Scorpio. When you think about backwards compatibility and our games lineup, we want gamers to know that when they're ready to upgrade to Scorpio, that content will go with them. That's our promise and commitment around compatibility.
The next thing was "Are you going to make games exclusively to Project Scorpio?" And we said we're not going to have console-exclusive games for Project Scorpio. It's one ecosystem -- whether you have an Xbox One S or Project Scorpio, we don't want anyone to be left behind, Now, with the power and capabilities we have, we'll be able to do high-fidelity VR. Now, that space, we don't think of that as console gaming, we think of that as high-fidelity VR, and so with the VR experiences those will be new things that you will get on Project Scorpio.
On the end of console generations
"The future of Xbox looks a lot like PC gaming." That's what Engadget editor Nathan Ingraham wrote after speaking with Phil Spencer earlier this year. Spencer spoke about wanting to see a steady stream of hardware innovation rather than seven-year gaps between consoles, citing the smartphone market as inspiration. Greenberg went one step further. In their opinion, this is the last console generation. "We think the future is without console generations," they said, explaining that Project Scorpio was a "big bet" that gamers will embrace that notion.
Q: The Xbox platform has moved forward to have such regular updates and new features coming all the time. It kind of seems like hardware is going the same way. There was a very short gap between the Xbox One and the Xbox One S, and we're probably talking an even shorter gap before Project Scorpio. Do you see a future of console upgrades continually happening? Is this the last console generation?
Greenberg: I think it is. ... For us, we think the future is without console generations; we think that the ability to build a library, a community, to be able to iterate with the hardware -- we're making a pretty big bet on that with Project Scorpio. We're basically saying, "This isn't a new generation; everything you have continues forward and it works." We think of this as a family of devices.
But we'll see. We're going to learn from this, we're going to see how that goes. So far I'd say, based on the reaction, there appears to be a lot of demand and interest around Project Scorpio, and we think it's going to be a pretty big success. If the games and the content deliver, which I think they will do, I think it will change the way we think about the future of console gaming.
On closing the gap between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
Sony is "winning" this console generation, at least in sales. Microsoft hasn't released any data in an age, but Sony passed 40 million sold months back, while current estimates put Xbox One at around the 22 million mark. I asked Greenberg how Microsoft fixed that, and if it's actually trying. They said that console sales are "really healthy," and that more people are using Xbox One now than last year. A large focus for the company is in bringing the games to a bigger audience through Xbox Play Anywhere (a feature that lets you buy a game once and play on Xbox and PC), rather than just trying to sell new consoles.
Q: I was in [a company's] briefing last week, and they said by the end of the year you'd sell 29 million Xbox Ones, versus 52 million PlayStation 4s. Obviously those are estimates, but the gap is there. How do you close that gap, and how focused are you on closing it versus just trying to make the 29 million Xbox gamers you do have happy?
Greenberg: We're focused on a few things. I'd say first we're focused on growing the user base of our games, bringing our games to as many gamers as possible; that's why you see a lot of our big franchises on Windows 10. That allows more gamers than ever before to play titles like Gears of War, Forza Horizon, etc. From a console ecosystem standpoint, we're seeing really healthy console sales and really healthy engagement. Year over year, for the month of July, we saw Xbox One usage up 18 percent, so also really healthy.
Sony's had a lot of success as well. I think what you're seeing is that the console market is really healthy, console sales are doing really well in general, software sales are strong. It's been a good industry for both of us, and we're innovating in different ways. We're innovating in a way where we know a lot of gamers are multi-device gamers -- they don't just buy one system -- and so we want to be able to have the same types of experiences on Xbox Live, the same games, the same friends, both in the living room on their console or at work, on vacation or at school on their PC. You should be able to stay connected, and play the same games through things like Play Anywhere. That's really been where we've been focused.

Sharia courts or councils, as they prefer to be called, mainly pronounce on Islamic divorces, which today constitute 90 percent of the cases they handle (AFP Photo/Shaun Curry)
London (AFP) - For more than 30 years, sharia courts enforcing Islamic law have been operating quietly across Britain. But two official inquiries have put them in the spotlight amid accusations that they discriminate against women.
Very little is known about them, even their number, which one study by the University of Reading puts at 30, while the British think tank Civitas estimates there are 85.
Sharia courts or councils, as they prefer to be called, mainly pronounce on Islamic divorces, which today constitute 90 percent of the cases they handle.
They range from groups of Muslim scholars attached to a mosque, to informal organisations or even a single imam.
But while they are aimed at helping resolve family and sometimes commercial conflicts within the Muslim community, some stand accused of undermining women's rights.
Campaigners cite instances where courts have refused to grant religious divorces to women who are victims of domestic abuse, and accuse them of legitimising violence, including marital rape.
The government and MPs on parliament's home affairs committee both opened inquiries this year into whether the councils are actually compatible with British law.
They are looking into the function and possible discriminatory practices of the courts.
- 'Rise of the Islamist movement' -
The first sharia court appeared in London in 1982 under the government of Margaret Thatcher, who rolled back state intervention in many areas, including mediation in family conflicts, which was delegated to faith groups.
But religious courts have existed for hundreds of years in Britain, whether in the Catholic Church or in the Jewish community -- the Beth Din -- notes Amin Al-Astewani, lecturer in law at Lancaster University.
As with sharia councils, the decisions of those bodies are not legally binding, but they represent a strong moral and social constraint for those who use them, they wrote in a submission to the parliamentary inquiry.
For Shaista Gohir, the chairperson of Muslim Women's Network UK who gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry, sharia councils are useful for Muslims but should be framed by a "strong code of conduct".
They also urged the government to make civil marriage obligatory for couples marrying under Islamic law, to ensure women are legally protected, saying that 40 percent of women who contact their organisation only had religious marriages.
But for other Muslim feminists, the courts constitute a "parallel legal system" and should be banned altogether.
An open letter to this effect was signed by more than 200 national and international women's organisations, while legislation which would limit the scope of sharia councils has been put forward by a member of the House of Lords.
"They are discriminatory, they are abusive, they endorse and legitimise violence," in particular marital rape, Maryam Namazie, spokesperson for the One Law for All campaign, told AFP.
They added: "These courts are linked to the rise of the Islamist movement. They are now saying that to be a good Muslim you have to go to these courts to get a divorce. It's not the case."
Swiss political commentator Elham Manea, the author of "Women and Sharia Law" who has studied the phenomenon for four years, said the first councils were set up by Islamist groups.
"They have been working with a kind of tacit approval of British establishment," they told AFP.
"There is a certain kind of hesitancy from British institutions to interfere in what they consider is internal affair to the Muslim community."
It remains to be seen whether the inquiries will change that situation, but they are already having some effect.
The London Central Mosque is attempting to organise the tribunals by bringing them under an umbrella group, the UK Board of Sharia Councils, which currently has 15 members.
They talk in their Democratic National Committee voice as if they still write press releases for the Governor of New York.
“Our Candidate…” they keep repeating, referring to Hillary Clinton.
“What about Bernie?” I ask.
They scoff. They say they don't have a chance. Hillary has the money and the establishment support.
My Dad has worked in politics, public and private sector, for over 25 years. In November, they came to New Zealand to visit me. The sandflies are nipping at our ankles as we drink beer and wine at a campsite in Marahau after hiking a portion of Abel Tasman track.
“But the only thing that matter is who gets the most votes,” I say. “We live in a democracy. It doesn't matter who has the most money.”
Their experience tells them otherwise.
My idealism and optimism in young Americans gives me confidence.
Bernie doesn't exist in their mind. Just as they don't exist in the minds of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the 359 superdelegates, according to the AP, already pledged to Hillary.

A few days before the Iowa Caucus, Serena and I are taking a luxury day away from the free campsite — where you have to bring your own toilet paper — to shower and use power, Internet and the kitchen at the Queenstown Holiday Park.
I'm devouring the New York Times. I try to explain what it all means and how Iowa is the first state to hold a primary, but it's not a primary it's a caucus and it makes no sense and Iowa is not a representative sample of America so why does it matter anyway.
Trump leads the polls amongst the Republicans. Hillary is ahead of Bernie by just a few points. I pull up Real Clear Politics and see that Hillary's lead has been shrinking over the past week.
They don't understand.
“So Bernie and Hillary are in the same party?” they ask.
“Yes,” I say.
“Do they like…” they can't find the words.
“Work together?” I ask.
“Yeah,” they say.
“Not really. They have really different ideas,” I say.
They don't understand.
They explain the party system In Ireland. If you vote for a politician you basically vote for their political party. They support Sinn Fein, which just recently became a feasible political party and is overcoming its status as a terrorist group and IRA connections. It's funny how the world is changing. With Justin Trudeau recently winning in Canada and Jeremy Corbyn winning in the UK
“Well there are only two political parties in America,” I say.
 They are shocked.
As they should be. As we all should be.

New Zealand is where we met for the first time as equals. I am no longer the son who they kicked out of their house and they are no longer the father that I depend on. We are two free men talking and drinking and enjoying each other's company.
“I like talking about this with you because I have ideas, but you have a lifetime of experience,” I say.
They tell me Obama lost all credibility in their first 18 months in office. They didn't fight hard enough. Too many concessions to the Republicans who only had one word to say: No.
They say we need a new leader in the next few years. Obama destroyed the Democratic Party.
What they don't understand is that the “new” leader we need is a 74-year-old socialist from Brooklyn.
—
Hillary says they will protect and continue Obama's legacy.
Why?
What was Obama's campaign all about? Change. Why would they want their predecessor to stop the change? I want us to go further. We can't stay like this.
The United States of America is not a democracy.
When one is elected as President of the United States that should be taken as a referendum. Take the power and do something with it.
(President George W. Bush doesn't count. They didn't win the popular vote. And, wow, that brings me to another point. I have to distinguish which President Bush I am referring to. I don't want to have to distinguish which President Clinton I am referring to. I don't want dynasties in America. Two families shouldn't be President for 24 plus years. Didn't we, like, fight really hard to separate ourselves from Kings and Queens and ruling families?)
I don't like the status quo. I want more change. Let's keep going.
Why don't we spend more money on education and health care than we do on “defense” which is code for pouring endless money into the wallets of private contractors who benefit from the military industrial complex? And I'm really tired of reading about drone strikes killing civilians.
I want money spent at home so Americans aren't living in poverty. I don't want money spent on the latest technology that kills people who have brown skin and live in deserts in the Middle East. Sorry, I mean protecting democracy around the world and keeping Americans safe. Silly me.
And it's all in the name of fighting terrorism. Who is the terrorist in this scenario? The poor teenager who's village was bombed and their family killed and then joins a group of “freedom fighters” who drive up in a pick-up truck and offer them a new life? Are they a terrorist? Or is the terrorist the most powerful country in the world that makes innocent people live in fear and if they die they are deemed enemy combatants because history is written by those who have power.
No more of this bullshit.
Hillary is a hawk. I want a dove. I want peace and prosperity for Americans.
Phew. Sorry about that. Where was I?

I can't help thinking about the conversation I had with my father as I am hitting refresh on my laptop watching the Iowa Caucus results trickle in at the Queenstown Public Library.
Bernie didn't win. Hillary has 49.9 percent to Bernie's 49.6. Hillary didn't win.
They both leave Iowa with the same number of delegates. Iowa is not a winner-takes-all state. What a strange system.
Now the establishment Democrats are scared. Even though it's just Iowa, they see that Bernie has people power. The most important type of power in what is supposed to be a democracy.
I check Reddit and read about Iowans saying their precincts ran out of voter registration forms. New voters mean Bernie wins. Young voters mean Bernie wins.
From my years as a Political Science student, writing research papers and opinion columns for the school paper, reading news, watching news, working as a Congressional intern, a media watchdog intern, trade association intern, think tank communications temp, and working on the campaign of the Governor of Virginia, I've learned that enthusiasm determines elections.
Certain people — older, whiter, and more conservative — always vote. Other people — younger, darker, and more liberal — usually don't vote.
Obama won their elections because young people and minorities were very enthusiastic about this intelligent and charismatic young black man who was running for President. They were different and exciting.
Right now in America, young people are excited about Bernie Sanders. They are excited because they have a lot of revolutionary ideas that will take America away from being owned by the moneyed interests and instead transform the country into a beautiful thing: A True Democracy.
That's what socialism is. Democracy. It means people working together instead of competing against each other. In unchecked capitalism, there are winners — which we always hear about — but there are many more losers. We don't talk about the losers.
How strange this must be to Australians who are required to vote or else face a fine.
The United States of America is not a democracy.

Republicans want to take us even further away from democracy. They call for voter ID laws and scream and yell baseless claims of voter fraud on their media outlets. And more furtively they disenfranchise voters via redistricting and gerrymandering.
Oh look. Ted Cruz won the Iowa Caucus. That doesn't mean anything. They can't win a general election. We have come too far. They want to shut down the government. They want to have a 10 percent flat tax rate and they want to abolish the IRS and make everyone pay taxes on a postcard.
Wow, so simple!
Is it any surprise that people who don't have a college education are more likely to support Ted Cruz? Of course uneducated people are going to vote for Ted Cruz. All they know is their own insulated existence and they don't have the critical thinking abilities to filter out what Fox News and Rush Limbaugh spouts from their spitting, seething, hate filled lips.
When they hear a 10 percent flat tax rate they think they will save a few thousand dollars every year. But what they might not understand is that the top marginal tax rate used to be 94 percent in 1944 and then down to a comfortable 70 percent until 1981. After deductions the millionaires and billionaires would pay a much lower rate but that shows how much we have changed since Reagan began to deregulate and favor the rich.
If the super-rich pay a 10 percent tax rate, then United States of America would lose an incredible amount of revenue. We can't just cut spending. America is people. Some people are poor. Some people can't support themselves because the system is rigged.
—
I understand that a lot of people out there like Hillary and don't appreciate this divisive Democratic Party that is similar to the debate between the Tea Party Republicans and Chamber of Commerce Republicans.
Yes, I read, An All-Caps Explosion of Feelings Regarding the Liberal Backlash Against Hillary Clinton, which several of my female Facebook friends have shared.
You say that Hillary has to be a part of the establishment because she's a woman and they have no choice. I don't care. This isn't about Hillary. I don't care about Hillary or your feelings, even if you are yelling.
I care about America. I care about the future of America and I know that Bernie Sanders has the ideas that will take us in the right direction.
I'm voting for the candidate who represents my beliefs. I don't care how hard Hillary has worked to be here or how they have to act a certain way because she's a woman. I agree with Bernie much, much more often than I agree with Hillary.
And I really don't give a fuck about what the media and the establishment tells us is possible.
Let us decide what is possible. Let young people decide what is possible. Let the voters decide what is possible.
This is a democracy, right?

Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors has unveiled the first location of its regional super-charging network in Australia, with the announcement that eight renewable energy-powered supercharging booths will be installed at the Goulburn Visitor's Centre.
The confirmation of the Goulburn address is the first in what is expected to a country-wide network of super-charging stations, which will add around 270kms to the range of the Tesla S, for no charge, and in just 30 minutes.
The first stages of the network – connecting Melbourne with Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast – were unveiled last year. Albury Wodonga is also a confirmed site, although the exact details have not been released.
Tesla says the superchargers are designed for city to city travel, allowing Tesla Model S electric vehicle drivers to travel for about three hours, take a quick break, and get back on the road charged up.
Tesla has so far deployed 415 Supercharger Stations and more than 2,285 Superchargers worldwide, making it the fastest-growing fast-charging network in the world.
The Goulburn installation will be powered by renewables. The visitor's centre (pictured below) already has a large rooftop array, but Tesla will be mostly green-power for this particular installation.
If you're from around these parts, you've probably heard about Dirk Nowitzki. They have a strong case as the greatest sports figure in the DFW area. They carried the Mavericks to their only championship (so far). They have won the Mavericks a lot of games.
In a vacuum, every field goal Dirk makes is worth the same amount: either two or three points. But while a game winning buzzer beater may only put two points on the scoreboard, it's a special moment that surpasses your run of the mill pick-and-pop jumper in the first quarter of a regular season game in the memory of fans, if nothing else.
We have found 16 instances of Dirk game-winning shots, and we have seeded them into a tournament bracket. But the seeding is arbitrary -- over the next two weeks, it's up to you to decide what shot is actually theirs greatest.
Bookmark this page, or just look for it every time you come to Mavs Moneyball over the next couple of weeks, because this will be your home page for the tournament. Below is a schedule that will be updated with links to the pages (as they go live) where you can vote for the best Dirk game winning shot, in true tournament style.
That's the only criteria we're going to give for this: which is the greatest? You get to decide what that means to you. There are a lot of factors to consider: degree of difficulty, importance of the game, impact to Dirk's career, the drama surrounding the play, or simply how pretty a swish it makes as it goes through the hoop. You decide which ones are most important to you, and vote accordingly.
First round, part one: Voting is closed
That layup has to be the first seed. It's iconic. It's historic. It's everything great about Dirk Nowitzki. Meanwhile, the 16 seed here is probably a shot you've never seen, but was a part of what was possibly the best Eurobasket runs Germany ever had.
RESULT: Last-second layup with 178 votes (89 percent)
If the Mavericks had gone onto beat the Suns in this second round series in 2005, this shot would probably be higher. Alas, they couldn't quite get it done. And then there's no. 9, and that shot's degree of difficulty might be the highest of the tourney.
RESULT: Crazy bank shot with 128 votes (76 percent)
We all remember the team that wouldn't die last year, despite the starting back court's best efforts. That 3-pointer was fantastic. On the other side, there's a beautiful step-back winner against Indiana.
RESULT: 3-pointer beats Chicago with 125 votes (75 percent)
"HE GETS THE BOUNCE. They GOT They BOUNCE," screamed Followill, a call that I am happy to have heard live. The mob scene is just as great. The other game winner is rather nondescript, but deserves its due.
RESULT: Pull-up jumper with 76 votes (52 percent)
First round, part two: Voting is closed
Okay, okay, you got us. This and-1 layup isn't technically a game winner -- it simply tied the game and sent it into overtime. But with that momentum, there was never any doubt, and we simply couldn't leave it off. The other shot probably doesn't stand a chance, but is excellent in its own right. Dirk struggled with their shot all game, but nailed that shot to make up for a bad night.
RESULT: And-1 layup against the Spurs with 129 votes (83 percent)
Technically, this shot is also not a game winner, but more of a "go ahead bucket" since there's over a minute left on the clock. But again, hard to leave it off in the closeout Game 5. Meanwhile, we love the other shot just because it's gorgeous. The turn, the fade and BANG! Buzzer sounds and game over.
RESULT: Doesn't miss twice against the Thunder with 82 votes (52 percent)
You probably all remember this shot, too: Deron gets a crazy bank shot off glass, and then Dirk is all like, "not so fast there, Utah." Great moment. With the 14 seed, we have Dirk baptizing Chris Kaman with a game winning jumper. Sorry future teammate.
RESULT: 3-pointer response with 149 votes (91 percent)
When it comes to degree of difficulty, 2012 was a good year. This and-1 layup against KG is bonkers, especially since Garnett is fouling them from the moment Dirk catches the ball. The other you'll know as Dirk's most recent buzzer beater, with the best part being Carmelo's deflated shrug.
RESULT: Layup and a Kevin Garnett foul with 84 votes (52 percent)
Second round: Voting is closed
(1) Last-second layup in Game 2 of the Finals (2011) vs. (9) Crazy bank shot beats Orlando (2012)
That one-footed fadeaway bank shot pulled a minor upset in round one, but can it pick up any steam against the one seed, Dirk's last-second layup in Game 2?
RESULT: Last-second layup in Game 2 with 136 votes (95 percent)
(4) 3-pointer beats Chicago in playoff push (2013) vs. (12) Pull-up jumper buries Phoenix (2006)
The top four seeds are alive, but the no. 12 seed here took out no. 5 last round because of the implications surrounding the shot. But hey, now it has to take on that Dirk 3-pointer we all know and love. Good luck!
RESULT: 3-pointer beats Chicago in playoff push with 71 votes (64 votes)
(2) The famous and-1 Game 7 layup (2006) vs. (7) Doesn't miss twice in the Conference Finals (2011)
Two shots that are technically not game winners, but both shots that helped the Mavericks move on to the NBA Finals. One resulted in a better outcome, but which shot is better is the question.
RESULT: Famous and-1 Game 7 layup with 83 votes (69 percent)
(3) 3-pointer response to a Deron Williams prayer (2008) vs. (6) Layup and a Kevin Garnett foul (2012)
Do you go that classic 3-pointer to answer Deron Williams, or a crazy tough layup over Kevin Garnett when he's all over him. This might be the toughest of the four matchups.
RESULT: Layup and a Kevin Garnett foul with 61 votes (54 percent)
Semifinal round: Voting is
(1) Last-second layup in Game 2 of the Finals (2011) vs. (4) 3-pointer beats Chicago in a playoff push (2013)
And here we are, just four shots left. Of course the number one seed has made it this far -- as we see in the NBA Finals, number one seeds are hard to knock off. And that layup is just the best of the best, culminating one of the greatest games in Mavericks history and greatest comebacks in the history of the NBA playoffs. If Dirk had lost this series to the Heat, I don't even want to imagine what would have been said about him. But on the brink of disaster, they led a charge and capped it with that beautiful layup.
Facing it is a shot that's slightly more recent. It doesn't have the same pedigree, being in a regular season game that ended with the Mavericks outside looking in at the playoff picture. But before you totally discount it, remember Dirk's knee injury. Remember their struggles when they first came back. Remember how the Mavericks seemed dead in the water, remember the beard pact, remember all of that. In this game, Dirk lit up the Bulls for 35 points in ways that only Dirk Nowitzki can, and while doing so, reminded the league of two very, very important details: first, that the rumors of their death were greatly exaggerated, and second, that a team led by them never, ever gives up.
(2) The famous and-1 Game 7 layup (2006) vs. (6) Layup and a Kevin Garnett foul (2012)
Three of the shots remaining come from the past four seasons. This one does not, which just goes to show how it has lived on through history. Even if you became a Mavs fan in recent years, you know about this shot. You know the story of that Game 7, how the Mavericks opened up a huge lead only to let the Spurs claw back and take a three-point lead with a Ginobili 3-pointer. Then this shot, technically not a game winner but in all regards finished the Spurs, allowed Dallas to run away in the overtime period and finally top their longtime nemesis. We all know this shot because how can you not?
This layup here has made it through two rounds thanks to favorable matchups, but also thanks to a level of difficulty that probably can't be surpassed in this entire tournament. Seriously -- is there any shot that is more difficult? Are there any shot that you are less likely to make in a hundred attempts? Of course, this tournament isn't based solely on degree of difficulty, so consider the metaphorical beauty of Dirk spinning past Kevin Garnett, fighting through half-a-dozen fouls and finishing a layup to take down the Celtics. People will debate which was the better power forward probably for years to come (granted, these people will be REALLY obsessed about basketball), but this play kind of gives you the answer, now doesn't it?
Final round: Voting closed, Dirk Game 2 wins the title of the greatest Dirk game-winning shot
(1) Dirk completes a historic Finals comeback with their Game 2 layup vs. (2) Dirk's famous and-1 layup over Manu in Game 7
It took a week and a half, and ultimately, it was just a countdown for the showdown between the no. 1 and no. 2 seeds to square off. Well, let's have at it. Go vote!

UK holidaymakers who make bogus food poisoning claims could go to prison, warns travel trade organisation Abta.
A huge rise in false claims has left travel bosses "embarrassed" by a trend which they say is a "British problem".
Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said the fraud is "one of the biggest issues that has hit the travel industry for many years".
They added that tourists chasing false or exaggerated claims "risk ending up in jail either in the UK or abroad".
Tens of thousands of UK tourists have put in for compensation in the past year, even though sickness levels in resorts have remained stable.
Abta says the cases usually involve holidaymakers who have been abroad on all-inclusive deals, who argue that because they only ate in their hotel, that must have been the source of their alleged food poisoning.
It has launched a campaign called Stop Sickness Scams, asking the government to clamp down on the issue.
It says laws designed to stop fraudulent claims for whiplash have instead pushed the problem of false insurance submissions on to overseas holidays instead.
This is because of a cap on the legal fees that can be charged by law firms pursuing personal injury cases at home.
Mr Tanzer added: "The government must urgently address this issue. The legal loophole that is allowing firms to unduly profit from these claims must be closed.
"This would allow people with genuine claims access to justice but make this area less attractive to claims firms."

Travel firm Tui said it had experienced a 15-fold rise in holiday sickness claims in the past year, costing between £3,000 and £5,000 a time, which was often more than the value of the holiday itself.
Tui's UK managing director Nick Longman and Thomas Cook UK's managing director Chris Mottershead both warned that if the problem continued, it could spell the end of the all-inclusive holiday for UK travellers.
Mr Mottershead said: "It has the potential of putting hoteliers out of business. They will stop British customers coming into their hotels."
Joel Brandon-Bravo, managing director of Travelzoo UK, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the upward trend was being driven by claims management companies.
"People are being called when they get back from holiday and encouraged to make claims and we've also seen evidence of them employing touts outside resorts encouraging people to make a claim and walking them through the process to make it easy for them," they said.
Private detectives
Mr Brandon-Bravo added that they felt people who were trying to cheat the system were not aware of the consequences if they were caught.
"Generally it is not made clear that if a claim is found to be fraudulent the individual could have a criminal record.
"In fact, there is one case going through right now with a Greek hotel, who is counter-suing a couple who made a claim for sickness three years ago for £10,000 and the hotel is counter-suing them for £170,000.
"They tried to withdraw their claim but they are seriously worried they could lose their house."
Package holiday operator Jet2 has decided to hire private detectives to tackle the issue.
It says it is using the private eyes for "one purpose and one purpose only - to prevent this dishonest behaviour from ruining the holidays of our customers".
It added: "The net really is tightening on this dishonest and deceitful practice, and we will not relent until these touts stop trying to take advantage of British holidaymakers."
'Legal proceedings'
The Foreign Office has also advised tourists against making any fraudulent claims.
"If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Spain," the FCO warns.
"There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay," says the FCO website.
"You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness."
The Alliance of Claims Companies told the BBC it was hoping to establish industry best practice principles that would help drive out rogue companies.
It wants to work with the travel industry to ensure genuine claims are dealt with effectively.
As hurricanes and wildfires rage, US climate politics enters the realm of farce Climate denial is less credible, but more powerful, than ever.
On Tuesday afternoon, as Southern Floridians nervously watched Hurricane Irma become a Category 5 monster, they received an odd message from popular right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh: The hurricane forecasts are not to be trusted.
In “official meteorological circles,” they said, “they believe that Al Gore is correct” about climate change. They “desire to advance this climate change agenda,” they warned, “and hurricanes are one of the fastest and best ways to do it.” So these meteorologists, they argued, create needless fear and panic.
What's more, local TV stations are hyping the hurricane to drum up bottled-water sales for local businesses. (Seriously.) For Limbaugh, the hurricane conspiracy goes deep.
If you can put aside how irresponsible it is to send that kind of message to a group of people in real and serious danger (uh, extremely irresponsible), it's almost funny. This is what conservative climate denial has come to. Even with one climate-amplified hurricane barely in the rearview mirror, another barreling down, and much of the Western half of the country on fire, the only reaction someone like Limbaugh can imagine is to double down. They would rather deny an oncoming hurricane than accept climate change.
It is difficult to appreciate, from up close and with so much else going on, just how deeply and ceaselessly bizarre US climate politics has become. Limbaugh is a good case study, but he's not the only one. Several bits of recent news — for instance, Trump's nomination of a climate denier with no science credentials to lead NASA — serve to illustrate the same point. American climate politics have gone from frustrating and weird to ... parody? Farce? Reductio ad absurdum? It's difficult to know the right term. But it ain't healthy.
The two consistent trends of the era of climate politics
Though it's somewhat arbitrary, I date the era of US climate politics back to June 1988, when NASA climate scientist James Hansen testified to Congress about climate change. Scientists had known about the greenhouse effect for a long while, but that is the moment when the subject entered US politics in earnest.
Ever since, two trends have unfolded side by side.
First, the science of climate change has grown more confident. Models and techniques have grown more sophisticated even as the field's core findings have undergone unprecedented, multi-layered, international review and re-review (and re-re-review). Public communication of the basic scientific findings has never been better; there has never been more informed media coverage. The truth about climate change has never been more well-supported or more accessible.
Second, the US conservative movement has become increasingly tribal, insular, and disconnected from the institutions and norms that bind American democracy together. As part of that process, it has rejected climate change and the need to address it.
One might think, a priori, that the first trend would have some effect on the second trend — that the steady improvement in the evidence for climate change would loosen the conservative embrace of climate denial, or peel off a substantial bloc of Republicans, or give GOP lawmakers pause, or ... something. Indeed, thousands of people have devoted millions of hours of time to careful argument and persuasion on precisely that presumption.
But no. The trends have continued steadily on, with virtually no interaction, no sense that they are occurring in the same universe. Let's take a look at some illustrative recent news.
Scientists set about refuting the remaining climate-skeptic literature
Most people have heard the statistic that “97 percent of climate scientists agree” on climate change. That stat traces back to an infamous study in which researchers built a comprehensive database of peer-reviewed scientific papers on climate change and classified them by whether they challenged the mainstream consensus. Just a little over 2 percent of the papers did. (Somehow “97 percent of papers” became “97 percent of scientists.”)
The study came under predictable attack, but its conclusions were in line with several other studies on the level of consensus. Skeptical Science has a nice rundown.
Now some of the same researchers involved in that 2016 study — along with several new co-authors — have published a new study, in which they track down the peer-reviewed papers challenging the consensus and subject them to review. For each of the 38 papers, they analyze the data and methodology and attempt to replicate the conclusions.
The results? You will not be surprised to hear that most of the papers had methodological errors and bad arguments. The authors cite “missing contextual information,” “ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions,” “insufficient model evaluation,” “false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, [and] basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics.”
If you're interested in the details, the study dives in pretty deep into each paper's errors and mistakes. Katherine Ellen Foley has a nice summary on Quartz, one of the co-authors, Dana Nuccitelli, discussed the implications over on the Guardian, and another co-author, Katharine Hayhoe, has a Facebook post about it.
The take-home message is simple: The 2 percent or so of papers in the peer-reviewed literature that dispute the basic findings of climate science are mostly junk. The arguments of contrarians “weren't suppressed,” writes Hayhoe. “They're out there, where anyone can find them.” They're just bad.
On one hand, this is yeoman's work. It adds to the strength of the climate case. But on the other hand, I have to admit, when I first read about this study, I laughed.
I mean, it's getting a little ridiculous. When 97 percent of scientific literature in a mature field agrees about something, we just say it's true. When 97 percent of scientists agree about something, we just say all scientists agree. We don't parse these tiny percentages; we don't track down every individual that disagrees and refute them one by one.
Scientists figured this stuff out. Then they reviewed each other's work, comprehensively, multiple times. They made the case. We live our lives and structure our society based on theories far less scientifically supported than anthropogenic climate change (see: anything in psychology, economics, or nutrition). Ninety-seven percent is extremely confident!
Now climate researchers are out wandering the landscape, seeking out the last remaining climate skeptic arguments, hunting them down one by one. At this rate, pretty soon every jackass in the comment section is going to have their own personal PhD student assigned to persuade him.
At a certain point, one has to question whether more of this is going to work, whether there is a substantial subset of people unconvinced by 97 percent confident findings who might be convinced by 98 percent confidence.
The evidence seems to show, rather, that the increasing strength of the climate case has made no dent whatsoever on the US conservative movement's denial. Whatever their opinions might be sensitive to, it is not the work of scientists.
Did they not hear about this latest study?

The know-nothings are ascendant
As the last 2 percent of credible climate skepticism was being demolished, the Trump administration was putting flat earthers in charge.
Trump announced they would nominate Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), a climate denier, to head NASA. Bridenstine has no scientific credentials or executive experience, but they serve on the House Science Committee, under the similarly fact-averse Rep. Lamar Smith.
"Mr. Speaker, global temperatures stopped rising 10 years ago," Bridenstine said on the floor of Congress in 2013. "Global temperature changes, when they exist, correlate with sun output and ocean cycles." (That's all false.)
They do not believe that human carbon emissions are the primary driver of recent atmospheric warming. (That's what “denier” means, no matter what Bridenstine's surrogates now say.)
They even demanded that Obama apologize for funding climate research. Now, because they were an early Trump supporter and apparently once expressed an interest, he's gonna get NASA.
Meanwhile, over at the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator Scott Pruitt has put John Konkus, a political appointee from the public affairs office, in charge of grants, a move the Washington Post's Juliet Eilperin rather drily terms “highly unusual.”
“In this role,” they write, Konkus “reviews every award the agency gives out, along with every grant solicitation before it is issued.”  They are reportedly on the lookout for “the double C-word,” asking grant solicitors to remove any reference to climate change. So far, they have canceled about $2 million worth of competitively awarded grants.
It's not subtle, but we already knew Trump and Pruitt are going after climate action with an axe, not a scalpel. (Pruitt is also bringing environmental justice and NEPA reviews under their political control.)
For decades, the case that climate change is a threat has grown stronger and deeper. It has had no effect whatsoever on the trajectory of the US conservative movement. Here at the tail end of all those papers and reviews and meta-reviews, all those explainers and videos and infographics, we have an administration appointing idiots who say things like “the climate has always changed” to lead the agency in charge of climate research.
Jim Bridenstine, explaining the whole ocean-cycles thing.
Still trying to make “tribal epistemology” happen
I look forward to the glorious day when our confidence in the basics of climate science finally makes it from 97 percent to 100 percent. But I think we have reached a point where we can say conclusively that the substantive scientific case for climate change is not going to pierce the conservative bubble, no matter how sharp the spear.
Hurricanes are battering our shores, the West is on fire, that poor 2 percent of remaining scientific skeptics has been refuted, and here's Rush Limbaugh, telling people in Miami not to believe meteorologists.
It's time to realize that more and better science isn't going to make a difference because the conservative movement has become detached from mainstream science just as it has become detached from mainstream journalism. If you believe an institution is corrupt, captured by your enemies on the left, you're not going to care if its confidence goes from 97 to 98 percent, or to 100 percent.
Mainstream science and journalism are saying one thing, conservative media and leadership are saying something else, and US conservatives have been trained for decades to listen only to other conservatives.
I called this “tribal epistemology” in a long post earlier this year, if you're interested in digging in. But the ludicrous dichotomy is right on the surface for all to see: an ever-strengthening case for climate action bouncing off an ever-more-adamantine wall of denial.
Rush Limbaugh confronts a universe of lies that contains round corners.
For years, US political and media elites have treated GOP climate denialism as a kind of peculiarity, an idiosyncrasy, occasionally to be mocked or “fact-checked” but mostly, like climate change itself, to be politely ignored.
Now it seems climate denial was a canary in the coal mine, harbinger of a more thoroughgoing alienation from mainstream understanding of the world, leaving the right “unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science,” as Ornstein and Mann so memorably put it.
The whole routine doesn't seem so cute when the Book of Revelation is unfolding around us and a dumbass radio host might get people killed.
Refuting the last few scientific arguments for denial is not going to bring conservatives around. Clever new ways of talking about climate action are not going to bring conservatives around.
Research on public opinion shows that conservative opinion is responsive to one thing above all else: the cues of conservative elites. People don't have strong opinions on political “issues” one way or the other. They believe and do what people like them believe and do, and they take their cues on that from trusted tribal leaders.
To put it more simply, conservatives will tend to believe on climate change whatever people on Fox (or talk radio) tell them about climate change.
It is conservative elites, and only conservative elites, who have the power to end this surreal farce. Judging from Rush Limbaugh's take on hurricanes, they do not yet feel any pressure to do so.
SOUTH WINDSOR, CT - 28 Jan, 2017 - The 51st annual Super Bowl will take place on February 5, 2017, at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. This year's game features the New England Patriots vs. the Atlanta Falcons, and features a half-time performance by Lady Gaga.
With all that in its favor, it's surprising to see that the tickets for this year's game are selling at significantly less than last year's 50th Super Bowl. And the prices have been rapidly dropping.
“Ticket Club's recent push to expand our impact within the ticketing industry has led to us pushing the cost down heavily for tickets,” said TicketNetwork CEO, Don Vaccaro. “Even then, I never thought a premium event for the Super Bowl would sell for so little. It's one of the largest events of the year.”
Currently, major secondary market players such as Stubhub, TicketNetwork, Vividseats, and Ticket Club are poised to fill the demand every Super Bowl season engenders. Since the primary market for the Super Bowl is lottery based, every year the secondary market explodes with demand.
This year however, that high demand hasn't translated into high prices.
On January 27th, the average price for the cheapest tickets across 5 major sites was $3,842. In order, Ticket Club listed tickets for $2,958, Vivid Seats listed at $3,157, Ticket Master at $3,243, StubHub listed at $3,270, and NFL on Location listed at $5,949.
On January 16th, the average price for the cheapest tickets listed on these same sites was $5,269. In just 11 days, the average ticket cost dropped by $1,427 – nearly 55%. The cheapest tickets across all the sites were from Ticket Club, and cost $3,820.
With 9 days left until the Super Bowl, prices are expected to continue to drop and are on track to break historic lows. That being said, expect NRG Stadium to be absolutely packed to the brim for this year's game.

Controversial extradition legislation under which Gary McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, faces being sent for trial in the United States on computer hacking charges is not "lopsided" or biased against British citizens, a judge-led review will report on Tuesday.
The official review into the 2003 Extradition Act, which was conceived in haste in the aftermath of 9/11, has also come down against the introduction of a "forum bar" rule, which would ensure suspects were tried in the country where the bulk of their offences had been committed.
But the independent review, led by Lord Justice Scott Baker, does strongly criticise the time taken by the European court of human rights to hear human rights appeals over individual extradition cases. The report urges ministers to put stronger pressure on Strasbourg to speed up cases.
The controversial European arrest warrant, which enables suspects to be transferred to another EU state within 90 days of arrest, is also to be given a clean bill of health.
The judge-led review, which was carried out by a small panel of experts, looked at the "balance of effect and the provision of justice in the McKinnon case".
The 44-year-old from Wood Green, north London, faces extradition to stand trial for hacking into secret military computers. McKinnon says they were looking for evidence of UFOs.
McKinnon's supporters said the Scott Baker report was a "whitewash" because it failed to conclude that the US-UK extradition treaty made it easier to send Britons to stand trial in the US than for Americans to be extradited to the UK.
"I'm quite frankly shocked that anyone with any intelligence can have the audacity to come out and say that this treaty is equal," said McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp. "Everyone knows it is a blatant whitewash produced to appease the Americans. My son Gary has lost almost 10 years of their life and has served a nine-and-a-half year sentence of psychological torture, despite the crown prosecuting service testifying to the court in 2009 that the US has provided not one shred of evidence of any extraditable offence … because they are not required to. For Gary these years have been akin to being on death row."
Home Office figures show up until June last year 62 people, 28 of them British, had been extradited from the UK to America since the legislation came into force. Thirty three people had been sent from America to Britain under the 2003 Act – three were US citizens.
The Scott Baker review was set up by David Cameron and Nick Clegg to implement a promise in the coalition agreement to review the operations of the act, which incorporates the UK-US treaty, to make sure it is even-handed.
It followed a Liberal Democrats 2010 manifesto commitment to "stop unfair extradition to the US". The Conservatives supported campaigns to prevent extradition in individual cases such as the NatWest Three and Gary McKinnon, but made no commitment to reform the legislation.
Critics of the extradition legislation claim the Anglo-American treaty is unfair because British citizens facing extradition do not enjoy the same degree of legal protection as Americans.
US authorities only have to outline the alleged offence, the punishment and provide an accurate description of the suspect. But for the British authorities to succeed they must prove the wanted person probably committed the crime – a much higher level of proof.
McKinnon's supporters had hoped at the very least Scott Baker would have endorsed the "forum bar to extradition" test, which is already on the statute book but has not yet been implemented. This would allow a court to block an extradition request if the conduct that led to the alleged crime took place while the person was in the UK, as in McKinnon's case. But it is understood that Scott Baker has rejected this approach.
Gunrunner: Eric Holder uses Fast and Furious to promote gun control at Senate hearing
Yesterday Eric Holder testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Operation Fast and Furious and once again me made the claim that they knew nothing about the deadly and scandalous operation. They said that while it was their responsibility to know what was happening in the “Justice” Department that they couldn't possibly be expected to know every detail of every operation in the department. That certainly sounds like a contradiction on their part; on one hand they admit it is their responsibility to know what is happening in their department, and on the other hand they are claiming that it is impossible for them to know what is happening in their department. It sounds as if they aren't up to the task they agreed to undertake when they accepted the role as head of the “Justice” Department.
We know that this is a lie based on Janet Napolitano's testimony in which they admitted that Operation Fast and Furious was an OCDETF which would have required Eric Holder to sign off on before it was implemented.
But that is not what I wanted to focus on today because I wanted to focus on this statement that Eric Holder also made during yesterday's testimony:
Unfortunately, earlier this year the House of Representatives actually voted to keep law enforcement in the dark when individuals purchase multiple semi-automatic rifles and shotguns in Southwest border gun shops,” Holder's written testimony declares. “Providing law enforcement with the tools to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking is entirely consistent with the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens and it is critical to address the public safety crisis on the Southwest border
Eric Holder did what many people try to do when they are losing an argument and have no facts to back up an argument, they tried to change the subject by shifting the investigation and attempted to turn the tables on the Congress and put them on trial for failing to pass more stringent gun control laws even though their “Justice” Department was selling weapons to criminals and are the ones under investigation here.
Over two years ago I wrote a post about how I felt that the violence at the Mexican border was going to be used by the Obama regime as a “crisis” to be used to implement strict gun control laws on the American people based on the 90% lie. This post was written before Operation fast and Furious became public knowledge and it has been my contention that Fast and Furious was being used as a means to ensure the 90% number was reached.
Ignoring the Fast and Furious scandal, back in July of this year the “Justice” Department moved forward with the gun grabbing scheme when it announced that gun shops must report all law abiding citizens who purchase more than one gun at a time in order to help quell the violence at the Mexican border. This policy was never implemented because the Congress must have realized the hypocrisy of the “Justice” Department asking law abiding Americans to adhere to more gun laws while the department was responsible for some of the violence at the border in the first place.
And now Eric Holder is berating the Congress for not implementing their plan even though they are guilty of providing the criminals with the guns used to justify their gun grabbing policies. Eric Holder has no case and they have no shame; they are gong on the offensive because they know that they cannot defend themselves or their policies.
The only people who should be exhibiting more control of their weapons are Eric Holder and all of the departments involved in this scandal because they are almost as guilty of killing Brian Terry as is the man who pulled the trigger.

Documentary Film – When money drives almost all activity on the planet, it would make sense that people understand it. Yet simple questions often get overlooked, such as: where does money come from? Who creates it? Who decides how it gets used? And what does this mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when the monetary and financial system breaks down?
To answer some of these questions, here's a film by Michael Oswald, produced by Mike Horwath, featuring Ben Dyson of Positive Money, Josh Ryan-Collins of The New Economics Foundation, Ann Pettifor, the “HBOS Whistleblower,” Paul Moore, Simon Dixon of Bank to the Future, and Nick Dearden from the Jubliee Debt Campaign.

Charlie Hebdo editor Laurent Sourisseau speaks at the 10th Investigative Journalism International Congress in São Paulo, Brazil, on July 4. (Carlos Villalba R./EPA)
The top editor and publisher of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical French newspaper that suffered a deadly terrorist attack in January, said the publication would no longer draw the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that have garnered it worldwide notoriety.
"We have drawn Muhammad to defend the principle that one can draw whatever one wants," said Laurent Sourisseau, in an interview this week with Stern, a German magazine.
But Sourisseau, who goes by the cartoonist nickname "Riss," said that it was not Charlie Hebdo's intent to be "possessed" by its critique of Islam. "The mistakes you could blame Islam for can be found in other religions," they said.
On Jan. 7, two Islamist militants stormed Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices, killing 12 of its journalists, including some of its top editors and cartoonists. According to statements made later by al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, which claimed responsibility for the attack, they were punishing the newspaper for its mocking depiction of Muhammad, images of whom are considered blasphemous in Islam.
The aftermath of the tragedy placed the controversial publication at the center of the global debate over the right to freedom of speech. Millions around the world who had likely never picked up a copy of Charlie Hebdo embraced the slogan "Je suis Charlie" in solidarity with its murdered staff.
Charlie Hebdo's first cover after the attack featured an image of a weeping Muhammad beneath a sign that read "Tout est pardonné," or "All is forgiven." The issue sold an unprecedented 8 million copies.
Sourisseau's recent remarks were foreshadowed in April by the cartoonist who drew that best-selling cover. Renald Luzier, who goes by the nickname "Luz," told a French cultural magazine that drawing the prophet Muhammad "no longer interests me."
They went on: "I've got tired of it, just as I got tired of drawing [former French president Nicolas] Sarkozy. I'm not going to spend my life drawing them."
In May, Luzier announced their imminent departure from Charlie Hebdo, citing overwork and fatigue. They added that producing each issue without their slain friends and colleagues was "torture."
The surviving members of the Charlie Hebdo staff all live under police protection and have spoken to media about the particular mental stress of producing the publication under the scrutiny that follows such tragedy. There have been reports of rifts within the staff over the moral role Charlie Hebdo should or should not to attempt to play, as well as disputes over what to do with the millions of dollars in added revenue and donations that have flooded in since the attacks.
Sourisseau, who owns 40 percent of the company's shares, has come in for criticism for pocketing a good portion of Charlie Hebdo's recent profits.
"The most important thing is there's a real desire to keep getting this paper out every week, it should continue and it will continue," Sourisseau told the Guardian in May. "The fact that everyone is watching across the world spurs us on to keep going, helps us not be scared."
They managed to survive the January assault by pretending to be dead, they have said.
"When it was over, there was no sound. No complaints. No whining," Sourisseau told Stern. "That is when I understood that most were slain."

A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday there is sufficient evidence for Oakland Raiders cornerback Sean Smith to stand trial for allegedly assaulting their sister's then-boyfriend on July 4 in Old Town Pasadena.
During the preliminary hearing at the Pasadena Courthouse, two witnesses testified they saw a man they identified as Smith stomp the head of Christopher Woods as they lay bleeding and unconscious near the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Arroyo Parkway.
“It was violent,” testified Sergio Galicia, who passed by the early-morning scene and called police.
Woods, a social worker in Atlanta, testified they recalled walking on the street, then their next memory was waking up at Huntington Hospital. Doctors inserted a metal plate and screws underneath their right eye and conducted reconstructive surgery on their left eye socket to repair five facial fractures.
Woods also tore their left anterior cruciate ligament, suffers from blurry vision and believes their injuries will require more surgery.
During cross-examination, Woods said they had no memory of Smith striking him.
Smith, who attended Blair High in Pasadena, faces felony charges of assault by means of force to produce great bodily injury and battery with serious bodily injury. They pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face a maximum of seven years in state prison.
Smith, 30, has played in 12 games for the Raiders this season. They signed a four-year, $40-million contract last year. They wore all black to the hearing, occasionally scribbled notes on a legal pad, but didn't testify and exited down a back stairwell. He's scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 3.
Alicia Brown, a cousin of Smith, testified she, Woods and their then-girlfriend, Rayna Smith, spent the day drinking vodka, then joined Sean Smith in Old Town Pasadena for tequila shots. Rayna Smith became combative, Brown testified, and their brother tried to calm them not long before the alleged assault.
Judge Teri Schwartz denied a defense motion to dismiss the case.
Last month, Woods filed a civil lawsuit against Smith and the Raiders seeking unspecified damages. The complaint accused the Raiders of training “Smith to use whatever means necessary to hard, injure and disable those they perceived to stand in their way.”
The lawsuit said Woods suffered a “severe traumatic brain injury” in addition to permanent vision damage.

Wife said they raped her, saying sex was their duty because they were married
If convicted, Lehmeier, 28, faces up to seven years in prison and/or a $14,000 fine
A 28-year-old man has been accused of threatening to shoot their wife while they breastfed their baby in a string of abuse going back ten years, police say.
Nicholas George Lehmeier, of Cold Springs, faces one felony count of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon - a firearm - in connection to an incident in July last year, reported CBS Minnesota.
The complaint against Legmeier was held by their wife Monday, who told police that they have been subjected to physical and verbal abuse for over ten years.
Deputies were called to their home on 2900 block of 151st Avenue, in Collegeville Township after reports of child abuse on February 8, reported WJON.
In their statement the wife also recalled the incident last year, when Legmeier allegedly took a 12-gauge shotgun, loaded it and pointed it at them while breastfeeding their four-month-old son.
They said they remembered them cocking the gun and pulling the trigger about three to four feet from her, but it didn't go off, says CBS.
They believed they were going to kill them but they then fired the gun out of a window.

The incident allegedly happened the first night they were able to bring their child home after they had had their five children removed from their home due to a prior incident, where Lehmeier was charged and convicted with assaulting their seven-year-old child.
The terrified mother says they hadn't told authorities before because they had been 'too afraid'.
They added that they 'always' threatened to kill them or the children.
 They are also accused of raping them and after they told them 'because they were married they had to have sex with him'.
If convicted, Lehmeier faces up to seven years in prison and/or a $14,000 fine
Alonso retired from the Spa race, reporting an "engine problem" on the radio, but Honda said after the race it found nothing in the data to suggest there was an issue.
Motorsport.com has learned the power unit was taken back to Milton Keynes for analysis but Honda could not find anything wrong and as a result have put it back in the pool.
It is available to use this weekend in Italy but it remains unclear when it will be drafted in as Honda is considering introducing an update on Alonso's car.
The Japanese manufacturer has brought the upgrade to Italy, but is currently undecided as to whether it will introduce it.
A final decision is due on Thursday night ahead of Friday morning practice.
Should Honda introduce the update, which is focused on boosting power, only Alonso will get it and it is likely Honda will change the whole engine.
That would incur a 35-place grid penalty, consigning them to starting Sunday's Italian Grand Prix from the back of the field.
Honda and McLaren are keen to take their grid penalties tactically to ensure they maximise results at the circuits in which they feel a strong result is possible.
Taking engine penalties at Monza makes sense, given the following race in Singapore offers the team arguably its best chance of a good result for the remainder of the season.
Alonso hinted at Spa that was they were likely to take penalties at Monza, when they suggested they would return the favour to teammate Stoffel Vandoorne by offering a tow in qualifying because their grid position would already essentially be clear.
"We had it planned," said Alonso of giving Vandoorne a tow. "Next week [at Monza] it will be the other way around because it's my turn.
"We were trying to take advantage of the penalties we have to find a positive and try to do the best for the team."
Liberty University's president decided that an arena full of people whose frontal lobes have not yet finished developing was the perfect place to denounce Islam and promote carrying dangerous weapons, all in the same breath.
In an address during the school's convocation on Friday, university president Jerry Falwell Jr. began their rousing call-to-arms by referring to something they were holding in their back pocket, presumably a gun (but who knows? Maybe it was just a stick of gum):
“If some of those people in that community center had what I have in my back pocket right now … Is it illegal to pull it out? I don't know ... I've always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in ... and killed them.”
Then, the leader of the Christian university, which often serves as a stop for presidential campaigns, urged their students, many of whom are less than 20 years old, to obtain weapons to shoot other people with.
“I just wanted to take this opportunity to encourage all of you to get your permit. We offer a free course. Let's teach them a lesson if they ever show up here.”
Falwell told The Washington Post that they were carrying a .25 pistol on Friday, and has had a concealed carry permit for about a year. They also clarified that by referring to “those Muslims,” he, of course, meant only Islamic terrorists.
A spokesperson for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) called Falwell's comments “rash and repugnant.”
So there you have it, from the lips of the president of the largest Christian university in the world: blessed are the concealed carriers, for they shall confer a degree.
Maine handcuffs Tigers in Monte Lee debut
David Hood by Senior Writer -
CLEMSON – Different year, different coach and different opponent but it was the same result for Clemson baseball Friday night.
Maine took advantage of a ball lost in the lights to score the go-ahead run in the top of the seventh, taking the luster off the head coaching debut of Monte Lee in a 4-3 season-opening triumph at Doug Kingsmore Stadium.
The Tigers lost the season opener to Eastern Michigan in 2014 and the opener to West Virginia in 2015.
Clemson had a final chance to tie the game – or win it outright – in the ninth. Pinch hitter Robert Jolly reached on an error to start the inning and was replaced by pinch runner Maleeke Gibson. Gibson was bunted to second and Chase Pinder was hit by a pitch to give the Tigers runners at first and second with one out.
Eli White struck out for the second out, but Reed Rohlman walked to load the bases. That brought up All-American catcher Chris Okey, who struck out to end the contest.
The Tigers managed just four hits and committed two errors, but it was the triple in the seventh that couldn't be ruled an error that made the difference. Weston Wilson had two of the Tigers' four hits and drove in a run.
"First, I want to give Maine credit for playing an exceptional ballgame today," Lee said. "It wasn't pretty on either side, but their guys did an outstanding job of competing. I thought their starting pitcher did an excellent job. Their bullpen was very good. They mixed pitches and they competed. They found a way to get it done. You've got to give those guys a lot of credit. They out-hit us and they pitched exceptionally well tonight."
The Tigers got on the board in the first inning after Eli White reached on a one-out error. Reed Rohlman promptly drilled the first pitch down the first baseline for an RBI double for a 1-0 lead and then scored on a two-out balk for a 2-0 lead.
The Black Bears added two runs in the top of the third against Clemson starter Charlie Barnes, but Barnes settled in until the sixth. The Black Bears put runners at first and third with one out, and Byrnes product Alex Eubanks came on in relief of Barnes. Eubanks induced a bunt strikeout from Lou Della Ferra, but Jonathan Salcedo rifled a single to left to score Kevin Stypulkowski. Eubanks escaped further damage but Maine held a 3-2 lead.
Barnes finished with 5 1/3 innings, giving up three runs, two earned, striking out seven and walking one.
The Tigers got Barnes off the hook in the bottom of the inning. Okey was hit by the first pitch of the inning and Chris Williams reached on an error by the shortstop. Maine starter Justin Courtney was replaced by Connor Johnson, who induced a fly ball from Beer to deep left center. Okey tagged up and advanced to third on the play. Weston Wilson chopped a pitch high off the infield dirt for a single that scored Okey, tying the score at 3-3.
Drew Wharton forced Williams at third for the second out and Renwick hit a soft liner at the shortstop to end the threat.
Clemson's defense failed Eubanks in the seventh. Jeremy Pena doubled to left over the head of Wharton with one out, but Eubanks struck out Tyler Schwanz for the second out. Brett Chappell promptly hit an easy fly ball to center, but Pinder lost the ball in the twilight, giving Chappell and RBI triple for a 4-3 Bear lead.
Eubanks went 3 2/3 innings, giving up the one run but striking out the final five batters they faced. They struck out seven on the night.
"It was a tough ballgame. It was a tight game. It was a tie ballgame going into the seventh and one of the things that championship-level teams do is they win the last nine outs of the ballgame," Lee said. "We put ourselves in a position to where we could've done that. We had some tough luck on a fly ball that Pinder and Beer just lost with two outs to give them the winning run. You give them credit. They kept fighting and finding a way to get guys on base to put pressure on our pitching staff. I thought we pitched exceptionally well. You look at our numbers, we walked one guy and struck out 14. I thought that Charlie Barnes and Alex Eubanks did an outstanding job. In tight ballgames, it's the little things that will get you beat and we made two errors tonight that cost us two runs. You've got to give Maine credit. We've got to bounce back and be ready to go tomorrow and try to even the series."
Clemson and Maine tangle in game two of the series Saturday at 2 p.m. The series finale is Sunday at 1 p.m.
This column recently recommended that as part of their 21st-century survival kits, rock and pop artists should strive to become freewheeling multimedia brands.
With the major labels in decline and thus unable to float generous advances to up-and-coming talent, this is no time to sit around and craft a sonic masterpiece. Two years off the road - and under the radar - is an eternity in this environment.
Bands of modest means need to think like Hollywood actors. Keep working. If your face isn't on the big screen, make sure it's on a magazine cover or a prominent video-store shelf.
That's an easy task for the camera-ready likes of the Jonas Brothers - not so much for indie-minded types who might be wary of self-promotion or highly protective of their music.
Doubtless in reaction to this sage advice, a couple of bands have leapt toward the front lines of Beatlesque multimedia innovation.
Tennessee rockers Kings of Leon, hyping the Sept. 23 release of their fourth studio LP, “Only by the Night,” are posting one home movie per day this month on their official Web site. The clips include intimate recording-studio footage and performance pieces plus some charming, deadpan interview segments.
For instance, one of the boys offers up this profound meditation on the band's new single, “Sex on Fire”: “I think that one's about … sex. Obviously.”
Indeed.
Then there's Tally Hall, a fresh-faced band of color-coordinated, necktie-clad indie-popsters not long out of the University of Michigan.
Soon after college, they were signed to the tiny indie label Quack. They toured extensively behind their debut album, “Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum,” and moved back in with parents.
Then came a big break: a deal with Atlantic Records.
The band members promptly found themselves at a crossroads - exuberant about the future but with an unexpected amount of free time on their hands. The machinery of a major label, it turned out, is like a jet engine: a powerful propellant that takes a while to warm up.
“So we said, ‘What do we now?'” recalls Tally Hall guitarist Joe Hawley, 25.
“What we like to do is write music and play music, but the formal business elements haven't fallen fully into place,” they say.
A film student who studied screenwriting at Michigan, Mr. Hawley says that rather than wait idly while the Atlantic put a promotional plan in place, Tally Hall plunged into making short films for the past year and a half.
With friends and family on hand as extras, the five band members on Monday will launch “Tally Hall's Internet Show” (“T.H.I.S.”), a series of polished, approximately two-minute set pieces predicated on hip, absurdist humor.
The series, shot on digital cameras and edited with Macintosh movie software, will be showcased front and center on the band's Web site and cross-posted on YouTube.com and iTunes.com - a multiplatform strategy designed to generate viral, word-of-mouth traffic.
A clip I previewed, “Natural Ketchup,” finds the band mates around a cafeteria table playing a game of 20 Questions centered on the titular, corn-syrup-free condiment. Bassist Zubin Sedghi fields the queries, which escalate with hostility: “Can you get it in a normal grocery store? … Is it pulpy? … Does it need to be refrigerated?”
Then the whole thing degenerates into a food fight as a, well, ketchup-y ballad by Matchbox 20 plays on the soundtrack.
Mr. Hawley is modest about the artistic pedigree of “T.H.I.S.”
“A lot of it's just for fun,” they say. “It's not necessarily professional, but it's not amateur, either.”
Modesty aside, the band has high hopes for the series. “We wanted to make a quality product rather than something that's thrown up on the Web and then torn down. We're trying to make something that will be meaningful. It's a project. We definitely planned it out,” Mr. Hawley says.
“T.H.I.S.” may or may not become the next viral smash, but it seems clear that Tally Hall is blazing a trail. As Mr. Hawley says, the Web has become an abstract playground where “identity is liquid.”
As in politics, success in music will depend increasingly on artists' ability to pierce through the clutter with biography and “narratives” - the more revealing or unusual, the better.
Rapper Diddy opining into a hand-held camera about Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin won't cut it. Madonna comparing Sen. John McCain to murderous dictators like Adolf Hitler and Robert Mugabe was good for a news cycle, but the stunt felt tired, irritating; it felt 20th-century, in fact.
The future belongs to bands like Kings of Leon and Tally Hall and other artists who use the Web to interact with fans in a sustained way and with humor and intelligence.
To the cleverest will go the spoils.

You've likely heard of the concept of practicing lovingkindness, a common translation of the word metta. But what if metta and lovingkindness are not quite the same? How could that affect you? Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu gets to the original meaning of metta.
Ajaan Fuang, my meditation teacher, once discovered that a snake had moved into their room. Every time they came in the door, they saw it slip into a narrow space behind a storage cabinet. And even though they tried leaving the door to the room open during the daytime, the snake wasn't willing to leave. So for three days they lived together. They were very careful not to startle the snake or make it feel threatened by their presence. But finally on the evening of the third day, as they were sitting in meditation, they addressed the snake quietly in their mind.
They said, “Look, it's not that I don't like you. I don't have any bad feelings for you. But our minds work in different ways. It'd be very easy for there to be a misunderstanding between us. Now, there are lots of places out in the woods where you can live without the uneasiness of living with me.” And as they sat there spreading thoughts of metta to the snake, the snake left.
When Ajaan Fuang first told me this story, it made me stop and reconsider my understanding of what metta is. Metta is a wish for happiness—for true happiness—and the Buddha says to develop this wish for ourselves and everyone else: “With metta for the entire cosmos, cultivate a limitless heart.”
Metta is not necessarily an attitude of lovingkindness. It's more an attitude of goodwill—wishing the other person well, but realizing that true happiness is something that ultimately each of us will have to find for them or herself.
But what's the quality of heart that should go along with that wish? Many people define it as “lovingkindness,” implying a desire to be there for other people: to cherish them, to provide them with intimacy, nurture, and protection. The idea of feeling love for everyone sounds very noble and emotionally satisfying. But when you really stop to think about all the beings in the cosmos, there are a lot of them who — like the snake — would react to your lovingkindness with suspicion and fear. Rather than wanting your love, they would rather be left alone. Others might try to take unfair advantage of your lovingkindness, reading it as a sign either of your weakness or of your endorsement of whatever they want to do. In none of these cases would your lovingkindness lead to anyone's true happiness. You're left to wonder if the Buddha's instructions on universal metta are really realistic or wise.
But as I learned from Ajaan Fuang's encounter with the snake, metta is not necessarily an attitude of lovingkindness. It's more an attitude of goodwill—wishing the other person well, but realizing that true happiness is something that ultimately each of us will have to find for them or herself, and sometimes most easily when we go our separate ways.
This understanding of metta is borne out in the Pali Canon, our earliest record of the Buddha's teachings, first of all in the word itself. The Pali language has another word for love—pema—whereas metta is related to the word mitta, or friend. Universal metta is friendliness for all. The fact that this friendliness equates with goodwill is shown in the four passages in the Canon where the Buddha recommends phrases to hold in mind to develop thoughts of metta. These phrases provide their clearest guide not only to the heart-quality that underlies metta, but also to the understanding of happiness that explains why it's wise and realistic to develop metta for all.
The first set of phrases comes in a passage where the Buddha recommends thoughts to counter ill will. These phrases are chanted daily in Buddhist communities the world over: “May these beings—free from animosity, free from oppression, and free from trouble—look after themselves with ease.”
Notice that last statement: “May they look after themselves with ease.” You're not saying that you're going to be there for all beings all the time. And most beings would be happier knowing that they could depend on themselves rather than having to depend on others. I once heard a Dharma teacher say that they wouldn't want to live in a world where there was no suffering because then they wouldn't be able to express their compassion—which when you think about it, is an extremely selfish wish. They need other people to suffer so they can feel good about expressing their compassion? A better attitude would be, “May all beings be happy. May they be able to look after themselves with ease.” That way they can have the happiness of independence and self-reliance.
Another set of metta phrases is in the Karaniya Metta Sutta. They start out with a simple wish for happiness:
Happy, at rest,
may all beings be happy at heart.
Whatever beings there may be,
weak or strong, without exception,
long, large,
middling, short,
subtle, blatant,
seen & unseen,
near & far,
born & seeking birth:
May all beings be happy at heart.
But then they continue with a wish that all beings avoid the causes that would lead them to unhappiness:
Let no one deceive another
or despise anyone anywhere,
or through anger or resistance
wish for another to suffer.
In repeating these phrases, you wish not only that beings be happy, but also that they avoid the actions that would lead to bad karma, to their own unhappiness. You realize that happiness has to depend on action: For people to find true happiness, they have to understand the causes for happiness and act on them. They also have to understand that true happiness is harmless. If it depends on something that harms others, it's not going to last: Those who are harmed are sure to do what they can to destroy that happiness. And then there's the plain quality of sympathy: If you see someone suffering, it's painful. If you have any sensitivity at all, it's hard to feel happy when you know that that happiness is causing suffering for others.
So again, when you express goodwill, you're not saying that you're going to be there for them all the time. You're hoping that people will wise up about how to find happiness and be there for themselves.
In a follow-up to this post, Thanissaro Bhikkhu discusses how the act of protecting your goodwill is most effective in protecting you and the world around you.
Musician and artist Laurel Sprengelmeyer goes by the stage name Little Scream, and there's a reason for that. There's so much they are yearning to express - hence the scream - but she's a gentle, lovely person - so it'll just be a little scream.
Based in Montreal, she's originally from Iowa, where they were raised as a Jehovah's Witness. When Sprengelmeyer was in grade three, their mother was disfellowshipped from the faith, but Sprengelmeyer chose to stay.
Laurel Sprengelmeyer with their mother and brother
"I looked at the world, and it seemed like there were so many problems, and that was a thing that had been presented to me as the solution to all of the world's problems, and all of people's problems. So I really embraced that wholeheartedly."
But there were challenges in reconciling their faith with their studies.
Laurel Sprengelmeyer
"I loved science, I was such an inquisitive kid. And I loved reading about everything. So having a fundamentalist doctrine about the world being created 6,000 years ago and all of the literal biblical fundamentalism, that was also really difficult for me to navigate with all of the things I was learning about the world."
They were overjoyed when they were accepted into a NASA space camp, until they shared the news with their Jehovah's Witnesses spiritual mother.
"She said, 'Well you know Laurel, if you go to this thing, you're going to be around worldly people and you know we're not supposed to spend any extra time with worldly people, and you're also going to be exposed to ideas that aren't in the Bible - things like evolution and all of these other ideas that you shouldn't be exposed to and I really don't think you should do it."
When Sprengelmeyer eventually left the Jehovah's Witnesses, they regretted some of their previous life choices such as not having attended the NASA space camp and they abandoned any religious practice altogether.
But soon, Sprengelmeyer felt there was something missing in their life.
"To find myself in a completely secular world, and not having anything that touched that part of who I was, it did feel really quite lonesome, so I asked my father, I said, 'Well the next time you are going to a Buddhist event, would you let me know?' "
Little Scream (Zach Hertzman)
Them father took them to a Buddhist retreat in Texas, and that was the beginning of the next stage of their spiritual searching. Later, upon the recommendation of a friend, they visited a small community in Brazil which was slowly becoming a cult. This experience inspired their album Cult Following.
"So the leader of this community claims that they haven't eaten in four years. I know they were drinking juices and having coconut water and stuff like that. But yeah, hadn't eaten in four years, which I think for the people for whom that works for, they have figured out a way to get their metabolisms into a very high functioning state. But then there were other people walking around that looked like they were starving."
Sprengelmeyer is a big fan of Prince, who was starting their life as a Jehovah's Witness just at the time Sprengelmeyer was leaving hers.
"I understand why people become Jehovah's Witnesses. Yes, I was raised in it, but … it gave me this sense of purpose in life. It made me feel like I was loved and special," they tell Mary Hynes. "There are a lot of really loving things in these communities. That's why people do it. And this world does not offer people a lot. It's just rampant consumerism. Where's the substance? What connects us to each other anymore? It's tough out there."
It's not even a question. I can be a necromancer, some dude with a stick, or a werewolf wizard. A werewolf wizard with brass knuckles who throws boulders and shoots icicles, no less. What better way to start my first playthrough of Haque, a newly released turn-based roguelike from SuperTry Studios. So begins the tragically short but altogether frickin' sweet life of thaumaturgic lycanthrope Fendr Plankflesh. Oh, and Forest, their fairy partner. No, I didn't come up with the names. They'd have been much stupider if I had.
At the request of a mysterious old man named Old Man, I enter the first floor of the dungeon. And boy, is it pixely in here. Now, the roguelike descriptor is a meaningless but necessary evil, a convenient if inconsistent bundle of terms like procedural and permadeath. That said, Haque is more like 1980's Rogue than most. It is incredibly retro. The low-res but endearing world renders in a small circle around my character and updates with every action I take. A D&D-style wall of commands and effects scrolls by on the right third of the screen, and some of the letters on my hotbar skills are so pixelated that they look like Latin.
Happily, the first entry in what I'm calling the action scroll informs me the enemies in this dungeon floor are all sluggish and tired. Which reflects poorly on me, because I miss the first enemy I attack: a bat. My opening icicle careens over its head, so I try lobbing a boulder It's way instead. Miraculously, I miss this as well.
Finally seeing exactly what sort of dolt she's been paired with, Forest automatically casts a protective barrier on me, presumably sighing, downcast. This protects me from the bat's attacks as I finish it off with some good old-fashioned knuckle sandwiches. May the werewolf gods smile upon me as I smite these vile bloodsuckers.
I pull up the minimap and head toward some unexplored rooms, which turn out to be graveyards filled with slimes and evil pumpkins. I fare better against these: a boulder connects and absolutely clobbers a pumpkin, as boulders are wont to do. But my satisfaction diminishes somewhat when I discover that, in the time it took me, a werewolf wizard, to kill one pumpkin, Forest, an AI fairy, killed two slimes. She's making me look bad, but she's also probably the only reason I'm still alive, so I put on a brave face and head to the teleporter.
Junk dodges Fendr's attack.
Before entering the next level, I get to choose between three skill add-ons. Again, no contest: frost boulders beats a small defense boost and a small speed boost. This also prompts me to look closely at my stats, which turn out to be surprisingly robust. I have a damage range of 9 - 19, a whopping six defense, a 12 percent dodge chance, and 2.5 movement and attack speed (which I later learn determines how many actions I can take before enemies have a chance to retaliate). I also have pitifully low accuracy, which explains my bat fiasco. I trade my brass knuckles for a rapier I picked up along the way, which bumps my accuracy up to 90 percent. Let's see those bats dodge me now.
Unfortunately the next level has no bats on which to test my newly acquired depth perception—only spiders and snakes as far as the eye can see, which is to say like six blocks. Two spiders swiftly identify the real threat in my party and gang up on Forest. She's done for at this rate. In a fit of rage known only to players whose healer is under attack, I activate my werewolf form for the first time, like some kind of Toonami shounen anime protagonist. I tear through both the spiders and my remaining mana in just a few turns, and promptly give Forest a regeneration crystal. I like to think this improves their opinion of me. The trouble is, not two minutes later, I stumble into an abandoned forge and attack and miss a box. I'm trying my best, Forest, I swear.
The anvil in the forge also yields a game-changing discovery: I can smack items together to make new, better items. My brass knuckles and rapier are both iron (don't think too much about the brass part), so they don't make anything interesting. But by combining my rapier with a snakeskin I picked up, I can make a snake rapier with higher accuracy. With visions of pinpoint boulders dancing in my head, I immediately give my breastplate the same treatment, using up the last of my snakeskins. Call me Snake Man.
Snake Man makes it to the third floor, whose enemies are said to be hideously inaccurate. Then again, I just missed a fucking box, so who am I to judge? It's smooth sailing until the old man warns me that a 'skeletitan' stalks this area. Judging from the extreme, glitch-like artifacting that often occurs whenever they talk to me, the old man seems to be fading in and out of reality. I suspect there's some sort of meta-narrative afoot, but Snake Man will never learn the truth.
No, I didn't die to the skeletitan, thank you very much. I'll have you know I annihilated them in my wolf form and made it two floors deeper, where I was swiftly pulverized by a manticore. At the very least, I died before Forest, so I can at least hope they made it out all right.
I can't figure out how Microsoft always gets so many cheerleaders to root for its new operating systems, but it somehow manages to do so. The cheers are beginning in full force and will continue unabated until the release of Windows 8 into the wild in October.
If the OS doesn't take off like a wildfire, then everyone will backpedal. As my readers know, I side with the critics of the product because I am not a fan of the Metro interface.
I am not going to name names because writers do not diss other writers unless they want an everlasting blood feud. Who needs the aggravation of that, especially when they are pandering to Microsoft? This rallying for Windows 8 spun out of control when some "objective" writers actually claimed that it is the greatest product ever. Then they finished with, "I can't wait!"
First of all, they do not have to wait. They can get a pretty clear idea of the new OS by downloading the Release Preview now. So why do they say they cannot wait? It makes no sense.
Over the next two months, this sort of boosterism is going to be rampant. In the olden days, Microsoft would send a lot of PR people into the field with techies in tow to show off the features of the new OS. If you, the writer, didn't understand the awesomeness the first time, then they'd return for a second or even a third brainwashing session.
Now it seems to be done through blogs, Twitter, and video podcasts. It's a different kind of cheaper groupthink. If Microsoft can get enough of its memes in play, these messages can permeate the media.
Personally, I cannot see why Windows 8 is so much better than Windows 7. What's so great about the dopey full screen Metro UI?
It is more cross-platform that Windows 7. So what? Why is that better? It is essentially dumbed down and based on the lowest common denominator: the Windows Phone 8 OS for handheld devices. This is funny to me because in the past, before the smartphone revolution, Microsoft's philosophy was just the opposite.
It used to take the basic desktop OS and move as much as possible to lesser devices. It was even done on the phone with older versions of Windows mobile that required a stylus to work. Now it reverses its thinking. The way I see it, the company will never get this right.
Thus, predicting that Windows 8 will be a flop is a good bet.
Every time you read the smallest of critiques, you end up reading something new. I had no idea, for example, that I will not be able to back-install a different OS if I hate Windows 8.
Here is an excerpt from a Globe and Mail article:
Windows 8 machines may not be capable of running other operating systems, thanks to UEFI nailing down what's allowed to load. This means no sneaky slithering of Windows XP or Linux onto a machine that came with Windows 8. It won't be a big deal for most, but the minority who wants the freedom to swap out the shipped OS for something else is irked, and working on ways to get around the restriction.
That doesn't sound good. These sorts of complaints are harder to find amidst all the applause.
Microsoft pulled this exact same trick since Windows 95. It's like clockwork. The only difference between then and now is that there are new suckers who will shill for the company. Kudos to Microsoft for a job well done.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University will acquire for-profit Kaplan University to create a new public institution, marking a first-of-its-kind move.
The Purdue Board of Trustees on Thursday morning unanimously approved a plan to acquire Kaplan University, a largely online institution that has 15 campuses across the country, including a site in Indianapolis.
"A public university coming together with an established online university I think is by any definition a national first," Purdue President Mitch Daniels said.
The emerging institution, which Purdue is referring to as "NewU" for the time being, will maintain all of Kaplan's current programs and employees, but will be part of the Purdue system and will include its name.
Daniels said the agreement with Kaplan — an affiliate of Graham Holdings Company — both allows Purdue to fully break into the growing online education sector, which the university wasn't prepared to do on its own, and to serve more nontraditional students who are unlikely to attend a residential campus.
Kaplan enrolls 32,000 students and about 3,000 employees, all of whom will transition to the new university. More than half of Kaplan's student population is older than 30 and most hold full-time jobs while going to school.
"When we thought there might be an interest at Purdue with (former Indiana) Gov. Daniels, there was no other possibility that was nearly as appealing for Kaplan," said Andy Rosen, Kaplan's chairperson and chief executive officer. "I've said many times I feel Purdue, probably more than any other institution in the country, has lived up to the land-grant mission while becoming an elite institution."
The "NewU" will rely only on tuition and fundraising to cover operating expenses and will not receive state taxpayer dollars. Indiana resident students will also receive a tuition discount that hasn't yet been determined.
While Purdue is technically purchasing Kaplan University, it will only pay $1 upfront and then enter into a 30-year agreement that allows for a buy-out option after six years.
Kaplan will provide some operation services to the new university, including technology and human resources support, financial aid administration and marketing and advertising, but it isn't entitled to receive any reimbursements unless and until the new university has covered all of its operating costs, according to the terms of the deal.
If certain conditions are met, Kaplan will receive reimbursement for its operation services and up to 12.5 percent of the new university's revenue.
"Purdue is not paying, except for the legally nominal $1," Daniels said. "We've struck a long-term service agreement, which really incentivizes both parties to grow the university and that's how Kaplan, if we're successful, will earn its value out."
The plan has been in the works for about five months, but Purdue officials had to keep the conversations confidential because Kaplan is a public company, said Gary Lehman, a trustee for the university. Additionally, under state law, the institution was legally obligated to safeguard trade secrets, they said.
The new university now requires approval by the U.S. Department of Education and the Higher Learning Commission, which currently accredits both Purdue and Kaplan. The agreement is expected to officially go into effect in about six to seven months.
Daniels said they expect the approval process to go smoothly, noting the Higher Learning Commission just accredited Kaplan for another 10 years. But the deal could face backlash due to the fact that Kaplan's a for-profit institution, a sector that has increasingly been under public scrutiny.
Additionally, Kaplan itself has been at the center of investigations and lawsuits. In 2015, it paid a $1.3 million settlement under a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for allegedly hiring unqualified instructors. The U.S. Department of Education also put it on a list released in January of hundreds of schools that load students with more debt than they can pay back.
When asked whether acquiring a for-profit could impact the Purdue brand or the reputation of a Purdue degree, Daniels said student outcomes, not business form, should be the real test in higher education. They also noted that the agreement makes the new university a public institution.
"We've tried to respond (to criticism of the sector) by proving what we've always believed, which is that we were doing a good job for our particular students," said Donald Graham, chairperson of Graham Holdings Company. "We are excited by joining an institution of the eminence of this one and by having a leadership that wants to expand our student body into new programs, new fields and particularly service to this state."

Microbling? iJack? The synonymic arsenal that is bread, cake, cheddar, moola and dough might have to make room for a whole new generation of short hands for the green stuff as the world pushes deeper into digital.
Clearly, cash is ceding at least some of its aura of indispensability to the smartphone, and to mobile devices and technology platforms of various stripes and hues in general, as the limit of what can conceivably be a convertible store of value is growing.
In relatively recent times, Goofy, Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse have seniority here. Disney Dollars, first issued in the late 1980s, are based on a dollar-for-dollar base, and are still widely accepted at the Walt Disney Co.'s archipelago of resorts and theme parks.
Disney Disney dollars are redeemable at many Disney facilities.
Other early forms of local currencies include Ithaca Hours, the Totnes pound in England and Denmark's Artmoney. Time Dollars are a unit of exchange where value is measured in duration.
More recently, until it scrapped it earlier this summer, Facebook Inc. had its ‘Credits' money system.
In the developing world, cell phone minutes have become a form of currency in places like Kenya, where calling time instead of money is often traded.
Bitcoin is an experimental attempt to facilitate transactions using peer-to-peer technology. Its radicalism is confirmed by the Keyser Söze-like anonymity of its creator.
In Sweden, there are reports of houses of worship installing card readers so as to make donations easier.
Under certain scenarios, frequent-flier miles and retailers' rewards programs are being used as forms of remuneration.
Companies and start-ups, too, from the big-ticket banks to PayPal Inc., to Square to Mint to Adaptu, are re-imagining personal financial tools for the 21st-century citizen.
They all starkly share a single missing ingredient: chicken feed, cabbage, dinero, scratch, mazuma. Physical cash.
“The example I often use is Sir Isaac Newton,” said David Birch, a leading British technologist, electronic-money consultant to major financial institutions and an advocate for digital wampum. “When Newton was made Master of the Mint in England in 1699 the currency was in a terrible state. If you had said to people in the 1690s: ‘Hey, how is money going to change in the future,' they would have said, well, basically, ‘silver coins will get better.' Or ‘someone will invent a machine for assaying more of them or for carrying more of them on a horse.'”
Today, cash is also at something of a crossroads. “We have pushed cash to the periphery of our everyday financial lives,” said David Wolman, a contributing editor to Wired magazine and the author of the recent book The End of Money. “Yet when you talk about killing cash, or even just wonder about its place in both the economy and the human psyche, people go bananas,” they added.
Wolman should know. As part of their quest to find out more about the role cash plays in the modern age, they “shunned cash” for the best part of a year, traveling around the world in order to diagnose “the usefulness of physical money” in diverse settings: amid Delhi's poor, to rogues states like North Korea and to alternative-currency evangelists operating on the margins of the law.
“The vast majority of people in the developed world have already said Yes to the electronic money proposition” even if they don't know it, Wolman said. “Most money nowadays only exists in the form of 0s and 1s on faraway servers.”
Still, Eden Zoller, an analyst at Ovum, said that cash isn't\'t going to disappear any time soon. \”Mobile payments are still fairly nascent services, and we've got nowhere near where the use of digital-payment services is habitual and daily, which is where it needs to be if it's going to cross that tipping point where people leave their purses behind and money home,\” they said.
Jeff Jarvis, a prominent commentator on the media and frequent speaker on topics related to technology, said: \” I see a world where you trade data for data. I will give you this data and in return I get something back. Is trust a currency, for example? I don't predict the death of currency, but it is an arena that is ripe for disruption. We've been hearing about the ‘cashless society' for years, just like the ‘paperless office.'”

A top U.S. diplomat wrote in a letter made public on Wednesday that the State Department is struggling to recruit new leaders amid the poor morale brought on by the Trump administration—leading to new concerns about the country's role on the world stage.
In an essay entitled "Time to Ask Why" in the monthly newsletter of the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), Ambassador Barbara Stephenson wrote, "There is simply no denying the warning signs that point to mounting threats to our institution—and to the global leadership that depends on us."
More than half of the department's career ambassadors have left their posts since President Donald Trump entered office in January, while other high-ranking officials have also retired or quit in record numbers. As Zack Beauchamp of Vox.com wrote, "The numbers reveal that American diplomacy, the backbone of U.S. global influence, is in a state of near collapse."
As the administration looks to cut the State Department's budget by nearly a third, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also imposed a hiring freeze as they attempt to create a more "efficient" State Department—tasking an outside consulting firm with interviewing employees to determine changes that might need to be made in the agency.

"These numbers are hard to square with the stated agenda of making State and the Foreign Service stronger," Stephenson wrote. "The talent being shown the door now is not only our top talent, but also talent that cannot be replicated overnight. The rapid loss of so many senior officers has a serious, immediate, and tangible effect on the capacity of the United States to shape world events."
In addition to the loss of scores of civil servants who would help to represent the U.S. in its relations with other countries, the department currently lacks an Assistant Secretary of State. Trump has dismissed concerns about the department's inability to fill its highest ranks, saying in an interview with Fox News last week, "I'm the only one that matters."
The ambassador expressed further concerns about a lack of enthusiasm for diplomatic work outside the department. While more than 17,000 Americans applied for the Foreign Service in 2016, that number has dropped by more than half this year.
"As the shape and extent of the staffing cuts to the Foreign Service at State become clearer, I believe we must shine a light on these disturbing trends and ask 'why?' and 'to what end?'" wrote Stephenson.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia is not veering from the mythology they created to explain away the crisis over Ukraine. It is one that wholly blames the West for provoking a new Cold War and insists that international sanctions have not grievously wounded their country's flagging economy.
They told the story again on Friday at a business forum whose purpose was to give weight to that fantasy. It drew at least 24 chief executives of Western companies, some of whom attended even though their governments had urged them not to.
Despite Mr. Putin's skill at using foreign executives as props, they are looking more desperate than confident that they will win the confrontation with the West.
It will be a big setback for Mr. Putin if, as expected, European Union foreign ministers formally extend sanctions on Russia by six months when they meet this week in Luxembourg. Ever since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea forced NATO and the European Union to react, they have worked to split the trans-Atlantic alliance, and some believe its collapse is their real goal.
Sometimes it's the subordinate who must say goodbye first.
This sentiment applies directly to General Michael Flynn who serves as President Donald Trump's National Security advisor. Known for their “kiss-up, kick-down” behavior, Flynn, USA retired, has been mired in controversy ever since it became known that they were advising then presidential candidate Trump. Flynn's speech at the 2016 Republican Convention on behalf of Mr. Trump endeared them to Trump supporters.
Those who served with Flynn praise them for their work as a war fighter and counterintelligence strategist. They served directly under General Stanley McChrystal when the latter was heading Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in Afghanistan. It seems, however, peacetime – like that of another General (Patton) – does not suit Flynn so comfortably. They were fired from their last job as Director of Defense Intelligence for their bullying tactics. Post-military they wrote a book that included disparaging remarks about Islam. Flynn also did work for RT, Russia's state sponsored television network.
Flynn's close connection to the Russians allowed them access to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. Sometime in December after sanctions were imposed on Russian by the Obama Administration in retaliation for Russian interference in the presidential election, according to reporting by the Washington Post, Flynn advised the Russians that the recently imposed sanctions would be “revisited” once Trump took office.
To make things worse, again according to the Washington Post, Flynn was not wholly truthful to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence about they had said to Kislyak. This misinformation led Pence to go on national television in mid-January and deny allegations about Flynn's discussion of U.S. sanctions on Russia.
Flynn has since backtracked on their story and apologized directly to the vice president. Rumors are flying throughout Washington about the disarray in the national security offices of the White House. Furthermore, Flynn has become less and less trusted by more and more people. Still they seem to have the confidence of the president, who has the only vote that counts.
Or maybe not!
Flynn can resign. At minimum Flynn has become a distraction for the Administration. At maximum they could be a security risk. The only way they can save face – and the honor of the presidency – is to step aside.
In doing so, Flynn would be following in the long tradition of civil and military leader who have stepped aside. One who did so was Flynn's own former boss, General McChrystal. In 2010 Rolling Stone magazine published an article about McChrystal's JSOC command in Afghanistan. Reporter Michael Hastings was embedded with the general's command structure.
During that time Hastings heard disparaging remarks about the Obama Administration's management of the war effort duly included them in their article. When the article was published, McChrystal took responsibility and resigned, likely forfeiting the opportunity to assume command of NATO, a plum assignment.
A counterargument may be that President Trump needs Flynn. Undoubtedly Trump respects Flynn's expertise but sometimes a president is better served when an aide under fire leaves.
While we speak a great deal about leader's responsibility downward – that is, respecting men and women throughout the chain of command. Leadership also extends upward. A direct report who is creating friction cannot serve to their fullest abilities. When this occurs, they must step aside for the good of the leader in charge and the health of the organization as a whole.
Flynn stepping aside is not about politics; it's about honor and integrity, two attributes of leadership that Flynn as an Army officer was bound to abide. Flynn can salvage a degree of respectability and exit now, sparing the nation and the president further embarrassment.
Update: General Flynn resigned as National Security advisor late this evening, February 13, 2017.
BMW has revealed patent sketches of its new i3 model this week, originally publicised by French Automotive magazine L'Automobile.
The absence of the transparent door panels are the first noticeable modifications, while the front doors have been moved back, significantly reducing the size of the rear doors. In addition, the head/taillights, bumpers and mirrors have been redesigned.
BMW plans to sell the i3 as an ‘all electric' model, and with a range extending engine. The former will see a floor mounted lithium-ion battery pack generating 127kw and 290nm, with a range between 130-160km.
The range extending engine will be a 0.65 litre two-cylinder motorcycle engine, which will extend the range to 220km.
Head of product management of BMW's i-division, Maximilian Keller, has previously released several other official figures, while BMW has reportedly taken 100,000 requests for a test drive of the new i3.
The BMW i3 will reportedly go on sale next month across Europe for an estimated 35,000 GBP ($58,000) for the EV, and 38,000 GBP ($63,000) for the range-extender.
At a recent Injustice: Gods Among Us preview event in Toronto, I had the chance to speak with Adam Urbano, Netherrealm Studio's senior producer.
Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting game based in DC Comics fictional universe. It features popular DC characters like Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, The Joker and even lesser known superheroes like Hawkgirl.
Q: Was there any difficulty deciding which DC characters to include in Injustice: Gods Among Us and which ones not to include?
Adam Urbano: Yea, it was rough. The process probably took three or four months, so it's this mix of things. We needed characters to tell the story we wanted and we needed a mix of boy and girl characters, so there is a nice balance. And then we obviously needed some well known characters like Batman but also some lesser known characters that we're kind of introducing to the world.
And then when you get down to it, there are so many DC characters. Not all of them are neccesarily popular or well known, but when you get to know them and get a chance to make them unique, the roster is near limitless and very hard to deal with.
Q: Was working within an established universe with a history and its own rules and constraints difficult at all?
Adam Urbano: DC was actually awesome (that's usually something producers say to maintain a relationship but it's totally true). Because it's sort of the Injustice universe they gave us a lot of freedom. We couldn't go crazy though. We're not going to make Superman suddenly have completely different powers, nor would we want to. We want to keep them true.
In a lot of cases, for some of the characters they let us do things that aren't necessarily canon. They also let us explore different versions and custom costumes were very much something we wanted to do with our interpretation. So it actually wasn't that bad.
Q: With the game's story line, did you sort of have free reign to create whatever you wanted?
Adam Urbano: DC was involved in the process obviously because they're experts and they know their universe better than you or I possibly could… For the most part it's the story we wanted to tell. We do some things that are obviously non-canon and sort of what you wouldn't expect the characters to normally do.
Q: I know your team worked on the recent Mortal Kombat reboot. Was there anything you learned from that game or maybe took from it and applied to Injustice?
Adam Urbano: We liked the community feedback we got at the end of Mortal Kombat (sort of what the tournament level players had to say). We also heard from fans about parts of the game that were difficult and its learning curve.
So we specifically set out to bring in as much fan feedback as possible. We also tried to make it much more accessible than Mortal Kombat was. Mortal Kombat was designed from the ground up to be a tournament level game. This one, sort of has tournament potential, but the barrier to entry is much lower.
So there are three attack buttons and one character trait buttons and outside of super moves that's it, so you can just play around with them. Through mashing, you can actually do quite a few cool things.
Q: Would you say that Injustice is more accessible than other fighting games. I'm not particularly a big fighting video game player because I find learning most game moves daunting and I just don't have the time to commit to that sort of thing. Back in the day, I played old school Mortal Kombat titles (mostly Mortal Kombat 3) and looking back, they seem much easier than modern fighting titles.
Adam Urbano: This is a great question because it's something we've definitely been focusing on. You can just pick it up and hit buttons and play against your friends. Every character has a high attack, medium attack and a low attack. And then the trait button just does something awesome. It might switch stances or do a powerful attack (like with Catwoman) just does something cool.
And super moves, those big over the top moves, are just the two triggers and then interacting with the environment, which is a big part of the game, is always just one button.
So I've basically just described the entire control setup. Now we wanted to make sure people could learn so the game also has a very in-depth tutorial. The first time you boot it up it says, “Hey you've never played this before, do you want to try out the training?” It gives you a chance to get used to it.
Story mode ramps up so that way you're playing this awesome single player experience and it kind of teaches you different characters as you go through it and you don't have to worry about competitions.
We have something called Starlabs which are hundreds of challenges that use the game engine in different ways to do different fun things that actually teach you without really knowing it… For example, there is a game of asteroids with Super Man. It's a totally different unique thing but it teaches you how to do a specific thing.
Because move lists are kind of big and scary, if you press start, just the special moves people care about come up (just the main things that look cool). You can tag these moves so they show up on screen. So if you want to learn or master one move, you can just hit a button and it will always be displayed on the screen.
Q: Were you worried that the game wouldn't appeal to hardcore gamers because it's too simple and accessible?
Adam Urbano: In development, that was obviously a huge concern. As you simplify things you have to make sure that there is still a level of depth.
What I can say is, that for the past two months we've brought in 20 or 30 pro players, especially guys that don't neccesarily like Mortal Kombat and are more about Street Fighter (guys that are negative towards our game), and they've sort of been living at Neverreal playing the crap out of the game and helping us balance it and find things.
I was absolutely blown away by how much they liked the game. The word they tend to keep using is that, “It's something fresh and unique.” The background interactables and stuff were something they were skeptical about at first, actually turned out to be something they like. So I used to be nervous and now I'm more comfortable.

Summary excerpted from LearnTarot.com, an excellent tarot resource:
The Hanged Man is one of the most mysterious cards in the tarot deck. It is simple, but complex. It attracts, but also disturbs. It contradicts itself in countless ways. The Hanged Man is unsettling because it symbolizes the action of paradox in our lives. A paradox is something that appears contradictory, and yet is true. The Hanged Man presents to us certain truths, but they are hidden in their opposites.
The main lesson of the Hanged Man is that we "control" by letting go - we "win" by surrendering. The figure on Card 12 has made the ultimate surrender…. yet they shine with the glory of divine understanding. They have sacrificed himself, but they emerge the victor. The Hanged Man also tells us that we can "move forward" by standing still. By suspending time, we can have all the time in the world.
In readings, the Hanged Man reminds us that the best approach to a problem is not always the most obvious. When we most want to force our will on someone, that is when we should release. When we most want to have our own way, that is when we should sacrifice. When we most want to act, that is when we should wait. The irony is that by making these contradictory moves, we find what we are looking for.
After 194 starts in 13 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, center Todd McClure is retiring from the NFL.

Vote for the greatest play in NFL history:
NFL.com has picked the 64 best plays ever, and over the next three weeks we are asking fans to cast their votes for the best. Vote now!
A seventh-round draft pick in 1999, the under-sized McClure was tutored by zone-blocking guru Alex Gibbs. Across the coaching staffs of Dan Reeves, Jim Mora, Bobby Petrino and Mike Smith, McClure constantly fought off competition to keep their job, breaking Keith Brooking's franchise record for consecutive starts.
The Falcons gave the 36-year-old a proper sendoff Monday, holding a retirement news conference.
"You deserve to be in that Ring of Honor," Falcons owner Arthur Blank said, "and we will get you there as soon as we can."
Last year's second-round draft pick, Peter Konz, is expected to take over the pivot after struggling in 12 starts at right guard in their rookie season. The Falcons are counting on Konz to improve as they gain strength and moves back to their natural position.

One of the biggest hurdles on the road to make electric vehicles attractive for the mass market is the long time it usually takes to charge batteries. But a Japanese company called JFE Engineering now claims it has found a solution for that problem. According to JFE, even so-called “quick battery chargers” often take 30 minutes to charge a car's battery to 80% of its capacity.
But their self-developed charger apparently needs just three minutes for a 50% charge, or five minutes for a 70% charge. In tests JFE conducted with the device, Mitsubishi's electric car i-MiEV (pictured above) was able to drive for 80km continuously after a 5-minute charge (the vehicle has a driving range of 160km on a full charge).
JFE also developed a low-cost version of its charger, which doesn't require a power transformer and therefore costs just $60,000 to install (roughly half the usual amount). Both that device and the high-cost model meet the specifications of the CHAdeMo standard for electric cars that was brought to life by a group of Japanese and international companies back in March.
JFE expects its charger to be used mainly at gas stations and convenience stores all over Japan by the end of March 2011.

Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham has today received a letter from NSW Minister for Resources and Energy, Anthony Roberts, which confirms that the 6-month freeze on coal seam gas license applications announced in March, is a farce.
In the letter (see below) the Minister confirms that, despite acknowledging in March this year that a comprehensive process for evaluating license applications was needed, the freeze:
Does not apply to Petroleum Special Prospecting Authority applications, even though this is a form of gas exploration;
Does not apply to the processing of existing applications made before the freeze and as such NSW Trade & Investment continues to process the 7 Production, 13 Exploration and 6 Special Prospecting Authority license applications they have received;
Does not apply to the processing of license renewals
So despite this so-called ‘freeze' on applications many parts of NSW still have the threat of CSG license approvals hanging over them. Towns with license applications over or near them which are being processed include:

Thanks to superfans at the FuckYeahBenNichols and DearBenNichols fan-sites, us lazier musicologists now have access to the man's earliest known bands. So, let's go backwards a few decades before working our way up the imminent new Lucero album.
In Little Rock, in the early early 90's, Ben played bass in high-school band The Harbingers, and shortly after, with the same personnel, in Victory Garden. Guitarist Brad Sims wrote most of the lyrics and sings lead, but Ben sings lead on the songs they wrote and back-up on most of the others. Like many upstart bands of the time, they wore a significant R.E.M. influence, but added accents of Hüsker Dü and early Joy Division. They sound like the south's response to Miracle Legion, which itself had been the north's response to R.E.M. For such a young band, they had that southern college rock sound down–they could float it out on new waves and surf vibes, tie it together with ribbony guitar and anchor it with concave drum. Ben's bass stands out every now and then, (like in the mostly instrumental “Truth is Rude”) but in these recordings at least, the Harbingers and Victory Garden were guitar-focused bands.
In the mid-90's, Ben's tastes punkified and they started their own Jawbreaker-influenced band, Red Forty. This is where the story becomes more well-known. Red Forty incinerates Little Rock for a few years before Ben moves to Memphis. There, they start a new band in the same vein called Lucky Old Sun, which only leaves behind a few shows and a demo tape featuring the song “Crystal Blue,” later played occasionally by Lucero. Ben's punk period stands on it's own as a great few years of songs; Red Forty and Lucky Old Sun deliver the emotional weight of any Lucero song, but quirked and revved to supercharged pace.
After Lucky Old Sun, Ben plays a stint on bass in the Memphis band/institution Pezz. They would leave Pezz to concentrate on a new cowboy band they were forming with another former Pezz bassist, Brian Venable. The rest, as they say, is … on the Attic Tapes.
Almost fifteen years later, Lucero has proved almost as variable as the rest of Ben Nichols' career, which is the main thing to take away from how a dude's high-school bands sound. Fashions change and artists sometimes outgrow them; if an artist started his/her work as a teenager, then that has to be for the best. To the message-board posters who say they could never listen to Lucero because the singer's voice seems so put-on, I mean, they didn't sing that way when they were twenty-something in Red Forty, the revelation of an earlier phase in Ben Nichols' evolution will probably only add fodder to that argument. To the Lucero diehards who say they can't appreciate the new records as much because they just don't sound like same band, it's not Country to use trumpets, the Harbingers and Victory Garden might not mean anything because they don't sound like “All Sewn Up.” However, I think each of those positions are as absurd as saying I don't buy into Picaso's Cubist Period, I mean, a few years before they were painting normal-looking people.
We're talking about an entire lifetime in art, spontaneous in some phases, but composed in others. Red Forty, the first four Lucero albums (S/T, TMFW, TN, ND, RRSB), and the Cormac McCarthy album are Nichols' compositions, but Lucero's latest material seems to be Ben's most instinctive since Victory Garden–it is an actual evolution, unlike Obama's “evolution” on equal rights for same-sex couples, which is just a choice. Ya burnt!

Stories about India these days tend to focus on the new India -- young, dynamic and with a rising GDP. But like many other parts of the world, India is graying rapidly.
By 2050, a quarter of the population will be over 60. Once, India was known for its large extended families. But now, thanks to immigration and globalization, it's also full of empty-nesters.
Services Needed For Seniors
And there is not enough of an infrastructure yet to support the increasing services needed for these seniors.
While a majority of Indians still live in multigenerational families, there is a growing anxiety about aging in India these days.
Madan Engineer and their friends spend every day playing carom at Mumbai's Harmony Senior Center. The game is a sort of cross between billiards and shuffleboard. While other centers are open for just a few hours a day, this one allows seniors a place to come from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
"There is no club like this in Mumbai," Engineer says.
My grandparents and great-grandparents didn't seem to need clubs. They all lived in our house. Growing up in India in the 1970s and '80s, I remember my great-grandmother making their own pickles, teaching me about gods and goddesses, playing endless games of solitaire in the sun.
Global Families
Manga Advani is the father of a friend of mine in California. Advani lives in New Delhi, while their son has made a new home in the U.S. Advani admits times have changed.
"The generation now -- most of them just fly away out of the country. They don't have much time for their parents," Advani says.
It is ridiculous for us to support a home for the aged.
A child abroad was once a badge of pride for Indian parents. Money sent home gave them a boost up the economic ladder. But it's hard to be a dutiful child from across oceans. When my father died, I wasn't even able to get home before they were cremated.
Irudaya Rajan, a demographer, says this is a common problem.
"Anybody dies today, the body will be kept in the mortuary for two to three days with all the ice, because someone has got to come from Canada, someone from London," Rajan says.
The problem isn't just that the children are off chasing the American dream; 81 million Indians are over age 60. But in the new India, old age isn't what it used to be.
Once, someone told me, the grandfather always got the prized fish head at dinner. Now, that goes to the grandson.
New Law On Care Of Parents
The government recently had to pass a law requiring children to take care of their parents. There were too many cases of seniors abandoned on the streets, according to Matthew Cherian, who runs the advocacy group Help Age India.
"Very often, the children leave the parents in different parts. We put them in old-age homes meant for the poor and destitute. This person is middle class, but there is no other option but the destitute home," Cherian says.
When I was growing up, the only homes for the aged were for poor Indians who had no family. They were run by people like Mother Teresa. We took donations of old clothes and cans of evaporated milk. Today, there's still not much help for seniors beyond their families.
There is no social security, and few Indians have pensions. Aloka Mitra set up a home for older women in Calcutta in the 1970s. A government minister tried to talk them out of it.
Taboo Of Nursing Homes
"He said, 'You ladies have nothing better to do, and so you are thinking up all these problems which don't exist. In our society, the aging are well looked after. It is ridiculous for us to support a home for the aged," Mitra says.
The home they started, Naba Nir, is still going strong. Mitra, at 69, is now older than some of the residents. They worry about what they will do when the time comes to retire.
"My son and daughter are both in London," they say, "In 10 years' time, we might need a home for the aging ourselves."
And they might choose a new, more popular option --- a pay-for-stay home or a retirement community with uniformed maids and bonsai classes.
Betty Kamath moved back to Bangalore to live in one after more than a decade in California with their children. They have three great-grandsons and loves to show the family photograph with four generations of Kamaths.
But the youngest one looks out of place -- and they are. He's been pasted into the picture, because Betty has never seen them in person.
Moving Back To India For Care
Kamath was happy in California until their rheumatoid arthritis got worse. They were ready for a nursing home, but not one in America after they saw the way the attendants treated the older people. "They are quite rude," Kamath says. "They grumble if you call too much. You won't find that in India."
Kamath can afford a 24-7 personal attendant in India. But an old-age home still carries a tinge of stigma here. Before they moved back, they wrote a letter to all their relatives explaining this was their decision, not them children's.
"You know how people talk," Kamath says. "They would have said, 'Oh, they sent their mother back,' " they say.
In California, Kamath's daughter, Cynthia D'souza, remembers when their mother told them about the decision.
"I said, 'Are you sure, Mom?' They were so definite. They said, 'Can you help me in this transition?' The tears just flowed," D'souza remembers.
Helping their mother move back to India has made D'souza think about their own retirement. For now, they plan to stay in the United States because that's where their children are.
"I feel it would be a disservice for them to feel obligated to come see us and to make that journey," D'souza says.
"So I think we will make ourselves happy here. We owe it to our kids," they say.
D'souza and their siblings stay in touch with their mother through annual visits and weekly calls, just like I do.
The last time I visited my mother in India, they told me to buy a CD with their new favorite song. It's about a couple who move to a retirement home because they have no place in their children's busy lives. My mother loves it, even though they live with my sister and the grandchildren. I think sometimes she, too, feels this new India is no country for old women.
Sandip Roy, editor with New America Media and host of its radio show New America Now on KALW 91.7 FM in San Francisco, traveled to India on a fellowship from the South Asian Journalists Association.
A slew of organizations and online communities targeted at digital nomads have emerged in recent years: the #nomads Slack group, the digital nomads subreddit and Nomad List, to name a few. But Remote Year is certainly the most ambitious company attempting to harness the lifestyle's appeal into a viable business model.
Here's how it works: For a monthly fee, Remote Year handles all the logistical details including accommodations, coworking space memberships and travel to and from each destination. The company also provides a community, social events and sporadic networking opportunities with locals.
The process for applying is relatively simple: Go through a series of online applications, submit a $50 fee and interview with a staff member via Skype. If you're invited to the program, you send in a deposit ($5,000) to secure your spot.
That's not to say it's not competitive. Remote Year claims that more than 200,000 applicants have applied for the 75 spots across their programs, six of which will launch in 2016.
Though it's decidedly cheaper to go backpacking solo, the appeal is obvious. Who doesn't want to travel the world and escape the drudgery of planning it, all while collecting a steady paycheck? From a corporate perspective, too, companies feel more secure letting their employees travel abroad with an organization that touts itself as rooted in professionalism.
This all sounds terrific.
But the ambitious business model isn't without serious hurdles, perhaps the most daunting of which is finding a middle ground between the fluidity of the lifestyle and the rigidity of a set itinerary and work schedule. Digital nomadism is attractive because it teases the promise of a truly untethered life. But Remote Year is a structured program. It dictates where, and how, you'll travel, and the people with whom you'll be surrounded for an entire year.
The two principles are innately at odds with one another.
An ad campaign for the nomad lifestyle would likely showcase young, beautiful people lying in hammocks on the beach, laptops in tow and a drink in hand. In fact, I may have just described an ad currently running to promote Remote Year.
Living the reality, however, looked a little different.
When they graduated from the Harvard Business School three years ago this month, the economy was a wreck. Nearly one in four of their classmates didn't have a job at graduation in May of 2009. Yet, Joe Mihalic, then 26, was able to land a job with Dell in Austin, Texas, at twice as much as the $52,000 a year they made before earning their MBA.
But there was some overhang from their experience in Boston: roughly $101,000 in loans that they had to borrow to get the degree, even after Harvard gave them $54,000 in fellowship support.
Mihalic, of course, is hardly alone. The average debt of a Harvard MBA last year was $77,880, up from $73,110 a year earlier. Wharton MBAs, however, racked up average debt loads estimated to be an unprecedented $114,000, and the median financial burden for an MBA from a top ten business school from the Class of 2011 is about $88,500.
Despite Mihalic's six-figure burden in the midst of the economic downturn, they gleefully jumped into a free-spending lifestyle that had defined their MBA experience. They bought a 2004 BWM M3 in the same month they graduated from Harvard. From Thursday to Saturday nights, they did the town with pricey dinners and drinks. For their 28th birthday, they bar hopped with friends in a black stretch Hummer. Though Mihalic had budgeted $850 a month for entertainment, they were commonly spending $1,300 monthly.
AFTER MAKING $22,000 IN MONTHLY PAYMENTS, THE HARVARD MBA STILL OWED $90,717
But there was one place where they didn't slough off. For 21 months straight, they dutifully made the monthly $1,057 payments on their student debt. It wasn't until the summer of last year when they checked their balance and was thrown into shock. After paying out more than $22,000, they still owed $90,717, a sum that exceeded their after-tax salary for a year.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that they would pay $42,000 in additional interest if the loans went to their natural 10- and 15-year terms. That is when they vowed to go on an extreme financial diet to get rid of the financial burden. “Student loans are a strange animal,” they reasoned. “Unlike a payment towards a car loan or a mortgage, a student loan payment doesn't go towards something that is benefitting me in a direct way.”
Mihalic, now manager of strategic alliances and business development at Dell, vowed to do “everything in my power–short of lying, cheating, and stealing–to pay down this debt in the next ten months.” Except that in their case, they also decided to chronicle the journey on a blog called “No More Harvard Debt.” The idea to anonymously write about the sacrifices they were about to make occurred last August after knocking out a cover letter to apply for a weekend delivery job.
LOOKING FOR PART-TIME WEEKEND WORK WITH A HARVARD MBA AND A FORTUNE 50 JOB
Even to him, taking a part-time position to pay down more of their debt seemed like a peculiar thing to do as a Harvard MBA with a six-figure management job at a Fortune 50 company. “I took a step back and it wasn't until I stopped laughing at myself that I realized others might enjoy laughing at me, too,” they recall. “The blog started as a joke. I had every intention of following through on my challenge when I started it, but I wanted to let people be amused by it and get a laugh at it, too.”
Over the next seven and one-half months, through 88 separate posts, they vividly describe their novel experience. Their blog is at times introspective, witty, and sincere, often inspirational. Their finances are laid bare, open for all to see as if they were dissecting a frog in a high school lab class. From their $20 haircuts to their monthly car insurance of $171, they meticulously detail every expense and just about every source of revenue in their life. Mihalic even shares an itemized credit card statement with a month's typical charges in Austin's 20-something bars and restaurants (among the charges were a $107.85 bill at Chez Nous, an $86.80 tab at La Condesa and a $68.13 purchase at Kona Grill). Always, they write with humor and flair on what it is like to live a remarkably frugal life–at least for a Harvard MBA.
As a symbolic and data-rich target, Wall Street faces a number of cyber threats. Regardless of the size of an attack, there remains the need for effective recovery and response mechanisms, underpinned by preventative measures.
The hub of the US financial sector, Wall Street holds great symbolic and physical importance. As such, nation states and lone hackers are reported to have launched attacks in a bid to disrupt national security or gain financial advantage through the sale of stolen confidential data.
In 2011, Iranian-sponsored hackers launched attacks against the websites of 46 Wall Street institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Although inconclusive, US-led sanctions on Iran possibly triggered the cyberattack as retaliation. This would reflect a symbolic attack on the US financial markets.
More recently, Russian hackers allegedly acquired over 150,000 press releases from Wall Street publications in August 2015. It is claimed that this data was then used to gain a trade advantage, worth $100 million.
Both examples show how, by targeting Wall Street, hackers can influence foreign affairs or make financial gains, estimated to be in the realm of $120 billion in the US alone during 2013.
Source of Cyberattacks on Wall Street
What does it mean to be cyber secure?
Due to the technological interconnectivity of Wall Street, a cyberattack is not an isolated affair. Instead, multiple financial institutions are targeted, as shown in the previous examples. Interconnectivity is both a blessing and a curse. It is vital for the sharing of real-time financial data, crucial to Wall Street firms. However, one data breach can disrupt multiple organisations.
This is where Wall Street is not so cyber secure. Firms are reluctant to publicly acknowledge mass data breaches, over fears that this will produce market volatility and damage a firm's reputation. However, the reporting of cyberattacks to other interconnected institutions is crucial in responding to, and preventing, further attacks.
Cybersecurity exercises, such as Quantum Dawn 3, held in 2015, featured 80 financial firms. It pitted Wall Street against fictitious cyber adversaries, to test its detection, reaction and recovery from attacks. Communication and cooperation between firms and the government were crucial in maintaining the operation of Wall Street during a series of simulated attacks. This remains true outside of the controlled safety of an exercise.
The human element in cybersecurity
Whilst information technology has developed rapidly, humans remain the greatest security risk to Wall Street. Cybersecurity is gradually rising up the agenda in Wall Street board meetings. In a survey conducted by FIS, a financial services technology consultancy, 77% of participating banks view cybersecurity as their biggest risk.
Despite being identified as a threat, only 18% of those firms questioned adopted the updating and reporting mechanisms prescribed by the US government. This is to keep all interconnected networks on Wall Street aware of live attacks. Whilst a good understanding of the potential risks posed by cyberattack is evident, Wall Street will not remain cyber secure for long due to inaction.
The CEOs of the future, the so-called Millennials, may be the greatest hope for improving Wall Street's cybersecurity. Tech-savvy financial leaders who have lived and breathed information technology since birth are best placed to detect, counter, and aid Wall Street's recovery from cyberattack.
As FIS's survey cleared illustrated, however, increased security spending and the hiring of experts still fails to influence boardroom decisions sufficiently at present. The basics of prevent, respond and recover are relatively neglected.
Overall, therefore, Wall Street is responding to cyber threats half-heartedly. Investment in cyber defence ebbs and flows, increasing immediately after attacks, yet dwindling when none are detected. Palo Alto Networks and FireEye, two leading cybersecurity firms, depreciated over a quarter in value in 2016. Wall Street generally views cybersecurity as a short-term risk or issue.
Value of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) depreciated over 2016
Is Wall Street cyber secure?
Wall Street can be considered relatively cyber secure at present. Successful breaches have allegedly lost millions, though these attacks are infrequent. It must be understood, however, that no organisation can be fully cyber secure. Efforts should therefore be focused on improving cyber defences, resilience, and recovery capacity in order to minimise the disruption of a successful attack.
There is a noted increase in cyber threat awareness, crucially at the executive level. It is hard to say how long this relative security will last. Wall Street must remain agile, adapting to new threats as they develop.
Less tech-savvy Wall Street executives cannot remain complacent. They must not only understand cyber threats, but act upon them. This requires more than just investment and the recruitment of experts. Millennials are very likely to have a greater grasp of the risks and opportunities that cyber connectivity presents, having been born into a technologically interconnected world, more so than senior executives relying on risk briefings by younger subordinates.
Wall Street also has a long way to go in adopting simple defence mechanisms. Unanimous incident logging and sharing among institutions of all sizes and government departments would be a start. Mass-participant exercises such as Quantum Break 3 must continue to expose vulnerabilities.
Cyber insecurity is a growing threat and complacency should not be an option. Wall Street must get the basics right. The logging and reporting of cyberattacks will improve resilience. It provides wisdom, so that CISOs can learn the methods of attack used by hackers and tackle them in the future.
Speaking during their weekly WEEI radio appearance, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady raved about their team's new defensive back, Darrelle Revis.
“It's been so fun to go against him, because they challenge every throw, every play'' said Brady. “He's so instinctive.''
It didn't take long for Brady to steer their answer in the direction of a couple of former Baltimore Ravens greats.
“I played against Ed Reed for a long time, and this is just a little bit of an example. Ed Reed, he'd play the deep middle of the field but sometimes he'd make tackles three yards from the line of scrimmage when their responsibility was 40 yards down the field. And you'd say, ‘God, how did they know that the team was running a shallow cross?' They just knew. They were something.'' “That's a lot how ‘Reeve' is. You don't know what they see, or what they know, but they always are in the right place and has got incredible instincts for a corner. Sometimes they run the routes before the receivers. They have great intuition. I think they obviously see everything on the field. They see the quarterback, they see the split of the receiver, they see the eyes of the receiver, they see the technique of the receiver coming off the line of scrimmage, and it's probably hard for them explain at times what they see. They just sees everything and they make great breaks on the ball. That's what makes great defensive player, is the anticipation to play with that.''
Brady also compared Revis to Ray Lewis, saying of Lewis, “When you would play-action, they wouldn't even step toward the line of scrimmage. They would just drop back into a zone, and then when you'd run the ball, he'd be downhill faster than anybody. And they just, to recognize plays and combinations, it's a great skill.''

The Reed comparison is huge praise for anyone, but especially coming from Brady. We learned just how much Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick slobbered over Reed during Belichick's “A Football Life'' feature.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's chief budget officer will issue new guidelines on Friday to boost efficiency and protect U.S. taxpayer dollars from being misspent in a move the White House expects will save hundreds of millions of dollars.
The steps were outlined in a memorandum obtained by Reuters to be issued by Jeffrey Zients, the acting White House director of management and budget. They follow other measures by Obama to curb federal waste and also follow an outcry over lavish spending by government workers at a conference in Las Vegas.
“Today's guidance is part of our aggressive efforts to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely,” Zients said in a blog posting to highlight the memo.
The measures will freeze the federal real estate footprint, meaning no new net additions to federal property holdings, and require federal agencies to cut spending on travel by 30 percent, while setting a higher bar to approve trips.
In addition, the guidelines will mandate that government-owned cars not be replaced until they are at least 3 years old or have been driven for 60,000 miles.
Teresa Danks (Jonathan Roark)
As a public school third-grade teacher, Teresa Danks has grown accustomed to getting creative when it comes to providing supplies for their classroom.
They hit up yard sales all summer. Weekends are devoted to thrift stores. Almost daily, they scroll through online sales and secondhand websites.
So when Danks's husband joked over breakfast last Tuesday about how they could resort to begging — as they were venting their frustration over recent cuts to Oklahoma's education budget — they didn't immediately brush them off.
“He's like, ‘Well, I guess you could make a sign, hit the streets like a panhandler,'” Danks said. They then laughed it off; they didn't. “I thought, you know, that might just generate a buzz on Facebook to help me get the supplies I need,” they told The Washington Post on Monday.
Danks said they had never panhandled before and wanted to act quickly before they changed their mind. After picking up a poster board from the Dollar Store, they laid it on the hood of their car outside a nearby gas station and scrawled a message: “Teacher Needs School Supplies! Anything Helps. Thank You.” At the bottom, they added a smiley face.
As Danks was finishing the poster, a man walked out of the gas station, noticed what they were writing and handed them a $20 bill.
“I want to support you in what you're doing,” they said they told them That was just the beginning, they added.
“I told my husband, I made my sign,” Danks said. “Now get me out there quickly before I lose my nerve.”
They dropped them off at a nearby highway overpass, at the end of an exit to a local casino. Danks would later remember being “a nervous wreck” but, within 10 minutes, they had collected $32. One person stopped to hand them a bottle of water. Another wanted to tell them how much their own teachers had meant to them
“I went from being nervous and awkward to being overwhelmed, not only with the small donations of cash but just the words of encouragement,” Danks said.
[With state budget in crisis, many Oklahoma schools hold classes four days a week]
Danks left the intersection soon afterward but returned after a local news station wanted them to reenact the panhandling. Even in the 10 minutes it took to film the segment, more drivers stopped. In all, Danks collected $126 that day. While that may not seem like a lot to some people, Danks said any amount helps. They told local outlets they make $35,000 a year, a figure not out of line with many of their colleagues' salaries, according to public records.
“We are given pencils and paper, and we are given textbooks … (but) it goes beyond pencils and paper,” they said. Danks estimates they spend about $2,000 of their own money per school year buying materials for their students to go through their project-based curriculum. “It might be paint and glitter, it might be batteries if we're talking about science projects, or water bottles for the volcanoes. … We're constantly replenishing and we're trying to do these things week after week.”
They added: “All this stuff, it costs money. I want the proper tools to do my job well. I wouldn't ask somebody to build my house with a spoon.”
Oklahoma already ranks near the bottom among the 50 states when it comes to per-pupil funding, spending about $8,000 per student — only Arizona, Idaho and Utah spend less, according to federal data. And even as the nation has recovered from the Great Recession since 2008, Oklahoma's education spending has fallen 14 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Years of tax cuts and falling oil prices have hit this energy state hard, slicing away hundreds of millions of dollars in state revenue and leaving Oklahoma schools among the nation's most cash-strapped.
The budget crunch is so extreme that schools have had to move beyond traditional cost-cutting measures, like letting class sizes rise and cutting art and foreign-language classes. Now, in nearly 1 in 5 Oklahoma school districts, students are going to class just four days a week — triple the number in 2015 and four times as many as in 2013.
The four-day week is meant to help districts shave off a few dollars that they would otherwise spend on utilities and transportation. But even more important, it's become a key teacher recruitment tool in a state that, by any measure, offers among the worst pay in the country. The state has not raised teachers' salaries since 2008, and the average salary now stands at $45,276, far lower than the national average of $58,353, according to the National Education Association, the largest U.S. teachers union.

“We've cut so much for so long that the options just are no longer there,” said Deborah Gist, superintendent of Tulsa Public Schools, a district that still holds classes five days a week but plans to merge schools and eliminate more than three dozen teaching positions.
Oklahoma's neighbors — Texas, Arkansas, New Mexico and Kansas — also pay less than the national average, but they still offer thousands of dollars more per year than the Sooner State. The disparity has led to a hemorrhaging of teachers from Oklahoma, according to local and state education officials. In May, Shawn Sheehan, the 2016 Oklahoma teacher of the year, announced that they were moving to Texas for a better-paying job that would support their family.
“This decision wasn't an easy one. Not by a long shot,” Sheehan wrote in a blog post later published by The Post. “But at the end of the day, the simple truth is that we can be paid a respectable wage for doing the same job — this job we love very much — by heading out of state.”
Since 1996, Danks has worked at private and public schools in Oklahoma, returning last year to a classroom at an elementary school in the Tulsa Public Schools system. They said teachers are “upset and frustrated” amid continuing cuts to public education in the state — and emphasized that their panhandling was a spur-of-the-moment decision born out of that same frustration.
After the weekend, Danks started a Facebook page called “Begging for Education” that they hope will bring more attention to education funding needs and problems in the state. Over the weekend, a corresponding GoFundMe account raised more than $3,000. Danks said additional donations will go to help teachers in other classrooms get supplies they need as well.
“I'm shocked and overwhelmed that people are listening to me, but I'm thrilled,” Danks said. “We have teachers every week that picket the (state) capitol and go unseen and unheard. I didn't necessarily start off doing this for everyone else but I'm definitely doing it for them now.”

On the Mexican side of San Ysidro Port of Entry on the border of California, traffic starts backing up long before the sun rises. Commuters shift their gears into park; lower their seatbacks for pre-dawn naps; buy Mexican grilled corn or burritos from street vendors; and listen to roving musicians strumming traditional norteño ballads — anything to help pass the time as they wait to enter the United States for the start of the American work day.
By the time that the traffic accumulates, Joaquin Harris, 37, a Mexican-American citizen born in San Diego but living in Tijuana, is long gone. Six days a week for the past 16 years, Harris has crossed the border at 3 a.m. for their 6 a.m. shift at a San Diego shipyard.
Their schedule is common among Tijuana's daily commuters, which include blue-collar workers, educated professionals, and students (both schoolchildren and college-aged), that cross by car and foot, a process that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
The act of crossing is itself a privilege, one that an estimated 55 percent of Tijuanenses do not possess, according to a study by Tito Alegria, the Director of Urban and Environmental Studies at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte — and this figure does not include the migrants and American deportees that see Tijuana as a transit point. Increasingly, the would-be American immigrants are not Mexican, coming from Central America, Haiti, and even Asia. Meanwhile, 90,000 Mexicans have been deported in the first half of 2017, and of the 15 euphemistically named “repatriation centers,” Tijuana is the single most common destination.
A sign points to the pedestrian San Ysidro border crossing from the U.S. into Tijuana, Mexico.
For those that can cross, other privileges help determine their time in transit. U.S. and Mexican citizens and permanent residents can pay $155 to apply for the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) program, a pre-approved accelerated crossing pass for low-risk travelers specific to the U.S.-Mexico border that cuts transit time significantly via dedicated vehicle and pedestrian lanes. Non-SENTRI-holders that have electronic Radio Frequency Identification chips in their documents, meanwhile, can take advantage of “Ready Lane,” which scans their identification from ten to fifteen feet away — sort of like an EZ-Pass for your travel documents.
But even for American citizens, SENTRI holders, and Ready Lane-eligible travelers, the wait can still be long and unpredictable.
Caitlin Trimble, an American citizen whose family moved from Los Angeles to Tijuana when they were ten, used to cross daily to attend college in San Diego. Them days would start at 4 a.m. so that they could be in San Ysidro by 5:15.
“For every 15 minutes that you arrived late, the borderline was exponentially worse by a factor of three or four. You eat breakfast while standing in line because you can't afford to sit at a table for 10 minutes,” they told me. “I would take two buses, the trolley, and walk two or three miles in between to get to school …[and] repeat that all in the opposite direction at the end of the day.”
Caitlin Trimble, an American citizen whose family moved from Los Angeles to Tijuana when they were 10 years old, used to cross the border daily to attend college in San Diego. Them days would start at 4 a.m. so that they could be at San Ysidro by 5:15. These days, they work from home three days a week as a paralegal for a San Diego law firm and travels to the office the other days after rush hour.
When it came time for Trimble to find a job after they graduated, they knew that they wanted to stay in Tijuana — though they didn't want to continue their grueling commute — so they looked for remote work opportunities. These days, they work from home three days a week as a paralegal for a San Diego law firm, traveling into the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays after the rush hour ends.
Ale Uzarraga, a Mexican-American photographer who commutes daily to their job in Chula Vista, California, still feels nervous at the border checkpoints, despite their dual citizenship and SENTRI pass. They typically move quickly, but even so, they always budget an hour at the crossing, just in case, using the time to put on makeup before work, one of their many so-called border-hacks. Explaining the concept, they say, “The border is not going anywhere. How can I make it work for me?”
Consuelo Ramos Quiñones, a Mexican lawyer who raised a transborder family between Chula Vista and Tijuana, commutes daily from Southern California, where they live, to their family's business in downtown Tijuana. For her, it's the afternoon rush out of Mexico, rather than the morning commute, that is their biggest pain point.
Southbound traffic, from the U.S. into Mexico, is often let through without stopping, but day's end on the northbound side is another story, when daily commuters are joined by day-trippers, medical tourists, and other casual visitors returning to the U.S. before dark.
Thousands of commuters and travelers cross over the San Ysidro border crossing every day, making it the busiest border crossing in the world. On the Tijuana side, the line to cross starts as early as 3 a.m.
“There are times when there are 300 to 400 vehicles,” Ramos Quiñones says. They call the 700-7000 hotline to check on the wait time (local radio stations and Facebook groups also provide regular updates). When the line is too long, they detour through Otay Mesa, the next crossing point six miles to the east.
But many commuters, who have no choice but to cross at the busiest times of the day and night — between 3 and 6 a.m. and 4 and 7 p.m. — don't bother to check. For them, spending pre-dawn and sunset hours at San Ysidro are part of the daily routine.
There are an estimated 350 million annual legal crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border, with San Ysidro as the busiest, with an average of 120,000 commuter vehicles, 6,000 trucks, and 63,000 pedestrians crossing daily.
A 2007 joint study by the San Diego Association of Governments and California Department of Transportation found that inefficiencies at entry points like San Ysidro cost $7.2 billion in lost economic output and 62,000 jobs on both sides of the “CaliBaja Binational Mega-Region,” as civic and business leaders have taken to calling the transborder metropolitan area.
The region is the most productive — and populous — along the U.S.-Mexico border, with 6.8 million people residing in CaliBaja, which encompasses San Diego and Imperial Counties and the state of Baja California, and a combined economic output of $220 billion. In comparison, the entire border, from east to west, has a population of 12 million.
Alexandra Uzarraga is a Tijuana-based photographer and teaching artist in San Diego. They cross the border everyday for work.  They are an American citizen of Mexican descent and sees themselves as having a dual identity.
According to the 2007 study, an extra 15 minutes of border wait time would result in an additional loss of $1 billion in productivity and 134,000 jobs every year. Notably, for “America-first” advocates, the cost is greater for the U.S., with $2 to $2.5 billion lost in San Diego, compared to $100 to 230 million in Tijuana.
This is something that a range of organizations, like the CaliBaja Mega-Region Initiative and the Smart Border Coalition, are looking to change. As several of the coalition's leaders wrote in an op-ed in the San Diego Union Tribune earlier this year:
From a purely commercial perspective, our borders are America's cash registers. All exports and imports must pass through them. No place else in the U.S., however, could make their customers wait in line every day for two hours and stay in business.
For Joaquin Harris, the decision to live Tijuana and work in California was a no-brainer: the U.S. offered a high-paying, stable job, while Mexico gave them an affordable and high quality of life.
Shipyard workers in San Diego, like Harris, earn between $17 and $26 per hour, according to Glassdoor. In comparison, a job in Tijuana's maquiladora manufacturing industry, the city's largest, pays between $2.85 to $4.60 per hour, according to the Tijuana Economic Development Corporation.
That's not bad when considering Mexico's countrywide minimum wage of 80 pesos per day (roughly $4.50), and median monthly salary of 13,239 pesos ($750), but it is low when compared to the U.S. — and California, in particular, where the $10.50 per hour minimum wage exceeds the federally mandated $7.25 per hour.

Trimble, the paralegal, also works north of the border for the higher pay. They would consider working in Tijuana, “if the price were right,” but by their own estimate, they make three times the salary in San Diego than they would in Tijuana.
Not all commuters are northbound. Dr. Ariel Ortiz, a Mexican bariatric surgeon, drives south from their home in Coronado to the Obesity Control Center, a private weight-loss hospital that they run, just a mile from San Ysidro on the Mexican side.
Their clinic is part of Tijuana's thriving medical tourism industry, which brings in an estimated one million patients a year for everything from basic check-ups and cancer treatments to cosmetic surgery. Their clinic performs six to seven surgeries a day and has a three-month waiting list, with procedures starting at $6,500 (compared to more than $20,000 in the U.S.)
In Mexico, they don't have to deal with convoluted American health insurance or a restrictive and “overburdening” Food and Drug Administration. Instead, Ortiz can pioneer — safely, they say, due to peer review — their weight-loss procedures up to four years before they are available in the U.S.
Ortiz is not alone, as U.S.-based entrepreneurs and investors are increasingly turning their interest, and capital, southwards. Michael Lenny and Daniel Altenburg, co-founders of ZipDev, a web and app development start-up, drive to Tijuana twice a week to work with their mostly Tijuana-based development team.

They take pride in being a binational company, which means more affordable technology for clients, mostly American small- and medium-size businesses, and access to a large pool of talented, English-speaking developers for them, all within the same time zone.
Meanwhile, for Ramos Quiñones, the lawyer in Chula Vista, Tijuana's worsening violence is one reason that their permanent home is north of the border: “I do not feel very secure… but I can't leave Tijuana because of my business.”
 They are not alone in their concern; a public opinion poll conducted this year by the Metropolitan Center of Economic and Business Information found that 92 percent of Tijuanenses feel insecure in the city.
Pamela Pena, 25, with their niece Vistoria Cronel, 5. Pamela crosses the border at least once a week to study dentistry. They were born in San Diego but lives in Tijuana.
The numbers paint a grim picture. Drug-related violence in Tijuana, which peaked in 2009 and 2010, with 1,118 and 1,256 murders respectively, had gone down in recent years, but the numbers have been climbing since 2016, reflecting an increase in drug-related violence throughout Mexico. By early August of this year, Tijuana had seen some 950 murders, putting 2017 on track to be the city's deadliest year on record.
And yet, there is far more to Tijuana than the drug wars. Ramos Quiñones, despite living on the other side, says that the uniqueness of life in CaliBaja is “not only because of the border — if you go to Juarez it's very different— but because it is the most important border [area] of Mexico.”
Ale Uzarraga echoes this sentiment. “I miss the area when I travel. I miss that I can be in two countries at once.”
As the new section of Trump's border wall begins construction this winter (assuming no further delays), CaliBaja's transborder residents will continue their daily commutes.
A border crosser runs through the traffic to catch up with the car they are traveling in after getting out to buy something on the side of the road.
“At first, there was a psychosis of fear,” says Ramos Quiñones of the early days of Trump's presidency, “That they wouldn't let you pass, that they'd take your documents. But now, we see that they ([Trump])'s busy with their own problems.”
After all, the ever-evolving region has undergone numerous other challenges and changes over the years. Here, on the U.S.-Mexican border, they're accustomed to the wait.
It's long been a conservative truism that universities are enemy territory, stacked as they are with sandal wearing humanities professors and scientists whose research depends on empirical reality. But the ivory tower has probably never been as liberal as the right wants to believe: 51% of college graduates and 42% of “postgraduates” voted for Mitt Romney.
Even so, the academy's supposedly implacable hostility to conservatives has been a career boosting foil for rightists from William F. Buckley to David Horowitz. But writing in Buckley's National Review this weekend, Betsy Woodruff sees an emerging trend that could help level politics in the quad: Frat boys!
Advertisement:
Using “quantitative analysis” which sounds suspiciously like a liberal plot, University of Iowa researchers found, “that on average, fraternity and sorority members enter college with more conservative political views than their peers. And while their peers became more liberal over four years of college, Greeks remained more conservative.”
Can the right going to channel this mysterious underground movement? Even Woodruff seems dubious. But for the time being they seem happy to seek common ground where they can find it. Madison Wickham, a founder of the website TotalFratMove.com said:
Merchandise pitched to conservatives — such as shirts that say “Mitt's the Tits” and “Back to Back World War Champs” — sells briskly, suggesting that the Greek system contains a strong contingent of young people who lean unabashedly right. Like most members of their cohort, they tend to be socially liberal. But Wickham says Greeks are more likely to have an affinity for conservatism than most young voters. "It's become so generic and typical for college students to be liberal,” they say, that the definition of “cool” has almost reversed. “It's cool to be conservative because everybody's liberal.”
And 2002 Dartmouth grad Christopher Bowen tells them that the “expansion of petty bureaucracy brought out some of their brothers' libertarian ‘don't tread on me' impulses, as they call them.”
Hmmmm. Even Woodruff concedes what anyone who has ever been to a frat party already knows, that frat boy conservatism tilts more to the socially-liberal fiscally conservative variety. But at least true conservatives and frat boys can commiserate about bureaucrats and reporters:
Several students say a challenge for the Greek system is negative press from predominantly liberal campus newspapers. Christopher Warren, who graduated from the University of Georgia in 2012, said their fraternity consistently struggled with unfair coverage. “The real thing we faced, even more than the bureaucracy of the university, was the on-campus media,” they say. “It was something we were constantly combating, having negative stories surrounding our fraternity or other fraternities on campus being the highlight in the school newspaper.”
Woodruff sees hope in frat boys' interest in “professional degrees such as finance, law, medicine, and economics — instead of, say, women's studies” but their article lacks a basic understanding of collegiate economics. Universities' future health and prestige depends on donations from wealthy alumni. Schools have no interest in victimizing those privileged and practical Greeks who are the base of their future fundraising.
Today, for example, Johns Hopkins grad and Phi Kappa Psi brother Michael Bloomberg donated $350 million to their alma matter, pushing their total lifetime contributions to the school to $1.1 billion. The New York City mayor sounds a lot like one of those middle of the road socially liberal/fiscally conservative types. Is their donation going to make frat boys feel any less welcome on any campus?
If they weren't working for Donald Trump, one might almost feel sorry for their speechwriters. How they must labor over those mellifluous phrases urging tolerance and love – only to see their hard work undone the minute the boss gets their hands on an electronic device.
But the ones who deserve our sympathy are the American people, and the people of the world, who know that this president is mouthing pieties that they privately mock, who know they are being lied to, and who can't seem to make the pretense, the meanness and the hypocrisy stop.
The Guardian view on Trump and Afghanistan: unwinnable and unlosable | Editorial Read more
On Monday, Trump appeared before the nation to announce their plan to increase the American military presence in Afghanistan. Speaking in measured, sonorous cadences, reading from a teleprompter, Trump endeavored to sound “presidential”. They invoked a series of lofty abstractions (courage, patriotism, “mutual trust and selfless devotion”) and cited the need for national unity and brotherhood.
They exhorted us to “make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one”.
The next day, addressing a rally of fervent supporters in Phoenix, Arizona, they delivered one of the most blistering rants of their career. They defended their failure to condemn the violent white supremacists who demonstrated in Charlottesville, Virginia, attacked the press with fresh fury and threatened to shut down the government unless Congress agrees to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.
Their phrasing (punchy, aggressive, frequently inarticulate), their vocabulary (limited) and their tone (bombastic, unhinged) could scarcely have been less like what we heard Monday night. The former director of national intelligence James Clapper publicly stated that he'd found the emergence of “the real Trump” to be “scary and disturbing” and that the Phoenix speech cast doubt on the president's competence.
On Wednesday, in Reno, Nevada, veterans who attended the National Convention of the American Legion heard a speaker who more closely resembled the Trump of Monday night – Teleprompter Trump – inform them that “we are here to draw inspiration from you as we seek to renew the bonds of loyalty that bind us together as one people and one nation”.
By midweek, news commentators were asking: which is the real Donald Trump, the one reading a script from the teleprompter or the one speaking off the cuff – and from the heart?
Framed like that the answer seems obvious, and yet, in some sense, it's a specious question. Few of us have one “real” self that emerges on every occasion; the way we speak to our children is rarely the same as the way we speak to our friends.
Even so, we sense that Trump means the insults, the boasts, the attacks, the inflated claims about their popularity and achievements. When they read the words that someone else – someone who apparently thinks that we must “renew the bonds of loyalty” – has scripted, they seem like an ill-bred, unruly child, compelled by their parents to tell the neighbors that he's sorry they broke their window, to tell their classmate that they regret their bullying behavior, to repeat, with reluctance, the apology that their elders insist they offer.
It's interesting to read the drafts of the iconic speeches that world leaders have delivered, to track their efforts to be as clear and eloquent as possible. At the FDR Library in Hyde Park, New York, one can follow Franklin Delano Roosevelt's revision process as they sought the most inspiriting way to inform the American people that we were going to war, the most damning phrase (he would settle on “day of infamy”) to characterize the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Too many have died in Afghanistan already. Trump must not draw us back | Owen Jones Read more
More recently, American presidents less often write their own public talks, and only the most naive citizen assumes that every president is the sole author of every speech. The addresses crafted by committees – and read from teleprompters – are nothing new.
What is new is a president who, speaking informally or to their “base”, sounds nothing like the person who reads aloud the words that someone else has written. What is new is the effort required not to feel insulted, not to feel we are being taken for fools when we are asked to imagine that Trump believes what they say whenever they are persuaded to sound like the president of the United States.
We feel reasonably certain that the adults who convince a child to apologize for their reckless or damaging behavior will try to dissuade that child from doing further harm. But we have yet to identify the responsible adult who will gently and legally take the baseball bat, or the brick – or the nuclear option – away from the dangerous child in the White House.

The Guy Behind The Qwikster Twitter Account Realizes What They Have, Wants A Mountain Of Cash
Last night, Jason went to bed a normal man, with a normal Twitter account (albeit one with a weed-smoking Elmo as the avatar), and a few dozen followers.
This morning, Jason woke up to an inbox full of messages, thousands of new followers, and wants to sell their account for many thousands of dollars.
As we chronicled last night, Netflix made a rather fundamental mistake in launching their new spin-off brand, Qwikster: they didn't make sure they had the name locked down on all of the big social networks before making the announcement. As Jason's luck had it, they had long owned the @Qwikster handle. He's willing to part with it — they just wants to make sure he'll “be making bank” first.
After over a month of silence, Jason's @Qwikster account sprang back to life just a few hours ago and, likely to Netflix's horror, has been more active today than it ever was before. Jason keeps touching on the idea of selling the account between poetic bursts like “I'm about to go play soccer n I got stug by a fucken bee” and “I just got scared I went into the shower turned on the water n then stuff started falling I was lik omg wtf lol”:
Jason seems to have rallied the, erm, expert counsel of their friend Gabriel (@SoccerIsLifegc7) who says they're “not talkin til the offers get in 6 figures”.
Someone should probably tell Jason that selling Twitter handles is strictly against Twitter's Terms Of Service, and attempts to do so can quickly result in the banhammer being dropped. Then Qwikster gets their name, free of charge.
Overview
Lariam (also known as mefloquine) has a high-risk profile and a minority of users experience severe side-effects. These side-effects are clearly highlighted by Roche, the manufacturer of Lariam, who rightly lay down stringent conditions which must be met if it is to be prescribed safely. But there is very strong anecdotal evidence that such conditions have often been disregarded in dispensing it to large numbers of troops about to be deployed.
Danger of side effects
The danger of severe side-effects from using Lariam has been highlighted by both Roche and other witnesses to the Inquiry. The evidence received has emphasised the specific risks that such side-effects can place on military personnel when deployed and the belief that the military environment has the potential to exacerbate those side-effects. While most users will not experience the most adverse reactions, the Committee does not believe Lariam, with its significant risk profile, is compatible with the duties required of military personnel on operations.
Strong anecdotal evidence suggests that a body of current and former Service personnel have been adversely affected by the use of Lariam. The MoD acknowledges its duty of care to support them, but the current arrangements for doing so appear to be inadequate.
Recommendations
The Committee concludes that any future prescribing of Lariam to Service personnel must be restricted:
Only to those who are unable to tolerate any of the available alternatives
Only after a face-to-face Individual Risk Assessment has been conducted
Only after the patient has been made aware of the alternatives and has been given the choice between Lariam and another suitable anti-malarial drug.
The report recommends that the MoD should establish a single point of contact for all current and former Service personnel who have concerns about their experience of Lariam. This point of contact should be publicised widely though the Chain of Command, veterans organisations, the MoD website, and armed forces magazines and publications. Discussions should also be held with the Department of Heath on possible ways of advising GPs of potential risks to veterans who may previously have been prescribed Lariam.
Chair's comment
Chairman of the Committee, Dr Julian Lewis MP, said
"It seems quite clear that not only is the MoD unable to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for prescribing the drug in all instances, but a number of troops discard their Lariam rather than risk its potentially dangerous side-effects. It is our firm conclusion that there is neither the need, nor any justification for continuing to issue this medication to Service personnel unless they can be individually assessed, in accordance with the manufacturers' requirements. And–most of the time–that is simply impossible, when a sudden, mass deployment of hundreds of troops is necessary."

When we first announced Neverwinter: Elemental Evil in January, our team was excited to introduce the community to our biggest expansion launch for Neverwinter to-date. With our efforts to revamp nearly all of our in-game systems, including the introduction of the level cap increase and the new Oathbound Paladin class, our plan was more ambitious than we had anticipated.
Our Neverwinter team wants to ensure that we deliver our promise of a high quality expansion, and in order to do so, we need a few more weeks to fine tune the Neverwinter: Elemental Evil experience. Consequently, we have made the decision to delay the launch of Neverwinter: Elemental Evil to April 7.
We appreciate your patience as we take this extra time to make sure the Neverwinter: Elemental Evil experience lives up to not only our expectations but yours as well. Our team is extremely excited for players to experience the new story, zones, critter groups and additional new changes coming to our game in April. Stay tuned to our blog and social channels as we continue to share additional details for Neverwinter: Elemental Evil.

​Concept drawing of Titan's surface. Image: NASA
​When it comes to tracking down extraterrestrial life, most scientists operate under the assumption is that aliens are likely water-dependent. After all, water played a central role in nurturing Earth's rippling biodiversity, so it's natural to regard this magic ingredient as crucial for kickstarting lifeforms on other worlds.
But perhaps this emphasis on water casts too small a net, excluding unhydrated worlds with promising properties. That's the view taken by an interdisciplinary team of researchers based out of Cornell. In a study published on Friday in the journal Science Advances, the team get creative with biology by designing a hypothetical cell capable of surviving in a waterless environment.
"The lipid bilayer membrane, which is the foundation of life on Earth, is not viable outside of biology based on liquid water," the authors write in the study. "This fact has caused astronomers who seek conditions suitable for life to search for exoplanets within the 'habitable zone,' the narrow band in which liquid water can exist."
"However, can cell membranes be created and function at temperatures far below those at which water is a liquid?" they asked.
To ground this question in the physical universe, the Cornell team focused on simulating a cell that could survive on Saturn's fascinating moon Titan—the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, and the only world outside Earth that supports liquid on its surface.
With surface temperatures of about -290 degrees Fahrenheit, Titan supports water only as ice. The moon's rivers, lakes, and seas instead flow as liquid methane, and its bedrock and atmosphere are bursting with hydrocarbons, which are important building blocks for life on Earth.
Generally speaking, life on Titan hasn't been regarded as much of a slam dunk as life on worlds like Europa, which is thought to contain more liquid water than Earth. But its hyperproductivity of complex organic molecules makes it a compelling candidate nonetheless, and a perfect testing ground for imagining water-independent organisms.
The Cornell team was led by molecular dynamics specialist Paulette Clancy, and co-authored by chemical engineer James Stevenson and Jonathan Lunine, an expert on the Saturnian moon system. From these diverse perspectives, they conceived of a cell which they dubbed an "azotosome," derived from the French word "azote" meaning "nitrogen."
A model of the azotosome. Image: James Stevenson.
This hypothetical lifeform would be comprised of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen, and would have the same flexibility and durability at cryogenic temperatures as our familiar hydro-operated cell membranes do at room temperatures.
The team modelled several different molecular scenarios looking for the ideal combination for the environment, and discovered that a toxic compound known as acrylonitrile—used in the manufacture of acrylic plastics and fibers—would be especially conducive to life on Titan. Clancy and Stevenson, a pair of chemists who normally work on semiconductors, were particularly taken aback by the hardiness of the simulated cell.
"We're not biologists, and we're not astronomers, but we had the right tools," Clancy said in a Cornell statement. "Perhaps it helped, because we didn't come in with any preconceptions about what should be in a membrane and what shouldn't. We just worked with the compounds that we knew were there and asked, 'If this was your palette, what can you make out of that?'"
The notion of producing a speculative design of a lifeform for an environment is a wonderful reversal of the evolutionary reality, in which environments sculpt life. It's also a welcome departure from the mindset that extraterrestrial beings are most likely to develop in Earthlike conditions. There's nothing at all wrong with that approach; in fact, it makes loads of sense. But as the new study demonstrates, it's a lot of fun to untether ourselves from our planetary prejudices, and think outside the astrobiological box.
Perhaps Stevenson, who was inspired by Isaac Asimov's essay "Not as We Know It" put it best: "Ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it."
Whether or not such beings actually do exist on Titan is a question for future studies. But to know that life is, at least, conceivable in such an alien environment expands the aperture of the search for otherworldly beings.
The NHL has released its schedule and with it, the new division realignment for the 2013-2014 season. While the Detroit Red Wings will be departing the West and the Central Division for the “greener” pastures of less travel of the East, the new Central Division has added three new teams; the Winnipeg Jets, Dallas Stars, and the Colorado Avalanche. In this 3-part series, we'll take a look at the new teams who were added and why it won't take long to start hating them.
History Lesson: Jets/Thrashers and Predators
Predators All-Time Record vs. Winnipeg Jets/Atlanta Thrashers:
Wins: 9 Losses: 4 Ties: 1 OT Losses: 1 SO Losses: 1 Points: 21 Goals For: 51 Goals Against: 43
While looking at these numbers, most Predators fans won't exactly be shaking in their boots. Dating back to the early-days of the Thrashers, the two teams have only met 17 times total. In those match-ups, the Predators have typically been the team that has been on the better end of the standings in their conference, while the Thrashers/Jets haven't had nearly the success the Predators have had at making the playoffs.
While the Predators have only played 1 game against the reborn Winnipeg Jets, a 3-1 Predators win in Nashville, the history between the two teams has been rather uninteresting, filled with lots of games that were either low-scoring or blowouts. Even though the Predators hold a winning record in the all-time series, the most intriguing part is that even with 5 more regulation wins, the Predators have only scored 8 more goals against the Jets/Thrashers in those games.
Why You'll Hate Them
When the 2013-14 season finally rolls around, there will be two good reasons that Predators fans will quickly understand for hating the Winnipeg Jets; Winnipeg can be a hostile environment for opposing teams and this is not your older brother's Atlanta Thrashers.
One does not need to look far to see that the fans in Winnipeg have come out in force to support their reborn team. The MTS Centre has staked out its spot as an intimidating arena to play in for opposing teams, as the rowdy Jets fans loved to loudly taunt the opposing players.
Whether you're one of the top players in the league:
Or an Olympic Medal-winning goaltender:
Or even the coach:
No one is safe from the harassment of the raucous bunch in Winnipeg.
With an up-and-coming roster, the Winnipeg Jets are not the same team who sat for years as bottom-feeders in the Eastern Conference. While they may not be a perennial playoff-contender yet, they are quietly building an impressive stockpile of tough, but skillful players. It won't take very long next season for Predators fans to grow wary of constantly seeing players like Evander Kane, Blake Wheeler, Mark Scheifele, Dustin Byfuglien, Tobias Enstrom, and Jacob Trouba being a thorn in the side of the Predators.
The Winnipeg Jets, while struggling to gain much of a foothold in the weakest division in the league over the past few seasons, will be looking to make their mark out West, while the Predators didn't have a great season last year. These two teams look like they'll be ready to collide for what could end up being some surprisingly gritty and testy contests next year.

In “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” the young protagonist gripes about their adoptive mother's efforts to “sivilize” them — particularly at the dinner table, where they observe that each dish is cooked and served separately.
“In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;” Finn says. “Things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.”
I thought about that line while reading Robert Putnam's “Our Kids,” a jarring study of the growing opportunity gap between rich and poor children. America would like to think of itself as Huck's “barrel of odds and ends,” a kind of democratic stew. But, as Putnam shows, our society is increasingly more like their adopted mother's meal, with each dish cooked separately and cordoned off into different compartments on the dinner plate.
The young and poor in America ‘are completely clueless about the kinds of skills and savvy and connections needed to get ahead.' Robert Putnam
Don't miss: Rich kids use the Internet to get ahead, and poor kids use it ‘mindlessly'
The upper-middle-class families Putnam profiles separate themselves into affluent suburbs, with separate public schools and social spheres from those of their poorer counterparts. As a result, the poorer children not only face greater hardships, but they also lack good models of what is possible. They are effectively cut off from opportunity.
“The most important thing about the experience of being young and poor in America is that these kids are really isolated, and really don't have close ties with anybody,” Putnam told MarketWatch. “They are completely clueless about the kinds of skills and savvy and connections needed to get ahead.”
Their analysis shows how family structure, parenting practices, schooling and health habits correlate with diminishing opportunities for poorer children.
For instance:
Children of poorer, less educated parents are far more likely to grow up in single-parent homes.
Putnam/Our Kids/S&S
Educated, wealthier parents are able to devote considerably more time to childcare.
Putnam/Our Kids/S&S
Due to lack of support networks and good models, perhaps, the highest-scoring poor children are less likely to graduate college than the lowest-scoring wealthy children.
Putnam/Our Kids/S&S
Childhood obesity has been all but eliminated among wealthier children but continues to increase in poorer families.
Putnam/Our Kids/S&S
Putnam does not fault the wealthier parents for seeking the best for their children. “Perhaps unexpectedly, this is a book without upper-class villains,” they note.
But they make the case that it's not only in the moral interest of wealthier families to help improve the prospects of poorer children but also in their own economic interest. The U.S. economy would get a major boost if the opportunity gap were closed, they say. We cannot continue to live in our own bubbles, or compartments on a plate, without consequences, they suggest.
“What I hope people take away is that helping poor kids, giving them more skills and more support would economically benefit their kids,” Putnam said.
Perhaps, as Huckleberry Finn suggested at the dinner table, when we mix things up, and break down our physical and cultural class divisions, ”things go better.”

Saturday Night Live writer Katie Rich has been suspended indefinitely after they tweeted a widely criticized joke about Barron Trump, a person familiar with the situation tells The Hollywood Reporter.
NBC had no comment.
On Friday, Rich tweeted that “Barron will be this country's first home-school shooter,” which led to public outcry and some calling for the dismissal of the SNL writer. Rich later deleted the tweet, and deactivated their account. On Monday, they reactivated their account and issued an apology.
I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry. — Katie Rich (@katiemaryrich) January 23, 2017
A Second City alum, Rich has been with the show since 2013, writing primarily for "Weekend Update."
The controversial tweet comes as SNL has been under additional scrutiny from none other than President Donald Trump himself, who has become known to tweet their own reviews of the late-night show hours after it airs.
SNL announced earlier Monday that Alec Baldwin, who has been playing the now-president all season long, will host the Feb. 11. episode.
Barron Trump, 10, is the only son of Trump with their wife Melania. The president has four other adult children: sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as daughters Ivanka and Tiffany Trump.
The White House Press Office released a statement on Tuesday following reports of Rich's tweet and subsequent suspension.
"It is a longstanding tradition that the children of Presidents are afforded the opportunity to grow up outside of the political spotlight. The White House fully expects this tradition to continue. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter."
Rich's tweet isn't the first time SNL has come under fire for poking fun at the president's offspring. In 1992, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's Wayne's World characters mocked then-12-year-old first daughter Chelsea Clinton, saying "adolescence has been thus far unkind" to her, but "she could turn into a babe in waiting." Then-first lady Hillary Clinton was critical of the sketch, which was subsequently cut out of all repeats of the episode. "We felt, upon reflection, that if it was in any way hurtful, it wasn't worth it," executive producer Lorne Michaels said at the time. "She's a kid, a kid who didn't choose to be in public life."
Chelsea Clinton came to the defense of Barron Trump in a tweet posted Sunday.
Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does-to be a kid. Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2017

The first release candidate of the Ubuntu 14.04 based ‘Deepin' Linux distribution has been made available to download.
Deepin 2014 RC features a number of improvements over the alpha and beta releases issued last month, including a reduction in boot time memory usage, an improved desktop theme, and refinements to the QML ‘control centre' modules for accessing system settings.
The application launcher, written in HTML5 and Go, also now allows applications to be uninstalled by dragging an app launcher item onto the Trash icon. A new user guide has also been included to help those unfamiliar with the distro get the most from it.
Deepin is developed in China by a team of more than 30 developers and designers. Alongside developing the OS and its custom desktop environment, Deepin also maintain a number of custom, native Linux applications, including the Deepin Software Center, a games hub, movie and audio player apps, and a simple USB installer.
You can see a video demo of the beta build in the video player below.
Download Deepin 2014 RC
Deepin 2014 RC is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit computers and has the following minimum system requirements:
Intel Pentium IV @ 2GHz or better
2GB RAM
15GB HDD
Deepin developers advise testers against trying the release in a virtual machine. This, they say, is “because Compiz is used as the window manager in Deepin 2014 and its performance is poor in a virtual machine”. A new window manager to replace Compiz is planned.

In their defense, the odds that an avowed socialist writing in the early 1970s might have been high when formulating their opinions have to be north of 90 percent.
According to various psychological surveys conducted over the past 40 years, somewhere between 31 and 57 percent of women confess to having rape fantasies, with the true number doubtless higher given the reluctance of some to admit that they've had thoughts like that. A survey published last year claimed that 29 percent of women had fantasized about being forced to have sex while 60 percent of men had fantasized about “dominating” someone sexually. Should any of that stop us from wringing every drop of political pain for Democrats from this?
No. No, it should not.
“A man goes home and masturbates their typical fantasy,” wrote Sanders. “A woman on their knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused.” Sanders didn't specify as to how they had gained such a deep understanding of the male psyche. In terms of their understanding of female sexual fantasies, Sanders provided similar insight. “A woman enjoys intercourse with their man–as they fantasize about being raped by 3 men simultaneously.”
Charles Cooke acknowledges that if any Republican in the race had written something like that, however long ago, not only would they be hounded by the media over it but so would every other Republican in the race and even prominent Republicans not in the race, purely for the war-on-women squirm factor involved. It would be a days-long lefty “rape culture” media jamboree. And yet, says Cooke, we should take the high road:
Bernie Sanders wrote these words in 1972. Maybe they were young and foolish. Maybe they were a different man back then? Maybe society was unrecognizable and they had bought into all sorts of faddish psychology. Who knows? And frankly, who cares? Sure, the Democratic party would crucify a Republican for the same offense. But they shouldn't. A society in which people are drummed out of politics for words they wrote 43 years ago is an ugly society indeed. Sometimes the best way to address hypocrisy is to take the high road. This is America: land of second chances. This is a place of redemption and of reinvention and of continual learning. Nobody honestly believes that Bernie Sanders is a sexual pervert or that they are a misogynist or that they intend to do women any harm. Nobody suspects that they harbor a secret desire to pass intrusive legislation or to cut gang rapists a break. Really, there is only one reason that anyone would make hay of this story, and that is to damage the man politically. Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. Perhaps I'm hopelessly idealistic. But until I see any sign of actual wrongdoing I'd much prefer to slam Sanders for their dangerous and ridiculous politics than to delve back into their past and embarrass them with a long-forgotten opinion. I certainly hope that my fellow conservatives will feel the same way, even if they do not enjoy the same courtesy from their adversaries.
But it won't damage them politically. That's the Democratic advantage. This is a fart in the wind, something they might be asked about once in a check-the-box way by a reporter who'll be only too happy to treat it as some sort of curio of youthful dunderheadedness. He's positioned themselves as the most ostentatiously left-wing member of the Senate; he's running, kinda sorta, as a left-wing alternative to Hillary Clinton. Short of child porn turning up on their computer, there's virtually nothing they could say or do sexually that the left won't dismiss as irrelevant. In fact, follow the first link up top and you'll see that their deep thoughts on rape were part of a piece about women being conditioned to crave subservience and degradation because of their traditional dependence on men. Why, Bernie's a gender warrior! Even so, why not make them and Hillary squirm by forcing them to comment? The only way you'll convince liberals to take Cooke's sober approach to decades-old thoughtcrimes is to make them taste the injustice of it, even for a day instead of the two-week fiesta that would greet some analogous Republican comment. It's the same impulse as demanding that Hillary be asked when they think life begins or how many genders they believe there are. It's not that the election will turn on their answers, it's that forcing the left and their friends in the media to experience the discomfort of a gotcha may lead them to be more circumspect in using that strategy against the right.
Anyway. Via Reason, here's Remy paying tribute to another, even deeper deep thought from Senator Socialist.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that “we can make a fast decision” on a new FBI director, possibly by late next week, before they leaf on their first foreign trip since taking office.
“Even that is possible,” Trump told reporters when asked whether they could announce their nominee by Friday, when they are scheduled to leave for the Mideast and Europe.
Eight candidates to be the bureau's director were in line Saturday for the first interviews with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and their deputy, Rod Rosenstein, at Justice Department headquarters. They are among more than a dozen candidates Trump is considering, a group that includes several lawmakers, attorneys and law enforcement officials.
“I think the process is going to go quickly. Almost all of them are very well-known,” Trump said aboard the plane that took them to Lynchburg, Virginia, where they gave the commencement address at Liberty University. “They've been vetted over their lifetime essentially, but very well-known, highly respected, really talented people. And that's what we want for the FBI.”
The Trump administration is looking to fill the job, which requires Senate confirmation, after Trump abruptly fired Director James Comey on Tuesday.
The first candidate to arrive was Alice Fisher, a high-ranking Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration.
Among those interviewed was Adam Lee, special agent in charge of the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, office. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also interviewed for the permanent post despite their repeated willingness to break from White House explanations of Comey's ouster and its characterizations of the Russia investigation.
Also interviewed Saturday were Michael J. Garcia, a former prosecutor and associate judge on New York's highest court; GOP Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate leader and a former Texas attorney general; and U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson, a George W. Bush appointee who struck down the centerpiece of the Obama administration's health care law in 2010.
Frances Townsend, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President George W. Bush, and former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers also met with Justice officials.
Rogers came endorsed by the FBI Agents Association, which said their diverse background makes them the best choice for the job.  They are the former chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee who also worked as an FBI special agent based in Chicago in the 1990s.
Fisher and Townsend were the only women on the list of candidates. The FBI has never had a female director. Each has worked in high-profile positions in the Justice Department.
Fisher formerly served as assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Criminal Division. They faced resistance from Democrats during their confirmation over their alleged participation in discussions about detention policies at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba.
Among other roles, Townsend led the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, which at the time handled requests for government surveillance warrants in terrorism and espionage cases.
Sessions has faced questions over whether their involvement in Comey's firing violates their pledge to recuse themselves from investigations into Russian interference in the election. Some lawmakers have alleged the firing was an effort to stifle that FBI probe.
Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said Sessions and Rosenstein are involved in the interviews because the FBI director reports to them as attorney general and deputy attorney general. They can make recommendations, but the president will ultimately make the hiring decision.

Superville reported from Lynchburg, Virginia.
A Nova Scotia woman says she's shocked they were turned down in their request for a personalized licence plate because of its religious message.
Rhonda Lynn Cormier-Clarke wanted to use the acronym 'IXOYE', which means, in Greek, Jesus Christ Son of God and Saviour. They were surprised by the reaction they received from a woman at the Service Nova Scotia counter.
"She said 'oh you won't be able to have that, I can guarantee it's banned,'" said Cormier-Clarke. "And they said, yes red flagged, anything that has a religious connotation is banned."
Cormier-Clarke said their choice of plate wasn't meant to be disrespectful.
"I'm just sharing my heart, my beliefs. I actually thought, you know, IXOYE, it's quiet, but it's my truth. It's not putting it right out there."
The incident has left them questioning why the government would ban something that they say doesn't mean any harm.
"Is there religious freedom? That's the question," said Cormier-Clarke. "It's like they're putting their focus on the wrong area. It's a licence plate. I'm not saying anything mean."
Separation of church and state
The Minister responsible for Service Nova Scotia – the department that issues licence plates – doesn't know what Ixoye means.
"The personalized licence plates, I think to my knowledge, are anything except politics and religion," said John MacDonell.
"A long time ago, people determined that church and state should be separated. I think this is kind of a further commitment to that. I'm not sure it's entirely appropriate at all for the government to be involved in the message."
They say plates with the words Amen, Allah or even OMG might offend people. IXOYE falls into the same category.
"There's somebody out there who is going to recognize that and somebody else who might recognize it," said MacDonell. "Someone might think it's great and some will not. So for our citizenry who pay taxes, they may have a problem with that."
MacDonell said he's not sure if a list of red flagged licence plates even exists. Cormier-Clarke said the government needs to be clear about the rules and post that information online.
In the meantime, MacDonell offered a solution. They pointed out there's no rule that bans anyone from putting religious phrases on novelty plates on the front of their car.
Nova Scotia isn't the only province to restrict licence plates based on religion. Employees in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and P.E.I. told CBC News they also have rules for personalized plates.
Accusations that Pentagon retaliated against a whistleblower undermine argument that there were options for Snowden other than leaking to the media
Edward Snowden has called for a complete overhaul of US whistleblower protections after a new source from deep inside the Pentagon came forward with a startling account of how the system became a “trap” for those seeking to expose wrongdoing.
The account of John Crane, a former senior Pentagon investigator, appears to undermine Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other major establishment figures who argue that there were established routes for Snowden other than leaking to the media.
Crane, a longtime assistant inspector general at the Pentagon, has accused their old office of retaliating against a major surveillance whistleblower, Thomas Drake, in an episode that helps explain Snowden's 2013 National Security Agency disclosures. Not only did Pentagon officials provide Drake's name to criminal investigators, Crane told the Guardian, they destroyed documents relevant to their defence.
Snowden, responding to Crane's revelations, said they had tried to raise their concerns with colleagues, supervisors and lawyers and been told by all of them: “You're playing with fire.”

They told the Guardian: “We need iron-clad, enforceable protections for whistleblowers, and we need a public record of success stories. Protect the people who go to members of Congress with oversight roles, and if their efforts lead to a positive change in policy – recognize them for their efforts. There are no incentives for people to stand up against an agency on the wrong side of the law today, and that's got to change.”
Snowden continued: “The sad reality of today's policies is that going to the inspector general with evidence of truly serious wrongdoing is often a mistake. Going to the press involves serious risks, but at least you've got a chance.”
Financially ruined
Thomas Drake's legal ordeal ruined them financially and ended in 2011 with all serious accusations against them dropped. Their case served as a prologue to Snowden's. Now Crane's account has led to a new investigation at the US justice department into whistleblower retaliation at the Pentagon that may serve as an epilogue – one Crane hopes will make the Pentagon a safe place for insiders to expose wrongdoing and illegality.
“If we have situations where we have whistleblowers investigated because they're whistleblowers to the inspector general's office, that will simply shut down the whole whistleblower system,” Crane told the Guardian.
Crane, who has not previously given interviews, has told their explosive story in a new book, Bravehearts: Whistle Blowing In The Age of Snowden by Mark Hertsgaard, from which the Guardian is running extracts. The Guardian has partnered with Der Spiegel and Newsweek Japan on Crane's story.

“When someone becomes a whistleblower, they're making a serious, conscious decision,” Crane said.
“They're making a decision that can change their lives, change their futures, impact family life, too. There needs to be this certain unbreakable trust. Confidentiality is that trust and that can't ever be violated.”
Snowden cited Drake's case as a reason for their lack of faith in the government's official whistleblower channels.
“When I was at NSA, everybody knew that for anything more serious than workplace harassment, going through the official process was a career-ender at best. It's part of the culture,” Snowden told the Guardian.
“If your boss in the mailroom lies on their timesheets, the IG might look into it. But if you're Thomas Drake, and you find out the president of the United States ordered the warrantless wiretapping of everyone in the country, what's the IG going to do? They're going to flush it, and you with it.”
While Drake's case is well known in US national security circles, its internal history is not.
Major source
In 2002, Drake and NSA colleagues contacted the Pentagon inspector general to blow the whistle on an expensive and poorly performing tool, Trailblazer, for mass-data analysis. Crane, head of the office's whistleblower unit, assigned investigators. For over two years, with Drake as a major source, they acquired thousands of pages of documents, classified and unclassified, and prepared a lengthy secret report in December 2004 criticizing Trailblazer, eventually helping to kill the program. As far as Crane was concerned, the whistleblower system was working.
But after an aspect of the NSA's warrantless mass surveillance leaked to the New York Times, Drake themselves came under investigation and eventually indictment. Drake was suspected of hoarding documentation – exactly what inspector-general investigators tell their whistleblowers to do.
“They made it clear to keep [documents] wherever possible, and obviously properly handle anything that was classified,” Drake remembered.
Crane feared that their own colleagues had told the FBI about Drake. They suspected the Pentagon inspector general's lead attorney, Henry Shelley, whom Crane said had earlier suggested working with the justice department about the leak, had done so. A confrontation yielded what Crane considered to be evasions.
“The top lawyer would not reveal to me whether or not Drake's confidentiality had been compromised or not. That was a concern … Normally I expect direct answers,” Crane said.
When Drake's attorneys sought potentially exculpatory information from the inspector general's office, they learned that much of it had been “destroyed before the defendant was charged, pursuant to a standard document destruction policy”, according to a 2011 letter from prosecutors.
Crane was livid. All relevant regulations mandated keeping the documents, not destroying them. But a high-ranking colleague, Lynne Halbrooks, prevented Crane from investigating the document destruction. They suspected Shelley and Halbrooks of sacrificing a whistleblower and misleading the justice department and a federal judge, all in a case centering around the cover-up of NSA bulk surveillance.
Forced out
Crane's relationship with their superiors spiraled downward until they forced them out in 2013, months before Snowden's revelations. The next year, they filed a complaint with a federal agency that works with whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel. In March this year, it found a “substantial likelihood” that the Pentagon inspector general's office improperly destroyed the Drake documents and arranged, with Pentagon consent, for the justice department inspector general to investigate.
Shelley, still the Pentagon inspector general's senior counsel, declined to answer questions but said they were “certain my name will be cleared” by the new investigation.
Halbrooks, the Office of Special Counsel and the justice department inspector general declined to comment for this story.
Bridget Serchak, a spokesperson for the Pentagon inspector general, noted that their office and the Office of Special Counsel jointly requested the justice department investigation.
“It is important to point out that there has been no determination on the allegations, and it is unfair to characterize the allegations otherwise at this point. DoD OIG will cooperate fully with the DoJ OIG's investigation of this matter and looks forward to the results of that investigation,” Serchak said.
Crane considers this latest inquiry a bellwether for whether the whistleblower system can reform itself in a post-Snowden era.
“Snowden responded to the way Drake was handled. The Office of Special Council investigation regarding destruction of possibly exculpatory documents regarding Drake might be the end of this saga,” Crane said.
It was just another sunny day at Woodbine Beach for Melissa Selvaggi and their friend, until a man with a camera concealed in their backpack began filming them. The man fled when Selvaggi confronted him, and dropped their camera, which contained a 30-minute recording consisting almost entirely of close-up recordings of several women's bikini-clad buttocks.
Melissa Selvaggi confronted a man they spotted filming women's derrieres on the beach, leading to a conviction for mischief. Wendell Craig Taylor was acquitted of voyeurism, however. ( ALYSHAH HASHAM / TORONTO STAR )
In an Aug. 13 ruling, Ontario Court Justice Richard Blouin found that the man, Wendell Craig Taylor, violated their victims' reasonable expectation of privacy in a public space and interfered with their lawful enjoyment of the beach. However, while Taylor, 35, was convicted of mischief, they were acquitted of voyeurism because the judge could not conclude the videos were taken for a sexual purpose. “I cannot completely discount the possibility that they made these recordings for an esthetic purpose,” Blouin wrote in the decision. “There are many artists (Robert Mapplethorpe, for example) that create nude images that are designed to be appreciated for reasons other than sexual gratification. In my view, consent to be photographed, present in those cases but not here, is not relevant to the purposes for which the photographs were taken or used.”

To Selvaggi, 25, the suggestion that the recordings, which they describe as “semi-pornographic,” were for anything but a sexual purpose is ridiculous. “You feel violated. I don't see how it's art or (something else). Like, no, they were videotaping your private areas, that's it, that's all,” Selvaggi said in an interview. “Just the nature alone of how they were capturing the video says a lot,” they added, noting that Taylor's camera was covered in a dark towel and black electrical tape so that just the lens was visible. “This to me was not innocent; it was intentional and it was deliberate.” Selvaggi's friend Ana Silva first encountered Taylor at Woodbine Beach in 2010 while they were there with their sister, and they asked them to leave their alone, according to the court decision. Two weeks later, they noticed the same man filming them and Selvaggi, and they called the police. It was after the third time Silva saw the man, in June 2013, that police arrested and charged him. Silva did not respond to a request for an interview.
Taylor, who has been previously convicted of mischief for a similar offence, did not respond to a request for comment through their lawyer, Stephen Whitzman. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for October. Whitzman says vagueness remains as to what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces, pointing to a court decision that allowed a man to openly take photographs at a nude beach.

Blouin found that in Taylor's case the line was clearly crossed because they were filming in secret and zooming in on the private areas of women. “In my view, it is entirely reasonable to expect that, while wearing a bathing suit on a public beach, you will be seen, maybe ogled and possibly find your way into a photograph,” Blouin said. “It is equally reasonable to expect that close-ups of your private areas will not be captured as a permanent record for the photographer and potentially millions of others online.” Lawyer Joanna Birenbaum says the judge's recognition of the breach of privacy is consistent with the purpose of the criminal offence of voyeurism, which was introduced 10 years ago. “Simply because we are in a public space, wearing a tank top, or a bathing suit, or a running bra and shorts, etc., doesn't mean we've given up all of our rights to privacy,” they said in an email. “The decision is disappointing that in this case, close-up photographs of women's buttocks, taken without their consent and without any surrounding circumstances that would suggest the purpose was artistic or innocent, could be interpreted by the Court as anything other than for a sexual purpose.” Selvaggi, who has provided a victim-impact statement for the sentencing hearing, said they would urge anyone who experiences something like this to report it to the police, even if it seems like a waste of time at first. “I was surprised and disturbed when I found that Ana and I were not the only ones making complaints about this same guy,” they said. “It all adds up. Keep pushing and putting in that information.”
Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' decision to review all major property development projects cleared during the last four to six months of the previous government has put the sector in a fix. Big projects will run into major cost overruns and the sector itself will be in a state of suspense for three or four months now according to realty experts.
Why are these development projects being reviewed?The BJP government is taking cognisance of the charge levelled by the former irrigation minister Ajit Pawar that Rs12,000 crore worth of projects were cleared in a hurry during the last months of their tenure by then chief minister Pritviraj Chavan without due diligence. Fadnavis wants to see if procedures were followed.
What did the previous government do?Though the actual value of projects cleared is unknown, a slew of major cluster development projects, most of it in Mumbai, were cleared during the last few months. Ajit Pawar was hinting at corruption when they made the allegation against their own chief minister.
What does Chavan have to say?Chavan told dna that the new government has every right to review any decision taken by their government. "I have no objections to them reviewing the decisions taken be me. I have not done anything wrong. If the cost of the projects increases by this move, then the incumbent government has to think over it," Chavan added.
What is a cluster development project?A developer with minimum of 4,000 sq meters of land can present plans for cluster development which will include all amenities. The government will then allot a Floor Space Index of 4 which means four times the land area can be build as towers or skyscrapers.
Why are developers upset?For developers who have raised debt to go ahead with projects already cleared this review will mean huge losses. Kailash Agarwal, chairperson of Avighna Developers which is doing a cluster project in South Mumbai says, "Cluster development policy will be most affected by the review decisions. There are a only couple of cluster developments projects which have been successfully executed since the inceptions of the scheme in 2009. The review will result in three months delay and escalate the cost many folds," Agarwal added. Other developers feel they will now have to pay bribes the second time for the same project.Sunil Mantri, president of National Real Estate Development Council said the new chief minister can review the previous government decisions but it should be done "speedily and with good intention". Atul Nemade, realty expert said this move will bring the already suffering real estate sector to a grinding halt.
The Croatian midfielder insisted that the striker has turned over a new leaf and challenged former Camp Nou star Zlatan Ibrahimovic to kick the club out of Europe
Ivan Rakitic has insisted that "polite" striker Luis Suarez will not bite anyone at Barcelona, despite their chequered history.
The Uruguayan is currently serving a four-month ban from competitive football after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup this summer, though the bizarre incident did not stop Barça from spending €88 million to bring them to Camp Nou from Liverpool.
Rakitic, another new arrival under Luis Enrique's regime, had only positive things to say about their Barça team-mate and said they are loving life in Catalunya alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Xavi.
"Suarez is very calm, polite and quiet," the Croatia international told reporters. "He's a great man and they said that any biting moments they have had in the past will never happen again.
"I came to Barcelona to enjoy my football, to work hard, to give my best, to help the team, to share the locker-room with some of the best players in the world.
"Every day I have smile on my face as I go to training and that is the most important thing."
Rakitic also lauded Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was on Barça's books for two years but spent their second season on loan at AC Milan due to a falling out with Pep Guardiola, and the Croatian has challenged the Swede to knock their former club out of Europe after the teams were paired together in the group stage.
"It is a tough Champions League group but our aim is to win trophies so we have to be ready. Ajax and APOEL are okay teams," the 26-year-old added.
"Ibrahimovic is maybe the best striker in the world - let them and PSG try to knock us out!"
A new study on climate change shows that California's current drought-like conditions could last another 50 years, and possibly for thousands of years, a result which in either case would have dramatic repercussions for agricultural production and food prices across North America.
The 21st century has brought with it a period of extended drought in the state of California, with 10 of the past 14 years registering as drier than normal and the last three years recorded as the hottest and driest since 1895. As a result, the state's agricultural output has decreased, affecting fruit and vegetable prices across the continent and leaving both producers and consumers wondering how long the downturn will last.
The news on that front may now be a little clearer -and more dismal- as an international team of scientists including researchers from Western University in London, Ontario, have released a new study of California's geological history which confirms that during past periods of drought, dry conditions in the region normally lasted anywhere between 50 years to thousands of years at a time.
Researchers analyzed sediment core samples from the bottom of Kirman Lake, a small freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains about 280 km east of Sacramento and found that from 6,000 to 1,000 BCE and again between 950 and 1250 CE the region was caught in severe drought.
“When you have arid periods that persist for 60 years, as we did in the 12th century, or for millennia, as we did from 6,000 to 1,000 BCE, that's not really a ‘drought.' That aridity is the new normal,” says Glen MacDonald, professor of Geography at UCLA and lead author of the study.

The authors say the markers in the lake's sediment composition, including charcoal deposits from wildfires and fossils from sagebrush, mollusk shells and algae, told the tale of local climate conditions throughout the years and indicated when the lake had dried up and become marshland and when it had filled in again.
The results match other geological accounts which also describe a general aridity both during the period known as the mid-Holocene between 6,000 and 1,000 BCE, commonly attributed to a slight shift in the Earth's orbit that affected the amount of sun received in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as during the period known as the medieval climate anomaly between 950 and 1250 CE, explained by a decrease in planetary volcanic activity and an increase in sunspot occurrences.
“We suspected we would see the millennia of aridity during the mid-Holocene at Kirman Lake, but we were surprised to see a very clear record of the medieval climate anomaly as well,” says MacDonald.
The problem, says MacDonald, is that whether the cause is the planet's orbit, volcanic activity or, as is the case in the current scenario, the greenhouse effect, the consequences for California, its croplands and farmers is likely to be the same: drought which persists for decades at a time.
“We can't save our huge expanses of oak woodlands, or our pine and fir forests, or high-elevation alpine ecosystems with irrigation projects like we might our orchards and gardens,” says MacDonald. “I worry that we will see very different wildlands by the end of this century.”
Released in 2006, The Secret harnessed the power of positive thinking and enthusiastic! punctuation!! It claimed that the blueprint to a happy and prosperous life lies in politely asking “the Universe” for a happy and prosperous life, please. “When you think about what you want,” author Rhonda Byrne explained, you attract it by causing “what you want to vibrate at the right frequency!” If nothing else, this provided a plausible explanation for why Quarter Pounders start to shake when Kirstie Alley pulls up at the drive-thru.
Byrne has now produced a sequel, The Power—and she's cut out the middleman. No longer do you need to climb upon the Universe's lap with a wish list. Simply express feelings of “love” for what you desire—cash, health, the telepathic powers of Aquaman—and it will be delivered to you. To assuage skeptics, the book is padded with deep quotes from such esteemed figures as Jesus Christ, Sophocles and the guy who draws “Dilbert.”
All you need to thrive in this age of economic upheaval is a cheery demeanour, Byrne writes. Hard work, dedication, a skill set: these are for suckers. Money “sticks” only to those who are upbeat. “The moment you react negatively to a big bill, you give bad feelings, and most surely you will receive bigger bills.” Got that? You don't get big bills because you spend foolishly. You get them because you're a grouchy pant. To think: the whole financial meltdown could have been avoided if only the employees of Lehman Brothers had triumphed over the Monday blues.
But The Power isn't all jolly adjectives and attitudes. There's math and science, too.
The math: the book reveals exactly how upbeat you must be to get off the Universe's naughty list. “If you give just 51 per cent good thoughts, you have tipped the scales . . . The love that comes back to you multiplies itself by attracting more love through the power of attraction.” Translation: even a D-minus optimist is pretty much assured a happy ending. You have to love a Universe that grades on a bell curve.
The science: “The inside of your head is 80 per cent water!” Byrne declares. Why does this matter? Because “researchers” have found that “when water is exposed to positive words and feelings . . . the structure of the water changes, making it perfectly harmonious.” I have no idea what she's talking about either—but think of all we can accomplish with our harmonious brain water! We can live for hundreds of years if we just put our minds to it, Byrne says. Mortality is for sad sacks.
But be warned: life is not all easy money and marinated super-brains. The Universe hates a mope. “From the small irritation of a mosquito, to the bigger irritation of your car breaking down, all of [your] experiences are the law of attraction responding to your irritation.” So mosquitoes bite only the crabby and my Volkswagen is at all times carefully monitoring my disposition. Noted.
Other revelations in The Power: nothing is dead, everything is alive, there's no such thing as time, and the Universe always knows where your car keys are. But mostly, the book is dedicated to its singular vision of how to confront modern problems.
Are you one of those negative Nancies who responds to lousy eyesight by wearing glasses? Dumb move, idiot. According to The Power, you can get 20/20 vision just by thinking, “I have perfect eyesight.” If you're sick and not getting well, it's not because the cancer is ravaging your body—it's because you're not being optimistic hard enough. Gratitude alone can apparently make “failed kidneys regenerate, diseased hearts heal and tumours disappear,” which is really going to help Obama afford that health care plan.
Need a job? Do NOT apply for one. That's a “desperate action” that announces your shortcomings to the Universe. Instead, do what “one man” did, according to Byrne. “He imagined their new office . . . They imagined their work colleagues. They gave them names. They had conversations with them. They even tasted the tacos at lunch breaks.” And then apparently out of the blue they got a job allegedly! Learn from them and you can make the symptoms of clinical insanity work for you.
“One thing is certain,” the author concludes. “We receive back what we give.” If that's true, the Universe owes Rhonda Byrne a tremendous amount of bullshit.
An Open Letter to SirScoots, the Counter-Strike Players Contracted to PEA Organizations, and the Counter-Strike Community
Noah Whinston Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 23, 2016
From Noah Whinston, CEO of Immortals and PEA Player Relations Committee Member, in response to the CSGO player open letter:
TL:DR
1) The intention of the PEA League is to create a better league for both American players and organizations. It is not an exclusive league. The teams will continue competing in non-PEA operated leagues and tournaments.
2) It is not financially viable for organizations to run a PEA CSGO league and also participate in all of the other existing online leagues because of issues with over-saturation.
3) PEA proposed a compromise to WESA to resolve the over-saturation issue, which WESA declined.
4) Though PEA organizations unambiguously have the contractual right to decide where their players compete, the organizations have decided to offer the players the choice to either participate in the PEA league or in the ESL Pro League North American division.
5) Financially, the PEA league offers more money to NA players. The PEA league pays out a guaranteed minimum average of $81,250 per PEA team (prize money + minimum guaranteed profit share), compared to a guaranteed minimum average of $21,428.57 (see http://bit.ly/2hOIE9I) per NA team in ESL Pro League (and a maximum average of $49,857.14 per team if NA teams took all the top 6 spots at the NA/EU EPL LAN final).
6) We sympathize with the players' sentiments around not feeling more included in the decision-making process and we acknowledge that we could and should have done better. That's why, in good faith, we're going to give this decision to them.
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
First, I'd like to acknowledge your open letter dated December 21st and confirm that we, all of the PEA organizations, take your concerns seriously and are open to continued discussions on these crucial matters. Your opinions (and those of the community) are important to us.
The purpose of the PEA league is to create a better league for players, fans, and organizations, introducing tangible benefits that go above and beyond the current standard in CSGO. It is not an exclusive league. PEA teams will continue to compete in non-PEA operated leagues and tournaments. We want to establish the framework for a partnership between players and organizations that extends far into the future. There's still a long way to go before that trust gets built, and we've made our fair share of missteps along the way.
Throughout this process, IMT has done its best to keep an open and transparent line of communication with our players, proactively preserving a healthy relationship and avoiding the potential for misunderstanding. I support their right to choose a collective representative in SirScoots, and look forward to working with both our roster and Scott on resolving the issues on the table.
Based on my interpretation of the public and private statements from Scott and the players, I've distilled their arguments down to 2 main points:
1) Players have the unilateral right to decide where they compete, regardless of their contracts;
2) Players have chosen to compete simultaneously in both the PEA and EPL.
For both the players and the community, context matters. Tweeting #LCSForever in support of organizations or #PlayersRights in support of players doesn't advance the conversation unless we build a common understanding of how the ecosystem functions.
Why players don't have the exclusive right to decide where they compete
Inherently, when players sign with an organization, there has to be a trade-off. At a basic level, players accept salaries as guaranteed money, not dependent on their performance or how many stream viewers they get or how well they sell sponsorships. Because players are protected, they give up some of the profit potential to their organization. Players get paid a salary and have access to housing, travel, and coaching and, in exchange, the team gets to control some of the channels of monetizing the players, like sponsorships and merchandising. That's how every company, esports organization or otherwise, works.
Nobody forces players to make these agreements. They are free to compete without the financial or infrastructural support of teams and maintain complete control. That also comes with a burden of responsibility, financial instability, and risk that, understandably, few players want to take on.
One of the rights that players give up in their contracts, in CSGO, League of Legends, soccer, basketball, and every other professional team sport, is the ability to unilaterally decide which tournaments they compete in. It would not make sense for a roster of players to decide what tournaments to participate in, while representing the organization and emblazoned with its intellectual property. Perhaps the most surprising part of the player letter is that this basic fact is treated as new information. Athletes have always been part of the conversation surrounding the events in which a team decides to compete, but the power to make a final decision always resides with the organization.
As a result, competitive leagues and tournaments need to create a structure that is beneficial for both the players and the organizations. That's why many of the larger CSGO leagues, like ECS, take steps to protect not just the financial health of the players via a prize pool, but also the health of organizations by providing opportunities to share meaningfully in the revenue of the league. The PEA was created to bridge the gap: creating a league that was not just better for organizations, because it would allow us to see more financial return from our work, but also better for players, because it would pay out profits to players on top of a high minimum prize pool and provide fringe benefits like health insurance and financial planning.
So it's not surprising that the feedback I've gotten from players about the PEA league has been positive. The problem before us is not whether the PEA league is good for players, but whether a team can reasonably compete in 3 simultaneous online leagues on top of its other responsibilities.
Why the players can't compete in both the PEA league and EPL
As many have talked about frequently over the last year, CSGO is past the saturation point. There are so many leagues and tournaments that players just don't have the time to play in all of them on top of fulfilling their streaming and sponsor obligations. Those streaming and sponsor obligations are important because those are the activities that most directly correlate to an organization's ability to pay player salaries. Burnout risk is at an all-time high because of the demanding schedule. Gameplay quality and consistency are falling as players devote more time to competition and less time to practice. it became apparent that the PEA league is not financially viable as yet another year-round league.
Despite this over-saturation, core needs of players and organizations still go unmet. Players lack access to profit-sharing, decision-sharing, health insurance, financial planning, and other fringe benefits that increase career longevity and provide a more stable situation for players after retirement. The ability of the organizations to have a meaningful say in the future of our brands and to create long-term value is diminishing. The status quo isn't sustainable.
As a result, the PEA attempted to negotiate a compromise with WESA around ESL Pro League to lessen the problem of over-saturation. This compromise would involve North American teams playing in a PEA league open to all teams, independent of affiliation with PEA, while the EPL would continue to operate in Europe. The top teams from each region would meet in a co-produced LAN final. This system would function identically to the current EPL structure, except with much more prize money available to NA players in the new PEA North American league compared to the pre-existing WESA North American division. I and other owners presented this compromise to our players in conversation and received positive feedback.
WESA declined our proposal, making a counterproposal that reserved the large majority of revenue for WESA member teams.
Based on our direct conversations with our teams and the representations of SirScoots, I believe every author of the player letter wants to participate in the PEA league, as well as EPL. Unfortunately, that option is not on the table. If the only option for the PEA is to lose money by functioning as yet another year-round CSGO league, we'll instead devote the PEA league's resources to other game titles where over-saturation is less of a problem.
I sympathize with the players' sentiments around not feeling more included in the decision-making process and I acknowledge that we could and should have done better. That's why, in good faith, we're going to give this decision to them.
We'll arrange a meeting with all of the players ASAP to discuss this and answer questions, so that they can decide as a unified body whether they want to participate in EPL or PEA next season.
I will personally be available to answer questions from the players, their collective representative, press, and the community. I will make the questions and answers publicly available to the extent that I can, and will be as responsive as possible during my travel today back to the United States from China.
Below, the community can find the direct comparison of economics between the PEA and EPL options.
PEA vs. EPL Economic comparison
EPL Season 5
Pro League offers no representation to non-WESA players in decision-making. The economics are expected to be as follows:*
*The above numbers represent the EPL S4 prize pools plus a 1/3 increase to reflect the change in prize pool from $750K to $1M per season.
Since the EPL prize pool is spread over NA and EU and includes more teams than PEA, player payouts In PEA will be more concentrated than EPL.
The players are likely to earn far more in PEA than in EPL (see below).
PEA Season 1
PEA initially offered $500,000 in prize money for Season 1 (produced in concert with our production partner PGL) and assumed that 10 teams would participate.
As I described above, PEA attempted to negotiate a compromise with WESA. We offered a 3-year deal whereby PEA would operate in NA and EPL would operate in Europe, finishing with a jointly-run NA vs. EU championship (see chart below).
WESA rejected our offer and made a weak counter-proposal — in which they offered to give all non-WESA teams some minor profit-sharing. As a result, we decided to substantially increase the payouts in the PEA league by adding $250,000 in minimum guaranteed profit-sharing to the $500,000 prize pool for a total payout of $750,000 (see below).
**Profit-sharing will only apply to the PEA teams, not all 10 teams in the league.
The addition of $250,000 in minimum guaranteed profits (MG) will provide a strong baseline of compensation for players and a preview of what's coming in the future when the PEA league is operating profitably. Teams at the bottom will more than double their compensation and even the top teams will see significant compensation bumps.
In addition, players will receive health insurance coverage and financial planning assistance not provided to them by any other CSGO league.

The Trump administration may want to exert more pressure on North Korea, creating an expectation in the outside world that it may militarily target North Korea and even launch a “decapitation attack.” But if Pyongyang wages a desperate counterattack, Washington will be caught in a dilemma.
I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2017
Taking military actions against North Korea is much more risky than launching a missile strike on Syria. Pyongyang is able to deal a heavy blow to South Korea. Regardless of Pyongyang's nuclear capability, a radiological dispersal device, or a “dirty bomb,” if thrown on the South, will cause nuclear pollution, which will be unbearable to this US ally.

Claudio Ranieri was backed for the Leicester job at very short odds
Sky Bet have suspended their next Leicester City manager market after Claudio Ranieri was heavily backed to take the job on Saturday.
The 63-year-old Italian had earlier replaced Martin O'Neill at the head of the online bookmaker's odds for the top job at the King Power Stadium.
Betting was later suspended on Saturday evening after Ranieri was supported for the Foxes role by punters at odds as short as 1/3.
Sky sources understand that Leicester want to hold talks with Republic of Ireland boss O'Neill over the vacant role, but it is Ranieri who has been attracting the money with the bookmakers.
Ranieri has been out of work after leaving their role as Greece boss at the end of 2014 and they previously worked in England as Chelsea manager between 2000 and 2004.
Leicester have been looking for a new manager after sacking Nigel Pearson, who kept the club in the Premier League, at the end of last month.
Sky Bet's Simon Thompson said: "After starting the day at 12/1, we have seen a steady stream of money today for Claudio Ranieri to take over the hotseat vacated by Nigel Pearson at Leicester, culminating in several extremely large bets at short prices this evening."

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Most of the focus of the 2016 presidential campaign has been on the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but the two leading Democratic candidates will both be making visits to western Massachusetts this week.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will hold a "Conversation with Hillary" fundraiser at the Delaney House in Holyoke on Thursday at 11:00 A.M. According to Clinton's campaign website, ticket prices range from $500 for general admission to $2,700 for a "Champion" ticket that includes a photo opportunity with the candidate.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will hold a rally on the steps of Springfield City Hall on Saturday afternoon. Supporters are being encouraged to gather there starting at 1:00 P.M. with the rally itself starting at 2:00.
The latest nationwide NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll shows the Democratic race is tightening. Sanders has been surging in recent months, and now is within seven points of the front-runner if Vice President Joe Biden decides to run. Without Biden, Clinton leads Sanders by 15 points, but they had led them by 60 points just three months ago.
Also troubling for Clinton: polls taken since the beginning of September in New Hampshire have consistently shown the senator from neighboring Vermont leading the former secretary of state.
The Massachusetts Presidential Primary is March 1.
Speculation has been rampant over the past few months regarding the next location of Survivor. Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines were all rumored as the setting for the upcoming cycle of seasons. Today those rumors can be put to rest, as Inside Survivor has learned the filming location for Season 33 and 34 of Survivor.
Survivor will be returning to Fiji to film the 33rd and 34th iterations of the long-running reality show; specifically the Mamanuca Islands. The Mamanuca Islands are a volcanic archipelago located west of Nadi and to the south of the Yasawa Islands and consists of over 20 islands. Mana Island, one of those 20 islands, is to be taken over by the production crew from February onwards.
The news that SEG Productions are setting up camp on Mana Island is supported by various sources and travel resorts within the area. Bula Wedding Creations, a wedding planning service based out of Fiji, confirmed Survivor's involvement on the island back in September 2015 on their Facebook page:
Holiday-goers have also reiterated similar information on booking websites such as Trip Advisor, like here in November 2015. The latest news regarding the upcoming production was posted on the Fiji Sun website earlier this month, when Ulrich Hoffgen, the General Manager of the Mana Island Resort, confirmed that film crew would exclusively charter the resort for nearly six months between February and July. While they didn't disclose that the production was Survivor, they did state that the first set of crew had arrived on the island for early preparation and that the show would bring “…great publicity for Fiji and Mana.”
Mana Island itself appears to be a relatively small island, and it is possible it could be used only to house production crew during filming. There are many other islands within the Mamanuca Islands chain that could be used for beaches to film on.
Survivor previously filmed in Macuata, Vanua Levu, Fiji back in 2006 for Survivor: Fiji which aired on CBS in Spring 2007. Inside Survivor was told that due to the harsh conditions suffered by both cast and crew during the filming on Koh Rong Island in Cambodia in 2015, it was a high priority for the Survivor production team to find a location that had comfortable accommodation for the crew as well as a safer filming environment.
Filming is scheduled to begin in March for Season 33 and production will continue until early July for Season 34.
BRYAN COUNTY, Okla. -- A government program has allowed a Texoma county to acquire several military vehicles, including another helicopter this year.
"I think it's a good thing in case there's ever a state of emergency where we have to use something like that," Bryan County resident Sarah Schrecengost said.
That's exactly the reason why the Bryan County Sheriff's Office jumped on the opportunity to acquire several excess military vehicles, on the federal government's tab.
And if you recognize some of these emergency vehicles it's because you probably have seen them, featured in a Choctaw Nation TV commercial.
Investigator John Haislip says they applied for the Pentagon Program in 2006 and now have three million dollars in equipment.
"It's not for us to try and be militarized," Bryan County Investigator John Haislip said.
Through the Pentagon Program, the Bryan County Sheriff's office was able to acquire a mine resistant vehicle, also known as an Mrap. They were the most survivable vehicles against roadside bombs in Afghanistan.
"We have two helicopters that are operational that we use," Haislip said.
The helicopters are used in pursuits, transporting inmates and were used for surveillance when the president visited Durant.
"Marijauna growers, or meth labs, when we get information on those we'll do surveillance there," Haislip said.
The upkeep is paid for by grants.
They also have 3 Humvees.
The MRAP was stationed in Cartwright during last spring's flooding.
"When we do have citizens in need, we have the ability to get to them and deal with the situation," Haislip said.
"Whenever the situation comes up where they're the ones stuck there and calling us, they're going to want it, they're going to want us to have it," Haislip said.
"Some good assets that they can put to use," Bryan County resident David Barkley said.
"I just think it would be a good thing," Schrecengost said.
The Sightgeist, by Jon Kudelka
Ever wondered what it would be like if our political systems collapsed and we had to rebuild them? We could end up in a dystopia where warlords carried cricket bats and ferals fought over cockroaches. Or we could inherit virgin territory and a chance to start again.
Well, the social media site Reddit conducted an experiment in exactly that a few weekends ago. And the result was a stunning display of politics that social scientists are already studying for clues on how humans organise themselves and, if worst comes to worst, whether we'll be eating cockroach pie in years to come.
Reddit set aside a space called Place and allowed its millions of users to fill it in. Each user could use one coloured tile every five minutes to create an image. The idea was to encourage co-operation but there were no guidelines or goal. Just 72 hours, 1,000,000 pixels and the challenge to create.

The first marks were doodlings, the stuff you find on toilet walls. Obviously, people were unsure what to do with a blank canvas, or maybe graffiti artists are always first to claim a space. But then users started organising and everything changed. They found strategies for collaborating and began enlisting people in their Reddit groups to contribute.
And art happened. A Van Gogh appeared, characters from video games popped up, messages to loved ones were written, spiritual iconography was created, pastiches from countries took shape and, inevitably, toilet doodlings continued. And all the time users were wiping out the art with their tiles or trying to save their art. It was a continuous wave of creation and re-creation. When national flags appeared, war was inevitable. Suddenly territory became political and the biggest contest was for centre position. The battle for the centre spot between the German and French flags was huge. A French-born Australian who is my friend stayed up late to defend the French flag while their partner helped defend the Australian corner: a boxing kangaroo, a Bunnings sign and Steve Irwin hugging a crocodile.
Over the 72 hours, a million Reddit users fought for territory, defended their art, destroyed art and sent messages to the world. And in their own chat groups, they debated strategies philosophies and generally gave the UN a lesson in geopolitics. Place began to look like a Rorschach test of human sentiments. And then the void arrived. Users from a rival social media group, 4chan, invaded Place with black tiles, and for hours the black splotch spread across the space, consuming flags and art. On playbacks, it looked like a cancer; in effect it operated like Islamic State.
The void was the biggest test for the one million creators of Place. They knew they had to stop fighting each other and come together to fight the void or their world would turn black.
It took negotiations across hundreds of groups for a solution. The creation that would take the central position when the 72 hours were up was both obvious and surprising. It was the US flag. The Place ended up looking like the world today. With America at the centre, the forces of darkness were repelled and other groups were free to create parts with art, humour, flags, religions, celebrities and sports. Even Steve Irwin and their crocodile survived.
The final Place is a beautiful world. You can check it out on any number of news sites and the best account of the war is at Sudoscript.com. But the most beautiful thing about Place is that it was created by a young and engaged community after a weekend of battles, strategies, negotiations and disappointments. No emergency session of the UN has lasted that long. And, perhaps, no resolution has been as good.
My Reddit friend quipped that he'll tell their grandchildren they fought for the French flag in the War of the Pixels.
For those of us who spent that weekend lounging around, oblivious to the battle being fought on screens nearby, there is solace in the achievements of the Reddit groups. When they run the world, our world, I don't think we'll be eating cockroaches.

Before “Interstellar:” The 12 Most Thought-Provoking Sci-Fi Films of the 21st Century.
Unless you live on another planet and haven't caught up with news from Earth, you've heard about Christopher Nolan‘s “Interstellar.” Mainstream Hollywood has been Nolan's oyster ever since their “Dark Knight Trilogy” (and more specifically, “The Dark Knight“) had audiences and critics alike frothing at the mouths, and now that their Gotham nights are behind him, every single person interested in movies has been anticipating their next post-Batman film. “Interstellar” has been compared to Stanley Kubrick‘s “2001: A Space Odyssey” before it was even seen by anyone outside Nolan's inner circle (partly due to Nolan's own talk on the campaign trail), so the dial on the expectation-meter has been bending for a while. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the meter has cracked.
After some celebrities bragged about how orgasmically mind-blowing “Interstellar” is before even press screenings were held, the epic Sci-Fi adventure hit limited theatres and IMAX multiplexes last Friday, and continues to expand ever further around the globe today. The verdict, thus far? Mixed, disappointing, underrated; it depends on who you ask and who you read. I hope to see it this weekend and weigh in, but until then, I got this idea. Nolan is known to inject a healthy dose of intelligence into their blockbusters, and if a true-to-form sci-fi film should do anything right it's probe the viewers' mind and spin our cerebral wheels into thoughtful contemplation about Earth, the universe, the future, the beyond…
To celebrate one of 21st century's most popular directors, and a genre that loves to bend the mind while looking pretty, here are the 12 most thought-provoking, intellectually stimulating, non-comic book, sci-fi films of the 21st century, in chronological order.
“A.I.: Artificial Intelligence” (2001)
You may just find me on my deathbed one day, still claiming that ‘A.I.‘ is Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement. Sure, it's partly due to the fact that I've never considered myself a “real” Spielberg fan (sorry, but “Schindler's List,” “Saving Private Ryan,” etc. drown in near-unbearable sentimentality) and that I think Stanley Kubrick is the true prophet of the religion of film, but it's also because ‘A.I.' is one of the best, most intelligent, depictions of the future and the future of human relationship and human emotion. Envisioned by Kubrick, realized by Spielberg, the project fuses the best of two worlds, birthing a masterpiece.
Do you even know what's going on in Richard Kelly‘s feature debut, “Donnie Darko?” Does he? How much does it matter, really, when the whole idea of “Donnie Darko” is to edge you closer towards the screen and make you wonder. Wonder at what's going on, what are those weird spirals, who the fuck is that evil-ass bunny, what does this have to do with cellar doors, time travel, Christianity, people being nice to people, a douche-y Patrick Swayze.. “Donnie Darko” is a mystery, a thriller, a coming-of-age story, all wrapped around bizarre science fiction theories, and should be found in the “Sci-Fi Movie Dictionary” definition of thought-provoking.
Shane Carruth‘s “Upstream Color” was lauded by critics and audiences as being this super-smart, off-beat, unique, transcendental movie about god-knows-what. But, I didn't like it. Instead, I much, much, prefer their debut “Primer” about a couple of regular guys who discover time travel. Forget the action-adventure “Looper,” which abuses the physics of time-traveling for its own entertaining ends. This is as down-to-earth as you're going to get with the possibility of time travel, giving you something to think about and not allowing you to switch your brain off.
“A Scanner Darkly” (2006)
Richard Linklater is really something else. They can give us the sweetest-tasting slices of life in recent memory (“Boyhood,” the ‘Before‘ series..) but at the same time has the capacity to take a Philip K. Dick novel, materialize it in animated form after shooting real actors in digital (for a supremely trippy effect), and hurt our brain cells. Real hard. The mental horizons may not be as expansive as they are in their “Waking Life” (mandatory viewing), but ‘Darkly' is one of the most faithful Dick adaptations and it's dipped in science fiction from frame to frame. Politics, drug addiction, and loss of self in the distant future. So bloody good.
Please enjoy some helpful advice for some of the best-known heroes and heros of science fiction and fantasy, courtesy of Baru Cormorant, the brilliant protagonist of one of September's most hotly anticipated titles. No stranger to sinister villainy and evil empires, Baru is more than capable of helping out everyone from humble hobbits to vengeance-driven superheroes with their unique brand of no-nonsense pragmatism…
Dear Baru: I'm tired of farm life. I want to join the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. What can I do? –Luke
Dear Luke,
I hate tyranny as much as you. But we need to be pragmatic. Most revolutions fail.
I suggest you fix up your uncle's finances, study hard, and apply to the Academy. Don't waste time trying to become a star pilot—much too risky. Get a job as an interrogator. (Do you have weird intuition or influence on the weak-minded? Could help.)
Once you're established as Chief Rebel-hunter, try to capture one of their leaders. Offer to release them as a triple agent. She'll feed you expendable Rebel cells. You'll protect them
You should be able to parley your success into political power. Once you have a loyal fleet, you can restore freedom to the galaxy!
Don't worry about this ‘Force' myth. It's bait for rubes. (If you find out otherwise, write immediately.)
Dear Baru, I'm worried the humans are getting ready to displace my tribe. How can I stop them? –Neytiri
Wow—HUGE ADMIRER. Listen: you already know what to do. Just befriend one of the human Avatars. Pretend you're fascinated by their way of life. Learn everything you can about acting human.
Then bait them to your World Tree and use your nerve bridge to put your mind into their human body!
I know it'll be hard for you to live in a tiny, frail human shell, given how graceful and athletic you are. But if we're going to save our people, we have to wear useful masks.
Dear Baru, There's an organism loose on my ship. I'm starting to think that Weyland-Yutani cares about capturing that thing more than it cares about us. What do I do? –Ellen
Dear Ellen,
Do you think you're the only ship on a mission like this? The Company is the real threat.
Bait that organism into a shuttle. (If it's your crew as bait, or the cat…) Launch the shuttle into space. Memorize the trajectory, and don't tell ANYONE.
Once you're home, demand a position on the Weyland-Yutani board in exchange for the shuttle. And if the Company suggests setting up a colony on LV-426, you can in send in the Marines to nuke the site from orbit!
Take good care of your daughter. And tell them everything. It's better that they know.
Dear Baru, I'm a huge fan of the way you manipulate financial systems and the lives of millions to achieve your goals. I'm a billionaire looking to use (mostly) human technology to improve the world in, uh, pseudo-legal ways. I need a new accountant to keep track of all my money. Interested? –Tony
Dear Tony,
While I admire your aims, I'm unsatisfied with your methods—and with your results. You insist on putting yourself directly in harm's way instead of managing risk by using talented subordinates. And your fraternization with your employees leaves you vulnerable to infiltration, blackmail, and emotional compromise. Imagine how you would feel if you'd lost your secretary!
Armor isn't for fighting, Tony. Armor is for running away from fights, so you can get back to your plans.
If I may be blunt, I think you're driven as much by your insecurities, vanity, and terror of losing power as you are by a desire to help the world. I can only conclude that one of your allies or companions is responsible for holding your company together while you play knight.
Please put me in touch with them.
Dear Baru, I've recently started studying wizardry at a British school. No one can tell me exactly how the Dark Lord was defeated — but I do have access to the only survivor of their last attack. Isn't anyone afraid He'll return? –Hermione
Hermione, I'm glad someone is thinking about these things. It's clear from your classes that you'll be a star student. I have reason to believe that professors at your school are easily compromised…perhaps you can get access to magical resources? I must confess great interest in the possibilities of polyjuice, Portkeys, apparition and all the rest…
Once you have assets, you'll need to arrange a test protocol for this Boy Who Lived. Monsters! Magical accidents! Clues, crushes, and conspiracies to test their reactions! It's vital that you learn how they survived, and what countermeasures defeated the Dark Lord. We must be scientific!
Can you infiltrate the boy's friends? Perhaps leverage the poor Weasley boy with a stipend? I'm not very good at this part. But if you can get close, I'm sure you'll be able to coax Potter through a set of experiments. Think of each year as a chance to learn more about the Dark Lord and their downfall.
I suppose you could just tell Harry what you're doing. But that seems like an unnecessary risk.
I would like to try on your school's hat.
Dear Baru, I've come into possession of the One Ring. I need to get it to Mordor. What's the best way? –Frodo
That's tough. Middle-earth is good at speeches but awful at logistics. So you'll need to rally the national economies of Gondor and Rohan to support a huge invasion force. (Please don't try eagles. Never count on the incompetence of your enemy's air defense.)
I understand the Ring comes with psychological risks. It's best to use it sparingly, in shifts. Wield it as necessary to gain intelligence and unite your followers. Your Fellowship members can support each other.
But you have to ask yourself, Frodo: do I trust my allies? Isn't it my responsibility to prepare for betrayal, and to betray first, if necessary to protect the mission?
Think on it. Let me know how it goes. Please score Galadriel's address for my correspondence.
Dear Baru, I recently inherited the title of Abhorsen. I can raise and command the Dead with bells. I'm supposed to kill the Dead as they rise, but I want to do more. Should I risk using Free Magic and necromancy to learn the secrets of the cosmos? –Sabriel
Dear Sabriel,
Are you single???
Dear Baru, My parents are dead. I want to use my billions to punch crime. Good plan? –Bruce
Dear Bruce,
You're an idiot.

Officials at a Manhattan court are scrambling to make sense of botched court transcripts in 30 cases after the stenographer allegedly typed gibberish and, in one case, "I hate my job, I hate my job," over and over, according to a published report.
The New York Post reports that Daniel Kochanski, 43, typed random keys or "I hate my job. I hate my job. I hate my job" while they were supposed to be transcribing court proceedings.
The Post, citing a high-level source, reports Kochanski's "gibberish" typing may have jeopardized convictions by giving defendants a chance to claim crucial evidence is missing.
Family members told the Post Kochanski had been an alcoholic, and the 43-year-old told the paper over the phone that they were fired because of substance abuse but not because they failed at their job.
Kochanski was fired in March 2012 for misconduct, an Office of Court Administration spokesperson told the paper. The Manhattan DA's office arrested them and forced them to try to make sense of their shorthand typing, sources told the Post, but the effort apparently failed.
Judges have been holding "reconstruction hearings" in which everyone involved in a case testifies about what they remember, despite years having passed since the cases.
The Center for Appellate Litigation is handling appeals in 10 cases in which Kochanski botched the court transcripts.
"I never had a situation where a single court reporter was responsible for so much damage," said Claudia Trupp, an administrator at the center.
Kochanski denied bungling the transcripts.
"I always did my job 100 percent," they told the Post, adding that they were in recovery and will be one year clean by July.
In a new study, researchers at the University of Iowa report that burning oat hulls had considerable benefits to the environment as well as to human health.

Biomass burning sometimes gets a bad rap. That's because many associate the burning of living and dead vegetation with human-caused fires and clearing of land that release unhealthy particles and gases that spur global warming.
But what if you burned biomass in a controlled environment, such as in a power plant, that at least partially replaces using a fossil fuel? Would there be demonstrable environmental and health benefits?
In a new study, researchers at the University of Iowa report that burning oat hulls had considerable benefits to the environment as well as to human health. The study examined the practices at the UI Power Plant, where technicians have burned a mix of oat hulls and coal for more than a decade. The researchers found a 50-50 oat hulls-coal mix, when compared to burning only coal, reduced fossil carbon-dioxide emissions by 40 percent and significantly reduced the release of particulate matter, hazardous substances, and heavy metals.
“Our general conclusion is that when optimized, co firing (burning biomass with coal) presents a good option for energy production, without incurring the negative environmental effects that comes with burning fossil fuels alone, like fossil carbon dioxide emissions and harmful particulate matter,” says Betsy Stone, assistant professor of chemistry at the UI and corresponding author on the study, published in the journal Fuel.
It may seem logical that controlled burning any type of biomass—from grasses to wood chips—would be good for the environment. After all, shouldn't any of these sources be more preferable than coal, known for its deleterious environmental and public-health effects? Not necessarily, as biomass burning requires specialized equipment, may not burn as efficiently as fossil fuels, and supplies may be limited, among other factors. In other words, the benefits may not outweigh the costs.
The UI Power Plant has overcome some of these obstacles with the oat hulls. The supply is plentiful, as the plant, which supplies steam to campus for heating, cooling, dehumidification, and about one-third of the campus electricity, gets its feedstuff from the Quaker Oats facility in nearby Cedar Rapids. The university also tinkered with equipment to optimize its burning of oat hulls, now at 40,000 tons annually, according to Ben Anderson, UI Power Plant manager.
Betsy Stone
But still no one had quantified the benefits, if any, of their oat hulls' use. As Stone put it, “It's not a linear effect. If you add more biomass, it doesn't mean air quality is getting better.”
So, they and their team decided to find out what the oat hulls were doing. The researchers took emissions tests in April-May 2014 to determine how co-firing affects the air pollution.
The team found significant environmental and public-health benefits.
When compared to burning only coal, co-firing with the oat hulls reduced filterable particulate matter by 90 percent, hazardous air pollutants dropped by 41 percent, and heavy metals, including manganese, copper, nickel, and zinc, fell by 51 percent. Moreover, fossil carbon-dioxide emissions were 40 percent less than if only coal had been used. Carbon dioxide, as has been well documented, is a major contributor to global warming,
“Many environmental advantages were observed with co-firing oat hulls as a new potential fuel for energy generation,” the authors wrote. “Co-firing 50 percent oat hulls with coal significantly reduced the emission of atmospheric pollutants.”
The team also found that co-firing wood chips had minor impacts on the release of pollutants, although more analysis may be needed to fully understand the effect, depending on the amount used and the mix percentage.
The UI power plant this summer added a third type of biomass, a grass called miscanthus, to its renewable-energy portfolio, part of a plan to derive 40 percent of the UI's power generation use from renewables by 2020. Stone's team plans to analyze miscanthus's potential environmental benefits as well.
Contributing authors include UI chemistry professor Vicki Grassian, post-doctoral researcher Armando Estillore, and graduate students Imali Mudunkotowa and Ibrahim Al-Naiema, all at the UI.
The university funded the study.
Hans Fliege likes to go for walks, and they love the view across the Main River, which is why they moved to the village of Obertheres in Bavaria 30 years ago. But they know that it isn't a strong enough argument against solar energy parks.
After all, the other side can base its arguments on the prospect of impending climate catastrophe. They could accuse Fliege of being prepared to accept rising sea levels, dried-up fields and hurricanes -- all so that their view of the Main River would remain undisturbed.
An investor wants to set up solar modules on two sites in Fliege's village, covering a combined area of 40 hectares (99 acres). Fliege wants to prevent it from happening. They scored an initial victory after recently collecting enough signatures to force a referendum, the first ever in the municipality of Theres, which Obertheres belongs to.
Now Fliege is trying to convince their neighbors to vote against the solar parks in the referendum, which will be held on the last Sunday in February.  They are standing in the middle of the assembly room at the Obertheres Gymnastics Association next to their laptop, which they have connected a new projector. "So, from the standpoint of energy production, the issue is complete nonsense for Germany," they say.
The citizens of Theres will not just be voting on the planned solar parks. Instead, they are being asked to decide whether open spaces within the town limits can be used for solar power projects at all.
Fine in Theory
It is a small, local issue, but it relates to some of the world's biggest problems. For instance, it brings to mind the December 2009 United Nations Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen, which failed when politicians from 192 countries were unable to come to an agreement. This is bad enough, but what happens when citizens are involved in the decision? Are they prepared to adopt a climate-friendly lifestyle? Do they actually want renewable energy?
Hardly anyone opposes it, at least in principle. According to surveys, more than three-quarters of Germans support more green energy. They want to be able to consume energy with a good conscience, preserve their lifestyles and still save the climate -- just not in their own backyards.
Very few Germans live in the vicinity of a conventional large power plant. Renewable energy, however, can be produced anywhere, in every small city or village, using solar panels, wind turbines and biogas plants. But when these energy-producing plants are built close to residential areas, their drawbacks quickly become clear, in the form of noise, stench and changes to the landscape.
This does, in fact, lead to "many reasons for communication" says Björn Klusmann, managing director of the German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE). Their choice of words is as smooth as the image of their industry. "In places where things are changing, issues of acceptance arise," they say. But they are also convinced that every dispute is in fact an opportunity for renewable energy.
'People Will Think We're Insane'
Hans Fliege, who is wearing a red cardigan, begins their PowerPoint presentation with a map of the municipality, on which many areas are shaded. These are the potential sites of solar parks, they say.
Fliege, 62, is a retired electrical engineer. Until now, they have kept a relatively low profile, not joining any local clubs and avoiding community events. In fact, they had their first longer conversations with many of their neighbors when they began collecting signatures against the solar parks. They then invited those who seemed the most receptive to their ideas to their meeting at the sports club. Of the roughly two dozen people in the room, most are couples in Fliege's age group, and all are opposed to the solar parks and ready for battle.
"People will think that we're insane," Fliege tells them right off the bat. It will not be easy, they say, to make it clear to people why solar parks in the area are not just ugly, but also a bad idea.
It's warm in the room and the smell of frying grease from the Greek restaurant next door is in the air. Fliege's presentation is getting complicated. They show their audience tables and diagrams, energy consumption graphs and efficiency figures. They seem to have computed everything possible and has dealt with every conceivable issue.
Emotional Reaction
Does climate change really exist, they ask? Couldn't Germany's nuclear power plants -- which Fliege, who used to vote for the Green Party, generally regards critically because of the question of where to store the nuclear waste -- be kept running for a while longer? Is there even an energy crisis in Germany?
The audience is getting restless. Fliege's wife reminds their husband not to forget about people's emotional reactions to the project. The residents are more concerned about real estate prices in the village than energy consumption figures. Some are probably wondering what solving the radioactive waste storage problem has to do with being against solar parks.
"We don't want those things here. Isn't that enough?" one man asks.
Dieter Rucht from the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB) has been studying protest movements for years. Establishing a citizens' initiative or collecting signatures against a development project is no longer seen as the work of troublemakers, but as a rational way of defending one's interests, they say. According to Rucht, everyone feels obliged to establish their or their own lobby. People today are self-confident when dealing with authority figures, more capable of voicing their criticism and more articulate.
But this, says Rucht, has also made the situation more confusing. Large numbers of groups calling themselves citizens' initiatives are being set up. Some claim to be promoting the environment, but are in fact sponsored by industry. "The battle lines are all over the place, and it isn't always clear who's behind a particular initiative," Rucht says.

Elections have consequences and you have no one to blame but yourself, according to former President Barack Obama.
Laying down some cold hard truth, Obama told an audience in Milan, Italy Tuesday that unless they participate in democracy “you get the politicians you deserve.”
“People have a tendency to blame politicians when things don't work, but as I always tell people, you get the politicians you deserve,” Obama explained while the audience applauded. “And if you don't vote and you don't pay attention, you'll get policies that don't reflect your interest.”
Obama also told the audience that often times a mistake activists make “is not engaging people once they get attention.”
Obama was in Italy to deliver a speech on food insecurity, food waste and the impact our food has on pollution and climate change.
“To make the big change we need to cut waste at home first,” Obama told the audience. But they also admitted the privilege that surrounds focusing on climate change.
“Being worried about climate change is a luxury because people have to worry about feeding their family,” Obama explained. “You have to be secure on what to eat before worrying about the planet.”

Он назвал Bitcoin Cash противоположностью биткоину и "будущим".
По его словам, биткоин "так же хорош, как и бесполезен". Сооснователь и технический директор одного из самых известных профильных сайтов о криптовалюте Bitcoin.com Эмиль Ольденбург заявил, что недавно продал все свои накопления в биткоинах. Теперь он вкладывает в Bitcoin Cash. Шведский предприниматель, который последние три года живёт в Токио, не уточнил, сколько у него было биткоинов, когда он их продал и сколько выручил. При этом он раскритиковал биткоин, назвав вложения в него "самыми рискованными инвестициями, которые можно сделать". Он так же сказал, что биткоин "так же хорош, как и бесполезен". По мнению Ольденбурга, главные проблемы биткоина — это высокие комиссии и задержки в операциях. "Когда люди поймут, как работает биткоин, они начнут его продавать", — уверен он.
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) dodged the question last week of whether they agree with their party's support for "reparative therapy," a process purported to change the sexual orientation of gay people. But campaign records show the gubernatorial candidate has been flying around on a private plane donated by two billionaires who help fund the "ex-gay" movement.
Texas fracking tycoons Dan and Farris Wilks have given Abbott a combined total of more than $30,000 worth of in-kind donations this year for the use of a private plane. The Wilks' charitable trust, The Thirteen Foundation, has contributed nearly $3 million to groups that promote gay conversion therapy, a discredited pseudo-medical practice meant to change people's sexual orientation from gay to straight. The foundation also donates millions to anti-abortion and conservative religious groups.
Abbott's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
The Texas Republican Party endorsed reparative therapy in its platform this year and asserted that homosexuality is not "an acceptable alternative lifestyle."
“We recognize the legitimacy and value of counseling which offers reparative therapy and treatment to patients who are seeking escape from the homosexual lifestyle," the platform states. "No laws or executive orders shall be imposed to limit or restrict access to this type of therapy."
As attorney general, Abbott has defended Texas' ban on same-sex marriages, but last week they avoided the question of whether they agree with that new plank in the GOP platform.
“First is jobs, second is schools, three is roads, transportation and water, and four is making sure our border is secure,” Abbott told KYTX.
“It sounds like reparative therapy is pretty far down on that list,” Sutton said.
“Well, if government does what it's supposed to do, and then gets out of people's way, everyone is a whole lot happier,” Abbott responded.
Abbott's billionaire donors have sent millions of dollars to groups including the Liberty Counsel, Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, which advocate for gay conversion therapy and have fought in court to protect the legality of giving the treatment to minors.

A video has emerged of Turkey's prime minister threatened a young man with a slap if they booed them on a visit to a town recovering from a mining disaster.
The video, released by Turkey's Dogan News Agency, was apparently taken during Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit on Wednesday to the eastern town of Soma - a day after more than 300 people died as they worked underground.
PM Erdoğan's advisor Yerkel confirmed the authenticity of the photos showing them kicking a protester [AP]
In the video, Erdoğan walks with their bodyguards as Soma residents around them boo. Then they approach a young man and says: "If you boo this country's prime minister, you get slapped."
The accident in Soma has been controversial not only because of lax safety standard accusations targeting the government, but also incidents involving an aide of Erdoğan and the prime minister themselves during their Soma visit.
Photos showing Yusuf Yerkel, an adviser to Erdoğan, kicking a protester held down by Turkish security forces during the visit emerged earlier in the week.
Confirming the photo's authenticity, Yerkel said in a press statement on Thursday that they were sorry "he could not keep their calm in the face of the provocations" in Soma.
Angry crowds
Erdoğan featured in earlier videos of a particular incident in which they are alleged to have slapped a citizen in Soma.
Shaky videos with different angles taken in a chaotic and crowded atmosphere make it difficult to detect the exact circumstances of the incident. However, in the beginning of one of the videos, Erdoğan is seen saying, "Come and boo to my face," while walking among angry crowds who are chanting for their resignation.
Following the mine accident, protests held in various cities [AP]
Then they enter a market shop where the alleged slapping took place.
The Soma man, named Taner Kuruca, talked to the national media after the incident and said Erdoğan did not mean to slap him, calling the action "involuntary". They added that they were not a protester.
They told Turkish media: "I was not one of the protesters. I came face to face with the prime minister. As their bodyguards started to push, the prime minister unfortunately did something involuntarily and slapped me while I was walking backwards, because they were angry at the crowd and they could not control himself."
Protests have taken place in various Turkish cities as the extent of the disaster, with at least 301 deaths, becomes clear. Demonstrations have targeted mine owners, accusing them of ignoring safety standards and Erdoğan's government of being too close to business people and insensitive to the tragedy.
In the days following the accident, police clashed with protesters in Turkey's three biggest cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir as well as other ones.
The Turkish company that owns the mine has defended its safety record and senior Turkish officials have denied allegations of poor government oversight.

WASHINGTON -- The judge in a class action lawsuit against Trump University on Wednesday ordered some records that have been released to be yanked from public view.
Judge releases sales playbooks from Trump University
U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel late Tuesday ordered some released documents to be resealed and resubmitted with sections blacked-out. They said some records had "mistakenly" been released Friday, when they ordered some documents made public.
Trump University is the target of two lawsuits in San Diego and one in New York that accuse the business of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has maintained that customers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the offerings.
North Korea joins the Trump bandwagon
At a rally in San Diego on Friday, they accused the judge of being "hostile" and a "hater of Donald Trump," and raised questions about Curiel's ethnicity.
"The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great, I think that's fine," Trump said of Curiel, who was born in the U.S.
It was the second time Trump has brought up the judge's ethnicity as they complained about their treatment.
Why Trump is blasting the media
Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign leapt on the new details contained in the unsealed documents, including the organization's strategies for encouraging prospective students to dip into their savings or find other means of making payments they couldn't afford.
"Money is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University; if they really believe in you and your product, they will find the money," a playbook reads.
What Trump's hostility toward press could mean for possible presidency
Clinton contends that Trump intends to defraud the American people.
As Trump steamrolled through the GOP primary, some of their rivals raised Trump University as a liability for the business person and at least five different outside groups mentioned the business in attack ads. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio used the school in campaign speeches as part of their failed attempt to blunt the real estate mogul's political rise.

Why is it no big deal that Michael Flynn pled guilty yesterday to a charge of lying to an FBI agent? Conservatives have run several excuses up the ol' flagpole to see if anyone salutes. One tactic is to claim that everyone lies and it's really not a big deal. A related gambit is to ignore the fact that Flynn is obviously being let off the hook because he's cooperating with prosecutors, and pretend that the single charge of lying is all there is to this. Tucker Carlson went all in on this last night:
.@TuckerCarlson: “If investigators can prove that the Trump campaign worked with Vladimir Putin in order to steal the 2016 election, by all means, prosecute…But this? So far it's hard to know exactly how this makes America better.” #Tucker pic.twitter.com/0RJVzLibcN — Fox News (@FoxNews) December 2, 2017
Nothing to see here folks. What's more, according to Carlson, the big problem with special investigations like this is that often “they wind up entrapping people whose only crime is the false testimony they provide during the investigation.” This is close to a perfect description of Ken Starr investigation of Bill Clinton, and conservatives sure didn't feel this way about perjury traps back in 1998. Back then, they thought that lying was a very serious crime indeed. I guess times change.
Another tack is to pretend that Flynn is just a minor functionary. According to the White House, they are a “former Obama official.” What's more, they're now claiming that the Obama administration authorized their talks anyway. It's certainly odd that they felt the need to lie about it, then, isn't it?
Finally, there's the peculiar but oddly Trumpian defense: admit further guilt because you're too dumb to realize what you're doing.
I had to fire General Flynn because they lied to the Vice President and the FBI. They have pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because their actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017
No no no, Mr. President. You didn't know Flynn had lied to the FBI back then! Remember? We've rehearsed this cover story over and over. But I guess it doesn't matter. Trump basically admits to wrongdoing all the time, and somehow it never seems to matter. He's confessed that they never would have appointed Jeff Sessions as Attorney General if he'd known they were going to recuse themselves from the Russia investigation. They confessed on national TV that they fired James Comey because of the Russia investigation. They then admitted the same thing to the Russian ambassador, telling them that they “faced great pressure because of Russia,” but that it was all taken care of now that Comey had been canned.
This is a striking and novel strategy in American politics. I never would have thought of it myself. I guess that's why I'm not president.
laryngectomy is a horrible procedure for the patient. it can adversely affect their quality of life, for the rest of their life and Dr. Scholl believes they can cure me by only removing a small portion.

Interactive Tool For Developing A Cleaner Energy Future
January 10th, 2013 by Guest Contributor
The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has created an energy analysis tool to help individuals and educators experiment with future energy use scenarios. The interactive Buildings, Industry, Transportation, Electricity, and Transportation Scenarios (BITES) allows users to explore how changes in energy demand and supply can impact carbon dioxide emissions and the current U.S. energy trajectory.
“BITES can help people understand the complex issues surrounding the energy and carbon implications of altering America's energy profile,” NREL Senior Analyst Austin Brown said. “By imagining ‘what-if' scenarios, users are able to adjust inputs from things like electricity generation to transportation fuel use in order to compare their outcomes to baseline cases.”
The scenarios used in BITES were originally developed to examine strategic planning opportunities for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. DOE is interested in identifying research priorities where potential technical advances will have the greatest impact in achieving national energy goals. As the scenarios demonstrate, significant technology and policy deployment in every sector is required to meet U.S. climate and energy security goals.
BITES was adapted for the web so anyone can investigate possible pathways for the U.S. energy economy. Users can adjust assumptions to each sector of the U.S. economy in order to evaluate outcomes, or combine these sector-specific strategies into a more complete picture of potential future energy use.
“For instance, someone could calculate how much energy could be saved by making homes and businesses more efficient,” Brown said. “They could also look at how much petroleum could be saved by making cars, trucks, and planes more efficient. And then, the users can put it all together and look at the combined impact of these situations.”
Scenarios created in BITES can be private, or they can be shared with the analysis community for discussion. Educators and students interested in energy and sustainability can use BITES to help teach the combined impacts of research, policy, or other forms of national action in energy. The BITES team has developed and piloted a college level workshop and is seeking interested educators to help further refine the curriculum. Information can be found online at https://bites.nrel.gov/ education.php .
BITES launches with several featured scenarios representing the findings of high-profile studies. One example focuses on the potential for high penetration of renewables in the electric sector based on the recent Renewable Electricity Futures study.
NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. NREL is operated for DOE by The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC.
Chicago White Sox left-hander Chris Sale was activated off the disabled list and will start Thursday night against the New York Yankees.
Sale, an American League All-Star selection the past two years, went on the disabled list April 22 with a left flexor strain. They were 3-0 with a 2.30 ERA in four starts before the injury. The team confirmed their return on Twitter.
"I'm excited," Sale said. "It's been a long time. It's something I've been looking forward to. It's been longer than I expected. I think it was just our taking time and not rushing back before the rehab process [was over], to come back at 100 percent."
Sale threw a bullpen session Tuesday.
"He threw free and easy," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said after monitoring the bullpen session. "It's another step in the right direction. We'll continue to see how they are."
Sale struck out 11 and allowed one hit in four scoreless innings Friday in a minor league rehab start with Triple-A Charlotte.
"It's big," Ventura said of having Sale back. "A guy like him, you get a pretty good feeling that you're going to win. He's proven that. With everything he's gone through, it feels good."
To make room on the major league roster, right-hander Frank Francisco was informed after Wednesday's game at Kansas City that they were being designated for assignment. The veteran reliever, who struggled in four relief appearances with the White Sox, was signed as a minor-league free-agent in April.
To make room in the starting rotation, the White Sox will move right-hander Scott Carroll to the bullpen.

28 January 2013 Iranian Hackers Target US-UK Joint Operations A sends: Source : http://www.rce.ir/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=245#p860 An observer we trust has let us know that in an underground Iranian hacker and reverse engineering forum, one article shows some guys have been up to no good against US-UK Joint Operations and hacked into the Waves as well as the C4I system. Ironically, there is a link and quote from cryptome.us [link added by Cryptome] regarding IRGC's drones flying over US carriers and put both conclusions together in a way that reader, indirectly, understands that military SATCOMS and JTRS terrestrial (say military VHF) are not safe for US-UK and to our understanding they could easily use these capabilities to grab scores from catastrophic events. The fact Iran is still talking to 5+1 in addition to these efforts, to the best of our analysis, are Iranian Deterrence.
After their win over Drake and Arcade Fire for Canada's Polaris Music Prize and subsequent collaboration with Björk, Tanya Tagaq is one of the world's most renowned throat-singers and First Nations advocates. Tagaq teams up with fellow Winterreise Nights curator Jeffrey Zeigler and a cast of other all-star musicians to perform the captivating live scoring of We Breathe Again.
The film's soundtrack is composed by no other than Paola Prestini, composer and Artistic Director of National Sawdust. Prestini is hailed for their “ability to evoke sheer vastness” (LA Times) while “pushing the boundaries of classical music” (Wall Street Journal), and pours their talents into a sweeping score, evoking drama, suffering, and ultimately, hope.
We Breathe Again is a film exploring the lives of five Alaska Natives and working to overcome the impacts of inter-generational trauma and suicide and recently premiered on PBS's “America Reframed.”
Music will be led by Inuk vocalist Tanya Tagaq, and will also include cello, guitar, vocals, violin, piano, and percussions, performed by Jeffrey Zeigler, Cornelius Dufallo, David Cossin, Gyan Riley, and Paola Prestini.
The film is written by the team of Marsh Chamberlain, Evon Peter, Enei Begaye Peter, and Ryan Jacobi.
Kim Dotcom, the founder of Megaupload, recently appeared on the RT network's Keiser Report to discuss the progress of their bitcoin-powered service Bitcache and the launch of Megaupload 2.0 (MU2).
During the interview, Dotcom explained that each file transfer encrypted by a third party service provider will be linked to a bitcoin microtransaction that will operate as the core component of its cloud-based affiliate program.
In traditional media and advertising markets, an affiliate program means a system where individuals are incentivised with a referral fee or commission when a customer visits a particular web resource. Within the MU2 network, Dotcom's affiliate program may enable content providers that drive direct traffic to the Megaupload platform to be incentivised through bitcoin micropayments.
Each time the cloud-based content is viewed on the Megaupload platform, the network may transfer a very small fraction of payment to the content provider that drove traffic to its affiliate program. As more users or customers continue to view and click the affiliate link, the content provider will receive more micropayments as a reward.
“On top of that, we'll have a solution called Bitcache where every file transfer is linked to a microscopic bitcoin transaction. So, we're utilizing the blockchain, utilizing this new digital currency and linking it to every file transfer kind of like an affiliate program and the combination of those two things will break new ground,” explained Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom.
Considering that Bitcache will be integrated into the new Megaupload cloud storage service as its core component, the MU2 development team will most likely utilise the bitcoin micropayment system as the basis of an affiliate program that will essentially link each file transfer to a transaction broadcasted on a public ledger.
However, Dotcom still has failed to specify how Bitcache could overcome the scaling limitations of the bitcoin network and its other technical restrictions to be able to handle an unlimited number of micropayments and transactions.

On this weekend's broadcast of “Fox New Sunday,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward said the unverified dossier about President-elect Donald Trump and Russia is a “garbage document.”
Woodward said, “I think what is underreported here is Trump's point of view on it. You laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that they were a recruited agent of the Russians, and a useful fool, they started this in Trump's mind, They know the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. No one came out and said those people shouldn't be saying those things, So act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out.”
“I've lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations, that is a garbage document,” they continued. “It never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump's incoming White House counsel. So Trump's right to be upset about that. I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we had, who are terrific and have done great work. I think they made a mistake here. And when people mistakes, they should apologize.”

William James Remar (born December 31, 1953) is an American actor and voice artist. They played Richard, the on-off tycoon boyfriend of Kim Cattrall's character in Sex and the City, Ajax in The Warriors (1979),[1] maniac Albert Ganz in the thriller 48 Hrs. (1982), gangster Dutch Schultz in The Cotton Club (1984), Lord Raiden in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997), Jack Duff in Miracle on 34th Street (1994) and Harry Morgan in the Showtime series Dexter. Since 2009, they have done voice-over work in ads for Lexus luxury cars.[2] Remar studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City.
Early life [ edit ]
Remar was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Elizabeth Mary, a mental health state official originally from West Kirby, England, and S. Roy Remar, an attorney. Their paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants (the family name was originally "Remarman").[citation needed]
Career [ edit ]
Films [ edit ]
Remar has spent the majority of their film career playing villains. They portrayed the violent and sexually aggressive character Ajax in the cult film The Warriors (1979), and the murdering sociopath Albert Ganz in the hit 48 Hrs. (1982). (Both films were directed by Walter Hill and co-starred David Patrick Kelly, whose character is named Luther in both). Remar also played real-life 1930s-era gangster Dutch Schultz in The Cotton Club (1984).
In contrast to these roles, Remar starred in the film Windwalker (1980) as the young Cheyenne Windwalker, for which they spoke their lines in the Cheyenne language. They also portrayed a gay man in the film Cruising (1980). That same year, Remar had a cameo in the Western The Long Riders (1980) in a bar fight scene with David Carradine.
They were the star of the 1986 film Quiet Cool (1986) and was cast as Corporal Hicks in the science-fiction/horror film Aliens (1986), but was replaced by Michael Biehn shortly after filming began, due to Remar's drug problem. For several years, the reason behind their dismissal was reported as "creative differences" with director James Cameron.[3] At least one piece of footage featuring Remar made it into the final version of the film: when the Marines enter the processing station, and the camera tilts down from the Alien nest, though Remar is not seen in close-up.[4]  They are also filmed from the back as the Marines first enter the compound on LV-426 and when "Hicks" approaches the cocooned woman, again filmed from the rear so the viewer is unable to tell it is Remar and not Michael Biehn.[citation needed]
They played Quill, one of the main villains in The Phantom (1996). They appeared in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997), the sequel to the film Mortal Kombat (1995), taking over the role of Raiden from Christopher Lambert. They then followed this with a role in the direct-to-video science fiction movie Robo Warriors (1996). Other films include Psycho (1998), in which they played the patrolman, Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), Wedlock (1991), Boys on the Side (1995), The Quest (1996), Rites of Passage (1999), Hellraiser: Inferno (2000), 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), Fear X (2003), Blade: Trinity (2004), The Girl Next Door (2004). They played a brief role as General Bratt in the prologue of Pineapple Express (2008). They also had a role in the horror movie The Unborn (2009), alongside C.S. Lee, who portrays Vince Masuka in Dexter.
Remar was featured in the film X-Men: First Class (2011) and voiced the Autobot Sideswipe in the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), replacing André Sogliuzzo. They were also cast in the heist film Setup (2011) and starred in the film Arena (2011).
Remar played two different, unrelated characters in Quentin Tarantino's film Django Unchained (2012):[5] Ace Speck and Butch Pooch. They starred, alongside Emma Roberts, Lucy Boynton, and Lauren Holly, in the thriller film The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015).[6]
Television [ edit ]
Remar's television appearances include the series Miami Vice, Hill Street Blues, Sex and the City (as the on-again, off-again boyfriend of Kim Cattrall's character), Tales from the Crypt, Jericho, Third Watch, Justice League Unlimited, and Battlestar Galactica. They also appeared as a possessed mental patient in The X-Files ninth-season episode "Daemonicus". They starred as Tiny Bellows on the short-lived television series The Huntress (2000–2001). They appeared in the miniseries The Grid (2004) as Hudson "Hud", the love interest of Julianna Margulies' character. They had a recurring guest role in the 2006 television series Jericho on CBS. Remar guest-starred in the CBS crime drama Numbers, playing a weapons dealer who later turns good and helps the FBI.
From 2006 to 2013, Remar co-starred in Dexter on Showtime. They were nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for their portrayal of Dexter Morgan's adoptive father, Harry Morgan.[7]
In 2010, they played guest roles as Giuseppe Salvatore in The CW series The Vampire Diaries[8] and as James Ermine, a general for Jericho, a black-ops military contractor, on FlashForward.
They also voiced Vilgax in the animated television series Ben 10: Alien Force and Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, replacing Steve Blum. They guest-starred in Private Practice in 2010, playing a physician named Gibby, who works with Doctors Without Borders.[9] On July 23, 2017, Remar was cast as Peter Gambi on the superhero drama Black Lightning.[10]

Score it a perfect 10 for CBS. The network said today it had all 10 of the most-watched shows on TV for the week ended February 14 — a first for any network in the Live+Same Day era that began in late 2005. The sweep included drama, comedy and news programs spread over six nights.
CBS won in viewers (9.4M), adults 18-49 (1.6 ratings) and adults 25-54 (2.3) for the second consecutive week, according to Nielsen. Its top 10 broadcasts were led by Tuesday's NCIS (16.9 million total viewers), Thursday's The Big Bang Theory (16.25M) and Saturday's GOP debate (13.4M). Its Republican faceoff drew more viewers than any other debate this election season. The network's table run also included NCIS: New Orleans, Scorpion, Blue Bloods, 60 Minutes, Madam Secretary NCIS: Los Angeles and Life in Pieces.
It was a cool evening in Ottawa on May 29. The weather, however did nothing to cool the fury of a white supremacist hate rock concert held that evening in the downtown area.
RAHOWA, or “Racial Holy War” banged out a set of racist, anti-semitic hard rock sounds that whipped the crowd of a couple hundred, mostly young skinheads and Nazi wannabees, into a frenzy.
They heard racist lyrics like: “These boots are made for stompin; and that's just what they'll do; and one of these days these boots are going to stomp all over Jews.” They sang using the “N” word: ” N—r, N—r, N—r, OUT OUT OUT.” The young thugs were primed for action.
Following the concert, lead singer George Burdi, the youth leader of the white supremacists, and its adult mentor, longtime neo-Nazi Wolfgang Droege, led their followers out on to the Ottawa streets, towards Parliament Hill. It was no surprise that many counter demonstrators, mostly young people from Anti-Racist Action (ARA) and “Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP)” confronted them.
Related
The white supremacists chanted “Sieg Heil” and gave Nazi salutes. This was the tinder needed: It turned into a full-fledged riot in the shadow of the Peace Tower. Burdi and Droege charged at the counter demonstrators. People were injured. Burdi was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. It was the largest most violent neo-Nazi riot in modern Canadian history.
This sounds very reminiscent of a similar riot last weekend in Charlottesville Va, where a couple hundred white supremacists confronted counter demonstrators. Here, too, there was violence. Sadly one young woman, Heather Heyer, there to express their opposition to the Nazis, was killed when a car slammed into the anti-Nazi marchers.
The difference is that the Ottawa riot occurred on May 29, 1993.
I have spent the last week responding to media inquiries about the “emergence of white supremacy” in the United States and Canada, as if this were a unique phenomenon. Far from it. What we witnessed last week in Charlottesville had its precedents 17 years earlier in our own nation's capital.
In fact, since the end of the Second World War, there have always been peaks and valleys of white supremacist activity in Canada. Immediately after the war, the fresh evil of Nazism silenced its growth for a short period of time.
However, by the mid 1960s, white supremacy made a small but important return. John William Beattie and David Stanley became leaders of what they called the “Canadian Nazi Party.” Their numbers were infinitesimal but their impact was devastating. A short publicized appearance by Beattie, Stanley and less than a dozen followers wearing Nazi uniforms in Toronto's Allen Gardens erupted in a counter demonstration led by Jewish Holocaust survivors, trade unionists and hundreds of others. The Nazis had to be led away by police. That movement withered and died.
There were minor eruptions of white supremacy in the years that followed but it really wasn't until the hateful antics of anti-semitic school teacher James Keegstra and the recently deceased Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel in the mid-1980s that we saw a real peak here again in Canada.
Zundel and Keegstra helped spawn the new look of neo-Nazism in a group calling itself the “Heritage Front,” possibly the most successful fascist grouping since before the Second World War. It in fact took the combined efforts of CSIS, police and anti-racists to finally shut down the Heritage Front.
The lesson for us is that hate can be muscular. Unlike this week's disgusting words from U.S. President Donald Trump that seemed to defend the Nazi rioters, government leaders must speak out forcefully against hatred. It was only nine months ago, in November 2016, that white supremacist hatred made an unwelcome return to Ottawa with a spate of incidents in which a youthful offender, clearly motivated by white supremacist ideology, scrawled cruel and hateful slogans on synagogues, churches and mosques.
But here is the good news: Ottawans – from government and faith leaders to ordinary citizens – reacted with their own expressions of solidarity and love for the victims. Today we see the same across Canada and the United States. White supremacy may be back but decent folk from all walks of life are speaking out.
Peaceful but passionate responses against hate are, in the end, the real and only antidote to ensuring that hateful white supremacy is once again eliminated – at least until next time.

Brexit has signed India's equity markets.
Even before the final numbers were out, India's benchmark Sensex index opened over 700 points or 2.85% lower at 9:20 AM local time. When the trading ended for the day at 3:30 PM, the Sensex closed at 605 points lower, marking a decent recovery.
Screenshot/BSE
Voters in the UK have decided to leave the European Union by a margin of 52% to 45% (“Leave” versus “Remain” votes.)
As Quartz wrote yesterday, the Sensex fall could be a knee-jerk reaction to global markets. Nevertheless, emerging markets including India, saw a sell-off from investors who are hedging global losses.
The Indian currency was under pressure, too, after the British pound fell more than 10% against the US dollar—lowest since the 1980s. In morning trade, the rupee fell to 68.22 a dollar, the lowest level since March 1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is monitoring the currency movement to keep volatility in check.
The FTSE 100—UK's main stock index—was trading at 4.67% at 11:24 AM GMT, lower than its close on Thursday.
Here's how the day unfolded:
11:00 AM IST: Oil prices have plummeted 6%, from $50.9 a barrel on June 23 to $47.54.
In India, shares of steel-maker Tata Steel fell 8.22%. The firm, UK's biggest steel producer, could see its operations take a hit following Brexit, the Financial Times reported. It is in the process of finding a buyer for its UK operations and may have to now re-strategise.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors's shares are down 55.6 points—11.6% lower—than their previous close. The company owns Jaguar-Land Rover, Britain's largest carmaker, and Brexit means an increase in taxes and duties that will make its cars less competitive to other luxury models from BMW or Mercedes.
11:40 AM IST: India's central bank governor Raghuram Rajan said that the RBI is “prepared for any eventuality” after the Britain voted for Brexit.
Speaking to ET Now, a television channel, Rajan added: “There are concerns from Brexit referendum, see no immediate dire impact on Britain..Have been in touch with Central Banks across the world on Brexit…We are watching all markets both internationally and domestically, where necessary will provide liquidity.”
Rajan also said that Indian companies that are invested in the UK will have to “figure out what its' market is and how best to access it.” “Immediately, the attractiveness to invest in the UK will be a little more limited,” Rajan said.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said that India is prepared to deal with the Brexit volatility. “Our immediate and medium-term firewalls are solid too in the form of a healthy reserve position,” Jaitley said in a statement.
12:30 PM IST: Investors in Indian stocks have lost some Rs4 lakh crore ($58.8 billion) due to the bloodbath in equity markets following Brexit. All the 30 stocks comprising the Sensex index were dropping. Meanwhile, the rupee continues to fall. The British pound lost 11%, strengthening the the US dollar.
1:05 PM IST: David Cameron, prime minister of UK, announced their resignation, saying the UK needed “fresh leadership.” The Sensex saw a negligible recovery and was trading at 836 points lower. Meanwhile, in London, the FTSE 100 index opened 7% lower. The fall has erased £122 billion of stock value in the FTSE.
2:30 PM IST: India's benchmark Sensex index recovered from early losses. It was trading 735 points lower, after losing more than 1000 points in the morning. The rupee recovered too from Rs68.22 a dollar and was trading at Rs67.91.
Meanwhile, JLR has said that “Nothing will change” for them and the auto industry overnight, with Brexit. Shares of Tata Motors, JLR's parent company were trading 8.56% lower.
In other news, Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's chief minister tweeted that a referendum seeking full statehood for India's capital may be on its way.
3:45 PM IST: The Sensex recovered from the day's lows, finally ending at 26,397.71 points, a drop of 2.24%. Analysts say that while Brexit is a cause of concern for India, other macro indicators are currently positive.
“In India, while Brexit is expected to cause a slowing of growth, economic prospects remain relatively sanguine due to the impact of local factors like a strong monsoon, the impact of pay hikes and higher public capex,” a report by Nomura said.
Some think the fall in the equity market could be a buying opportunity for investors.
“To our minds, the reaction in the global markets to the UK referendum is an exaggerated one. Any reaction of this sort presents a buying opportunity,” Rajeev Shastri, managing director and CEO of Peerless Fund Management, said in an emailed note. “This is especially true for India, since almost every factual development after the vote presents a benefit, whether it's lower oil prices or a slower increase in US interest rates.”
Kenny Vaccaro interception, Jacksonville jaguars @ New Orleans Saints 2015

New Orleans Saints safety Kenny Vaccaro will play Sunday against the Denver Broncos, but they don't know when he'll officially hear about the status of their pending four-game suspension.
And after what happened Thursday, it's clear Vaccaro and coach Sean Payton are frustrated with the process of how they learned of the punishment, which is related to a positive test for the performance-enhancing drug Adderall.
Medical administrators appointed jointly by the NFL and NFL Players Association perform the drug tests. The league does not receive notification of a suspension until a player has a positive B sample.
"The league has not been notified of a violation by the program administrators," NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said Friday.
Yet, on Thursday, the NFL Network reported Vaccaro's pending suspension prior to the testing of the second sample.
Payton said Friday they didn't know the suspension was coming before the report, which is line with a Pro Football Talk report Thursday. Vaccaro said he'd received a notification, but didn't know the punishment was definitely coming before the report, though a second sample could potentially clear him.
"We got a letter, but that's just a preliminary letter that it could be a possible something," Vaccaro said. "But, there have been mistakes before."
Vaccaro and the Saints are still awaiting the results of a second sample.
"Well, you guys will probably hear before me," Payton said. "You did yesterday."
[enhanced link]Vaccaro said their B sample has yet to be tested, and for now, it's unclear when he'll receive an update about the suspension.
"We're waiting just like you guys are," Payton said.
Vaccaro started at least 14 games in each of their first three seasons, and they started seven of the Saints' first eight games this year.
Vaccaro declined comment Friday when asked if they ingested Adderall, but obviously, missing four games would be a blow to the Saints defense.
"It would be frustrating because we're on a run," Vaccaro said. "We've won four out of the last five ... but at the same time, it is what it is and we're working it out right now."
BALTIMORE – Jake Arrieta didn't throw a baseball while relaxing at home in Austin, Texas, during an All-Star break the Cubs absolutely needed.
Walking the streets of Baltimore this weekend triggered memories, seeing where they used to live (when they aren't getting shuttled back to Triple-A), eating at one of their favorite restaurants, interacting with old Orioles teammates and appreciating the classic look and feel of Camden Yards.
Jose Quintana arriving here on Friday pointed to the Cubs filling a big hole in their 2018, 2019 and 2020 rotations and moving in another direction once Arrieta becomes a free agent after this season.
All these forces – decompressing from an all-consuming game, reminders of the struggling pitcher a Cy Young Award winner used to be and the dominos falling from the Quintana trade with the White Sox – made it seem like a good time to think about Arrieta's future and how this could be their last chance to make history (again) with the Cubs.
“If I have to leave, I don't want to leave without another ring,” Arrieta said after Saturday night's 10-3 win set Quintana up for the sweep on Sunday afternoon.
The Cubs have scored 19 runs in their first two games after the All-Star break, but any sustained momentum will revolve around starting pitching. Arrieta kept an American League lineup off-balance for 6.2 innings in a steamy, hitter-friendly park, mixing in their cutter and changeup while limiting the Orioles to two runs (one earned) in the kind of controlled, efficient performance the Cubs desperately need if they are going to break out of their 45-45 pattern and make up those 5.5 games against the Milwaukee Brewers and Colorado Rockies in the division and wild-card races.
It doesn't even have to be the Bob Gibson/Sandy Koufax/Dwight Gooden/Randy Johnson-esque push that catapulted the 2015 Cubs and transformed the franchise's identity. It won't be Max Scherzer money. But super-agent Scott Boras will get Arrieta paid for their raw stuff, durability, big-game performances and good clubhouse reputation.
“I would love to stay,” Arrieta said. “That would be cool. But if it doesn't work out, that's the nature of professional sports.
“We're all on the same page here. Regardless of how we played the first half, that's the end goal – to get back to the playoffs and then just have the chance to roll the dice and see what happens in October. And hopefully we get to play in November.”
Arrieta (9-7, 4.17 ERA) is starting to look more and more like the guy who beat the Cleveland Indians twice on the road during last year's World Series. The thing is, Arrieta always thought they were The Man, even when they couldn't stick in Baltimore.
“I joke with my friends,” Arrieta said. “I kind of tell them how I think I'm going to finish the second half. I don't know if I'll verbalize that to you guys, but I'm very confident.
“We didn't perform the way we would like – all the way around – (in the first half). We expect better things from ourselves as a team overall. That's the competitive nature of all these guys in this clubhouse. We want to get back to where we were last year. We want to get to the playoffs and have a shot to play into November again. It's still within reach.”

A New York City ride-share passenger was sickened to discover that Uber charged them $200 in addition to the fare in order to clean up vomit that they supposedly spewed over the car.
But Meredith Mandel told Gothamist that when they and their companions reached their destination in Williamsburg shortly before 1:30 a.m., they left the Uber vehicle without even a belch, much fewer puddles of puke.
When they saw the PayPal charge — $19 plus the $200 cleaning fee — for the two-mile trip, they naturally are outraged.
They contested the bill, and Uber responded by emailing photos of the "vomit" taken by the driver and explaining that "the driver let us know that there was a mess on the trip resulting in the need for a car cleaning." Uber says 100 percent of the cleaning charges in such cases go to the driver.
Mandel's driver told Uber that the party was drunk, they said.
"I was infuriated, because I realized that it actually is a scam," they told The Gothamist.
They said inspection of the photos backs their claim:
— Some of the alleged barf appeared to be in the front seat area. Mandel said they and their two companions rode in the back.
— All the vomit conveniently landed on easily washed plastic surfaces, mainly floor mats, the plastic of the dashboard and a driver's-side door.
— No metadata showing time or date was included with the photos.
— Neither they nor their friends were drunk.
Uber passenger says they were charged $200 after 'cabbie created fake vomit pictures' https://t.co/gEWDXodjKG — Tenfingerz (@iGODWINi) March 3, 2016
Taking "CSI-Uber" one step farther, they even noted that the bright yellow color of the chunky liquid didn't match the meals the group had consumed at dinner.
"We ate really dark food, like meat," they said.
There have been at least four other cases reported nationwide of drivers allegedly staging messes in order to pocket bogus cleaning charges.
After Mandel filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, Uber refunded them the $200.
But they say they won't use Uber again — the whole experience left a bad taste in their mouth.
A representative from Uber says a refund was issued in accordance with company policy and that the incident was not indicative of a trend.

Scandal rocked the art world today when it was revealed that a five-course dinner of rat meat served at a Lower East Side gallery was not locally-sourced. High-toned guests paid $100 to feast on rat at a dinner intended to explore the "post-apocalyptic themes of urban survival." Artist Laura Ginn, who says she's spent the last several years "developing an ad-hoc crash course in self-reliance," served the dinner with the help of Chef Yuri Hart. They raised over $2,000 on Kickstarter for the event, and hosted it wearing a dress made entirely of two hundred rat pelts they tanned and sewed together herself.
Judging by the NY Observer's report, it seems like a delightful evening:
The first course consisted of a goat cheese crostini overlain with a small piece of rat meat and a shot glass of (rat-free) gazpacho. Diners at our end of the table noted that the goat cheese mostly overwhelmed the rat, but we found the flavor and texture reminiscent of lamb. Next came two circles of rat and pork terrine over a deconstructed salad containing cherries, greens, pickled carrots and Mexican sour gherkins (also known as mouse melons—clever menu planning). Though oily (hardly a criticism, it's a terrine for god's sake), it was salty and delicious. “Rat Two Ways” was the main course. Reminiscent of rabbit, a pile of braised rat was so tender it fell apart as soon as our fork touched it.
But was the carbon footprint of all that succulent meat worth it, just so a handful of decadent art aficionados could enjoy an ironic "post-apocalyptic hunter-gatherer feast"? DNAinfo reports that the 75 rats used to prepare the feast were not hunted and gathered on the Lower East Side, but rather sourced from a "clean and safe facility" on the West Coast and bred to be eaten. We look forward to an apocalyptic culinary landscape where organic, grass-fed, humanely-slaughtered rat meat abounds! And by that point, we guess the carbon footpring won't matter.
To be honest, we're a little upset we didn't catch wind of this until after the fact—we would have purchased carbon offset credits to assuage our pre-apocalyptic guilt just to try the dessert, which the Observer describes as "the most dramatic plating of the evening, an entire crispy rat head sat on each plate, mouth open and teeth jutting forward, and a back leg sat atop the French toast, toes and claws clearly visible." Fellas, we're thinking the same thing: Is Ginn single?
For more on the big $100-a-plate rat dinner, here's a video of Ginn explaining the project:

Based on a leaked CIA file, THE COUP is a short film that tells the darkly comic true story of what happened when Britain and America tried to oust the prime minister of Iran...
LeilI Farzaneh (writer and director): I am half Iranian, half British, and love both nations dearly. And yet for decades they have seemed to veer between grudging allies at best and sworn enemies at worst. I've always wondered why.
I had heard various conspiracy theories about Britain and America sending secret agents to meddle in Iran's politics. But when I decided to look into what really happened, I found a tale that was stranger than any conspiracy theory.
I found a classified CIA file (that had been leaked to the New York Times), which documented a brazen plot to overthrow the prime minister of Iran in 1953.
It was a plot that had been conceived by the British, but was executed mostly by the Americans. Its target was prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh - who had angered the British by trying to take Iran's oil back from their control.
What's also striking about the coup is that the agents on the ground tasked with the job certainly weren't dashing James Bond types - in fact, the document reveals that they were actually hilariously amateur in their approach, bribing the King's sister with a fur coat, paying a rabble of moustachioed strong men to take to the streets and bungling the whole thing on their first attempt.
Eventually they succeeded. Iran lost a prime minister who dreamed of 'Iranian oil for the Iranians', while Britain and America secured their access to lucrative Iranian oil for decades to come.
The coup may have unfolded over 50 years ago, but its story is more relevant than ever today.
Now, with your help, I want to bring this story to life on film, and give audiences a glimpse of just how many western powers have meddled, schemed and plotted to control the Middle East - not for just for ideology, but also for much more earthly gains, like oil.
Most importantly, it's a story that shows what Western government agencies can get up to under the shroud of secrecy. This isn't the slick world of spy thrillers. This is a world where secret agents make mistakes, money is generously applied to get people to bend to their will, and organising sham bombings, recruiting mobs, and even getting the BBC to advance their underhand schemes is all in a day's work.
This is the darkly comic tale of what coup-making looked like when the CIA was still in its infancy. One can only imagine what happens today...
Bookended by more traditional documentary sequences to establish the history and consequences of the coup, the heart of our story will be an imagined interview with Donald Wilber - principal CIA architect of the coup and author of the leaked CIA account. Donald will be played by an actor, but every word they utter will be drawn verbatim from the document that they wrote.
As the interview unfolds, they will slip out of vision but continue to narrate as we break out into dramatised sequences of the events they recount. We will be transported back to 1950s Tehran, where the visuals will become playful vignettes, capturing key moments of the caper-like plot as it is put together.
WRITER & DIRECTOR: LEILI FARZANEH
When QI creator John Lloyd was asked to lay out their programme's manifesto in The Idler, they began with this directive: "Everything is interesting. Allow yourselves the luxury of looking clearly and patiently at anything – a turnip, the history of Chelmsford, a letter from an insurance company – and new layers of detail come into focus." With the show now in its tenth series, that luxury is still enjoyed by a very healthy audience: four million viewers watched the first episode of this series, if you combine the figures for QI and its extended repeat QI XL. So what keeps us tuning in?
It was 2003 when everyone's favourite principal, Stephen Fry, introduced the first edition of the show, entitled Adam. Now we've reached the letter J. Fry has been joined over the years by regular team captain Alan Davies and a revolving panel of funny, intellectually adventurous guests such as Dara O'Briain, Bill Bailey, Jo Brand and David Mitchell. They talk around subjects rather than trying to score a direct hit with the right answer.
And, while other long-running series have started to look a bit knackered, QI still manages to surprise, as a guest pops up with an unpredictably deep knowledge of a pet subject. I loved Ben Miller waxing lyrical about quantum physics – they wouldn't be allowed to do that on The One Show.
After all this time, QI also still has the power to tick, with a flourish, at least two of Lord Reith's dusty old boxes: entertaining and informing by the barrow-load. Last week the show even seemed to address the constant criticism that women are under-represented on panel shows by including a record three female guests in Sue Perkins, Jo Brand and the exquisite Liza Tarbuck. Incredibly, the sky didn't fall in. And it was really funny. The producers plan to keep the supply of funny women coming in future episodes too.
Rather than working like a straightforward panel show, QI gives participants the chance to freely associate, to chatter and to toss their idea-tomatoes around in the collective salad bowl. Points are awarded for intriguing segues rather than straight answers. And that's the key to its success. You feel like you're at the pub with the funny, clever people, ear-wigging on their slightly tipsy meanderings, rather than standing against a wall while they fire their joke cannons at you. It draws you in, all that familiarity and casual pontification.
The badinage doesn't ever degenerate into combative cock-fighting as it sometimes seems to on shows such as Mock the Week. The panelists tease and rib – with particular focus on Alan Davies who always gets the most demeaning sound for their quick-fire buzzer – but it's camaraderie and intellectual kinship that parps warmly into our living rooms from QI, not the chill, stale gas of more aggressive offerings.
TV peers such as Never Mind the Buzzcocks might have their moments, but there aren't many panel shows on TV where comedians competing for screen time seem so happy to let each other speak. In fact the only recent show to equal QI's all-round pleasantness was Channel 4's Paralympics companion, The Last Leg with Adam Hills, which also hit just the right balance of cordiality and inter-comedian goading.
Meanwhile QI is one of the last truly popular programmes on mainstream television where comedians are allowed to be clever or even vaguely cerebral without being ghettoised into some late-night shame-slot on BBC4.
True, not everyone wants to listen to thoughtful, articulate people demonstrating their skills. Some might see them as smug showoffs who should keep their big brains and large vocabularies to themselves. But thank goodness for series J of QI. The BBC will be failing in its duty if it doesn't let them get all the way to Z.
PARIS (AP) — France and Germany formed a united front Saturday in the face of President Donald Trump's halt in the U.S. refugee program, with the German foreign minister noting that loving thy neighbor forms part of America's Christian traditions.
After meeting Saturday, the foreign ministers of both nations, Jean-Marc Ayrault and Germany's Sigmar Gabriel, said they want to meet with Rex Tillerson, Trump's nominee for secretary of state who is still awaiting confirmation.
Ayrault said Trump's order on Friday that bars all refugees from entering the United States for four months — and those from war-ravaged Syria indefinitely — “can only worry us.”
“We have signed international obligations, so welcoming refugees fleeing war and oppression forms part of our duties,” the French minister said.
“There are many other issues that worry us,” they added. “That is why Sigmar and I also discussed what we are going to do. When our colleague, Tillerson, is officially appointed, we will both contact him.”
Gabriel — on their first trip abroad since their appointment Friday — said offering refuge to the persecuted and those fleeing death are western values that Europe and the United States share.
“Love thy neighbor is part of this tradition, the act of helping others,” they said. “This unites us, we Westerners. And I think that this remains a common foundation that we share with the United States, one we aim to promote.”
Trump declared the ban necessary to prevent “radical Islamic terrorists” from entering the United States.
The order immediately suspended a program that last year resettled to the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice.
The Ohio State Buckeyes added another strong win to their repertoire last week with a win over the Wisconsin Badgers. The Buckeyes overcame a 10 point deficit at halftime to win in overtime 30-23. Penn State is currently 4-2 this season with a blowout loss to No. 3 Michigan and a close loss to the Pittsburgh Panthers. The Nittany Lions will be looking to wrap up their three game home stretch with their third consecutive win after beating Minnesota and Maryland in the weeks before. Ohio State and Penn State will both look to extend their winning streaks.
What to Watch: Ohio State at Penn State
J.T. Barrett vs Penn State Secondary
Junior quarterback J.T. Barrett has had a Heisman caliber season so far. Barrett has accounted for 1,641 total yards this season with 22 touchdowns. After trailing 16-6 to the Badgers last week, Barrett was 11-15 for 145 yards and a touchdown. Barrett will likely look to continue to target Curtis Samuel who caught six passes for 58 yards against Wisconsin.
Despite Penn State having a solid season so far, the only area they have truly excelled at a national level at is their pass defense. The Nittany Lions currently allow the 12th fewest passing yards and have only allowed six passing touchdowns this season. The senior safety Malik Golden has been one of the best in their secondary, intercepting one pass this season while breaking up three, and deflecting four more.
Trace McSorley vs Ohio State Secondary
Sophomore quarterback Trace McSorley has been strong so far this season. McSorley has accounted for 641 yards and five touchdowns in the last two contests with no turnovers. If Penn State wants to keep up with the electric Ohio State offense, McSorley will have to keep the ball out of the hands of the Ohio State secondary. To do this, Penn State may want to continue to use tight end Mike Gesicki. Gesicki has caught 14 passes in the last three games and has been the perfect check down target for McSorley.
The Ohio State secondary consisting of Malik Hooker, Gareon Conley and Marshon Lattimore have been able to intercept 11 passes this season, ranking them 5th in the country. The young Buckeye secondary has been able to have a lot more success than most people expected. Of their starting four corner backs and safeties, only two are upperclassmen.
Saquon Barkley vs Ohio State Front Seven
Sophomore running back Saquon Barkley has either shined or disappeared in every game this season. Barkley has broken 100 yards twice this season with a 202 yard performance last week against Maryland. Penn State has begun to utilize them more heavily the last three weeks where they have not had less than 15 carries in any performance. Last season, Barkley also had a breakout week against Ohio State with 194 yards on 26 carries. Head Coach Urban Meyer will look to shut them down this year.
For the Buckeyes, their rush defense has dropped the past few weeks. The Buckeyes now give up the 20th least amount of rushing yards after giving up 78 to Devine Redding and 164 to Corey Clement. While the Buckeyes have been giving up more rushing yards than normal, they have still held backs out of the endzone. Ohio State has only allowed one rushing touchdown all season which came in the middle of the fourth quarter last week. Ohio State prides themselves on strong defense and will look to shut down Saquon Barkley this week.
Overall
This is a game that the Buckeyes should win. It is not an easy task to go into Beaver Stadium however so Ohio State fans should not expect a blowout. If the Ohio State defense can keep the Nittany Lion offense stagnant, Urban Meyer should be able to extend their road winning streak to 21 games.

Besides struggling to make ends meet because of low wages, millions of part-time workers in America also face uncertainty over when they will be called in to work. Irregular schedules and last-minute notice make it hard for these workers to find other work, go to school and make arrangements for child care or caring for aging parents.
As The New York Times reported last week:
About 27.4 million Americans work part time. The number of those part-timers who would prefer to work full time has nearly doubled since 2007, to 7.5 million. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, 47 percent of part-time hourly workers ages 26 to 32 receive a week or less of advance notice for their schedule. In a study of the data, two University of Chicago professors found that employers dictated the work schedules for about half of young adults, without their input. For part-time workers, schedules on average fluctuated from 17 to 28 hours a week. “Frontline managers face pressure to keep costs down, but they really don't have much control over wages or benefits,” said Susan J. Lambert, a University of Chicago professor who interpreted the data. “What they have control over is employee hours.”
According to the National Women's Law Center, food service workers experience a 70 percent average variation of work hours every month. For retail workers, the variation is 50 percent and for janitors and housekeepers, it's 40 percent.
Lawmakers across the country are beginning to notice how irregular schedules complicate the lives of part-time workers, and are taking measures to address the problem. Employees of federal agencies now have the right to request work schedule flexibilities. Workers in San Francisco and Vermont can ask for a more flexible or predictable work schedule. In a report released in June, New York City comptroller Scott M. Stringer made a case for a legislation that would give employees the chance to make such requests “without fear of reprisal.”
Congress is swinging into action on this issue as well. On Tuesday, Representatives George Miller and Rosa DeLauro introduced the Schedules That Work Act. Miller admits that the bill may meet with opposition, but thinks that it will highlight “often callous scheduling practices.”
The Guardian reports that another version of the bill is brewing in the Senate:
Senators Tom Harkin and Elizabeth Warren are co-sponsoring of the Senate's version of the bill. Carrie Gleason, co-founder of Retail Action Project, said [that] Warren will introduce the Senate version in upcoming weeks. A single mom working two jobs should know if their hours are being canceled before they arrange for daycare and drives halfway across town to show up at work,” said Warren. “This is about some basic fairness in work scheduling so that both employees and employers have more certainty and can get the job done.”
Although some businesses are saying the bills would represent government overreach, the clothing store Zara has already promised to start giving its part-time employees two weeks notice on their work schedules.
"American hops also have a characteristic aroma while they possess a high preservative value and impart a rather stronger flavour to the beers. Very few of these hops are used in the mild flavoured beers brewed in the South of England, but most of the brewers in the North and in Scotland use a small proportion, the annual consumption in Great Britain being 20,000 to 30,000 cwt.
An endeavour has been made at Wye College under the direction of Prof. Salmon to produce new varieties of hops having the same characteristics of American hops which could be grown in this country, the idea being, that they could replace imported hops and give the English grower the benefit of the increased output. Up to the present over 500 of these new varieties have been grown up at East Malling Research Station and a large number have been subjected to brewing trials. From the results obtained at least five have been selected as suitable for replacing American hops. These have been named by Prof. Salmon as follows:— Early Promise (X.35), Brewers Favourite (O.P.21), Brewers Gold (C.9a), Bullion Hop (0063), and Fill Pocket (Z.62), and already several of these are being grown on a commercial scale. Growers, however, have been discouraged in their efforts to grow these hops partly by the very low values placed on them by the Hops Marketing Board and partly by the disinclination of the brewers to buy them."
Journal of the Institute of Brewing Volume 46, Issue 4, August 1940, page 276.
British hop imports from the USA year cwt. 1864 47,625 1869 117,102 Sources: The Temperance Record, 1870, page 214. Kentish Gazette - Tuesday 06 March 1866, page 3.
"Difficulties have also arisen in granting extra acreage for their growth and efforts made to straighten this out have only so far resulted in a deadlock. In view of the exceptionally high preservative value these new varieties possess, growers had anticipated that they would obtain a high valuation and were very discouraged with the low price they received.
. . . . .
The Research Fund Committee has appealed to the Brewers' Society to endeavour to secure a more favourable valuation, from the growers point of view, by the Hops Marketing Board, in order to encourage their growth, and as a result Mr. Toswill, who has had a lengthy experience of these hops, was invited by the Hop Valuation Committee this year to assist them in their valuation.
Journal of the Institute of Brewing Volume 46, Issue 4, August 1940, page 276.
"While some of these new varieties have been produced from an Oregon hop as parent, those giving the highest yields and the highest preservative value have been produced from a Manitoba or a Mexican hop as the parent. These hybrids possess a rather unusual aroma derived from their parent which has probably had something to do with their low valuation, and certainly appears to be the reason for the lack of enthusiasm on the part of brewers to try them. "Brewers Gold" and "Bullion Hop," both of which are now being planted on a small scale by a few growers, have had repeated brewing trials, and those have proved that the peculiar aroma does not come through into the beer, while the flavour is quite equal to that of choice American hops."
Journal of the Institute of Brewing Volume 46, Issue 4, August 1940, page 276.
"It is interesting to note that in Canada and the U.S.A., where the value of hops is assessed on their preservative value as well as flavour, growers are planting "Brewers Gold" as fast as they can obtain sets from this country. It is quite possible, therefore, that in the not far distant future we shall be importing those in place of the present type of Oregons, which would indeed be paradoxical. It has been a source of keen disappointment to Prof. Salmon, who has devoted 20 years in an endeavour to produce hops capable of replacing those imported from America which can be grown in this country, that when they have achieved their object they should see the prize slipping out of their grasp. It would indeed be fitting if this war was instrumental in enabling them to see their dream realised, which is an additional hop acreage of 3,000 acres planted with their hops."
Journal of the Institute of Brewing Volume 46, Issue 4, August 1940, page 277.
The idea of growing American-style hops isn't a new one. Attempts were already being made before WW II to breed varieties with the characteristics of American hops which could be grown in Britain.As I've pointed out before, from the 1860's on, large quantities of American hops were used by British breweries.To contextualise that quantity of American hops, in 1940 265,512 cwts of hops were used in British brewing*. Which means about 10% of the total came from the USA. That's considerably less than in the 1860's:Though that can partly be accounted for by the large drop in the quantities of hops used in Britain. In 1914 it was 559,423 cwts*, more than double the amount used in 1940. The drop in beer gravity as a result of WW I greatly reduced the demand for hops.Getting back to those new hop varieties, Brewers Gold and Bullion are still going strong. I never realised they were Britain's response to high-alpha acid American varieties. It sounds as if they had a difficult start in the UK. Mostly because of the price growers could get for them.It's understandable that farmers would unwilling to plant these new varieties in large numbers if they didn't feel they would get the price they thought they deserved for them.Various North American hops had been used as one of the parents for these new varieties:In the 19th century American hops were often criticised for having an unusual aroma. Which is why they were mostly used as bittering hops and were often kept for a year or two before use. From this description, it sounds as id Brewers Gold and Bullion really were good substitutes for American hops.The American habit of prizing hops for their alpha acid content is also nothing new:Did the Prof. Salmon's nightmare of Britain importing Brewers Gold and Bullion become reality? Probably.* 1953 Brewers' Almanack 1955, page 62.
YEREVAN, FEBRUARY 2, ARMENPRESS. Inadequacy of Azerbaijan impacts Nagorno Karabakh conflict settlement process and there is no progress there just because of its un-constructive steps. “Armenpress” reports Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian told about this at the annual summing press conference.
According to the Minister, Azerbaijan not only does not realize that it does not receive any assistance from the Minsk Group Co-chair states due to its un-constructive policy, but even tries to create an imaginary reality for itself, blaming the Co-chair states of Islamophobia. “It is hard to imagine, but they say that Azerbaijan is an Islamic state, and as the Co-chair states are Islamophobes, they act against Azerbaijan. It must be comprehended that speculations over religious factors may be very dangerous under the current conditions, which is not the first time; they have made such attempts in different institutions”, Minister Nalbandian said.
In the words of the Foreign Minister, Azerbaijan blames Armenia for all its failures. “They say that the condition over human rights is perfect in Azerbaijan, and Armenia is to blame for Azerbaijan being criticized by the world. They say that Armenia is to blame for drop of oil exports from Azerbaijan, and they say that those local oligarchs, who are no longer under the patronage of their leadership, have Armenian origins. It is very simple and easy. Armenians are to blame for everything. They know seven songs, all of them about Armenians”, Edward Nalbandian added.
The Minister also added that Azerbaijan cannot present its country from better positions by organizing symposiums and shows. “They say they are the most tolerant and multicultural country, the only one in its type. They are really the only one: no one else can be like them in terms of tolerance”, the Foreign Minister noted.
DEAR ABBY: My son and daughter-in-law recently had a baby girl. My daughter-in-law and their family have extreme OCD and are afraid of germs. I wash my hands all the time, but still they seem to cringe when I or anyone in my family holds the baby.
I want a relationship with my granddaughter. I have expressed my concern to my son, but I don't want to cause an argument. How can I approach this without causing friction? -- GRANDMA S. IN NEW YORK
DEAR GRANDMA S.: Your daughter-in-law is a brand-new mother. Many new parents are nervous about their babies being exposed to germs.
A way to approach it would be to talk with your daughter-in-law in a non-confrontational way and tell them you have seen their reaction when you hold your granddaughter. Explain that you are careful about hand-washing, and ask if there is anything else they feel you should do. It might make them feel more in control and put their mind at ease.
Starlanes 2.0
The most advanced skill on Alexa has gotten a recent upgrade. There have been several new features that enhance gameplay and usability.
Configuration
Five new ships have been added. Or, rather, the ability to change your ship into one of six types. Each is optimized for a different game function: transition distance, carrying capacity, or overall range.
Tide
The geography of connected worlds is no longer fixed. At high tide, it is easier to reach certain worlds, and at low tide, it is harder. This enables new strategic techniques that can take advantage of the geography.
Leaderboard
The leaderboard is now available in-game. Additionally the concept of faction leaders has also been introduced. Whoever is top of the leaderboard for their faction is the leader and has access to special commands.
Messages
One of the perks of being faction leader is the ability to send faction members messages. This was added for administration, but now there is a command that will let you reply messages in case you miss them. This gives a much better sense of community.
Fuel
Unlimited travel is no longer allowed. You have a certain amount of fuel that regenerates over time. Fuel is only expended while transporting drones. If your hold is empty, you can travel anywhere you like. This prevents highly active users from dominating the game and makes you think more tactically about your moves.
Badges
Gameplay is now rewarded with a badge based achievement system. As you conquer or explore systems, these are noted at bronze, silver, gold and platinum levels. You can query your own badges in game or see others on the leaderboard.
Briefing
You can ask for a daily briefing that will give you a rundown of recent activity and combats. This is very useful for working out when someone is messing with a world you've taken as your own.
Tutorial
In case you get lost in all the new features, there is a much-needed tutorial system. This walks you through the basic gameplay and gets you started with the game concepts. You even get a badge for completing it!
Knock Knock
The updates here are not quite as comprehensive as for Starlanes.
The interaction model has been tweaked to avoid more false "quit" matches. It used to drop the conversation with just an "OK" rather a lot. It's much better at that now.
The Help, Repeat, and Cancel features have been added. Although "help" is more humorous than helpful.
Lastly, sometimes after a joke is done, there is some sort of canned "ba-da-bum" noise. Tres amuse.
A Florida company is going to court over a Wisconsin Dells lumberjack show that uses the Paul Bunyan name.
The owners of the Paul Bunyan Lumberback Show, based in St. Cloud, Fla., filed a lawsuit this week in federal court in Madison.
The suit says the owners of the Paul Bunyan's Cook Shanty in Wisconsin Dells can't use the name of the mythical lumberjack in its show because the Florida owners have trademarked it.
Both shows include competition by professional lumberjacks in a variety of events, including chopping, sawing and log-rolling.
The Dells show is held next to the restaurant, while the Florida show travels around the country and included a stop last month in Wisconsin.
The owners of the Dells show did not immediately return a call for comment.
Finnish team Koiranen GP have announced three drivers for the 2015 Formula Renault 2.0 Alps season.
The drivers joining the team are German Philip Hamprecht, Austrian Stefan Riener and Brazilian Bruno Baptista.
Hamprecht, 17, made their single-seater debut with Mucke in ADAC Formel Masters last year, contesting five rounds. They left the series after securing their best finish of fourth at Slovakia Ring.
They also guested in two Formula Masters China series rounds, securing a podium at Shanghai, and made their Formula Renault 2.0 debut in the NEC series with Inter Europol.
“I am happy to be a part of a team as successful as Koiranen GP,” said Hamprecht. “I will do my best to satisfy the team, my sponsors and myself. I know the category isn't easy, but I have the best team behind me and I will learn as much as possible.”
Riener, 19, is another ADAC Formel Masters graduate, having raced in the category with Neuhauser in 2013. Their best finish of the season was a second from reverse-grid pole at Lausitzring and they ended up finishing 12th overall.
They raced in FR2.0 NEC full-time in 2014, finishing 11th overall. Riener also scored their first 2.0 podium in the Alps round at Monza and guested in the Eurocup with Koiranen at Jerez.
“Working together with Koiranen in the upcoming season is a great opportunity,” stated Riener. “I'm very comfortable being surrounded by a very professional and friendly team. I have already learned a lot with the team during our test days and I am confident that I will continue to improve throughout the next season.”
Baptista, 17, debuted in single-seaters with a season in F4 Sudamericana last year. They promptly won the series, taking four wins and finishing on the podium in all but two races.
“I know that competition will be much tougher in Europe and the car is pretty different,” admitted Baptista. “But I am very happy to be part of Koiranen GP next year and I am highly motivated to do well.”
Koiranen won the 2014 teams' and drivers' championships in both Eurocup FR2.0 and the Alps series.
The past few weeks, we've been seeing a decent number of cow/calf pairs of blue whales. Just recently I got word that a calf was seen nursing! Now even though I haven't witnessed this with blue whales myself, I did recently get to see beluga whales nursing!
Recently I took my vacation and went to the San Juan Islands, and then to the Vancouver Aquarium in B.C., Canada. It was absolutely amazing to see their little newborn beluga. While we were at the underwater window, both of the calves, one being about a year old, and the other just about 3 months old, started nursing. I couldn't believe my luck and of course took some pictures!
Depending on the species of whale, some young can stay nursing for up to two years! The milk of the mother is a very high concentration of fat to help ensure that the baby is able to get a really thick layer of blubber, which is like fat, that helps with the insulation. Because whales and dolphins are mammals, they need to make sure they can stay warm at all times living in the cold water. Humans, for example, wouldn't be able to stay in water for long periods of time, even with a wetsuit. We don't have a thick fat layer to keep the heat inside our bodies and that becomes a problem because water drains the heat out of our body about 25 times faster than air! See why blubber is so important?
Since it's so important the calves gain weight quickly from milk, how does a whale nurse underwater? It seems like a pretty tough obstacle to overcome! Typically what happens is the baby starts to nudge the mama around the belly. That lets the mother know that the baby is ready to feed. To be more hydrodynamic, the mother's nipples are inverted at the mammary gland until the baby starts to nudge where they then start to point out. The mom then starts to shoot out milk. Whales don't have lips, so they can't really suckle the milk. Instead it's almost injected into the baby's mouth. This will go on until the baby is weaned from nursing. The older of the two baby beluga is still nursing, but is also getting solid food as well. It just goes to show what a close bond these babies have with their mother! As the baby starts to eat solid food, the concentration of fat in the milk starts to decrease. It's amazing how these animals are adapted for this kind of behaviors!
I feel incredibly lucky to have witnessed this amazing maternal bond with the beluga whales, and with any luck, I'll soon get the chance to see a blue whale nursing as well. If you'd like to join me and my co-workers on our search, click here!
What is Neptune Flux?
Neptune Flux is a deep sea adventure game that takes place in the near future. You take on the role of an employee working for a dystopian corporation called A.Q.U.A. carrying out their oceanic operations. As you explore the open ocean you'll discover supernatural wreck sites, ancient artifacts, lost treasure, and dark secrets. Neptune Flux is inspired by games like Myst, Minecraft, Fallout, Bioshock, and classic Lucas Arts point-and-click adventures. If you like story-driven exploration, this game is for you.
Neptune Flux will be available for Windows & Mac. It can also be experienced on VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, however a VR headset is not required; you get to decide how you want to play.
Stretch Goals
Neptune Flux is getting close to funded, so it's time to announce some stretch goals. I sent out a survey to backers recently asking what everyone would like to see, and overwhelmingly the response was a PlayStation 4 release and more content. So let's do both!
PLAYSTATION 4 RELEASE - $9,500
I've been exploring the possibility of a PS4 release for a few months now, and at this juncture, it's simply a matter of having the extra cash to do it! Releasing on the PS4 would be huge because it would help give the game more life beyond next year's initial release, including future updates.
CAVES - $11,000
The terrain in Neptune Flux will have lots of trenches and pits, but one of the technology limitations of Unity (the game engine running Neptune Flux) is that it's technically challenging do caves that actually go underneath the terrain. But I still want you, the players, to be able to explore cave systems and experience a new part of the story. Extra funding will go towards contracting a 3D artist to help build out some of the cave assets, which will free up my time to do the programming involved in making caves work.
SARAH'S PROLOGUE - $14,000
Let's shoot for the moon! :) The writer for Neptune Flux, Brandon Tenney, has a fantastic prologue written for the game that sets up some of Sarah's backstory. Presently, this is going to be mostly voice over as opening credits play, but it would be way cooler to make this an intense playable part of the game. Extra funding will go towards more voice acting along with contracting a character animator to help flesh out a playable prologue that reveals more of Sarah's past.
Story
The world above the water is a dust bowl and an escape into space is just out of technology's reach; humanity's last and best hope of survival is the untouched ocean depths, and A.Q.U.A. is the global conglomerate tasked with colonization preparations and resource harvesting.
A.Q.U.A.'s funding comes from political puppeteers, desperate celebrities, and shadow governments all hoping to escape to a new beginning while the rest of the world ends in a whimper. A.Q.U.A. has overpromised a bright future and now there's pressure to deliver.
In Neptune Flux, you take on the role of Sarah, an A.Q.U.A. employee trying to keep their mind off of their troubled past. Working for A.Q.U.A. means being in the dark, literally and figuratively. Sarah has learned to stop asking questions about their missions, but when their assignments become increasingly unusual, they begin their quest to learn the truth. As Sarah uncovers the ocean floor, they find more than just sand and lost cargo.
Glow-in-the-Dark Sonar T-Shirt
A new reward level has been added that includes a super comfortable American Apparel shirt with glow-in-the-dark ink! All higher reward levels will also include this shirt featuring the visual sonar iconography seen in the game. Here's a mockup of what it looks like:

Neptune Flux is driven by exploration and solving mysteries with unusual solutions. It's like a classic point-and-click adventure game for the modern age.
In the deep sea there's no natural sunlight, so you'll need to use tools on your vessel to see in the dark. Your dive pod is equipped with floodlights, but you can also use other tools like flares and more advanced upgrades like visual sonar. A.Q.U.A. headquarters will give you missions to accomplish, but you're also free to explore the open world and discover supernatural wreck sites, ancient artifacts, and lost treasure. Successful missions and treasure are immediately rewarded with cash, which can be used for upgrades to your dive pod at any A.Q.U.A. base.
As you carry out missions and explore the sea floor, you'll advance through the main storyline, and learn about some of the dark secrets that lurk below.
Artwork
The ocean floor can be a beautiful place; from sunken ships to coral reefs to futuristic underwater bases, Neptune Flux features an incredibly detailed setting that's filled with amazing places to explore.
Neptune Flux uses the Unity 5 game engine and takes advantage of physically based rendering, image based lighting, and global illumination; all combining to create a beautiful and dynamic virtual world.
The game can be played on a traditional computer screen or with a VR headset. Both experiences are immersive and fun! If you do choose to play the game with a VR headset, you'll also be able to explore the ocean in stunning stereoscopic 3D and look around in 360 degrees at the interior of your dive pod!
Sound
An immersive experience like Neptune Flux would not be complete without a vivid soundscape. You'll hear every bubble, sonar ping, and flare in exceptional clarity. Neptune Flux uses positional audio to help capture the full spectrum of sounds all around your dive pod as you explore.

The game will also feature an original score by Chris Zabriskie. You can learn more about Chris and their work in the "Collaborators" section below.
Why Kickstarter?
It's now possible for individuals and small teams to create fun video games, music, movies, and more. This digital democratization is enabled by powerful software and hardware tools that save time and close the gap between inspiration and creation.
Making a game like Neptune Flux involves software subscription fees for a game engine, 3D modeling software, texturing software, licensing fees, code plugins, and more. It also involves several pieces of development hardware that are updated frequently, such as the Oculus Rift development kits and hardware upgrades to support them. There are also costs involved with delivering the game to some distribution platforms. None of these things are expensive on their own, but taken together, it can add up.
And that's just the beginning! There are lots of cool enhancements I have in mind for Neptune Flux and Kickstarter is a great way to fuel their creation. If this project is successfully funded before the deadline, stretch goals will be announced that will make the game even better.

November 2016, we all rejoiced the launch of the most awaited Flyme 6. Flyme 6 is just not an updated version of Flyme OS, it is designed to enhance the way you will experience our devices. We have been talking a lot about Flyme 6, incredible animations and amazing features which is loaded with goodness. However, every time we shared the features, all that we got to hear & read was “When is the Flyme 6 stable releasing?”. We really appreciate your passion for Flyme 6 and the enthusiasm towards experiencing it, we offer our sincere apologies for our communication issues and for the delay.
We created the Flyme forum to build a community that canhelp in contributing to Flyme's development. It's not a promotional or a marketing channel for us. It's a philosophy that pervades everything we do, and software is a big part of what we do at MEIZU. It's been a group effort since the very beginning with the help of our 300+ global beta testers giving us continuous feedback & suggestions.
Going back to the curios question, our friends –“When is Flyme 6 Stable going to release officially?”. Here's the short answer: It all goes back to that “Created Together” belief we hold close to our heart. We want to make sure that every feature, tweak, and addition to Flyme 6 passes the ultimate test: the scrutiny of, well, you. Thus keeping in account the current status of the firmware, we will start rolling out stable version of Flyme 6 from July. The models will receive update one by one, beginning with M3 Note, M2 followed by the rest of the devices ( MX4, MX4Pro, M1Note, M2Note, MX5, PRO5, PRO6, M3s, MX6, U10, U20, M3E, M3Max, PRO6 Plus ). M5, M5s and M5 Note the update will be released later, since these 3 models are relatively new in the market.
To help us accomplish this goal before time, Flyme development follows three release cycles: Closed Beta, Open Beta, and Official Release. At every step of the way, we collect feedback, bug reports, and feature requests directly from our community. And, now you know the extensive level of community input and testing that takes place before a single line of code ever reaches your device. If you want to experience brand new Flyme 6 features (and aren't afraid of some little bumps along the way), you can flash the released Open Beta Version . You will be heard, feel free to drop in your suggestions in the forum bugs & feedback section.
In 2009, the University of Texas officially passed the University of Notre Dame for the most valuable college football program according to Forbes business magazine. In recent years, the Wall Street Journal has been doing their own valuation and coming up with the same results–Texas has a comfortable lead as the No. 1 most valuable team but Notre Dame continues to sit in the No. 2 spot.
Several Big Ten (Ohio State, Michigan) and SEC (Tennessee, LSU, Georgia, Alabama) programs have been consistently among the most valuable in the nation but even without a consistent winning product the Fighting Irish have remained second-best.
Whenever these figures are released each year there's been a caveat with Notre Dame. No, it's not that the program refuses to join a conference. It's that the Irish haven't fully flexed their muscles in regards the football stadium the way virtually every other major program has over the last 10-15 years.
That's beginning to change with the unveiling of the Crossroads Project this fall. Here comes advertising on the new jumbotron, am I right!??
Actually, don't hold your breath on that.
As virtually every Notre Dame fan knows the hallowed grounds on campus inside the football stadium have remained advertising-free since its opening in 1930. Well, almost. The old, old (now going to be the old, old, old) scoreboard was very clearly a nice little advertisement for clockmakers Longines. Plus, the school did allow small NBC Sports signage on and around the scoreboard since the network began broadcasting Irish home games in 1991.
Oh, I guess it IS okay to advertise in the stadium.
We're approaching 90 years of this tradition–with the university adamant nothing will change with Crossroads–and it's always surprising at how little faith there is with this topic.
“I'm sorry I'm going to need another 100 years before I believe the school on this one.”
It's mostly an irrational fear borne out an aversion to change and a misunderstanding of advertising, and more importantly, the operation of video boards and their revenue generation capabilities within the context of Notre Dame's football budget.
I'm here to explain why Notre Dame will probably never go down the road of in-stadium advertising.
First, let's talk money. There's generally a misconception about the revenue that can be generated through advertising during college football games. For example, I'd recommend taking the time to read this lengthy New York Times piece from late 2015 on Alabama's football team generating wealth for its school. In that article, the NYT discusses the money brought in from ads inside the Tide's stadium:
Inside Bryant-Denny, the bigger regional and national sponsors own the scoreboards. Regions bank and Toyota pay $80,000 to have their logos rotate down the left side throughout the game. Muscle Milk and Coca-Cola pay six figures to own the tunnels and corner boards. Anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000 buys one minute of pregame ads and two minutes of in-game ads on the LED scroll and attracts companies like Cooper Tires and restaurants like Billy's Sports Bar.
We can safely assume that these prices are near the top in college football if not Top 5 or Top 3 nationally. Think about it, these advertisers get roughly 600,000 to 700,000 people to see their product for roughly 4 hours per game 6 to 7 times per year. Maybe throw in a little more for a spring game. It's not super valuable for these schools when juxtaposed with their total revenue.
For the big schools like Alabama, Texas, and Notre Dame you're looking at maybe an additional 2% to 3% in revenue from this in-stadium advertising. Heck, if you want a more long-term worry it's stadium naming rights. USC just recently signed a 15-year deal with United Airlines worth $70 million for naming rights at the L.A. Coliseum. Notre Dame could easily earn 600% to 800% more per year from one sponsor on a naming rights deal in comparison to in-stadium advertising and even that large sum hasn't tempted the university as of yet.
When the Forbes and Wall Street Journals of the world talked about Notre Dame lagging behind it was almost always focused on the lack of premium seating. Obviously, the Crossroads project is rectifying this in the fall.
Notre Dame hasn't publicly announced any prices for the 3,000 new premium seats (68 loge boxes & 2,100 indoor/outdoor club seats) but the Sports Business Journal recently published a story with insight into the financials involved:
…the new premium seats cost slightly less than Tennessee's west club seats at Neyland Stadium, the venue where Notre Dame most closely bench-marked its products. Those seats at UT run $5,000 a seat annually, plus capital gifts of $35,000 to $50,000, according to Tennessee athletics' website.
Now, start plugging some figures into a calculator and it becomes crystal clear why premium seating is so valuable for college football teams and sports franchises in general. In comparison, stadium advertising seems like mere bread crumbs. Which, by the way, is likely why Notre Dame has never forced this on its fans. It's been a tradition for so long and the extra bit of cash isn't worth the backlash.
Estimated 800+ square feet of speakers for Notre Dame's new video board. 🤘🏻🗣🏈 https://t.co/gyxeOjjZ4L — Eric Murtaugh (@EMMurtaugh) April 26, 2017
There's also another aspect to this discussion. Notre Dame has altered the stadium stands with the premium seating, a new visitors tunnel, and wider seating to decrease capacity by almost 3,000 seats to 78,000 overall. Even though we've recently witnessed some gaudy capacity upgrades (Texas A&M's Kyle Field famously spent $450 million in upgrades which included an increase of almost 25,000 seats and they backed that down by 4,000 seats the year after its debut season) the truth is that live football is likely slowly headed in the other direction.
I'd be willing to bet that within 50 years the capacity inside Notre Dame Stadium dips below 50,000. For what its worth the L.A. Coliseum–previously well over 100,000 capacity and hovering around 92,000 in recent years–is reducing things to 77,500 following renovations.
This isn't some new revelatory opinion. Football games in person are brutally long, with little game action, and are becoming a tired and expensive endeavor. It's just easier, cheaper, and usually flat out better to watch at home. The future of live football is going to be more intimate, catering to a greater percentage of expensive premium seats with a wide variety of amenities, and definitely focused heavily on providing value (food, entertainment, access to technology, etc.) beyond staring at a field for several hours.
If we're talking about advertising it's clearly the television fans should be worried about. After all, Notre Dame can't even get half a million people to show up to the stadium every year for football games while the home finale last year against Virginia Tech (with a poor rating at that) saw 2.4 million people watch just that one contest.
TV ad creep is coming and has already begun.
I'm personally not too worked up about this future of advertising because the market tends to correct the big problems and the implementation is so incremental that we get used to it as the years move forward. Plus, this type of advertising will be so heavily controlled by the likes of ABC, NBC, and ESPN that there's a sense of inevitability of the networks doing this as traditional cable packages and commercials are slowly eroded.
Top 5 Opinions on Crossroads in the Stadium
1. On many of the Watch ND uploads there is a tiny sponsor that pops up briefly early in the videos. Lately, it's been the St. Joseph Health System. We'll presumably see these same videos used on the video board so will it technically be considered in-stadium advertising?
2. I'd bet the use of the video board will draw generally favorable reviews with the exception of the sappy side of the Notre Dame video world. We all know the “What Would You Fight for?” television spot is getting packed into halftime, right? I think the pat-ourselves-on-the-back type of videos (using the board to honor groups, etc.) is going to bring some of the loudest criticism.
3. Despite tin foil hat conspiracies we know the Kiss Cam and 60-second ads for (obligatory reference) Gurley Leep aren't coming. In addition to the mushy Watch ND videos the loudness, timing, and music used by the sound system will be fascinating to watch unfold. In previous years the acoustics in the stadium were poor but still fairly loud. Now, with a much larger and better sound system the acoustics will be better but also potentially far louder.
4. Don't sleep on the video ribbon boards being the biggest complaints. These are among the least talked about additions to the entire Crossroads project. Be prepared to hear and read many testimonials about how distracting they are. I'm cautiously optimistic on them, depending on their utilization especially with stats.
5. Notre Dame has given zero indication as of yet but I'd bet they will be expanding Crossroads in the future. People have marveled at the size of the new video board but I was never enamored with the lone board stuck in one end zone. Plus, coming in at 5,184 sq. ft. the Irish board is 13th largest heading into 2017. Not bad but in 5 to 10 years it'll probably be outside the Top 20 and I fear it'll be old-fashion a lot quicker than expected. That's why further building expansion in the corners of the stadium may be in the cards down the line. More places to anchor additional versatile video operations so the current set up doesn't feel so 1998 in a few years.
Mason Dunn is trying to kick a 10-a-day habit (Picture: SWNS)
Mason Dunn is a 14-year-old school kid trying to kick a 10-a-day cigarette habit.
In order to do that their mum bought them an e-cigarette, which releases nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide.
They hope to eventually wean them off vaping, but for the time being they say that it's helping.
However she's now embroiled in a disagreement with Mason's school, Kearsley Academy in Greater Manchester, because teachers confiscated the e-cig.
Mason Dunn with their mum Sue (Picture: SWNS)
‘I am not happy about the fact they smoke in the first place, but we have tried everything to help them stop,' Sue, Mason's mum, said.
‘We have tried patches and have been to the doctor, but nothing worked, so my eldest son bought them an e-cigarette and it has helped them stop smoking cigarettes. They have really made an effort.

‘I went into school and explained the situation but was told it is against the school policy. They came home from school in a terrible state because they needed nicotine.
‘If it helps to prevent people from developing cancer at a later stage, I think it should be allowed.'
Sue added that Mason took up smoking, without them realising, when their father died.

Suzanne Pountain, the school's principal, said: ‘Kearsley Academy is a no-smoking site. We have a duty of care to our students to reinforce this and discourage them from doing so.
‘We offer students access to the school nurse and if necessary pathways such as the smoke cessation programme, if this is needed.
‘We will continue to work with and support Mason within the guidelines of our policy.
‘For the safeguarding of all our students, smoking, including the use of any nicotine inhalation devices are not allowed.'
Vaping: What do the experts say? A report from Public Health England concluded last month that vaping is around 95 per cent less harmful than cigarette smoking. ‘Smoking remains England's number one killer and the best thing a smoker can do is to quit completely, now and forever,' Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said in the report. ‘E-cigarettes are not completely risk free but when compared to smoking, evidence shows they carry just a fraction of the harm.' But experts from the British Medical Association are pushing for more rules to be placed on e-cigarette use – for example, by possibly making them prescription only. ‘Doctors want to see strong regulation of e-cigarettes, as a licensed medicinal product, to best reflect their use for harm reduction and ensure their effectiveness, quality, and safety,' Dr Ram Moorthy, BMA Board of Science deputy chair, said. ‘There is a lack of robust research and evidence in this area, and any benefits or disadvantages to public health are not yet well established. Regulating e-cigarettes as a licensed medicinal product best reflects their use for harm reduction, ensures their effectiveness, quality, and safety, and provides the necessary controls on their promotion and sale.' Last year the World Health Organisation also called for a ban on vaping indoors.

Re: “Fukushima and the right to responsible government” by Colin P.A. Jones (The Foreign Element, Sept. 17):
It would be useful if the government of Japan would avail themselves of the assistance and technology that could be provided by foreign corporations with experience in the decommissioning of nuclear plants.
The United States successfully cleaned and decommissioned nuclear facilities at Hanford, Washington, Rocky Flats, Colorado, and Portsmouth, Ohio. Other projects are currently under way in both the U.S. and U.K.
Yet, American firms who have offered to help with issues at Fukushima have been repeatedly turned down by Tepco and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
Recently, a METI official told me that Japan could not use American technology that was used to decommission Hanford because these were military reactors used in weapons programs. Fukushima is a civilian power reactor and, hence, the technology would not be appropriate.
Fuel rods inside the core of a nuclear reactor do not know if they will be reprocessed or put into a spent fuel pool.
This type of thinking harkens back to the fallacious argument that Japanese cannot eat American beef because their intestines are different.
The cleanup of any nuclear reactor will use the same technology, regardless of what the reactor has been used for.
The consequences of the continued delay in addressing the real challenges at Fukushima have international consequences.
So, why not allow the international nuclear community the opportunity to help?

‘Jailhouse Blues' for Tepco?
Elvis has left the building. Tepco is talking about water leaks. Three reactor cores have melted.
The hits just keep on coming. “Jailhouse Blues” can't be far behind for the Tepco officials that have allowed this to happen.
I can feel the rock ‘n' roll rhythms starting to get louder. How about you?

Re: “A friend to kanji learners worldwide” by Louise George Kittaka (Sept. 10):
Sadly, I learned today of the death of Mary Sisk Noguchi (Kanji Clinic columnist) last December.
For many of who have spent years climbing the mountain of learning and remembering kanji, they were a soft and understanding beacon who delighted in helping to light the way to becoming more proficient.
Like many others, I wrote to them asking advice and they answered personally, as they did with all such requests.
They will be dearly missed.

The 17-year-old photographer Humza Deas spends so much time exploring the air above New York City that he's begun to run into people they know up there. On a recent balmy night they strolled across the Manhattan Bridge, snapping long exposures of FDR Drive from the pedestrian walkway. They were descending into Chinatown when, about 50 feet over Henry Street, their name wafted out.
“Hum-zah DEEEEEEEEEEEZ!”
Two backpack-laden figures ran laughing over the rooftop of a six-story building across the street, just a few feet above the walkway. They scurried up a ladder to an empty billboard and disappeared around its far side. “I think that was Last Suspect,” Deas told Junior, a friend who was carrying their tripod. “I can tell by the way they dress.” Last Suspect is a well-known New York City street photographer, part of a community that specializes in combining picture-taking with urban exploration: a tribe of outlaw Instagrammers for whom, every night, New York City becomes a playground and battlefield. They compete to capture the gritty cityscape from unexpected — often aerial — angles while garnering as many likes and follows as possible in the process. (Like Deas, Last Suspect is an elite of the group, called a “K,” which means they have more than 10,000 followers on Instagram so the last three digits of their follower count are replaced with the letter K.) They can be spotted by the distinctive humpback of their padded photographers' backpacks and colorful lightweight Nikes, equally effective at gripping rusty ladder rungs and looking cool in a photograph hanging over the city from the edge of a skyscraper's roof, as if all of Manhattan were just an ottoman. For them, photography is more performance — or competition — than visual art.
There has long been a subculture of so-called “urban explorers” who have made a game of accessing off-limits places. But Deas and the other Instagrammers distinguish themselves from these mostly older, more cerebral trespassers. “They'll go to the top of the bridge and touch it and be like, Wow, this architecture!,” Deas says, a little dismissively. Urban explorers take photos mainly to document that they've been there, while for Deas the image is the whole point. The outlaw Instagrammers have more in common with graffiti artists, another subculture of underground creatives who make their work in the cracks of the urban landscape. Many Instagrammers go by enigmatic handles that would look good scrawled on the side of a subway car, like Novess, Black_soap, Heavy Minds, and 13thwitness, aka Tim McGurr, an unofficial godfather of the scene. But the outlaw Instagrammers are better-positioned to thrive in post-Giuliani, post-Facebook New York than old-school graffiti writers: transgressive enough to be cool, but innocuous enough to amass a huge following without getting hunted down by the NYPD.
Even as individual Instagrammers have gained tens of thousands of followers, the community remained largely out of the mainstream, until last month, when Deas nearly blew up the scene. It started July 22, the morning some then-unknown party swapped the American flags on the Brooklyn Bridge with big white flags. (A pair of German artists, Mischa Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke claimed credit for the stunt this week and offered convincing proof to the New York Times.)
The best outlaw instagrammers have a specialty that sets them apart, and Deas's is climbing bridges. In one photo they balance at night on a suspension cable at the top of the Manhattan Bridge as cars streak below him. In another, a friend sits on the sloping steel beam of what appears to be the Queensboro Bridge, their face lit by the glow of a smartphone he's staring into. And so Deas woke the morning of the white-flag incident to find their Samsung pinging with Instagram notifications, texts, and emails from fans and friends who thought he'd officially staked their claim up there. I think this guy did the white flag. Nice job, man! Was it you? They posted a note on Instagram to their more than 22,000 followers, declaring that they did not do the bridge. Then their friend Neil, a barber who cuts a WPIX camerman's hair, told them the station was looking to interview someone about bridge-climbing and Deas, intending to clear their name, instead got themselves in trouble.
In the resulting video, Deas walks the Manhattan Bridge with a reporter while spilling the secrets of the outlaw Instagrammer. They explain that the best time to climb bridges is in the very early morning, right after they shut the lights off. They even drag Last Suspect into it: Last Suspect had claimed responsibility for the flags as a joke, and Deas tut-tuts that “you shouldn't take credit for someone else's work,” over a screenshot of Last Suspect's Instagram page. When the report aired, other outlaw Instagrammers were horrified. Deas received death threats, and Last Suspect proposed a Humza Deas “boycott”.
Even sympathetic outlaw Instagrammers thought Deas was trying to pull up the ladder after climbing it to fame. “It just awoke New York to like, there are these kids, these grown-ass men, even women up on our bridges and our roofs so we gotta watch out,” says a 17-year-old Instagrammer who goes by Kostennn (51k followers). “Of course Humza wouldn't care because he's already hit everything so he's just like, Whatever I'm gonna do the interview. And that made us mad because it's like, Wow, that's pretty selfish. What if I wanted to hit the bridge this Friday night?”
Deas is a handsome kid with a babyface and a marathon runner's frame clad head to toe in cutting-edge streetwear. (Unless he's trying to sneak onto the roof a Times Square hotel, in which case he'll dress up a bit in some nice pants and a button-down and Stacy Adams pinto shoes since, as a young black man, he's likely going to get a second look from the doorman at a luxury hotel.) He's has been skateboarding since they were 8 years old and is good enough at that to be sponsored by the Belief Skateshop in Queens, where they grew up before moving to Bushwick with their aunt. They got the idea to start climbing earlier this year, while watching a viral video of two Russian daredevils scaling the 2,073-foot Shanghai Tower, still under construction in China. The first-person video was so intense that their hands began to sweat as they held their phone. “I was like, damn, this is so dangerous,” they say. Then they saw the otherworldly scenes they captured while clinging to a crane at the top, where skyscrapers poked out of a sea of clouds. “I'm thinking, Hey, they're in China, they're not in New York,” Deas says. “I can show New York this kind of photography.” So one night in April, Deas climbed the Brooklyn-side tower of the Williamsburg Bridge. They found it was easier than he'd expected. It took just 15 minutes, although, having learned something from the WPIX fiasco, they swear me to secrecy when they tell me how they did it. The resulting photos were more popular than the well-composed shots of subway tracks and DUMBO sunsets they had posted in the eight months he'd been on Instagram. They then scaled the Queensboro Bridge, Hell Gate Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. They hit the Williamsburg bridge six more times, late at night or early in the morning, often with a small crew of fellow photographers. At the same time they began hitting skyscrapers.
Their Instagram feed over the past four months seems to belong to someone who bounds across Manhattan from rooftop to rooftop, rarely touching the sidewalk. Some Instagrammers use Google Maps to scan the city for juicy targets but Deas's method is largely spontaneous. If they come across a space in the city they think would look good from above, he'll hit the roof of a nearby building after looping around the block a few times to get a sense of security.
Deas's rising notoriety has made climbing a bridge a sort of badge of honor among other Instagrammers. If you click around certain accounts — like night.shift demidism and 7expresstrain — you'll see photos from the tops of New York's bridges have proliferated like selfies. Deas was recently up on the Randalls Island tower of the Hell Gate Bridge with some friends when another group of Instagrammers in town from San Francisco climbed up. After a brief moment of panic — each group thinking they'd just been busted — they realized they knew each other and ended up clambering over the beams to Queens together.
If they do get caught, Deas's only hope is to talk their way out of trouble, which has worked out so far — he's never been arrested. The building manager and their teenage son once caught Deas photographing a girl against the sunset on the roof of the 53-story Eventi skyscraper on Seventh Avenue. As they waited for the cops, Deas chatted with the son about high school and the upcoming New York State Regents exam, which, Deas casually mentioned, they had to take the next day. When the cops came the guy decided not to press charges.
“I knew they wouldn't arrest me because I had a test in the morning,” Deas says with a grin. “He's a dad.”
But Deas has been keeping a lower profile since the white-flag incident. He's convinced that he's now on the NYPD's radar because of the WPIX interview, and when a cop ambles past on the Manhattan Bridge, they and Junior visibly tense up until he's out of sight. The blue lights glitter tantalizingly along the suspension cables above. But tonight Deas is heading to Long Island City to shoot the graffiti mecca 5 Pointz before it's demolished this month. As if to make up for being physically grounded, Deas maintains their high-flying swagger until the moment they disappear into the subway at Canal Street. “If I really wanted to, I could do it,” they say, of scaling the bridge even in the face of ramped-up security. “The NYPD is not superhuman.”
Though the US Central Intelligence Agency may use Facebook, Twitter, and the like to keep tabs on targets of interest, the spy agency has only now officially joined social media--a move hastened by an imposter who was using the agency's name online.
The agency's first tweet, which earned the CIA nearly 200,000 Twitter followers in just a few hours, was the appropriately sarcastic, “We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.” There were already 40,000 followers after just a single hour online, with the agency's debut on Facebook sparking a similar conversation on that platform.
We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet. — CIA (@CIA) June 6, 2014
“By expanding to these platforms, CIA will be able to more directly engage with the public and provide information on the CIA's mission, history, and other developments,” CIA Director John Brennan said in a press release Friday. “We have important insights to share, and we want to make sure that unclassified information about the agency is more accessible to the American public that we serve, consistent with our national security mission.”
The CIA admitted as far back as 2011 that its agents and employees regularly scan social media to spy on intelligence targets. It already had multiple accounts on Flickr and YouTube, but only debuted on Twitter Friday because it had spent months lobbying Twitter to stop someone else who was already using the @CIA handle.
“There was someone out there impersonating CIA via Twitter,” spokesperson K. Jordan Caldwell told NBC. “Earlier this year, CIA filed an impersonation complaint with Twitter and they secured the @CIA account for us, which is routine for government agencies. This has been a lengthy process. It's been in the works for a long time.”
The poser wasn't a member of the Syrian Electronic Army, or even a veteran of the agency's “enhanced interrogation” techniques, but the Cleveland Institute of Art, which was cursed with the same abbreviation as one of the most powerful cloak and dagger agencies in the world.
“We just deleted that one because it was kind of confusing,” Jessica Moore, the institute's web manager, told the Wall Street Journal. “Some people would mention us in their tweets and they were clearly thinking they were talking with the 'real CIA,' the Central Intelligence Agency.”
If the CIA is used to infiltrating foreign governments and aiding assassinations, though, it was still unprepared for Twitter trolling. Tweets immediately began pouring into the agency's timeline from all over the world. Whether it be journalists, comedians, companies, or conspiracy theorists, seemingly all of Twitter felt compelled to make a joke that had been made dozens of times before.

.@CIA wheres that dang plane — jonnifer lopez (@senderblock23) June 6, 2014
Certainly the most effective trolling so far has come from the New York Review of Books, which launched an assault on the CIA's Twitter feed complete with the torture methods used by the CIA and the date each incident occurred.
Each of the flurry of tweets included a link to the 2009 NY Review of Boks article titled “US Torture. Voices from the Black Sites," which “reveals for the first time the contents of a confidential Red Cross report about the CIA's secret offshore prisons.” The link was unavailable for much of the afternoon Friday, most likely because the site in question was overwhelmed with the sudden amount of traffic that came from the hundreds of retweets and favorites.

Along with compelling the Cleveland Institute of Art to give up its Twitter moniker, the CIA's debut on Twitter is also timely because it comes as a number of US government agencies have increasingly relied on social media to communicate with the public. The trend began a year ago after the Edward Snowden leak, when the National Security Agency sought to shift the conversation with its own Twitter account.
“Other US government departments have attempted to use social media not only to get out their message, but at times to actively combat America's enemies in sometimes bizarre online spats,” explained Lee Ferran of ABC News. “The State Department's Think Again Turn Away Twitter account, for instance, directly engages in arguments with pro-jihadi computer users. Terrorist groups, like the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda-allied group Al-Shabab in Somalia, already have a robust social media presence, which they use to spread their own propaganda.”

Want to see a look of pure hatred? Pull out an EBT card at the grocery store.
Now that my kids are grown and gone, my Social Security check is enough to keep me from qualifying for government food benefits. But I remember well when we did qualify for a monthly EBT deposit, a whopping $22 — and that was before Congress cut SNAP benefits in November 2013. Like 70 percent of people receiving SNAP benefits, I couldn't feed my family on that amount. But I remember the comments from middle-class people, the assumptions about me and my disability and what the poor should and shouldn't be spending money on.
Anger toward those living below the poverty line seems to only be increasing. Maine and Missouri have proposed bills limiting residents' food choices if they use SNAP. Missouri House Bill 813 would bar the state's 930,000 food stamp recipients from using their benefits to buy cookies, chips, soda, energy drinks, steak and seafood. (The legislature also implemented mandatory drug testing for TANF applicants in 2011.) If the bill becomes law, a Missourian can't buy a can of tuna with an EBT card. Tortilla chips to go with salsa? Nope. Flank steak — tough, stringy and the only cut of beef I can afford — is off-limits, too. Who are these people, and what makes them think that what we eat is their business? And given that the average food stamp allotment in my state in 2013 came out to just $1.41 per person per meal, I wonder if they understand that recipients couldn't buy lobster if they wanted to.
[Stop blaming poor parents for their children's limited vocabulary]
In America today, being poor is tantamount to a criminal offense, one that costs you a number of rights and untold dignities, including, apparently, the ability to determine what foods you can put on the dinner table. When I drive my 19-year-old car, with its drooping bumper, peeling paint and loud muffler, the police follow me. Utilizing American safety-net programs (which, by the way, I paid into for years before receiving any “entitlements”) requires that I relinquish my privacy multiple times. I have to reveal how much I pay to live where I live, the amount of my utility and medical bills, what car I own, even whether I have a plot to be buried in when I die. I have to update the local office any time my income changes, or if a family member moves in or out, and even when my college-age children come home for the summer.
When I used WIC to supplement the diets of myself and my two children, we were required to report to the Health Department quarterly for weight and wellness checks. My babies' blood was taken to look for lead exposure. When my daughter's test came back with sky-high lead levels, the Health Department came into my residence, crawled over the whole place, and took samples of windowsills, walls, soil, flooring and water, and found…nothing. Upon recheck, my daughter's lead levels were perfectly normal and deemed a false positive.
What if they had had discovered metabolites consistent with drug exposure? Poppyseeds metabolize like opiates. Had I been living in Section 8 housing, that would have resulted in a search of my home for drugs, the loss of my home and quite probably the loss of my children.
[My son has been suspended five times. He's 3.]
Laws in several states that attempt to drug-test applicants for TANF (“welfare”) or SNAP (“food stamps”) operate on the presumption that all people living under the poverty line use drugs. Court challenges have ruled Florida's and Michigan's unconstitutional. In Utah, 4,730 people applied for TANF; 466 people were tested, turning up 12 positives. Turns out only a small minority of folks receiving benefits actually abuse drugs or alcohol.
Believe me, it's a thrill to pee in a cup after relinquishing my purse, wallet, keys and shoes (I might be carrying a “clean” baggie of urine), just so I can get a Scheduled Drug sleeping medication.
There are many lives I would rather lead, and poverty is not my choice. As a child, I lived in a lovely family neighborhood in Connecticut, where we had horses and a barn, competed in horse shows, and went to Maine on vacation. Illness stole any dreams of emulating my upbringing, or of raising my children in the comfort that I had growing up.
[This is what happened when I drove my Mercedes to pick up food stamps]
My disability is invisible, which means I draw stares when I park in the blue-lined spots up front. I've even been challenged verbally: “You don't look disabled.” The invisibility also means I hear opinions from people who don't know me well — opinions on poor people. I don't sound poor; I don't look poor. I want to ask, “What does poor look like, anyway?” In public housing, 50 percent of the residents are elderly or disabled, or both. According to the Social Security Administration, as of 2013, the average retiree gets $1,294 per month to subsist on, and the average disabled person gets $1,146; both are around the monthly paycheck of a minimum-wage job-holder before taxes.
It's as if middle-class and wealthy Americans think poor people live under the poverty line by choice, as if a sensible person would choose to subsist on so little. We're barely getting by. Don't tell us what to buy at the grocery store.

Earlier this week, the Washington Post's Earlier this week, the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold uncovered yet another Donald Trump scam job, in which they used over $250,000 in charitable donations to help pay off their legal bills. And, because this is Trump, that sordid (and almost certainly illegal) bit of money laundering is just ONE despicable detail of the story. There are many more, including Trump's club trying to welch on a $1 million hole-in-one payout (out of all of Trump's bad qualities, their steadfast refusal to pay people what they owe them , while bragging about it, is the most enraging), along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so they could put a big, dipshit flagpole up at the Mar-a-Lago club , with their lawyers stating—with a straight face—that a smaller flag “would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump's . . . patriotism” (NOTE: Until recently, Trump didn't know what the stripes on the flag symbolized ).
None of this is surprising, of course. Trump is a liar and a crook, and they commit abominable acts at such a frenetic pace that they get lost in the fury surrounding whatever horrible thing they do next. Keith Olbermann needed over None of this is surprising, of course. Trump is a liar and a crook, and they commit abominable acts at such a frenetic pace that they get lost in the fury surrounding whatever horrible thing they do next. Keith Olbermann needed over 17 minutes on this site just to list a fraction of the atrocities Trump has staged during election season, and he's gonna need 17 more minutes to cover what happens between now and Election Day. Remember when Trump said they would get rid of food regulations? That was Thursday.
Regardless, in the end, people are still gonna vote for this man. Maybe not enough to get them elected, but still: it'll be in the tens of millions. (Note to the people causing the polls to fluctuate: What the fuck is wrong with you? I gotta meet the five percent of people who saw Hillary come down with pneumonia and were like, “Forget her, gimme the dictator with dryer lint hair.”) Nothing that Trump says, no damning piece of Trump reportage, and certainly no opinion piece like this one will stop their voters from pulling the lever. Nor will anything stop Trump from being the officious, braindead goon that they are. They will never answer for their crimes, and there's a frighteningly large portion of the electorate that will always love them for that.
And so I'd just like to say to that portion of the electorate: Fuck you. No, seriously. Go fuck yourselves. I'm not gonna waste any more time trying to convince you that you're about to do something you'll regret forever. I'm not gonna show you old clips of Trump saying rotten things. I'm not gonna try to ANNIHILATE Trump by showing you records of their hypocrisy and greed. I'm not gonna link to a John Oliver clip and be like, “THIS. So much this.” Nothing's gonna take down Trump at this point, so I'm not gonna bother. No no, this post is for ME. I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here.

YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of Because while Trump is a miserable bastard, YOU are the people who have handed them the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit . YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst business person, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when they cause problems for other people instead of solving them. YOU are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (“deplorables”), while cheering Trump on as they leave a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere they go.

Whatever mildly frustrating centrist liberal bureaucracy that Hillary presides over will be fine compared to the spray tan mushroom cloud that would arise all because YOU thought Trump was such a brave, un-PC dickhead to everyone within shouting distance.
Trump is human waste.  They are the worst of America stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and they are emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to DRAG kicking and screaming into the 21st century: Cliven Bundy, Sean Hannity, Kim Davis, and on and on and on. Trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any Oil Party candidate waving a NO GAYS flag. Fuck them. These are needy hillbilly loons who are just as starved for attention as Trump himself. And voting for Trump is their way of emulating him, of saying FUCK YOU to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout.
The old saw is that people get the politicians they deserve, and I'll be crestfallen if Trump wins and proves this to be true once more. If you vote for him, you're not making America great again. You are killing it. You are telling the world that America isn't worth it. You are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people. You are handing the most important job on Earth to Napoleon from Animal Farm. And you are revealing your breathtaking ignorance to everyone except for yourself. I can't believe you can't see this. I want you to see this. I wanna shine a big fucking light in your face and scream at you that Trump isn't even qualified to be human, much less President. How are you gonna change the system if you elect some corrupt idiot who has no clue how to DO IT, huh? Can't you see this? Haven't you heard this asshole talk? THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?
But I already know that's a futile effort. So fuck you, and fuck the GOP leaders who are too chickenshit to stand up to you. I'm not gonna wish deportation or imprisonment or some kind of fantastical hyperbolic death upon you. I'm not gonna ask for a wall to be built on the Mason-Dixon line. No no, I think you people deserve the EXACT same fate as Trump himself, and that is to lose, badly. That's what should happen to you. You and your hamburger puppet leader deserve to live the rest of your days arm-in-arm in disgrace, branded as losers for the rest of your lives. Because that's what you are.

Did an undercover Austin Police detective induce members of Occupy Austin to commit felony obstruction of a roadway during a demonstration in Houston in December 2011? Or, did they – and two colleagues – intervene in protester plans in order to keep them, and police and firefighters responding to the Houston protest, safe?
Those are among the questions now before Harris County district Judge Joan Campbell, who is presiding over the prosecution of Austinite Ronnie Garza, one of 16 Occupy protesters from across the state arrested in December during a demonstration at Houston's port, part of a nationwide “Occupy the Port” action. Garza is among a group of eight of those protesters who are now facing felony charges of “possession of a criminal instrument” as a result of that road-blocking action, while the other eight protesters, who were also blocking the road, were charged only with misdemeanor obstruction of a highway. A felony carries a possibility of two years in a state jail while a misdemeanor is punishable by six months in the county lockup.
At issue is the manner in which each group of protesters blocked the road – and who shares responsibility. The group facing the misdemeanor charges locked arms while lying across the roadway; the group facing the felony charges linked their arms with the aid of a "lockbox" (sometimes called a “dragon sleeve”). It's essentially a home-made PVC sleeve made to lock protesters together or to a stationary object. The lockbox is typically made by drilling a bolt through a width of opaque PVC pipe – using chain and carabiners, protesters can be locked to the bolt or each other, their arms hidden snugly inside the pipe. Unless the user releases an arm, the device usually must be cut off, posing risk to the user and, potentially, to the police or firefighters doing the cutting, if booby traps are employed inside the pipe.
It was those concerns about safety, says APD Assistant Chief Sean Mannix, that prompted APD detective Shannon Dowell to get involved last December in constructing a series of lockboxes eventually used by the eight protesters arrested for wearing them at the Port of Houston. Dowell (known to protesters originally as "Butch") was working undercover within the Occupy Austin movement. Their real name and occupation was discovered by an investigator working for defense attorney Greg Gladden. Mannix confirmed testimony Dowell provided in court this week, that the APD actually had three undercover detectives, including Dowell, working inside the movement last year – but the point wasn't to disrupt activities, claims Mannix, rather to ensure that any person in Austin wanting to engage in "protected free speech" would be free to do so.
Informants had already told APD that there were individuals inside the movement who were advocating violence, Mannix said, and the idea of having undercover officers attending OA General Assembly meetings and participating in various demonstrations was devised solely, they insisted, to ensure the safety of everyone, including not only police officers but the protesters themselves – not to foment trouble or to try to shut down the movement. "We are there to protect people who want to engage in protected speech," Mannix said. According to Mannix, Dowell and the other two undercover officers had attended General Assembly meetings where the use of lockboxes as acts of civil disobedience were discussed and approved. At an Aug. 27 court hearing in Houston, Dowell acknowledged that they helped to build and provide the lockboxes; Mannix claims that was in part to make certain that the devices were safe. (OA activists say the other two undercover cops used the names "Rick" and "Dirk”; OA members haven't yet secured their real names, and the APD declined to reveal them.)
But Garza's attorney Gladden, former president of the ACLU of Texas and a member of the National Lawyers Guild, and other Occupy Austin activists tell a different story. According to an affidavit by David Cortez, head of Occupy Austin's bank actions committee, it was Dowell who encouraged the activists to don the lockboxes. "He was a fairly quiet individual who never contributed much to our meetings," Cortez recalled of Dowell, "but consistently pulled myself and others aside individually in order to express their frustration with debate and eagerness for more aggressive and provocative actions than our standard peaceful & nonviolent ones," reads the affidavit. According to the affidavit of fellow OA member Yatzel Sabat, possible acts of civil disobedience, "including trespassing, sit-ins or obstruction of passage ways" had been discussed at meetings but it was Butch (Dowell) who was involved in the initial discussion of using lockboxes, and it was they who "acted more excited about the idea," reads the affidavit. "He volunteered to gather the piping and other materials by purchasing it at Lowe's and delivering it back to the members of the group that were planning to go to Houston for the demonstration," they continued. "Butch persuaded us to use these arm tubes."
Sabat and Cortez note that the lockboxes weren't necessary to carry out the protest; the other eight members who blocked one of the roads leading to the port did so simply with their bodies. And without the influence of the APD officers, Gladden says, the eight now facing felony prosecution, including their client Garza, would have done the same. In short, they say, Dowell's actions entrapped their client and the others, inducing them to take an illegal action they otherwise would not have undertaken. "The police knew the kids could be charged with the felony" for using the lockboxes, Gladden says, "but the kids didn't know [that]."
The court must decide whether the activists were induced into using lockboxes – which are not illegal to construct or to own, but are illegal when intended for use in a crime – the distinction that allowed the state to bump the misdemeanor obstruction charge into a felony offense for Garza and their fellow Occupiers.
And based on the transcripts of this week's hearing in Campbell's court, the APD's official story hasn't been embraced. Dowell was subpoenaed by Gladden to attend the pre-trial hearing, and to bring with them all written and electronic records – police reports, text messages, emails, pictures and notes – related to their Occupy investigation. But Dowell showed up, essentially, empty-handed. They had photos on a thumb-drive of the boxes and the woman they delivered them to, they testified, but they somehow lost that drive on the way to court; they had emails on a work computer (and, it seems, on a personal computer as well) and phone messages, but they had deleted them. They brought with them only "a little note that I made here regarding [an Occupy] meeting," they said. There are no written police reports, they said; since there was no criminal investigation ongoing, there was no reason to write an official report for the APD system, they testified. Judge Campbell did not seem impressed: "When they are sent a subpoena and they don't respond and they don't come with their own attorney," they said, "I think they lose a little bit of the dignity that they should be carrying themselves with."
Campbell reset the hearing for next week, and has told the state that the state must produce the names of Dowell's APD cohorts, or see the case dismissed. The two other officers are fact witnesses who could help determine whether the police induced the activists' use of the lockboxes. "We need the real name of Rick next week or dismissed," Campbell said.
Regardless of the outcome, Mannix insists that the APD's involvement in Occupy was motivated by a desire to protect free speech, not to impede it. Gladden doesn't see things that way. "It's an old story," they say – as old as the FBI's notorious Counterintelligence Program's hunt for subversives, communists, and civil rights activists. "Basically, it's just a chilling effect, that's what they're trying to do."
Last weekend, I had the opportunity to attend ConnectiCon 2013 in Hartford, CT. While my full report is still in the drafting stages, I do have some news from the convention, mainly a brief interview I conducted with Brian Clevinger, writer of both Atomic Robo and 8-Bit Theater. My friend, and the original person who lent me the Robo volumes, Knight of Alpha joined me with a few questions of their own. Check out the interview after the break!
Silverwolf: How did you get inspired to create Atomic Robo?
Brian Clevinger: Because robots are really cool and history is full of interesting crap, so we [Clevinger, and their partner, artist Scott Wegener] shoved those two together and here we are today.
Silverwolf: Do you have a favorite issue of the series? Or a favorite volume?
Brian Clevinger: No, I like them all for different reasons. I don't know, I've got no answer.
Silverwolf: OK, that's fine. What are some of your favorite comics in general?
Brian Clevinger: Weirdly enough, I'm really digging these old Captain America comics that you can get in the giant Essential black and white collections. I love those because they're just so insane and they just don't even care, it's wonderful.
Knight of Alpha: I've actually got a question. I've noticed your comic titles, at least for the volumes [of Atomic Robo], seem to be based on other works, like The Savage Sword of Dr. Dinosaur and The Savage Sword of Conan, I think one of the future volumes is called Atomic Robo: Diamonds are for Never. Do you get influenced by other works, such as Conan?
Brian Clevinger: Oh yeah! We draw our inspiration from all kinds of movies, fiction, research into non-fiction stuff. Pulp is a big, big influence, especially the vibe you get from that stuff.
Knight of Alpha: I also heard you might be doing something with Mouse Guard in the near future, such as in their upcoming anthology?
Brian Clevinger: No, I don't think we're doing anything related to Mouse Guard.
Silverwolf: Ah all right, a panelist last night mentioned something about it, but I suppose they were mistaken. The panel was actually asking about everyone's favorite Indy and small press comic titles, and I said Atomic Robo!
Brian Clevinger: Yay!
Silverwolf: Do you have any funny stories from your time working on Atomic Robo?
Brian Clevinger: It's honestly really boring. All we do is read. The weird stuff happens here at shows. Like, we had this one guy yesterday, and they were terrifying, and that's all I wanna say.
Silverwolf: I can understand that. What advice would you give aspiring comic creators who are out there?
Brian Clevinger: Do what you love! It sounds really cliche, but that's what got us this far. Practice, I mean, I wrote a comic for about ten years before we started Atomic Robo, and man, having to do a page a day for ten years, it was a hell of a crash course. So just stick with it, read more than just Marvel and DC, there's so much out there, Indy comics are great, read as much nonfiction as you can, cause just learning about people and the world is amazing and gives you great inspiration for stories.
Silverwolf: Great! Well thanks so very much for your time, I appreciate it!
Brian Clevinger: Thank you!

BMW Won't Release Next i Series Model Plug-In Until After 2020
March 24th, 2015 by James Ayre
So while we got both the i3 and the i8 in relatively fast succession, and BMW has announced plans to electrify every model in its fleet, it looks like BMW will be taking its time in taking that line of inquiry (from-the-ground-up electric cars) any further. The company has reportedly only just begun the brainstorming process for the third model in the series.
As with the first two models, the third will also be designed independently from the company's other offerings — in other words, it won't be based on the company's various standard models.
The asupervisorstioned head of R&D, Klaus Froehlich, also made a number of other interesting comments. Gas2 provides more:
Froelich went on to say that the mission of the i sub-brand is to change the perception of how a low-emissions car should look and perform and therefore there are no plans to re-package an existing BMW Group model and call it an i model. That seems to quash any idea that the newly introduced BMW X5 xDrive40e plug-in hybrid SUV is going to morph into the range filling i5 model.
In the meantime, BMW says it will work on improving its i3 and i8 cars. It will also transfer some of the knowledge it has gained from designing and building those two cars to the rest of its production vehicles. Vehicle weight is becoming increasingly important to carmakers eager to increase fuel economy and reduce tailpipe emissions in order to meet ever tightening government regulations around the world. The company's innovative use of carbon fiber technology in the i3 and i8 will most likely lead to more use of carbon fiber components across the entire BMW lineup of automobiles.
Interesting. Increased use of carbon fiber make sense for a number of reasons — it's not exactly surprising to see the company pursuing that line of thought. It is certainly something for which Amory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute have been pushing for a long time.
These comments do make me wonder if BMW's slow approach to the electric vehicle market will leave it in the dust, though. 2020 is quite a ways off….

Everyone in Canada has a sob story.” So said Sport and Persons with Disabilities Minister Kent Hehr to lawyer Fiona Sampson and four other thalidomide survivors in an October meeting. “His lip was curled in a bit of a sneer when they made the ‘sob story' comment,” Sampson told me. “He was mocking and dismissive.”
They even reached out to grab one woman's arm which made them uncomfortable. The woman in question is missing one leg and some internal organs. You don't touch any woman, particularly “thalidomiders,” as they call themselves, without permission, and a competent disabilities minister would know that. This group of thalidomiders were women, and they have it very bad indeed. They were asking Hehr for help after a 2014 House of Commons pledge to fully support them turned to air, as these things tend to without public reminders. Because of their shortened lifespans, five victims have since died, they told him. “So you probably have about 10 years left then now,” Hehr responded.

“That's good news for the Canadian government.” The remarks were a massive unkindness, especially to people who might not have arms or legs, with distorted hands and damaged bodies. In shock after the Hehr meeting, they couldn't get out of the building. The handicapped doors didn't work. “Collectively missing multiple hands, arms, legs, etc. we couldn't get those huge, antique carved oak doors open,” Sampson said. It was awful. After Sampson's public statement, Hill reporters were so astonished by Hehr's quotes that they repeatedly and specifically offered them a chance to explain himself. They could not. Over and over they danced with words. They sounded familiar, the same words that cowardly powerful American sex abusers have been using.
They said the fatal “if” as in “if anyone was unreasonably offended,” and worse, they used the “as someone with a disability,” which sounds much like “as a father of daughters” that American politicians use when they deplete women's rights. Hehr is a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the chest down with only some use of their left hand, which makes the “you don't have it so bad” remark even more contemptuous. It is not their judgment to make. “If there was any physical contact, it was completely accidental,” Hehr said, and we're hearing a lot of that too. If. If.

Hehr's contempt for Parliament was patent. After a Conservative MP asked about their remarks, they twice responded by reading an identical statement off a piece of paper. They did not deny their remarks, but passed them off as unimportant. “While some of my comments were misconstrued, as soon as I learned that my comments were felt to be offensive, I immediately... apologized.” So it's on the thalidomiders. What dopey ladies they are, so unreasonable in their hurt. Sampson, who had initially accepted Hehr's apology with courtesy, now objects. “The fact that Hehr is now saying (in the scrum) that they never said some of the things they definitely said adds to the insult,” they told me. I had been busy on another story as the Hehr news appeared. By sheer chance, it was about Sampson's day job. I have written about it before and always have trouble with it, fearing Star readers might find it too upsetting. People can only take so much. For many years Sampson has headed The Equality Effect, an NGO in Kenya that has helped Kenya pass a law to prosecute men who “defile” or rape little girls, sometimes as a way to cleanse themselves of HIV/AIDS. In the “160 Girls” project, girls at a shelter in Meru (a city north of Nairobi) between the ages of 3 and 17 sued the Kenyan government for failing to protect them from being raped. After a landmark legal fight they won. The Equality Effect has no white saviour complex, quite the opposite. It plants seeds, working in partnership with victims, parents, shelter staff, politicians and police. Thanks partly to Sampson's efforts — they were given an Order of Canada in 2016 — men are now less likely to violently rape children. “It was about legal impunity,” Sampson, born a thalidomide child, told journalist Sally Armstrong. “The pharmaceuticals and governments had impunity when my mother was pregnant with me. The rapists in Kenya also had impunity because the police didn't take the defilement of girls seriously.” And this is the person Hehr mocked. I'm not saying they were inaccurate. Everybody does have a sob story, including Hehr, Sampson and tiny 3-year-old girls who are taken away as they play outside and violently raped by grown men. Meet little Emma who was raped by their stepfather at the age of 2, beaten and left for dead. They totter, their untreated injuries now irreparable. When they see a man, they cover their face and weeps, making it literally a sob story. What makes Sampson different from Hehr is that they didn't react to the children's pain with mockery and a hope that Kenyan taxpayers wouldn't get dinged. Canadians aren't like that. I know that to be true. I don't know what Hehr is doing in Prime Minister Trudeau's cabinet, a place of intellect, decency and feminist fairness. Hehr is inept.  They are blasé about the pain of others, as a newer complaint also reveals. To a woman discussing a class action suit over denial of maternity benefits, Hehr said, Well, Ms. McRae, that is the old question, like asking... ‘When did you stop beating your wife?'” In the House of Commons, they offer rote bafflegab — one reason MPs have lost much public respect — instead of candour. The reasoning behind their appointment came from identity politics, which is fine so far as it goes. But it contains a flaw. The assumption that a disabled minister would understand all kind of disability is not true, just as women are not automatic sustainers of other women. Hehr was pitiless to these braver Thalidomider women who came to them seeking a champion. It was unforgivable. hmallick@thestar.ca

When we think of algae, our mind goes to seaweeds -- a nuisance or curiosity for sea swimmers, or to edible algae used in Far East cuisine delicacies. Few realize that marine algae are used to extract hydrocolloids, such as carrageenan and agar, used extensively as gelling and emulsifying agents in many human foods, worldwide. Yet, even fewer know that marine algae, and namely macro-algae, are currently being investigated for their multifaceted health properties in human and animals. Indeed, seen from a functional feed perspective, the right type or combination of marine algae can offer the following five advantages:
1. Immune modulation
The cell wall of algae is an extremely complex structure composed of distinct polysaccharides. Some of these compounds appear to enhance the immune activity of animals. For example, carrageenans and agar, both polysaccharides from red algae, have been shown to improve the immunomodulating activities in mammals by modifying the activity of macrophages stimulating phagocytosis. In addition, some carrageenans induce a strong activation of macrophages.Ulvans from green algae also exert immunomodulating properties by activating the expression of some cytokines and chemokines involved in innate and adaptive immune response. Such effects are of particular interest in diseases where the immune system is impaired or can benefit from a boost. This is the case, for example, in young animals or during the vaccination period. It is interesting to note that such immunostimulating activities require the presence of sulphated polysaccharides, which abound in algae but are absent from most terrestrial plans.
2. Stimulation of mucin secretion
Intestinal mucins are glycoproteins that coat the luminal surface of the enteric epithelium forming a protective gel that acts as a barrier against mechanical insults, bacterial colonization, bacterial toxins and, of course, from self-digestion. Thus, anything that enhances mucin production (from intestinal goblet cells) will enhance the mucin barrier leading to enhancedanimal gut health. Data from a laboratory trial illustrated that algal polysaccharides (alginate and ulvan) can increase mucin secretion, indeed. The same was true for the fermentation products (acetate and butyrate) of these algal polysaccharides. Although this remains a laboratory study, and as such its results -- albeit interesting -- should be interpreted with care, it is highly likely farm animals will respond in a similar manner, something that pends verification.
3. Management of fat metabolism (digestive health)
Fatty liver syndrome in sows and hens is a perennial problem with no current solution. To this end, certain extracts from algae might prove to be beneficial as they have shown to possess strong activity against hyperlipidemia. In fact, such algae extracts are used to manage high cholesterol in humans. Algae extracts are considered especially powerful in controlling hyperlipidemia because such effects depend on the ion-exchange capacity, something that is found to be particularly strong in algae. It is interesting to note that certain algal polysaccharides, such as agar from brown algae, can combine with calcium salt (unless already saturated with calcium). This might require further elucidation in the case of aging hens that suffer from low calcium absorption.
4. Prebiotic activity
Algae are rich in polysaccharides that bypass digestion at the upper parts of the gut and can serve as substrate for microbial growth at the lower part of the gut (two conditions necessary for all prebiotics). Such polysaccharides include alginates (up to 45 percent in certain algae), laminarin and fucans, whereas commercial products usually contain a varying mixture (extract) of many diverse polysaccharides. Studies conducted with young pigs indicated that products based on laminarin provide a prebiotic effect similar to that of lactose: marine algal extracts improved growth, most likely due to enhanced counts of beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria) against those of pathogenic orientation (colibacteria). The possible lactose-replacement effect is of particular interest as it can offer substantial feed cost savings. In addition, a recent study indicated that adding a brown algal product in broiler feeds provided the same growth-promoting effects as inulin (another prebiotic) and (or) virginiamycin (a common antibiotic). As such, algal products may offer a new alternative to antibiotic-free nutrition programs for non-ruminant animals.
5. Interaction of algal polysaccharides and clay for mycotoxin management
Research based on a modified clay product indicated that treatment with algal polysaccharides increases the absorptive capacity of clay. This in turn results in a significant increase in mycotoxin binding capacity of the modified clay. Interestingly, such treatment allows for lower clay inclusion rates (from the usual 10 down to 1 kg per metric tone), under normal mycotoxin contamination levels, something that reduces or eliminates the problem of vitamin binding by the clay. A low-inclusion anti-mycotoxin product offers substantial savings in the formulation and logistics of feed supplement packages.
Cab company Ola charged a Mumbai resident Rs 149 crore for a 300-metre ride
Sushil Narsian was charged Rs 149 crore for a minute-long ride
@SushilNarsian Thanks for pointing out the glitch, Sushil. We've corrected the issue at our end.
Here's a small token of our gratitude. Pls check your DM pic.twitter.com/jxeJ3unlLD — Ola (@Olacabs) April 4, 2017
Mumbai resident Sushil Narsian will not forget April 1, 2017. They booked a cab from their residence in Mulund West to Vakola Market but the driver could not locate their house via maps because their phone stopped working. So, Mr Narsian started walking towards the driver but by the time they reached the pick-up point, the driver had cancelled the ride.When they tried booking another cab, Mr Narsian saw something that must have felt like a cruel April Fools' joke. They were unable to book a cab because they had an outstanding amount of Rs 1,49,10,51,648. That's over Rs 149 crore if you had trouble calculating. The cab company also deducted the 127 rupees they already had in this mobile wallet. All this for a 300-metre ride."Initially, I thought it was an April Fools' prank", Mr Narsian told NDTV. They got in touch with the company on social media . The company informed them that it was a technical glitch. They refunded their money and fixed the 149-crore-anomaly within two hours.As a bonus, the company offered them a coupon for the inconvenience they faced. The code to claim the coupon was the same number as the pending amount that showed up on their app. Social media was amused to see the whopping taxi bill."149 crores ??? Where was the trip drop location ?? Pluto or Neptune ?", wondered a user on Facebook."Check if they pulled a 1st April special on you. Though I would never trust them", wrote another.Sushil Narsian told NDTV that they have no grudges against the company and continues to use the app.Hope it doesn't happen again.

As an experiment, we added discounted one-week microtransaction bundles - the Darkness Pack and Wild Packs We have a good understanding of how many people purchased one bundle or both, but we want to better understand why people purchased neither bundle. If you didn't buy a bundle, please answer the poll to indicate why. Thanks for the feedback!
Where is the: "Didn't feel like it" Option? Or the: "didn't want to buy the deamon bundle because To cleave claw effect has no use to anyone because cleave was nerfed into the ground and reave is now more vaible" Option?
Hmm , I kind of want an option that says : I never buy cosmetic microtransactions , I did however sponsor the game quite a few time with stash tab buys and a closed beta acces pack. So I couldn't vote that I'm not interested in microtransactions. Love you guys !
Bundle price is fine. But if you run a sale on a bundle, you must run an equally discounted sale on all items within the bundle. "This week! Discount on all "Darkness" themed items! Buy the entire bundle and save extra points!"
Personally, I'm really only likely to buy a bundle if I want everything it includes; a single item I'll probably never equip dramatically lowers the savings a bundle purchase would net me. I feel like Antlers and Twisted Horns are helmet effects that only mesh with the look a specific subset of the player base wants on their character, though the other things were great. Then again, I haven't actually bought anything yet. When that black cat goes back on sale in a few months, though, I'll be on it like a bonnet.
Taking uberX everywhere is now cheaper for me than owning a car (I have an expensive car, so it's not a super fair comparison, but I still think it's interesting).
I first played around with one of those web calculators and was so surprised by the result I sharpened my pencil and did it myself with more precise numbers. It was not quite as dramatic as the rough calculation but Uber still wins. I linked to the spreadsheet below for anyone curious; change the yellow fields to your own numbers if you'd like.
A few notes:
*I live in San Francisco and drive a Tesla Roadster. It costs about $10 to charge (on average, sometimes I pay peak rates and sometimes not) for about 200 miles of range.
If I can easily take the Caltrain to the south bay (about half the time), then I do, otherwise I drive or take Uber. My total annual spend on Caltrain is a few hundred dollars.
*My cost per mile is probably lower than most peoples', but is somewhat neutralized by the higher depreciation which is partly due to battery pack degradation.
*Uber may raise the rates on uberX, which could swing my particular calculation back in favor of ownership.
*I used an average cost per mile for uberX of $2, which is a good average for me including time and minimum fares (it's much more on short trips, but a little under $1.50 on long trips).
This of course leaves out the huge intangible of how much nicer it is not to drive and instead work/text/think/whatever.
This calculation is why I think Uber is still undervalued. The people who say Uber is only worth $4 billion or whatever don't think enough about people like me who will go from spending ~$500 a year on taxis and car service to ~$12,000 now that the experience and cost have reached a tipping point.
A Column for Women
Women learn early on that sex is a weapon and a tool.
We know that people want us, and that we can get things -- dates, popularity, financial rewards, orgasm, to name but a few -- when we wield it. We also learn that the women who employ this tool are punished, covertly (through reputation) or overtly (through legislation) for using it.
As females, we are told from birth that recreational sex is wrong. When we get older, we are told it is for procreation. When we seroconvert we are told that we are vectors of virus and should abstain. All throughout, we are sold ideas as to how, when, and with whom we should be engaging in sex.
Women throughout the ages have been punished for exhibiting their sexuality, while at the same time, iconized as sex-symbols. We have been treated, and taught to see ourselves, as victims of male prowess. We are taught to look at our sexual behavior as submission to, rather than desire for, sex. It becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle ourselves from this web of power-imbalance between men and women and self-perception and public perception of women as sexual beings. It is much easier to see ourselves as victims rather than participants.

When a woman has HIV disease, the power imbalance is perceived to have changed. They become a sexual predator, and must be stopped, through legislation, or worse. The idea that a woman may be a healthy, sexually active person living with HIV disease is an anachronism. It is unfathomable. By the mere fact of them having this sexually transmitted disease, they are seen as "dirty" and/or "dangerous".
Consensual, but illegal
Pamela Wiser, an HIV-positive woman in Tennessee, is facing up to 12 years in prison for two counts of criminal exposure to HIV, a Class C felony.
Wiser alleges that they disclosed their HIV status to their partners and that the sex acts were consensual. Tennessee law states that "a person commits the offense of criminal exposure of another to HIV when, knowing that such person is infected with HIV, such person knowingly engage in intimate contact with another," which is described as "the exposure of the body of one person to a bodily fluid of another person in any manner that presents a significant risk of HIV transmission."
Adults have sex for a myriad of reasons. Sometimes it is out of anger. Sometimes it is to win someone's love or attention. Sometimes it's just to get off, and, of course, sometimes it is to procreate. There is no right or wrong reason to have sex if both parties are willingly engaging in the act.
Sexuality is biological. Sometimes we "think with our dicks" (or, in a woman's case, our clits). Many of us know those morning-after feelings of regret or elation. It is ridiculous, not to mention impossible, to legislate a person's motivation for having sex, regardless of a person's HIV-status, and that seems to be the crux of this particular case, even more so than the HIV status of either party. The press has been all over how they were "seeking revenge" and was out to "punish the world."
Is it a crime?
The real question, of course, is: Is it criminal for a person with HIV to engage in sex? The answer from a moral, human (and my) point of view is obviously "no."
Accepting the fact of legislation that has passed, however, for the duration of this article, I am forced to consider the law as the law. I wonder where the criminal activity actually springs from. Is it more criminal to have consensual sex after disclosing your HIV-positive status than it is to agree to having sex with someone you know is HIV-positive, or to have sex with someone whose HIV status you don't know? Consensuality implies complicity, and the burden of responsibility falls on each individual to act with integrity and with the maximum amount of knowledge available to them. I don't know that it is possible to legislate personal responsibility or integrity.
As far as personal responsibility is concerned, it would seem ridiculous to hold someone you just picked up, or an anonymous sexual contact responsible for your health. If you wouldn't give your house keys, ATM card or even phone number to this person, why should you hold them responsible for protecting your health? To rely on someone's disclosure is flagrantly irresponsible.
I am not saying that taking calculated risks, or making an informed decision to have sex, protected or not, with an HIV-positive person, or a stranger, is stupid, but to hold them wholly responsible for the outcome -- that is. However, now there are laws that enforce that sort of irresponsibility. This is a country that coddles its victims, and we revel in being victims. I do believe that there is no way to place blame on any one individual in a mutual situation. Punitive action only enforces people's prejudice, fear, and distaste surrounding HIV.
In the case of Pamela Wiser, the public and the press are ready, willing and able to envision a revenge-crazed woman out to take the world of men down with them Is 12 years in prison enough for them to pay for the crime of being sexually active? And what price does the man who infected them have to pay? Where are the criminal charges against him? They didn't get HIV from nowhere. If someone is responsible for transmission of HIV, and it isn't the "innocent victims" -- the one-night-stands they picked up and brought to a cheap hotel room who agreed to unprotected intercourse -- and it isn't their (now) ex-boyfriend, why in the world has the blame all been brought to their hand? What are they actually being punished for?
Making room for ideas
There is little room in the public arena for women to express their sexuality. If the women are HIV-infected, there is less still.
Because of this lack of public discourse, I decided to start a magazine, Dentata, focusing on HIV-positive women and the people involved with them. We hope to take a step back from the current ways of addressing HIV and women's sexuality.
Right now we are trying to ascertain what our potential readership would be interested in seeing, so I am completely open and (pretty much) without an agenda as to where the magazine is going. The onus of the magazine is simple: to give voice to women living with HIV disease who are still (or who still want to) engage in sex. I hope to present a forum for that voice. And to give voice to men and women who are engaging in sex with HIV-positive women, whether that partner is HIV-positive or not. I hope that we get fun stories, interesting experiences and lively discussion.
I don't want this magazine to be political, inasmuch as sex can be apolitical. I don't want it to be based in the current theories and trends of prevention. For once, instead of telling people how to have sex, we want to hear from the people who are having it.
We all know that HIV disease isn't a laughing matter, but we can find humor (albeit gallows humor) in any situation. We came up with the name Dentata from the concept of "vagina dentata": the vagina with teeth. The dangerous and powerful sexuality that women possess that seems to intimidate or scare people, including women, from expressing their sexuality in a healthy way; HIV-positive or not.
With that, I hope that you find interest in submitting something, or at least passing this information on to anyone you think might enjoy contributing.
By 1979, The Grateful Dead was closing in on a decade and a half of recording and touring, were headlining arenas on the regular, and the non-countercultural media was becoming reasonably certain that Jerry and the boys were, you know, not just a fad. Enter Evening Magazine, a television news features program that aired locally on CBS-3; they caught up with the Dead and their devout Deadheads at The Spectrum in this segment that aired on November 6, 1979.
After some amazing reactions from the energized and very Philly-accented crowd (“Best band in rock and roll!” “It's a way of life! Peace, man, you know?”), the reporter – who we haven't been able to identify, but if you know who they are, let us know in the comments! – informs the viewers that, no , The Grateful Dead is in fact not dead (heh) and takes us to a backstage interview with founding members Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir.
Some highlights: the guys really don't like being pegged as a 60s band, as the reporter does in their first question, but Garcia sums up the 70s as “people scratching their heads about the 60s, seemingly. ‘What happened in the 60s?'” The legendary shows the Dead played at the great pyramids of Egypt were recalled as “spooky.” Also, this great quote from Weir about what keeps them going: “You can't have fun without adventure. And if it's not fun, I can't picture doing it for the rest of my life, or for the next year, or the next two weeks.”

Image copyright Met Police Image caption Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston
A man apprehended by police in an east London shop did not swallow a controlled substance before they died, the police watchdog has said.
Rashan Charles was followed by officers in Dalston on 22 July and became ill after putting an object in their mouth.
Their death sparked a number of protests, including one which turned violent.
An item removed from their airways was not a controlled substance, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has found.
It did not reveal what the item was but said it was awaiting the preliminary results of a post-mortem examination, which was carried out on Monday.
Image copyright PA Image caption Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Mr Charles
"The IPCC has now received results of forensic analysis of an object that was removed from Rashan's airway by paramedics," a statement said.
"The object did not contain a controlled substance."
Mr Charles's family has been informed.
'Follow the evidence'
Officers had followed the 20-year-old on foot after attempting to stop a car on Kingsland Road.
CCTV showed Mr Charles entering a shop pursued by a uniformed police officer, after which there was a struggle on the floor.
In the footage, they appeared to put their hand to their mouth and became ill shortly after.
A force medic provided first aid at the scene but Mr Charles died later in hospital.
The IPCC said it was continuing to collect and analyse evidence, including "police body worn footage" and other CCTV.
The statement added: "We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have".

Creepers are common stealthy hostile mobs who silently approach players and explode shortly after coming within 3 blocks of their targets. Due to their distinctive appearance and high potential for killing unwary players as well as damaging the environment and players' constructions, creepers have become one of the icons of Minecraft, notorious both among players and non-players.
Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well as the only renewable way to obtain music discs. When struck by lightning, a creeper becomes charged, which substantially amplifies its explosion power.
Spawning
Creepers naturally spawn in the Overworld on top of solid blocks with a light level of 7 or less.
Drops
Creepers drop when killed:
Behavior
A creeper giving chase and about to explode.
Creepers will chase after any player, as long as it is within a 16 block (±5%) radius and ±4 blocks vertically. The detection range of creepers is reduced to half of their normal range (8 blocks) when the player is wearing a creeper mob head.‌[Java Edition only]
Creepers can climb up ladders and vines like any other mob, but do not do so intentionally.
When within three blocks of a player, a creeper will stop moving, hiss loudly, start flashing and inflating, and explode after 1.5 seconds. A creeper's detonation can be halted if the player gets out of the blast radius (7 blocks), including by knocking back the creeper or killing it. Creepers can be forced to explode by using a flint and steel.
Creepers will flee from ocelots and cats if one is too close, until they are approximately 16 blocks away from the feline(s).
Normal creeper explosions have a power of 3.
If a creeper is inflicted with a status effect, its explosion will create an area effect cloud of the effect.
Creepers are never targeted by any mobs, other than withers, snow golems, and vindicators named "Johnny". If they are hit by a stray projectile, they will retaliate only if not already chasing a player.
Charged Creeper
Two creepers' explosion damage radius in sand. Comparison between a charged creeper's (left) and a normal creeper's (right).
A charged creeper is a more powerful variant of a creeper.
A charged creeper is created only when lightning strikes within 3–4 blocks of a normal creeper or when hit by a trident with the Channeling enchantment during a thunderstorm, which significantly increases its explosive power. Charged creepers are distinguished from normal creepers by the blue aura surrounding them.
Their countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time. With a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a regular creeper (see image). How close the creeper was to the lightning strike will not affect the size of the explosion.
Charged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers. The only difference is that the value of the boolean "powered" tag is set to "1" (true).
Charged creeper explosions that kill zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, or other creepers cause one of those mobs to drop the corresponding mob head. They will not drop their own head. Players or ender dragons will not drop their heads.
Video
Data values
Creepers have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the mob.
Entity data Tags common to all entities see Template:Nbt inherit/entity/template Tags common to all mobs see Template:Nbt inherit/mob/template powered : 1 or 0 (true/false) - May not exist. True if the creeper is charged from being struck by lightning. ExplosionRadius : The radius of the explosion itself, default 3. Fuse : States the initial value of the creeper's internal fuse timer (does not affect creepers that fall and explode upon impacting their victim). The internal fuse timer will return to this value if the creeper is no longer within attack range. Default 30. ignited : 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether the creeper has been ignited by a Flint and Steel.

Trivia
A sight that can scare even the most courageous players.
Notch stated on Twitter that "I imagine [Creepers] as being made out of leaves or similar. I'm not sure why they explode." [4]
When asked to describe the physical texture of a creeper, Notch said they would feel "crunchy, like dry leaves". [5]
Creepers are their bright green color because Notch tried to make them well camouflaged for the original classic Minecraft textures, which were very bright shades of green. This would make them extremely dangerous as they would be harder to notice from a distance.
In multiplayer, if a creeper is attacked by another player, and the other player runs out of sight, it will not attack any other players.
When about to detonate, creepers will cease movement and its head will face directly forward.
When asked how creepers trigger their explosive nature, Dinnerbone said "They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire". [6]
If the player is at full health, a creeper blast at point-blank range for a player with full iron armor on hard difficulty will knock them down to 1 (
Creepers are faster when fleeing cats than when chasing players.
If a charged creeper is given invisibility, the "aura" effect will still be visible.
If a player or another mob is standing on the same block as a charged creeper when it explodes, they will have experienced the greatest amount of damage any mob in the game can do at one time.
Publicity
Creepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt players and destroy structures. Their distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely-recognizable Minecraft icon. Creepers are referenced in several of the items available at the Minecraft merchandise depot,[7] and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, web comic references, and demotivational posters. A central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating:
"That'sssss a very nice <random valuable object> you've got there... It'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it..."[8]

Wide receiver Jared Abbrederis will get a chance to continue their NFL career with the Lions.
The Lions announced on Monday that they have signed Abbrederis to a reserve/future contract that will make them part of the team's 90-man roster this offseason.
Abbrederis was a fifth-round pick of the Packers in 2014 and saw action in 15 games for the team before being placed on and then released from injured reserve in October of this year. They caught 10 passes for 119 yards.
Anquan Boldin and Andre Roberts are both set to become free agents in March, leaving Marvin Jones, Golden Tate and T.J. Jones as receivers who saw time on offense this season and are under contract for 2017.

In Tim Pawlenty's recent autobiography Courage to Stand, the word “abortion” only appears once in nearly 300 pages sketching their life story and record as governor of Minnesota. Pawlenty blandly characterizes abortion as a “lightning-rod issue associated with social policy,” and goes on only to say “I'm pro-life.” Ad Policy
This is the sort of book politicians write to introduce themselves to a national audience—but here and in most other speeches and interviews, Pawlenty seems reluctant to talk about their views on abortion. The issues page of their campaign website contains only one reference to their abortion stance, a three-sentence statement on the annual March for Life.
In reality, however, Pawlenty's views on a woman's right to choose are among the more extreme in the emerging GOP field. National Review dubbed Pawlenty as possibly “the strongest pro-life candidate in 2012.” Under Pawlenty, who is an evangelical Christian, Minnesota was the first state to give women bogus information on “fetal pain” in an effort to dissuade them from having an abortion. They also signed laws providing women with information about “alternatives” to abortion, which became a model for other states, and has engaged in years of direct outreach to extreme antichoice groups.
“The more women voters learn about Governor Pawlenty's anti–women's health record, the more impossible it will be for them to pick up the support of independent voters in the general election,” said Dawn Laguens of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
That may be true, but Pawlenty first needs to win over the social conservative base that dominates crucial states like Iowa and South Carolina. There's a lot for them to like.
Less than one year into their governorship, Pawlenty signed the Women's Right to Know Act of 2003. The law required physicians to provide women with information about abortion alternatives at least twenty-four hours prior to the procedure, including a list of adoption centers, detailed information about fetal development, and a description of the risks associated with abortion procedures.
Shortly after the law was enacted, controversy erupted over the information the Minnesota Department of Health was providing to women. On its website, MDH claimed that several studies had found a link between induced abortion and breast cancer rates, a long-debunked claim of antichoice activists. This prompted the nonpartisan Minnesota Medical Association to criticize MDH and demand the information be removed, lest the episode “erode the Department's credibility.” In a letter to Pawlenty, the Minnesota Public Health Association, another nonpartisan group, said the state health department “should not be used to advance a political opinion.”
In the midst of the controversy, Pawlenty's state health commissioner admitted that those areas of the department's website were developed not by medical experts but rather in consultation with Minnesota Citizen's Concerned for Life, a leading antichoice group in the state.
It's impossible to know how many women were dissuaded from getting an abortion based on this faulty information, though in the first full year under the Women's Right to Know Act, 15,859 pregnant women were given the state's information, and 13,788 went through with the procedure.
Two years later, Pawlenty signed the Unborn Child Prevention Act, making Minnesota the first state in the nation to mandate that pregnant women considering an abortion receive information about “fetal pain.”
Though the position of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that there is “no legitimate scientific information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain,” the law requires abortion doctors and referring physicians to inform pregnant women seeking an abortion that “pain-reducing medication” is available for their fetus. Women in Minnesota seeking an abortion must now sign a form either requesting or refusing pain-reducing medication for their unborn child.
Currently, sixteen states are following Pawlenty's lead in Minnesota and trying to enact “fetal pain” bills. Nebraska has already enacted such a law, and similar bills have passed both legislative houses in Kansas, Oklahoma and Idaho. Indiana and Iowa have passed fetal pain bills in one chamber.
Pawlenty also never missed an opportunity to appoint strongly antichoice jurists to the Minnesota Supreme Court, appointing four judges that openly disagree with Roe v. Wade.
In 2008 they named Eric Magnuson chief justice of the court. Manguson has a long record of opposing abortion rights, and once wrote an amicus brief on behalf of an antichoice group arguing that taxpayer money shouldn't go to abortion services.
Interestingly, National Review credits Pawlenty's record on judges to their wife, Mary, a former judge that converted Pawlenty from Catholicism to evangelical Christianity during their courtship. “Although pro-life voters appreciated the pro-life actions of presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and George W. Bush, their wives did not share their prolife perspective. Mary Pawlenty, an evangelical who attended Bethel College, is a heartfelt prolife advocate who combines a passion for the unborn with an acute political and legal mind,” noted a blog post by the editor of LifeNews.com and published on the National Review website.
Beyond these substantive measures, Pawlenty has made many symbolic overtures to the antichoice movement. They declared April 2010 “Abortion Recovery/Awareness Month” in Minnesota. Their proclamation noted that “many organizations in Minnesota promote policies that reinforce a culture of life and hope,” and encouraged women who had abortions to seek their help.
They also issued proclamations that darkly observed the day Roe v. Wade was decided. Speaking at an antichoice rally on the 2006 anniversary of the decision, Pawlenty said, “We have a dream today that someday soon this will not be an anniversary of sadness, but an anniversary of justice restored.”
Pawlenty didn't always hold such radical views on a woman's right to choose; in 1991 they told a reporter that “the abortion issue wasn't a big deal to him.” Their rightward lurch is unmistakable, however, and can be seen in several other areas of social policy, including gay rights. ThinkProgress has a report documenting Pawlenty's “evolving homophobia,” including their recent veto of a bill that would have allowed same-sex partners to recover damages in the event of a wrongful death.
These positions will no doubt help Pawlenty among the strong evangelical base in Iowa, the caucus many think they must win in order to have a shot at the nomination. But it's only a matter of time before the former governor will have to be more upfront about their deep opposition to a woman's right to choose–not least because pro-choice groups don't plan to leave them an option. “As this primary campaign evolves, we will make sure that Americans, especially independent voters who will be a deciding factor in the general election, are turned off not only by Pawlenty's lackluster campaign style, but their extreme anti-choice positions as well,” said Ted Miller, communications director for NARAL Pro-Choice America.
“You change for two reasons: Either you learn enough that you want to, or you've been hurt enough that you have to.” ~Unknown
I learned about boundary work when I was teaching in the NYC jails with male prisoners.
After driving onto a maximum security island of electric, clanging gates, I encountered metal detectors, hallways filled with yelling, chaotic inmates, and tension and anxiety in the air that was almost tangible.
I started my work day tensed up and ended it drained, exhausted, and overwhelmed.
In other areas of my life, the same thing was happening. In my personal relationships, I couldn't find the edges where I ended and others began. I sometimes felt powerless, unsure of who I was in relationships, and unheard. I wasn't sure how to change my life, but I knew that I had to.
Because I didn't set healthy personal boundaries, I was exhausted, I couldn't focus, and I felt consumed by drama around me, in both my personal and professional lives. As I result, I dealt with a lot of conflict, failed to take care of myself, and generally disliked my work.
Since I knew I loved my work, I took some time to reflect on why my job wasn't working for me. I then decided to try some experimenting.
I started doing a little boundary and grounding work each morning before I even entered each facility. At the end of each day, before I went home to my baby, I did a short releasing meditation in my car.
It worked so well that I began to notice a marked difference in the flow of the classes I taught, my relationships with my students, and my overall enjoyment of the day. I left energized and excited by my work, as opposed to drained and burnt out.
I was able to go home and be completely present with my daughter, instead of taking my day with me and letting it creep into our evening.
My boundary work has been crucial in my personal relationships, as well. As I started doing this work to protect myself and center myself in the jails, I realized that I could do it with the people in my personal life, too.
I began to see immediate effects in my relationships, as well as in the quality of my everyday life.
Even though I no longer work in prisons and jails, I still do this work just about every morning. When I let it slip, when I don't take time to ground myself and honor my boundaries, I can feel a big difference.
Nowhere has this work impacted my life more than in my personal relationships. I used to feel like every person who I spent a lot of time with blew me around as I got caught up in their life. I noticed myself taking on aspects of their personalities and lifestyle and losing myself.
After doing this work, I now surround myself with people who are really attracted to me because of who I am. How I show up in the world: by my strength, my motivation, my passion—how absolutely me I am.
And I stay me. It's not even a struggle. I am centered in who I am and what I love and I have my boundaries in place, so the people and circumstances around me can't shake that.
If you'd also like to maintain healthy boundaries to feel more centered, these three steps will be a good start:
1. Check your personal engine light.
Think about how you feel when you're around someone who drains you and upsets you, someone with whom you feel you lose yourself. How does this feel in your body? How does it feel in your mind? How does the presence of this person affect you?
Now look at this list of feelings and sensations you've made, and imagine that your body is like a car, with a dashboard full of warning lights.
You've just identified what I like to call the “check engine light” for your personal boundary system. It's a security system warning that your personal energy field has been breached, and you're letting in stuff that isn't yours.
This is really important. When our boundaries are weak, unguarded, or unclear, we let in all sorts of stuff that isn't actually our stuff, and we give away our own personal energy unconsciously.
That means you're dealing with a breach of your energetic security system and a leak of your own personal energy. You're looking at warning signs indicating that some work needs to be done, some boundaries need to be shored up, and you need to return to center.
2. Ground yourself as preparation for maintaining boundaries.
Grounding is akin to the way a tree sinks their roots to stay secure in a storm. It's the first tool in creating healthy boundaries—nurturing a connection with ourselves, our centers.
Our root system is both our anchor and our boundary system. It keeps us from being blown about in other people's winds. It gives us a way to focus and still ourselves to connect with our heart and our intuition. That's what keeps us steady and connected and focused.
There are as many ways to ground as there are people. I like to take five minutes to actually imagine my root system connecting me into the earth, like a giant oak tree. Here are some other ideas:
Meditating
Saying a prayer, affirmation, or mantra in the shower in the morning
Offering a blessing over your morning meal or beverage
Chanting or repeating affirmations in your head as you walk to work or school
Try different ways—you'll find the one that works for you!
3. Notice the people and places that tend to drain you.
Before entering those places or exposing yourself to those people, take a few minutes to imagine breathing a bubble of protective energy around you. Think of it as a space that will only allow love and positivity inside it, deflecting anything else. Really see it and really feel the force of it around you. Then recognize what you need to do to maintain that space.
These three steps will help you create and maintain healthy boundaries. Building boundaries is like any muscle or practice—the more you work with it, the better it serves you!

Children born with albinism in Tanzania live in constant danger of being attacked by people looking to profit from superstitious beliefs. About one in 20,000 people is born with albinism, lacking pigment in their hair, skin, and eyes. In Tanzania, according to reporting from the Thomson Reuters Foundation, albino body parts are highly valued in witchcraft and can fetch a high price: “Superstition leads many to believe albino children are ghosts who bring bad luck. Some believe the limbs are more potent if the victims scream during amputation, according to a 2013 United Nations report.” Reuters also notes, “The United Nations estimates about 75 albinos have been killed in the east African nation since 2000 and have voiced fears of rising attacks ahead of this year's election, as politicians seek good luck charms from witch doctors." Reuters photographer Carlo Allegri recently documented the lives of several Tanzanian children receiving care in New York after being brutalized in their home country.
The boy is understood to have sent a message via the site on Wednesday
A British teenager who took a drugs overdose has been saved after the American girl they were chatting to online raised the alarm.
The 16-year-old boy from Oxfordshire had sent them a message suggesting they intended to commit suicide.
Although they did not know where they lived, calls via the White House and the British Embassy enabled Abingdon police to save the boy's life.
The boy, who has not been named, made a full recovery after hospital treatment.
Still conscious
It is believed that they were using the social networking site late on Wednesday night and sent a private message to a girl in Maryland saying that they were going to harm himself.
They told their mother, who called local police.
The police called a "special agent" at the White House, the British Embassy in Washington and finally the police control room in Abingdon.
Staff narrowed down their location to eight possible addresses, and officers found the teenager at the fourth house they tried. They had taken an overdose, but was still conscious.
Either left with no option by the studio, or simply a lack of expertise in the field, most directors aren't heavily involved in the marketing of their films. Stanley Kubrick, as one might expect, didn't fall into that category. Once they were able to (fairly quickly) cement their status as an unparalleled auteur, they had a hand in every aspect of their films, from development to exhibition (going as far as selecting a list of theaters he'd want their films to play in).
This was certainly the case with their 1980 psychological horror feature The Shining, and now we've got a peek behind the process thanks to the currently touring Stanley Kubrick exhibition. After working with Saul Bass on storyboards for Spartacus, Kubrick got in touch with the designer some 20 years later to design the poster for their Stephen King adaptation.
While the final result is the iconic, yellow one-sheet, there were a number of iterations, and we can now see the rejected ones. Drawing from different aspects of the film, including the maze, the hotel, and the family unit, there's some striking imagery, but we can see why Kubrick went with the one they did.
Featuring handwritten notes by the director, check out the rejected poster designs below from Design Buddy and TOH (via Open Culture), along with a cover letter from Bass explaining what they sent, as well as Kubrick's response. For more on the film, check out a recent video analysis and Vivian Kubrick‘s behind-the-scenes documentary.

Etymology Edit
The origin of sense 1 (“a state of bliss”) is uncertain; however, the following etymology has been suggested:
The first edition of the International Cloud Atlas (1896),[1] which defined ten types of cloud, described the ninth type as the cumulonimbus which rises to 10 km (6.2 miles), the highest a cloud can be.[2]
Compare cloud seven (“state of complete happiness or euphoria”),[3] which may have originated from confusion of cloud nine with seventh heaven.[2]
Sense 2 (“a state of fantastic or impractical dreaming or thinking”) may be due to a confusion between sense 1 and the phrase head in the clouds.

A man splashed an unknown liquid in a girl's face and called them a “white b–ch” as they were getting off a school bus in Queens, officials said.
The 13-year-old had just stepped off the bus near the corner of Lefferts Boulevard and 101st Avenue in Richmond Hill when the man accosted them around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, police said.
“This is for you, white b–ch,” they shouted before throwing the substance in their face.
The attacker then fled north toward 97th Avenue, but not before the victim managed to snap a photo of them with my cellphone.
The child was taken to Jamaica Hospital for eye irritation. Police said they were not seriously injured and they are still working to figure out what the substance was.
The suspect is approximately 30 years old, bald and was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt with a red shirt underneath, police said.

As new investment rejuvenates Brookland, WMATA is seeking a developer to build at the Brookland Metro station. But neighbors and local nonprofit Casey Trees want to ensure that future development leaves room for green space as well.
The proposed development with amendments as envisioned by neighbors, including a preserved Brookland Green (in red). All images from Brookland Bridge.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) plans to seek a developer to build a mixed-use joint development on the property surrounding the Metro station, including the bus bays, a kiss-and-ride lot and a vacant lot along Michigan Avenue NE. Also slated for development is what residents call the Brookland Green, an approximately .75 acre green space adjacent to the Metro station entrance that boasts 20 mature trees.
Neighbors are asking WMATA to amend their joint development solicitation to preserve the Brookland Green. They have the support of Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie and Casey Trees, a nonprofit organization based in Brookland best known for planting trees. They feel that it is not only possible, but also more desirable to redevelop the Brookland Metro station while preserving this park space as a core asset for the growing number of DC residents that call Brookland home.
The “Brookland Green.”
Building around Metro stations like Brookland, typically referred to as a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is more sustainable than traditional development because it puts people near public transportation, reducing their dependence on automobiles. While the presence of transit and density are two components of TOD, truly sustainable communities also provide access to green space and trees.
Preserving the Brookland Green fits with Mayor Gray's Vision for a Sustainable DC, which recognizes the benefits of trees. The plan sets goals to provide parks or natural space within a ten-minute walk of all residents, as well as to increase tree canopy coverage to 40% across the District.
Research indicates that the green spaces we experience everyday have a greater influence on our health and wellbeing than those that we visit occasionally. Our major national parks, such as the National Arboretum, the National Mall and Rock Creek Park, are wonderful places to visit. But the Brookland Green's proximity to the Metro provides a greater number of people with the daily access to nature and can improve the surrounding urban environment, by decreasing stormwater runoff, filtering our air and cooling the city.
Furthermore, the presence of trees near business districts can enhance sales: several studies have shown that people are willing to visit more frequently and travel farther to business districts with trees, and they are also willing to pay an average of 12% more for goods and services in these areas.
The Brookland Metro station is fortunate to have an existing amenity that provides both of these elements of green space and a lush tree canopy to its residents. So why should we not preserve that within the new development?

My name is SaeberTheDude, these are the interviews I have achieved with Monstercat musicians before I was banned by Monstercat sub-reddit staff for a comment I deleted in less than a minute. These interviews were never the best, quite embarrassing actually, very low quality. I had quite a few unreleased interviews that didn't quite work out due to the responses, that will more than likely never be released, I had fun doing these though. All I can say right now, is that I'm still in the presence among you in the Monstercat sub-reddit. Man, I would say so much more about my experience, but I would rather not get the person posting this to the Monstercat sub-reddit for me in trouble. But, you can private message the person posting this if you have any questions.
Thank you for all the support on these interviews. But since this was the end of my account, it looks like its the end of the interviews. Thank you so much to all the interviewees for giving up time to answer the questions I had for them (sorry if I was ever a bad host haha).
Thanks for reading!
A giant painting of an erect penis that appeared overnight on the side of a New York apartment building proved to have little staying power after painting crews covered it only a few days after it first popped up.
Like an unwanted gift of a Yule log, the super-sized painting appeared overnight on Christmas Eve on a building on the Lower East Side, the New York Post reported. Neither residents nor the owner of 303 Broome St. were aware that the mural of the turgid member was about to appear on the side of the building that night.
Swedish street artist Carolina Falkholt took credit on Instagram for the massive graffiti. “NO TIME 4 BALL$$ … I have never heard so much laughter and seen so many happy faces behind my back when painting as for today doing this wall on Broome Street,” the artist said.
The artist has indulged their penchant for giant genitalia before. In 2015, Falkholt painted a giant vagina on the side of a building in Sweden.
Authorities are reportedly looking into the possibility of charging the artist for the graffiti, but no action has been taken to date.
One resident of the building next to mural was not amused by the whole thing.
“It's ugly,” said Qun Chen, 47, whose third-story apartment has a full view of the thing. “There are a lot of kids that live in this building and in the neighborhood — it's not good for the kids, they're little.”
The building's owner, Samy Mahfar, was also less than pleased that their building served as Falkholt's canvas. Once workers were finished with their Christmas holiday, Mahfar hired a painting crew to immediately whitewash the painting.
Along with the owner, the building's management also felt like they got the shaft when the apartment building became the graffiti artist's target. “The artist did not receive permission, we are extremely embarrassed and painting over it as quickly as possible,” SMA Equities said in a statement to the press.
Local parent Naomi Peña was unhappy with the sudden appearance of the painting.
“I am all for street art. I appreciate street art,” Peña told the media. “It's one thing if you want to keep that art in your home, but when you put it on public display that becomes an issue.”
Peña also said the painting was offensive and was bad for the neighborhood's children.
By Wednesday afternoon, the painters hired to eliminate the graffiti had done their work and the whole affair was just a bad memory.

Another day another data breach, this time it is Ancestry.com, the United States-based genealogy company operating a large network of genetic, historical and genealogical websites with over 2 million paying subscribers.
Ancestry and RootsWeb
One of Ancestry's service is RootsWeb that is an online community consisting of forums and mailing lists etc to assist people in exploring the history of their family tree. Now, the bad news for RootsWeb users is that the community suffered a data breach in which usernames, email, and passwords of 300,000 registered users were stolen and leaked online in clear text format.
The data was discovered by Troy Hunt, founder of data breach notification website HaveIbeenPwned. Hunt did an analysis of the leaked data and reported that the breach took place in 2015, however, Ancestry.com was unaware of the incident. On the other hand, the company has confirmed the breach and wrote an in-depth blog post to explain what happened.
Ancestry's acknowledgment
“As a result of that analysis, we determined that the file was legitimate, although the majority of the information was old. Though the file contained 300,000 email/usernames and passwords, through our analysis we were able to determine that only approximately 55,000 of these were used both on RootsWeb and one of the Ancestry sites, and the vast majority of those were from the free trial or currently unused accounts. Additionally, we found that about 7,000 of those passwords d and email address combinations matched credentials for active Ancestry customers. As part of our investigation, our team also uncovered other usernames that were present on the RootsWeb server that, though not on the file shared with us, we reasonably believe could have been exposed externally,” the blog post explained.
New breach: Ancestry service "RootsWeb" had almost 300k email addresses and plain text passwords compromised in 2015. 57% were already in @haveibeenpwned. Read more: https://t.co/gSOwv23poS — Have I Been Pwned (@haveibeenpwned) December 24, 2017
The plan
To tackle the situation, the company has taken RootsWeb offline and plan to bring it back with additional security measures to ensure user data remains secure. Those affected by the breach have been already informed and urged to change their passwords.
Furthermore, accounts of 55,000 customers who used the same credentials at RootsWeb's surname list and Ancestry have been locked and require them to create a new password upon their next login.
RootsWeb data available for download
On December 4th, 2017, RootsWeb was posted on a hacking forum for anyone to download it and contained emails and their plaintext passwords.The data is still available on the hacker forum which means customers should change their passwords without further delay.

Please don't misundertake me. ;-) I am no supporter of Mary Landrieu.  They are a DINO, bought and paid for by big oil. They have goose-stepped with the Republicans more often than not. They deserve no votes, funding or support. This one time, however, they are right. A stopped clock is right twice a day, and even DINOs are right at times and actually show up lying Republican hypocrites.
House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa's (R-CA) investigation of clean energy loan programs was undercut this week by a revelation, first reported by Bloomberg, that they had also requested money from the same program for companies in their district. A follow-up story by ThinkProgress found that an investor to the firm Issa had asked to subsidize had donated several times to Issa, including a check just shortly before Issa sent their letter to Secretary Chu.
Today on the Senate floor, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) mocked Issa's hypocrisy. They carried with their copies of the letters signed by Issa, as well as other letters by Republicans asking for money for the clean energy program they had just voted to cut, and read them into the Congressional Record…
…Watch it:
Earlier this week, Republicans tried to make hay out of the Solyndra controversy by taking an axe to clean energy programs. Landrieu made short work out of the GOP's shameful gimmick.
Landrieu continued tearing into Republican hypocrisy. They noted that the cuts were purely political because the supposed offsets for FEMA only required $175 million, not $1 billion. They then continued to read Republican letters asking for clean energy loan cash, including yet another one signed by Issa (asking for money for battery-maker Quallion LLC)… [emphasis added]

Dearborn Police are investigating an alleged attack of a transgender person at a bar, officials said Thursday.
The incident occurred around 1:50 a.m. Wednesday on Michigan in west Dearborn. Police declined to name the bar, however, in a video posted on Facebook Wednesday the apparent victim said the attack took place at Post Bar.
In the video posted to Facebook, a person who identifies themselves as Courtney Purvis said they were hit in the face “because I'm transgender.” In the self-recorded video Purvis shows what appears to be blood on their face and a split lip.
“They treated me like I did something wrong,” Purvis said. “I've been attacked. Trans lives matter, too ... And I don't understand why they attacked me like this.”
According to police Thursday, the victim said another bar patron, a woman, made derogatory remarks about the victim, which caused an argument.
“Management escorted all parties out of the bar and once outside the victim states they were stabbed in the back and struck in the face with a bottle,” police said in a statement.
The victim was treated at a hospital for nonlife threatening injuries and released, police said.
Lt. Gary Mann of the Dearborn Police Department said Thursday they are investigating if the incident is a hate crime. It is unclear if the victim knew the suspect, they said.
“We're in the preliminary stages of the investigation right now,” they said adding police are having a difficult time contacting the victim for an interview.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Dearborn Police Department at (313) 943-2241 or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at (800) SPEAK-UP.

Avengers: Age of Ultron already has an impressively long runtime, at 142 minutes long, but the first cut was more than an hour longer, clocking in at three and a half hours long. Director Joss Whedon tells Vulture that editing the film down to a more palatable length was not easy.
“There's one or two things that I'm unhappy about not having in there, but they're small,” said Whedon. “I said to Kevin before we started, 'My secret fantasy that'll never come true is that the second one is shorter than the first.' And we're shorter by a minute.”
Speaking of the first Avengers film, despite its huge critical and financial success, Whedon set out to film the sequel as a way of fixing everything they feel went wrong the first time around. “When I watch it, I just see 'flaw, flaw, flaw, compromise, laziness, mistake,'” said Whedon. “The reason I set out to make another film is because I wanted to make one that was better, and I wanted to up my game as a shooter and work harder on every aspect of it and sort of give myself up to it in a way that's hard for me, because I have a family. I started as a writer in low-budget TV, and there was always this element of, ‘This is good enough.' And with this movie, I never wanted to say, ‘This is good enough.'”
This quest for perfection has rendered Whedon unable to watch the final cut of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but he's happy with the positive early buzz its been building up online. “I tried, and I had a terrible time,” they said. “Is it perfect? It is not. Is it me? It's so baldly, nakedly me. To do something that is as personal as this movie is — on that budget, for a studio that needs a summer tentpole — is an extraordinary privilege.”
New Delhi: The government is likely to push ahead with banking sector reforms alongside infusion of fresh capital in state-owned lenders in the new year as it looks to lift banks out of non-performing assets (NPA) crisis and revive lending growth from a 25-year low.
The government in October announced infusion of an unprecedented Rs2.11 trillion capital over two years in public sector banks that are reeling under high NPAs. Their NPAs have increased more than two-and-a-half times to Rs7.33 trillion as of June 2017, from Rs2.75 trillion in March 2015.
Of the Rs2.11 trillion package, Rs1.35 trillion would be infused through recapitalisation bonds. The finance ministry would soon announce contours of the recapitalisation bonds and the amount to be front loaded during the current fiscal. The capital infusion in banks is not going to be an easy affair as it has to be backed by string of reforms including strengthening of bank boards, resolution of non-performing assets and HR issues so that they do responsive and responsible banking in future.
“Reform agenda is the highest priority which has to be implemented along with capitalisation. A whole lot of reforms will come so that genuine borrowers don't suffer and get hassle-free, need based credit," financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar told PTI. Special focus would be on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), financial inclusion and job creation, they said.
To facilitate consolidation in the public sector banking space, the cabinet in August gave in-principle approval for public sector banks (PSBs) to amalgamate through an alternative mechanism (AM). Subsequently last month, the panel under the chairpersonship of finance and corporate affairs minister Arun Jaitley was set up to examine proposals from banks for in-principle approval to formulate schemes of amalgamation.
A report on the proposals cleared by it will be sent to the cabinet every three months. Two other members of the panel are railways and coal minister Piyush Goyal, and defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
As part of its resolve to bring down burgeoning NPAs, the government issued two ordinances—Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017—during the year.
The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 gave way to the Act permitting the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to direct any bank to initiate insolvency proceedings and give directions for resolution of stressed assets. The RBI's internal advisory committee identified 12 large stressed cases worth over Rs5,000 crore, accounting to 25% (Rs1.75 trillion) of total gross non-performing assets, for proceedings under the insolvency and bankruptcy code.
Subsequently, the central bank advised banks to set aside 50% provisioning against secured exposure and 100% against unsecured exposure in all cases referred for bankruptcy. In a blow to defaulting promoters seeking to reclaim their firms that are under insolvency proceedings, the government last month promulgated an ordinance to bar wilful bank loan defaulters as well as those with NPA accounts from bidding in auctions being done to recover loans.
The ordinance, which is yet to be considered by Parliament, aimed at putting in place safeguards to prevent unscrupulous persons from misusing or vitiating the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The amendments would be applicable to cases where the resolutions are yet to be approved.
The changes essentially mean that certain promoters would not be allowed to bid for their own assets under the insolvency proceedings initiated to recover overdue loans. The RBI in its second list of big defaulters released in August asked banks to resolve 28 large accounts till 13 December or report them by 31 December to NCLT for insolvency proceedings.
Of these, banks are set to refer as many as 23 accounts for insolvency proceedings. These 28 accounts together account for 40% of bad loans or around Rs4 trillion. Some of the large accounts which are likely to go to the NCLT include Asian Color Coated Ispat, Castex Technologies, Coastal Projects, East Coast Energy, IVRCL, Orchid Pharma, SEL Manufacturing, Uttam Galva Metallic, Uttam Galva Steel, Visa Steel, Essar Projects, Jai Balaji Industries, Monnet Power, Nagarjuna Oil Refinery, Ruchi Soya Industries and Wind World India.
The other highlight of 2017 was the merger of five associates and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank with State Bank of India (SBI), catapulting the country's largest lender to among the top 50 banks in the world.
With the merger, SBI joined the league of top 50 banks globally in terms of assets. The total customer base of the bank will reach 37 crore with a branch network of around 24,000 and nearly 59,000 ATMs across the country.
The merged entity began with deposit base of more than Rs26 trillion and advances level of Rs18.50 trillion. On the social sector, the Finance Ministry launched the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) to provide social security during old age and to protect elderly persons aged 60 and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions.

“It's like a camera. You point and shoot.”
—Resident Evil: Retribution
Given the opportunity, the Resident Evil movies always snap back to the image of star Milla Jovovich holding two guns out at just above chest level, arms locked at the elbows, mouth pinned into a snarl. There are something like a half-dozen variations on this pose in every Resident Evil flick, often presented in plastic super-slow-mo, which makes Jovovich look like a life-size action figure—which is fitting, because Resident Evil is the definition of a toy-box franchise.

Some context: The title Resident Evil comes from a long-running survival horror Capcom game series (called Biohazard in Japan), as do many of the movies' monster designs, place names, supporting characters, and basic plot points. Still, it would be a bit of stretch to say that the movies—all five of which have been written and produced by Jovovich's husband, Paul W.S. Anderson—are out-and-out adaptations of the games, and their most significant overlaps with the Capcom series come across as little more than fan service. That having been said, the Resident Evil movies do take a lot of their cues from the stuff of gaming. It's where they get their sleek, geeky sense of firepower-based cool and their structures, which are predicated on boss battles, navigable environments, and restarts. They might not be straight adaptations of the Resident Evil games, but they're video game movies through and through—a major sticking point for critics in an era when movies are only ever compared to games pejoratively.
Besides the video game thing and a general sense of filmmaking fun, what the Resident Evil movies have going for them is a sense of subterranean claustrophobia dosed with a distrust of corporate power and a focus on impromptu groups and unions. (Anderson grew up in a coal-mining family; draw conclusions as necessary.) They work in that old B-movie tradition in which bands of survivors—invariably led by Jovovich, the most credible female action hero to come out of Hollywood—have to put up with each other in order to get from point A to point B.
The series' best entries—the fourth and fifth, both directed by Anderson himself—are pulpy sci-fi slice-'em-up flicks distinguished by their sharply staged action and the ways in which they play around with viewer perspective and their own convoluted mythos. They are lean and lively and fun and totally unpretentious, and, creatively and commercially speaking, they're the closest thing to a bona fide success to come out of the game adaption gold rush of the 2000s—the days of Doom, Hitman, and the Uwe Boll tax write-off. They even have a poetry to them.

For better or worse, Resident Evil is the movie where Paul Anderson, up-and-coming genre stylist, became Paul W.S. Anderson, widely maligned director of video game adaptations and movies that feel like video game adaptations. Anderson's work has an unusual relationship with film criticism, because, while their movies—most of which don't screen for the press—get drubbed by most reviewers, they also enjoy a serious cult following among a distinct subset of critics. (I presume that part of it has to do with the fact that Anderson doesn't make the kind of movies that are supposed to be good, and they don't wink about it either.) Believe it or not, but, for the last couple of years, a fractious debate—about what it means to appreciate action movies, and the meaning of the word auteur—has been making its way through film criticism, and much of this debate is centered on the Resident Evil series.
Resident Evil began as a project for George Romero, the politically conscientious father of the modern zombie movie. Romero had directed a Japanese commercial for Resident Evil 2/Biohazard 2 in 1998, which stoked interest in the idea of a Resident Evil feature; they turned in their first draft of the script that October, but their relationship with Capcom quickly soured. They were off the project by mid-1999, and Anderson was brought on, initially only to write the screenplay. (At the time, the production company was trying to snag Stephen Norrington, the Jim Henson's Creature Shop alum who'd recently made Blade and was widely considered to be hot stuff.)
Advertisement
Given carte blanche by Capcom, Anderson ended up making a pastiche of zombie horror, B-sci-fi, and Through The Looking Glass that was supposed to function as a prequel to the games, but ended up spinning off into its own parallel-universe series. The Resident Evil films constitute something like an auteur piece, in which continuities and references to the source material only matter insofar as they figure into Anderson's established set of interests and skills, which include, but are not limited to: fast-paced stories of the “escape from…” variety; one-against-dozens showdowns; deathtrap settings; references to Lewis Carroll, especially Through The Looking Glass; and getting Jovovich to look and sound as cool as possible. The series is fixated on mazes, models, two-way mirrors, maps, simulated environments, memory wipes, clones, and all kinds of other things that don't have a whole lot to do with its ostensible subject—i.e., Jovovich mowing down mutated zombies—but do fit neatly within a larger design based around space and repetition. It might not be a vision, but it's certainly consistent, personal, and fully formed.
Here, an amnesiac named Alice (Jovovich) passes through a secret door—hidden behind a wall-sized mirror, no less—on their way to an underground research facility overrun by zombies and controlled by deranged artificial intelligence called the Red Queen. There's a white rabbit, a decapitation—and so on and so forth.

Resident Evil is the longest movie in the franchise—even though it doesn't come within spitting distance of the two-hour mark—and the choppiest of the ones directed by Anderson himself. And yet, in between all of its jump scares and its modestly budgeted mayhem, there are moments of real elegance, sinister low angles and overhead shots that continually orient the viewer within the space of the Hive—the research facility of the Umbrella Corporation—and the secret train tunnel leading to it. This is the kind of stuff Manny Farber—the quintessential B-movie connoisseur of American film criticism—used to call “termite art”: unpretentious filmmaking that produces something akin to art through sheer, single-minded industriousness. For instance, in the interest of expediency, Anderson establishes Alice's amnesia through graceful silent-movie shorthand, in a brief sequence in which they spot a note on a desk and then starts copying it, realizing after a few words that the handwriting isn't hers.
Resident Evil wasn't a runaway hit, but its low budget made it very profitable, paving the way for a sequel: 2004's phenomenally trashy Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which is more or less the movie most people expect a Resident Evil feature to be. Styled as the visual equivalent of second-tier nü-metal, it's a barely coherent series of wire-assisted stunts, canted angles, and disruptive references to the games—a movie in which Alice is introduced crashing through a cathedral's stained glass window on a motorcycle.

Anderson backed out of directing the sequel, instead giving the job to Alexander Witt, a first-timer who'd had one of those odd career trajectories that are unique to cinematographers, crewing on everything from The Serpent's Egg to Leonard Part 6, before becoming an in-demand second-unit director of photography. Apocalypse remains their only feature as a director, and it's the only film in the series to make an overt attempt at connecting with the Capcom franchise.
For the most part, Apocalypse was an opportunity for Jovovich—who came up with the idea of setting the story during a heat wave, so that their character would be more scantly clad—to look good while shooting guns at rubber-masked stuntmen. And yet, even here, in the franchise's weakest entry, there are moments of sharp, B-movie poetry—termite art, like the shot of a shambling zombie being reflected in the visor of a fallen police officer's helmet.

Anderson had wanted to make a female-driven action flick since they arrived in Hollywood in the mid-1990s, and with Resident Evil, they managed to set off a whole series of them. It's Alice's sinewy physique—her broad shoulders, their muscular arms—that gets ogled here. Consistently throughout the series, they get counterposed with other women: Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) in the original and in Resident Evil: Retribution, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) in Apocalypse, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) in Resident Evil: Extinction and Resident Evil: Afterlife.
Extinction is the better of the two non-Anderson-directed Resident Evil movies, and arguably even better than Anderson's original film. Directed by Russell Mulcahy—the smoke-and-dust-obsessed stylist behind Highlander and The Shadow—and set around a facility hidden in the desert of the American Southwest, it follows what, by this point, had become the formula of the series. There's a disorienting opening—a repeat of the original's introduction of Alice, followed by their apparent corpse being dumped into a concrete ditch full of lookalikes, later revealed to be clones—and then the build-up to a collision, with loner Alice quickly joining forces with a convoy of survivors.
The non-numbering of the sequels only reinforces the impression that they're all variations on the same story about a deadly, Dietrich-faced woman leading a motley crew from point A to point B, each new version adding more layers of Byzantine backstory. Point B, in this case, is a rumored safe zone in Alaska, which involves a pit-stop in a deserted Las Vegas—its streets half-buried in sand—and a run-in with the Umbrella Corporation, now run by Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara; Shawn Roberts would play the character in subsequent films). By this point, the series' internal mythology had become incredibly convoluted, with Alice as a super-human with psionic powers whose DNA held the key to a cure to zombie plague that had affected all life on Earth.

What's remarkable, then, about all of the Resident Evil movies is how clearly plotted they are, setting up a clear goal and a limited set of characters at the beginning. For all of their clones, corporate conspiracies, and memory wipes, the movies proceed in straight, diligent lines.
2010's Resident Evil: Afterlife marked Anderson's return to the director's chair and their first foray into 3-D. With its fixation on clean geometric lines and its crisp sense of space, Anderson's style was tailor-made for the stereoscopic format. Afterlife would be their first film with Glen MacPherson, the Canadian cinematographer who's shot all of their subsequent movies; it's still one of the best-looking 3-D movies of the modern era, continually using the format to define and reveal space.

Space is plot here, with Alice at first helping a group of survivors breaks out of Los Angeles prison where they've holed up while hordes of the infected undead claw at the walls, and later traveling further and further into the interior of a massive cargo ship. Anderson's sense of action and movement had substantially improved since the original Resident Evil, and Afterlife's opening—in which Alice leads a small army of clones in an attack on the Umbrella headquarters—is a small marvel of choreographed cheesiness, a slow-motion tableau of throwing stars and sub-machine gun fire. It never comes across as kitschy or campy, in part because Anderson never gives the impression that they think he's an artist. He's organizing and presenting entertainment—and that, in and of itself, is a kind of art.
Which brings us to Resident Evil: Retribution—the franchise's most recent entry (Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is due in 2016) and the point where all of its visual motifs converge. If Anderson has a masterpiece, this is it.

Set inside of a massive underground facility composed of simulated environments (Tokyo, Moscow, an American suburb) and populated by brain-washed clones, it once again pits Alice against the Red Queen, here functioning less than a generic, HAL 9000-style amok AI, and more like a game designer. Exteriors are revealed to be interiors and characters are revealed to be copies; there are two different Rain Ocampos—neither the “real” one—with polar opposite personalities running around. It would be a mess, if it weren't for Anderson's style, which is focused on organizing action and orientating the viewer.
From the countdown at the end of the first Resident Evil to the pile of failed Alices at the beginning of Extinction, the series had always played around with integrating the mechanics of gameplay; here, they're front and center, with a major emphasis on the play. The horror aspect has all but been abandoned, in favor of outrageous images that toy with viewer preconceptions about space and character: one outdoor environment leading into another, a sky “rebooting,” a false Alice being abruptly killed off. It's a kind of unaffected, perhaps inadvertent poetry that's unique to B-movies, and something that Resident Evil does better than any other film series. Come for the zombie slicing, stay for the geometric compositions and phantasmagoric tableaux.
How to Fill a Gaping Hole with 2,304 LEDs
Hugo Lourenço Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 25, 2016
I woke that morning feeling like I do every morning, groggy and desperate for coffee. I descended the staircase from my bedroom to escape the unforgiving morning light. To my bewilderment, a second barrage of relentless sunbeams hit me in the face. My living room ceiling had caved in.
Most people would stare at a gaping hole in their ceiling and curse the gods that put it there. They would assess the damage, call a contractor, and shake their fists in rage. And that's what I did. But in the dark recesses of my mind, I was already formulating a plan. This hole wasn't just a nuisance, it was the beginning of my greatest home-hacking adventure.
At age 13, I began to tinker with electronics. I convinced my parents to buy me a do-it-yourself book on the subject and an actual soldering iron. What were they thinking? Despite my excitement, I lost interest in the analog world when a ZX Spectrum entered my life. My first computer.
It couldn't “break the Internet,” but it could break SPACE
My parents thought I would play games on the ZX, but I hacked it instead. Programming was enticing and lit a passion for software in me that has yet to die out. But 8 years ago, I was finally able to reconcile my one-time interest in electronics with my joy for coding. I discovered the Arduino platform.
Arduinos are pocket-sized computers that perform a limited set of operations. They accept an input, like a button press or a text message, and send an output. Their massive ecosystem of add-ons made building complex electronics feel like stacking Legos. For programmers who want to turn their things into Internet things, Arduinos are perfect.
Most landlords don't let tenants hack their appliances, their blinds, or their front lawn. That's why I moved into a detached house in the country. I moved far away from pesky landlords and mad-science fearing neighbors. So I cracked my hacking hands and gleefully put all my automation dream projects into motion. Arduinos began to spring up in my house like mushrooms.
I built a solar heating and ventilation system, an air conditioning controller, a shutter blind controller, an irrigation system for my lawn, a LED lighting system for my couch, a — getting carried away here. About a year later, we were getting ready to blow the candles out for my son's birthday. A guest remarked that our Christmas tree was giving off too much light for the occasion. I whipped out my phone, tapped a button the screen, and the Christmas tree shut off. My cool-dad factor skyrocketed.
Cue Barry White
I was proud, but these projects felt small. I had big dreams, and those dreams involved hacking my entire living room ceiling. The ceiling was bare, hospital white, and stretched on for an eternity. I had to do something, but what? I put the project off repeatedly by telling myself, “later,” “you have no time,” and, “what do you even know about ceilings?” But this gaping hole was the catalyst that silenced my doubts and set in motion a whole ton of awesomeness.
First, I had the leak fixed. I left the hole in the ceiling open for several rainy days just to be sure. Then it was time to plan. I drew inspiration from my LED couch project: who wouldn't want a 70s dance floor on their ceiling? Measuring time. I had enough space for a 4 by 9-meter rectangle. I needed about 60 LEDs per sq. meter to maintain an adequate light level, which meant a total of 2,304 of those little suckers.
My mind asked what every good developer's mind asks when faced with a problem. Has someone already solved this so I don't have to? It turns out, someone had. I could buy pre-built single LED modules and use them in an array. And if I had started to save enough money to buy two-thousand of them, I would still have a hole in my ceiling right now. I was going to have to do this my way, the cheap-as-dirt way.
It was a custom job in every sense of the word, so I tailored it for my needs. I couldn't limit control to smartphones, that didn't make sense for a light. It needed to work by a switch, too. And I wanted a fixture of this size to be maintainable. But guess what? Addressable light strips wire the LEDs in series. That means that if one goes out, they all do, like some kind of LED suicide pact. Dismounting and repairing a single module had to be effortless.
Left: LEDs in series; Right: single LED
And the most important design concern of all: this light had to inspire awe. It had to be more than just a matrix of boring point light. I wanted the entire panel to feel alive; to drift through organic patterns. Basic Arduino's weren't going to cut it; I needed to upgrade the software and the hardware. I discovered the ESP8266 combined with the Open-Source NodeMCU firmware. This microcontroller provided more power and more memory. It also had integrated WiFi at a bargain-bin price that I couldn't resist.
Doesn't get sexier than this, folks
With my architecture in mind, I set out to build a prototype. Prototyping the entire unit would've been costly overkill. So I stuck to hacking a single row of 32 LED modules together. I struggled to choose the right material for the housing. I tried plywood, cardboard, and even styrofoam. The cheap options felt, well, cheap. Then I got my impatient hands on medium-density fiberboard. MDF was simple to cut and looked great painted — moving the hell on.
Top: Panel design; Bottom: MDF prototype
When it was time to put the LEDs into the housing, I ran into another problem — yay me. The off-the-shelf LED strips, like the kind I used for my couch, were no good for my groovy panel. These strips packed the LEDs like sardines: way too close together. But more luck came to my side. AliExpress let me order a custom strip with the exact spacing I required. (Stay tuned for my next IoT invention: The Shameless Plug).
My prototype was ready after a week of cutting, painting, gluing, burning myself, screaming in fury, and crying long into the night. And if I had to make 71 more of them by hand, to see me, my children would've had to visit the psych ward. The end.
Behold, the nerdiest jack-o-lantern
It would've been the end if I hadn't found a nearby woodworking shop that had a CNC router. That's a device capable of precision material cutting and it follows a computer-guided pathway. It's basically a robot carpenter sent from the future to warn us about Skynet. I ignored its prescient AI warnings. And I ordered it to construct 72 clones of my you-get-an-A-for-effort MDF panel. And in several weeks, they would arrive.
Meanwhile, birthday season was fast approaching. I call it birthday season because my kids celebrate one month apart, and the season was almost upon us. If I wanted the lights ready in time, I'd have to speed things up. And my cool-dad factor was waning. I had to remind these ingrates that I was the most boss father around. When the robot overlords come to enslave humanity, who was going to protect them? Me with my hacking skills or Mr. Erikson and their convertible? Pfft. Pssh, whatever.
When the panels arrived, I began to assemble each one by hand. I had to glue the strips down, wire everything up, add the LEDs, and glue the filter. Then, and only then, did I finally mount the module to the drop ceiling. At this point, the power was on, and as I attached each module, it beamed pure white light down from nerdy heaven. But about halfway through the 2nd row of modules, heaven went on the fritz. My frugality finally bit me in the ass. The low-cost, ahem, low-quality power connectors failed me. They couldn't deliver consistent power from one panel to the next.
I had to order premium connectors to fix this problem, and they were on back-order because of course they were. I got enough wiring for half of the modules and had to wait two months before I would get the rest. With only three months before the first birthday party, time was running short. I needed to bust a serious move on this ceiling as soon as those connectors arrived.
After an eternity of waiting, the connectors appeared at my doorstep. I continued work immediately. And with progress came more snafus — when would they end? As I mounted the first module in the 3rd row, the ceiling went nuts. Each LED suddenly had a mind of its own, and that mind was hopped up on military-grade ecstasy. The panel looked like a poltergeist communicating with me from beyond the grave. I don't believe in ghosts, but just to be safe I shut that thing off and called a priest.
“I'll have to exorcise each LED… I do bulk pricing”
The Exorcist noted that rapid-switching electrical signals misbehave as they travel long distances. The modules closest to the controller were fine. But as the distance between module and controller grew, so did the level of noise and magnetic interference. I needed a way to send the signal consistently to all modules, regardless of how far each was from the source. The answer was RS-485. But that meant I had to redesign the controller to work with a new interface.
Left: RS485 bus; Right: Bus + controller 4ever, y'all
I worked tirelessly to refactor the ceiling in time but didn't make it. I had only half the ceiling built for the first birthday party. It was hardly ready to show off, let alone save the world from evil robots. I checked the cool-dad stock market, my market cap was plummeting.
The children urged me to turn the light on even after I explained that it would look like a bomb went off in a nightclub. Finally, I conceded and flipped the switch. These kids lost their minds.
With only half the panel completed, the light was a major success at both parties. And about a year later, I had the light fully built and functional. I still have some finishing touches to put on it and I'm rebuilding the mobile app using our latest platform (had to mention the boss at some point, right?). But all in all, this was a life-changing project and I feel immense pride having completed it. Now all I need is a pair of moon shoes so I can dance on this thing.

Q. What's the peak viewing time?
The eclipse is expected to be visible (weather permitting) in Mississauga/Brampton between 1:10 and 3:49 p.m., with peak coverage set to occur at 2:31 p.m.
Q. What's a total solar eclipse? Why is this one so special?
An eclipse of the sun happens when the new moon moves between the sun and earth, blocking out the sun's rays and casting a shadow on parts of Earth.
The Aug. 21 event is a total solar eclipse through a stretch of the United States from Oregon to South Carolina, while varying partial degrees of the eclipse can be seen throughout North America.
Q. Can I still go outside without glasses during the eclipse even if I don't look at the skies?
You don't need any protection (glasses) while driving if you're not directly looking at the sun. However, it's important to note: you should not look directly at the sun without specially designed solar viewers. Sunglasses, smoked glass or photographic films are not acceptable eye wear.
Q. Where can I find good eclipse-viewing glasses?
According to NASA, special solar eclipse glasses should be marked with the "ISO 12312-2" international safety standard on the label. Make sure there are no scratches on the lenses.
The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (https://www.rasc.ca/), as well as some universities and science centres will be distributing free eclipse glasses at viewing parties across Canada. Science museums and stores that sell telescopes may also have stock left. Good luck finding them, though.
Q. How can I spot fake eclipse glasses?
The American Astronomical Society says you can test the glasses yourself. Legitimate eclipse glasses are very dark, and when you put them on, you really can't see anything except the sun. “If you can see ordinary household lights through your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer, it's no good,” the AAS reveals on its website.
Q. What if I am driving and the car's facing the sun?
As long as you do not stare at the sun directly while driving, it's OK.
Q. Can I take photos of the eclipse on my smart phone?
If you take a photo by looking at the sun directly without protective glasses, you'll damage your eyes. As long as you're wearing safe glasses, it's OK to take photos on your phone without a solar filter. If you're hoping to take images through a point-and-shoot or DSLR, you'll need special filters. Here's what NASA recommends on the subject.
Q. I can't make it to Riverwood Conservancy in Mississauga for the viewing; where else can I go?
The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada has a full list for Canada. You can check it out here.

Australia's government has preliminarily blocked Chinese and Hong Kong bidders from taking a controlling stake in the country's largest electricity network, citing worries over national security.
In a statement to the media, the Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison has said the foreign investment proposals from Chinese and Hong Kong bidders "were contrary to the national interest."
China's State Grid Corp and Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings (CKI) were attempting to buy a 50.4% controlling stake in Ausgrid, which is New South Wales's electricity distribution network - the largest in the country.
State Grid Corp has not commented so far on the blocking of this sale, but undoubtedly the reaction in Chinese media will be one of outrage.
Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, owned by HK billionaire Li Ka-shing, has distanced itself from this rejection.
In a statement to the BBC it said: "We believe that the Australian government must have reasons beyond the obvious which led them to make today's announcement. The issue is unrelated to CKI."
Australia's move comes as the UK has postponed approval for the Hinkley Point nuclear power project, in which China's General Nuclear Power Corporation will have a minority stake, on similar concerns.
Australia risks Chinese anger over power grid sale

The power grid sale, which is reportedly worth about $7.5bn (£5.8bn), would have allowed the Chinese and Hong Kong bidders to acquire the controlling stake in Ausgrid for 99 years.
Ausgrid was appealing to international investors because it is seen as yielding stable and positive returns.
Chinese companies have been on a global acquisition spree, buying up resources and power firms in Asia as I've been reporting. Take the Edra asset in Malaysia for example, which was also not without controversy.
But Australia's Mr Morrison said that during the review process, national security issues were identified in critical power and communications services that Ausgrid provides to business and governments.
Mr Morrison said the bidders need to address these concerns, and that they have until 18 August to submit their proposals to him, at which time a final decision will be made on the project.
A new report out of India has predicted that rooftop solar and battery storage will change the nation's energy landscape, delivering electricity to households cheaper than coal-fired power from the grid as soon as 2023; while rooftop solar generation alone could be as much as 10 per cent cheaper than coal power by 2020.
The report, released on Tuesday by KPMG India analysts Arvind Mahajan and Manish Aggarwal, says that solar prices in India today are within 15 per cent of coal power prices on a levelised basis.
“While this may not fully capture costs such as grid integration costs for solar, our analysis suggests that even after considering the same, solar prices would be competitive with coal,” it says.
As you can see in the graph below – and as we have noted before on RenewEconomy – solar PV generation is already cheaper than imported coal in India; that happened this year. Solar prices are expected to breach domestic coal prices in mid-2018.
“Our forecast is that by 2020, solar power prices could be up to 10 per cent lower than coal power prices,” the report says
“Solar rooftop power combined with storage will be cheaper than grid power after 2022 for a large section of consumers, and at that time we may see a large shift towards rooftop power. We would like to call this transition, the arrival of the ‘Solar House'.”
According to the report, the arrival of the Solar House in India could see the sub-continent's rooftop solar market reach a total installed capacity of 10GW by 2020 and 49GW by 2025, growth that would change the energy landscape.
The report forecasts a solar PV generation price of $A0.09/kWh (INR 4.20/kWh) by 2020 and $A0.08/kWh (INR3.59/kWh) by 2025 (at 2015 price levels).
Of course, as the report also notes, India's ongoing NTPC solar park tender has already delivered prices at the INR 5/kwh mark ($A0.11/kWh) – which it describes as a landmark for the energy sector.
The report also estimates that the total market penetration of solar power in India could be 5.7 per cent – or 54GW – by 2020, and 12.5 per cent (166GW) in energy terms by 2025.
“Along with wind power, renewable energy could constitute a significant 20 per cent of our power mix in energy terms by 2025,” the KPMG report says.
“Solar rooftop power, today, is already competitive compared to grid power; however, it requires net metering support. …going forward, this will change due to the significant evolution that is expected in storage technologies.”
For coal, the report says it expects the sector to start coming under “significant pressure” from 2022 onwards, by which time solar would have achieved scale.
“To meet this challenge, the coal sector needs to focus on cost efficiency and flexibility to meet the various scenarios of demand. Apart from solar, various other factors such as slowing growth in China, emergence of energy efficiency on the demand side and fall in the commodities cycle, could lead to pressures on imported coal prices as well. This in turn
could put pressure on Coal India Limited (CIL)'s costs, as many users may find imports cheaper,” the report said.
Brook Lopez was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week hours before tip-off for Nets-Blazers at the Barclays Center. Brook is the first player in Nets franchise history and the first in the NBA this season to win consecutive Player of the Week awards.
Their jokester brother Robin Lopez of the Portland Trail Blazers was none too impressed.
"It's amazing how far you can go with a crappy center," Robin joked Monday night. "But I guess they fooled the NBA for a couple weeks, at least."
Well they must be a pretty good prankster if they ‘fooled' the NBA. The Nets' big fella is the conference's leading scorer over the last week, averaging 24.8 points on 58.5% shooting. Behind them rank DeMar DeRozan (24.6 points), and Kyrie Irving (23.4 points).
The joking twin brother continued.
"There are a lot of thick-headed people in this world," Lopez said. "They don't obviously see the diamonds in the rough in front of them." Who? The Nets? Lionel Hollins? Please elaborate, Robin! However, reporters talking with Lopez said it wasn't taken in the sense of a jab to the Nets front office. Just good ol' fashioned fun.
Fun. Something the two have had a lot this NBA season, with Robin's team holding a 50-26 record and Brook emerging as the Nets' leader during this late playoff race. They've also had a different kind of fun this year, especially with the mascots around the NBA.
Robin Lopez has stirred some trouble with mascots around the NBA, talkin' smack and causing beef among the league's costumed entertainers. Robin has beat up on most of them, but in Brooklyn he'll have nobody to mess with since the BrooklyKnight's mysterious departure prior to the season.
"I think they saw what was coming. I'm sure they saw me in their nightmares," Robin said.
Tensions raised between the twin brothers when Brook took a happy picture with the Cavaliers mascot the Moondog, who gave Brook popcorn as part of theirs thank you gift. Robin didn't like it. Nor did they like the popcorn. "It was a little tough to swallow," Robin said. "I'm sure it wasn't as bitter as the popcorn, but it was bitter."
The brothers have faced off eight times in their seven seasons in the league. Robin has won five of the eight, but Brook has individually dominated the matchups, averaging 19 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
"Doc" Rayburn's military career began October 21, 1861, when they entered Confederate service as a Private in Company C, 12th Texas Cavalry Regiment. In 1862, enroute to Tennessee with Parson's Brigade, they were left in Des Arc, either sick or wounded. While recovering, they persuaded other young men to help the Confederate cause and was successful in organizing a small company to begin their guerilla strikes against Union troops. From White, Prairie and what is now Lonoke County, the recruits came. Rayburn was elected Captain, assisted by Lt. John Bethell and a young man named Snigley. Their activities earned the name "The Phantom Unit" and attracted the interest of General McRae who was influential in obtaining recognition of the unit in the Confederate Army.
An oft-told story is the series of events leading up to the acquisition of Captain Rayburn's favorite horse, Limber Jim, who carried Captain Rayburn through the war. Doc Rayburn was young, blonde and blue-eyed. They borrowed a Des Arc woman's clothes, dressed themselves in them and went to DeValls Bluff where Union troops were stationed. A Union officer invited them to a dance. Entering with a group of girls, they were able to manage well. Leaving before the dance was over, they took Limber Jim, a beautiful black horse belonging to the Union officer. Later they and their men stole other horses from the Garrison's prairie pasture hiding in the White River bottom Forrest, southwest of West Point.
The highlight for Rayburn's Company came when they served as guards for General Sterling Price and were with them throughout the Missouri campaign in 1864. As a Union reward had been offered for Rayburn "dead or alive", they were arrested and placed in a Union prison; their followers were paroled. The rigors of war, along with the treatment and exposure in prison caused Captain Rayburn to contract tuberculosis. Their many friends, knowing they could not live long, managed to secure their release in 1865. Captain Howel A. "Doc" Rayburn was buried in a cemetery near Wattensaw Bayou area near Des Arc.
R. T. Martin, also a Confederate veteran, spent their last years at Beebe, Arkansas, and eulogized Doc Rayburn and their youthful comrades in these words: "Doc Rayburn sleeps in an unmarked grave. Their grave can never be officially decorated but perhaps blossoms of wild flowers have shed their fragrance upon the young hero's grave through the years. Others of less heroism have been honored more. Great Generals have declared that no greater heroism was shown during the war than was displayed by youths from sixteen to twenty years of age, both Union and Confederate. Much older men were often led into battle all during the Civil War by these brave young men."
Born in Roane County, Tennessee, 1842, Howel Raburn was the fourth child of Hodge and Susan Raburn. Their siblings were, according to the Shelby County, Texas, 1850 census: James, Mary C., William, Milton, and Robert L. They married Mary A. Booth of West Point in 1863; the marriage recorded in White County as is a will of the widow, Mrs. M. A. Rayburn, filed January 13, 1904.

Titanfall 2 Fans Complaining About Delayed Vanguard Edition By Ryan Winslett Random Article Blend Titanfall 2 is finally out in the wild, with players hopping into mechs and blasting through the game's campaign and online modes. For some folks who ordered the game's Vanguard edition, though, the only game they're playing right now is "the waiting game." Buzz around the internet is that some Amazon shoppers aren't too happy when it comes to Titanfall 2, which launched just yesterday on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Tooling around Twitter, message boards, and forums, it sounds like some folks who pre-ordered the game for day-one delivery still have not received their copies of Titanfall 2. This seems to be tied to one particular version of the game, the Vanguard Collector's Edition, and one retailer in particular, Amazon. Here's a look at just one tweet in particular, Joe Vargas, known for the Angry Joe Show. Woke up today looking for my Titanfall 2 Helmet & Vanguard Collectors edition & see its been delayed with no ETA. Thanks a lot @Amazon — Joe Vargas (@AngryJoeShow) October 28, 2016 So the launch date came and went and it looks like Angry Joe is without their copy of Titanfall 2. They point out that there was a sudden delay put on the game and no word on when it might actually be available and delivered. And Angry Joe isn't alone here; loads of people are reporting the exact same problem. It might be easy for some to say, "What's the big deal? Just play it when it gets there," but that's not really the point. The whole purpose of pre-ordering a game (well, one of them, anyway) is to reserve a copy nice and early. These folks want to be playing Titanfall 2 from the get-go, so they took advantage of a service that is supposed to guarantee exactly that. There's also the fact that they've probably forked over extra cash to have their delivery arrive the day of launch rather than a few days later. Even refunding their money isn't going to solve a problem like that. I don't know about you folks, but when I've got a game's launch set in my head, I tend to schedule other events around time for me to be able to play that game. If said game doesn't arrive, you're potentially screwing with my entire weekend. This might not have been so bad had Amazon not made an identical booboo just a few weeks back. Gears of War 4 offered early access versions of the game that, once again, were delayed to some consumers. Again, what's the point of offering "early access" games for delivery if you can't deliver on that promise? Unfortunately, Amazon has offered no update on the matter, so we suppose would-be Titanfall 2 players just have to sit tight for the time being. But with the holidays right around the corner, we're starting to wonder if Amazon is going to be able to keep up with demand. Then again, maybe there was an issue they can't control. But we can't know until they offer some info. Blended From Around The Web Facebook

Oversharing on Facebook is posing a unique challenge for the CIA's recruitment of future spies.
Every year, the agency has to drop five or six stellar candidates because of things they said on social media networks like Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and LinkedIn (LNKD), the CIA's top recruiter said in an exclusive interview with CNNMoney.
That's a tiny fraction of the 20,000 applicants who make it into the final phases of the interview process. But the CIA has rescinded job offers because of their social media posts.
"Obviously, secrecy and social media are at odds with each other," said CIA hiring chief Ron Patrick, who keeps a vague LinkedIn account -- and has Facebook and Twitter accounts under a different name.
Want to work at the CIA? Here's Patrick's advice.
Don't like us on Facebook.
"Once we've expressed some serious interest in their application we say: Don't follow us, don't like us. And if they have, we asked them to back off a bit," Patrick said.
It's all right to express interest publicly -- at first. But you might be an undercover CIA operative in a war zone someday. Don't keep broadcasting your interest in spying to the world.
However, do have a presence on social media.
Secret agents aren't antisocial or technophobic.
"If we only hire people that are afraid of it, they're not going to be much help to us in the world or our mission," Patrick said. "Many of the people we're dealing with -- especially the targets we're working against -- are on social media."
Don't announce a great interview.
As cringe-worthy and glaring as this is, this one has derailed great candidates. Once you apply to the CIA, the agency tells you to shut up. Some don't get it.
Patrick said several aspiring spies have made it all the way to a face-to-face interview, then they go online and post something like, "I interviewed with CIA! Dynamite interview!"
"It's a question of trust and integrity," they said. "They can't follow instructions and handle the severity and importance of the job they've applied to."
Don't crowdsource cheating tips.
Last year, the CIA had to withdraw a job offer when someone made this stupid mistake.
The screening process for a clandestine officer position is long and complicated. These are the spies who typically work overseas, recruiting tipsters and reporting sensitive intel back to their bosses at headquarters.
One man made it all the way through and even got the CIA job offer, Patrick recalled. Then a background investigator for the agency asked them if he'd used social media in the application process.
Yes, they admitted. They were nervous about passing the polygraph (lie detector) exam, so they used their network to track down specific people who could help "defeat the polygraph," Patrick said.
"As soon as they said that, we immediately disqualified the person," they said.
Once you're in, don't tag fellow officers at a party.
This is an unspoken rule. CIA employees tend to operate in little, private bubbles. You don't typically know what your desk neighbor is really working on. So, you don't know if snapping their photo at a party will blow their cover.
No face tagging -- or announcing their location either. It's not nice to @JackRyan. Besides, adding coworker spies to your "friends" list only makes it easier for foreign intelligence agencies to map out the CIA network.
"The word discretion is not a bad word around here," Patrick said.
If you're hired, don't disappear from social media.
"It's funny. People who've done that were posting in Omaha, then New York -- then they stop talking," Patrick said. "It's going to raise suspicion. That's a clue. It's a sign that other intel services might look at."
(An earlier version misstated the second-least happy metro area; it's St. Joseph, Mo.)
Cheer up, Big Apple residents — New York City is the most unhappy city in America.
That's according to data coming from a working paper by Harvard professor Edward Glaeser, Vancouver School of Economics professor Joshua Gottlieb and Harvard doctoral student Oren Ziv. They used data collected in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and then adjusted it for age, sex, race, income and other factors. (Such adjustments are important — women, for instance, are happier than men; the married are happier than single or divorced respondents; and so on.)
Read related post: Living in an unhappy city gets you a better house
In short, New Yorkers are the unhappiest on an “adjusted” basis; but scoff at those adjustments as you like, they are still third-most-unhappy region (of the areas where there are at least 200 respondents) out of 177 metro areas on an unadjusted basis.
It'd be blithe to say those who work on Wall Street are scientifically miserable. But remember, money buys happiness. So, probably not.
The happiest five cities are all in Louisiana, with Lafayette taking the crown (Louisiana is also the happiest state). The unhappiest cities, after New York City, are St. Joseph, Mo.; South Bend, Ind.; Erie, Penn.; and the Evansville, Ind.-Henderson, Ky. area.

A gay man who reached out to a mental health helpline in Russia was called a "faggot" by an operator who then outed them on social media.
The man had called "FROG", a helpline based in St Petersburg for people dealing with mental health issues.
After explaining they were gay and needed support, the operator told them the helpline "isn't for faggots" and hung up on him.
The FROG website claims to provide 24-hour support. "If you want to talk, to understand yourself, if you need support and someone to listen to... Call! We help everyone!"
After the incident, the man reached out to the organisation's director, Alexander Bronshtein, to complain – but they were told the operator had done no wrong.
"You were told that [we] don't work with faggotry and then you were wished all the best. What was rude about this?" Bronshtein asked the man, arguing the Russian word "pedorastiya" – which translates to "faggotry" – was an acceptable term.
The man then reported the incidents to a support group for young LGBT Russians, Children 404.
Lena Klimova, the founder of the group, posted about the man's experience on the social media network VKontakte.
Bronshtein responded with a now-deleted post on the network. "We really don't treat people for faggotry and this caller was informed of that, and wished all the best," they wrote.
"Except you [Lena Klimova] erased their information for some reason, and left mine. If you're taking screenshots, then do a full screenshot. You don't need to hide your friend's name."
Bronshtein also posted screenshots of their conversation with the man, revealing their identity. The post has since been removed.
Anti-gay rhetoric and abuse is commonplace in Russia. In 2013, the country's national parliament, the State Duma, passed a federal law banning gay "propaganda", amid a Kremlin push to enshrine deeply conservative values.
A report published in the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta recently reported that gay men were being detained and tortured in prison camps for LGBT people.
Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Hibernian 1-2 St Johnstone
Steven MacLean's last-ditch winner gave St Johnstone their first victory in seven games in a dramatic finish after Hibs appeared to have salvaged a point.
Murray Davidson nodded in Liam Craig's header across goal to bring Saints' 620-minute goalless run to an end.
But Anthony Stokes converted a last-minute penalty after Joe Shaughnessy handled Martin Boyle's effort.
Saints responded superbly in injury time when MacLean slid in after Davidson's initial shot was saved.
It was a sensational finale to a match that really only came to life after the break.
The visiting supporters must have thought their long wait for a victory would be prolonged even further when Stokes side-footed home a spot-kick just as the game entered injury time.
But Saints, having failed to score in six games, notched their second of the afternoon as good work by Michael O'Halloran was rewarded when MacLean tapped in after Ofir Marciano had saved from Davidson.
It was no more than St Johnstone deserved as, despite their recent travails in front of goal, they had created the more dangerous opportunities throughout.
John McGinn was unhappy with a feisty challenge from Steven MacLean
They had virtually the only decent effort of a largely forgettable first half, but Marciano saved brilliantly from Craig, reacting instinctively to push the Saints midfielder's 12-yard shot against the crossbar.
The visitors again came close to a breakthrough when Steven Anderson - up for a corner - volleyed goalwards, only to see John McGinn head off the line.
O'Halloran forced another good save from Marciano before MacLean opted to pass rather than shoot, perhaps a sign of dented confidence on the striker's part.
But Saints' endeavour was rewarded shortly afterwards when Richard Foster floated a cross to the back post, Craig headed across goal and Davidson, with a trademark late run into the box, nodded past Marciano.
It was the visitors' first goal since Murray netted against Hamilton on 23 September.
Even before they had gone behind, Hibs had found it difficult to make their possession tell and Zander Clark was scarcely troubled in the visitors' goal.
Simon Murray had a frustrating day in front of goal for Hibs
Martin Boyle's swerving drive from the edge of the box was Clark's only test of the opening 45 minutes, with Simon Murray and Stokes both firing over.
The keeper did have to look lively to divert an Efe Ambrose shot - dummied by Murray - past the post with their right boot, but until the award of the late penalty, they had little else to do.
They could not keep that out but it was rendered meaningless as MacLean's late strike earned Saints the points.
Reaction
Hibs manager Neil Lennon: "We were flat but I didn't think we deserved to lose the game.
"We showed good character to get back into it, but then we should see the game out and take the point. There's a bit of naivety at the end when we should clear the ball and we don't. It's a poor goal to concede and it's the last kick of the game.
"There was a flatness about us today and I understand that. There has definitely been a momentum break and it looked like it was detrimental to us. There was lack of urgency at times in the final third.
"I've no doubt the (international) break has affected us. The build-up was a bit fragmented but that's not an excuse. We were OK but we were nowhere near the level we've been at in the last few games."
St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: "Wwe fully deserved it on our second-half performance. It was a great team effort and I'm really proud of them because it's been a tough few weeks.
"I said to them in the dressing room that people were starting to doubt them but certainly I have never doubted them.
"The (Hibs) penalty is harsh. Yes, it hits their arm, but he's so close I don't think the referee can give those.
"I'm so pleased that they kept going and kept their heads, and we get the win with the last kick of the ball."
Steven MacLean slides in to score Saints' winner
Preschool is a relatively recent addition to the American educational system. With a few notable exceptions, the government had a limited role in early education until the 1960s, when the federal Head Start program was founded. Before mothers entered the full-time workforce in large numbers, private preschools were likewise uncommon, and mainly served as a safe social space for children to learn to get along with others.
In the past few decades, however, we have seen a major transfer of child care and early learning from home to institution: Nearly three-quarters of American 4-year-olds are now in some kind of nonfamily care. That category spans a dizzying mix of privately and publicly funded preschool environments, including family-run day cares, private preschools in church basements, and Head Start programs in public elementary schools, to name a few. Across all of them, the distinction between early education and “official” school seems to be eroding.
When I survey parents of preschoolers, they tend to be on board with many of these changes, either because they fear that the old-fashioned pleasures of unhurried learning have no place in today's hypercompetitive world or because they simply can't find, or afford, a better option. The stress is palpable: Pick the “wrong” preschool or ease up on the phonics drills at home, and your child might not go to college. They might not be employable. They might not even be allowed to start first grade!
Media attention to the cognitive potential of early childhood has a way of exacerbating such worries, but the actual academic consensus on the components of high-quality early education tells another story. According to experts such as the Yale professor Edward Zigler, a leader in child-development and early-education policy for half a century, the best preschool programs share several features: They provide ample opportunities for young children to use and hear complex, interactive language; their curriculum supports a wide range of school-readiness goals that include social and emotional skills and active learning; they encourage meaningful family involvement; and they have knowledgeable and well-qualified teachers.
As an early-childhood educator, I've clocked many hours in many preschool classrooms, and I have found that I can pretty quickly take the temperature from the looks on kids' faces, the ratio of table space to open areas, and the amount of conversation going on in either. In a high-quality program, adults are building relationships with the children and paying close attention to their thought processes and, by extension, their communication. They're finding ways to make the children think out loud.
The real focus in the preschool years should be not just on vocabulary and reading, but on talking and listening. We forget how vital spontaneous, unstructured conversation is to young children's understanding. By talking with adults, and one another, they pick up information. They learn how things work. They solve puzzles that trouble them. Sometimes, to be fair, what children take away from a conversation is wrong. They might conclude, as my young son did, that pigs produce ham, just as chickens produce eggs and cows produce milk. But these understandings are worked over, refined, and adapted—as when a brutal older sibling explains a ham sandwich's grisly origins.
Just yesterday we reported on some forthcoming features in the popular messaging app WhatsApp. The new features, which include saving of videos to the device, were found in the private beta of the app. Soon after that article though, WhatsApp pushed out another update to version 2.11.322 and it now has the long coveted feature of attaching videos. We have verified that the new functionality is present.
The system for attaching videos is very basic. Users simply tap on the ‘Albums' icon to browse their library of media, but instead of just photos, videos are now visible there as well. From that screen, users can just attach the video, which will then be auto-sent to the contact. It's basic but it works and we imagine it will be refined a little over the next few betas. Limits for video size and length are currently not known.
Death causes many people to doubt life's meaning. It isn't surprising that the meaninglessness of life consumes Tolstoy's Ivan Ilyich, or that death figures prominently in the world's literature about the meaning of life. Consider these haunting lines from James Baldwin:
Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.[i]
Something binds the topics of death and meaning. The thought of oblivion arouses even the non-philosophical among us. What is the relationship between death and meaning?Death is variously said to:
render life meaningless; detract from life's meaning; add to life's meaning; render life meaningful.
Death has always been inevitable, but the idea that science will eventually conquer death has taken root—achieved through some combination of future technologies like nanotechnology, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Some think the possibility of technological immortality renders human life meaningless, others that life can only attain its full meaning if death is overcome.
But whatever view one takes about the relationship between death and meaning, the two are joined. If we had three arms or six fingers, our analysis of the meaning of life wouldn't change; but if we didn't die our analysis would be vastly different. If our concerns with annihilation vanished, a good part of what seems to undermine meaning would disappear. To understand the issue of the meaning of life, we must think about death. Pascal's words echo across the centuries:
Imagine a number of men in chains, all under sentence of death, some of whom are each day butchered in the sight of the others; those remaining see their own condition in that of their fellows, and looking at each other with grief and despair await their turn. This is an image of the human condition.
Can we find meaning in this picture?

A Colorado man's purchase of $42 of Girl Scout cookies has led to a court date and more than $700 in debt for what they say was an error by a Girl Scout troop's bank.
Tad Osborn, an IT professional in Fort Collins, Colo., bought about a dozen boxes last year from a scout from their neighborhood. They wrote a check for $42 and enjoyed the cookies with their family.
Then last summer, they received a notice from a collection agency, informing them that their check had bounced and more than doubled their bill to $82, as first reported by CBS4.
They called the local Girl Scout troop who directed them to an office in Denver.
"When someone called me back, they said my account was marked as closed. That was the first sign that we had a problem here, because my account was not closed," they told ABCNews.com.
They explained to the Girl Scouts that their account was not closed, even asking their bank manager to send a letter that their account had remained opened.
Osborn said they believe the Girl Scouts' bank had an issue processing their check.

Rachelle Trujillo, a spokesperson for the Girl Scouts of Colorado, declined to comment specifically about this case due to pending litigation but said the cookie operation is like any other large business. The state organization sells 3.5 million cookies.
"When a check is reported as bad debt by a troop's bank, the troop attempts to contact the customer and the council then attempts to resolve the debt," the organization's statement reads. "Like any other business, after multiple attempts to resolve, we use a professional collection agency."
"The problem is I was never notified," Osborn said, claiming they never received a phone call, letter or knock on the door notifying the check had bounced. "Because they never contacted me, I never had the chance to set this straight."
The debt collection agency, AAA Collectors Inc., sued Osborn for $739.85, the bulk of which is $450 in attorney fees, followed by court and principal costs.
An office manager for AAA Collectors Inc. declined to comment to ABCNews.com, explaining that the company is bound by federal law from discussing a collection with a third party.
Osborn had to pay $100 to file a legal response just so the agency doesn't win a judgment by default.
That cost was "the thing that really got me upset," they said.
The attorney for the agency, Randall Purvis, has asked Osborn if they want to settle, Osborn said, but they declined. Purvis did not respond to a request for comment.
Today Osborn received a notice for a trial date of May 8, and they feel they will likely need to hire an attorney. They have filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office on Monday.
The legal headache hasn't prevented them from buying Girl Scout cookies this year however.
Their daughter recently became a Girl Scout in an unrelated troop.
"I like the Girl scouts and their Girl Scout cookies," they said. "I have no problem donating the money to them. This is making me think twice about writing a check. Just cash -- lesson learned."
Although some people think that deadlines kill creativity and hamper productivity, they can really help you streamline your energies and focus on the work at hand, especially when you work as a freelancer and have multiple projects to handle.
If you don't set deadlines for your individual projects you will soon lose track of time and will never be able to deliver the projects on time to your clients, creating a bad professional reputation in the process.
If you want to be taken seriously by your past, present, and future clients, you have to take your deadlines seriously and respect them; when you respect your deadlines it means you respect your client's time and also your own time.
But following deadlines can sometimes prove to be a really difficult task and this happens more often when you work on your own and there is nobody to supervise you or nag you in case you delay your work.
Not having to go to office is both an advantage and a disadvantage because when you don't have to go to office at a particular time every day you don't have to start your work at a particular time every day. Similarly you can stop doing work whenever you feel like and it is very easy to get distracted when you work on your own; and it is not always entirely your own fault because the people around you think that your time is only valuable when you work in an office or a shop.
But that is a different topic; in this post we will try to explore some ways to set up realistic deadlines and then stick to those deadlines.
Here are a few handy things:
Define your working pattern
In order to create rational deadlines you need to understand how you work, how much time you take to accomplish particular tasks, and under what conditions you are most productive, and least productive. You won't be able to make this out immediately and this task may take a few months to materialize but sooner or later you'll have to make a beginning and the sooner you do, the better it will be. Once you have created a map of your working pattern you will be able to create the right deadlines for your individual projects. Of course as you gain more experience your working pattern will keep changing.
Develop a schedule and then stick to it
We are not able to meet deadlines mostly because we don't follow a definite schedule. Working independently affords us with lots of flexibility. Although this flexibility can immensely improve the way we perform, sometimes, unknowingly, we end up working less just because we think that we have enough time and hence we can easily postpone work. So always set aside a particular time of your day when you do nothing but work. If you are not used to it in the beginning it will be very difficult and both your mind and body will resist but as you persist they will both get used to it.
For instance if you decide that you are going to do your professional work between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and then between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. you will be able to achieve more compared to when you work randomly at any time; in fact you end up working more and achieve less when you don't have well defined schedule. Your family and friends too will get used to your timings and thus disturb you less during those hours. Once you start working within your working hours you'll be surprised to discover how much extra time you have and how efficiently you can work.
Track your work
When you track your work you know exactly where you are at a particular instance and you can then increase or decrease (you should rarely decrease your speed though) your speed accordingly. Depending upon the status of your work you can also alter your methodology so that you can finish your work within your deadline or before the deadline. In case you observe that you are going to run late you can also seek outside help; remember that it is very important that you deliver the assignment to your client on time or before the time you have committed even if it means outsourcing certain components of your project.
There are many software tools available that can help you track your progress; such tools are often called “project management software”, but frankly you don't need such elaborate tools unless you are running an organization consisting of multiple employees. If you work alone you can use something like Tadalist or Remember the milk, Google calendar of even the calendar feature of Microsoft Outlook. These tools help you create lists of jobs that you want to accomplish at a particular time interval. Again using such tools may seem like a drag or even waste of time in the beginning but once you get used to them you will tremendously improve your performance vis-à-vis your deadlines.
Of course you can use a simple notepad and a pen or pencil to achieve the same: it depends on how you prefer to work.
Don't over commit
We mostly over commit when we don't keep track of our present work and our schedule; we never intentionally take up work that we cannot do (unless we intend to cheat). If you maintain a proper calendar and always refer to it before committing to new projects; politely refuse if you cannot finish the assignments within the timeframe acceptable to the client. Refusing the work is far better than first accepting it and then not doing it or delaying it.
Even if you don't charge for the extra time you spend on the project it delays your client's plans and they or they may resent you or even penalize you for that. It is another matter if the delay occurs due to a sudden change in the specs of the project or if your client keeps changing their or their mind and at that time you should always keep a duly signed copy of the initial agreement at hand and show it to the client whenever some conflict manifests.
Take your entire family into confidence
When you work from home your working schedule depends a lot on how your family reacts to your need to focus on your work during particular hours of the day. If you are interrupted all the time by your spouse or by your kids then you can forget about meeting the deadline.
You can meet the deadline only if you can do your work uninterrupted and you should communicate this to your family repeatedly because they tend to forget it very quickly, and it is but natural because it is home for them and not an office. If possible move to a room that is not used frequently by your family members.
Keep your client well-informed
Keeping your client well-informed keeps misunderstandings at bay and at certain instances it also allows you to make your deadline flexible. More often than not your client is interested in the completion of their or their project and they or they are okay with a few delays and changes here and there. For this you constantly need to update your client regarding the status of the project.
There should be a mechanism in place where you can actually show your client how much work has been done so that they or they have an idea of how fast or slow the work is progressing and if you are not meeting the deadline then what is the reason behind it.
Deadlines, especially unrealistic deadlines, rack havoc with many a project, but they can be great performance-boosters if you manage your projects systematically and track individual deadlines diligently. As I mentioned above, it may seem like a wasteful exercise in the beginning but as your work increases a mechanism to track all the deadlines and meet the deadlines will prove to be indispensable once you realize how it helps you improve your performance and hence achieve more in limited time.

Your software is your legacy. It is up to you to decide how long that legacy lives for.
Life ends. But software doesn't have to.
After the wild success of “joe” (and the blog post that followed), I posted a tweetstorm listing some of the rules that I think separate good software from bad software. A few people got in touch with me after that to talk shop and asking for clarification on some of them.
Let me be perfectly clear, though. It is only rarely possible to follow all of these rules for any given project. I myself am guilty of not following all of them successfully. But the more rules you follow (read: preach), the longer your software will live. At the end of the day, every byte you write adds to the whole ecosystem, and as engineers, our goal should be to keep the software ecosystem as clean as possible.
Fast
But what do you get out of writing good code? Isn't “move fast break things” a good thing?
No. Learning to make software is a skill. Anyone can do it. Learning to make good software is an art. It requires time, effort and dedication.
When you die, do you want the world to have more SEGFAULTs than it already does? Do you want the sysadmins to constantly be on call because of the shitty code you wrote that breaks everything? Do you want your PM to remember you as being the engineer who pissed all users off?
I have nothing against moving fast — I do believe in the power of MVP's and the power of getting out first. But at some point, when it's not too late, you do have to realize that low quality code can only go so far.
When
When you walk into a doctor's office, the doctor first asks you a series of questions to determine what is up with you. They don't prescribe drugs before diagnosis.
Similarly, it is important to know when you are writing bad software. Here are a few questions that will help us diagnose if you are writing bad software.
Does pushing updates to the software take a lot of time and effort?
Does the whole system go down when you push a very small change?
Have you ever pushed broken code to production, and didn't realize until your users started complaining?
Do you know what exactly to do when your system goes down — how to dig into backups, and deploy them?
Are you spending more time on things like moving between environments, or running the same commands again and again, or running small utilities than actually making the software?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, this post is for you. Read all the way through, at least twice.
So let's see what those rules are, shall we?
1. Modularize
Rule 1: Modularize. Pushing 1 module with a bug in it is significantly less work that pushing the whole codebase. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
We humans are extremely complex creatures with the most sophisticated CPU ever designed. Yet, it fails to solve complex problems. Want proof? Tell me, without using any calculators, what 13*35 is. I bet you can't. At least not in a reasonable amount of time.
BUT. What we are good at is decomposing complex problems into smaller and solvable problems.
What is 13*10? 130. What is 13*5? It's 130/2 = 65. What is 130*3? 390. What is 390+65? 455. BAM!
See how breaking a large problem down to small, independent and easy problems helped us get to the right answer?
Follow the same logic for your software. Divide up your software across multiple files, or folders, or even projects. Bring all dependencies in one location, follow MVC or some variation.
Not only will this code be fun to read, it will also be so much easier to debug. In most cases, your stack trace will lead you to a very small subset of code instead of a 1000-line file of code. When pushing updates to a particular module, say the comments system on a blog CMS, you won't have to take the whole system down — only the parts that are being updated.
2. Test
Rule 2: Test. I'm guilty of not always writing tests for my code. All production code should have tests. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
Yes. I know. Testing. Blekhh!
Let me tell you why you just did that. Because we have been trained to treat testing as a different activity than making software. Even in school, you are taught how the C++ templates work, but not how they are tested. Online tutorials will teach you how to make a sick web server in Brainfuck, but they won't tell you how to test it. And that is the problem.
Some people will tell you that you should write tests before you start writing the actual application logic.
I, on the other hand, don't care when you write tests, as long as you write some tests. Don't try to be a testing hero when you first start out; start simple. Test in a brute force way (eg. print(add(1, 1) == 2)) then move onto a testing framework for your language.
Here's what will happen when you start testing your code — you'll start to understand the complexity of your software. You'll start to learn how to modularize your software into pieces that can be independently tested. So just by nailing testing, you will have followed two of the seven rules here. Power to you.
3. Continuous Integration
Rule 3: Use continuous integration. @travisci, @droneio and @jenkinsci all are great. They notify you as soon as you push broken code. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
After you write tests, you have to make sure they pass, and you have to make sure they pass in multiple environments (multiple versions of Python for example). You also need to test whenever any changes are made.
While you can do that manually from your command line, it's more convenient, faster and cheaper to just use a continuous integration platform.
Thoughtworks has a beautiful page on CI. Here's what you must know:
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires > developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a > day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing > teams to detect problems early.
I use both TravisCI and Drone.io for my projects. Whenever I check in new code (or someone else does), the platforms build my code and run the tests.
4. Automate
Rule 4: Automate. Have 5 scripts that need to run to test & deploy? Add them in a single bash script. Reduce the steps. Save time. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
Bigger projects often have some tasks like bootstrapping code, or testing code in different ways, or for deploying to different servers, or for backing up parts of code.
I have seen people store txt files with commands, and copy and paste when they need to. Do yourself a favor and learn bash scripting (and/or Python).
Here are some common tasks that you must automate using simple bash scripts:
Converting README.md to other formats (depending on what different distribution channels require)
Automated testing (including creating mock servers and/or data, deleting temp files, etc).
Stage code to dev server.
Deploy to production.
Automated dependency updating (be careful, you don't always want to do this, especially when updates can break existing API).
5. Redundancy
Rule 5: Redundant version control: Don't rely on just Github. Use multiple synced off-site remotes and increase redundancy. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
This is the first thing you see when you go to git-scm.com (emphasis mine):
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Distributed version control. Distributed. That's the keyword.
Pinch yourself if you host your code on Github, and Github only. Why? There's a single point of failure. If Github goes down, or if you push corrupted files in the repo, your workflow will halt.
Ok. Now, signup for Bitbucket, and do this in your repo:
Now whenever you push to origin, your changes are pushed to both Github and Bitbucket.
You never know when shit will go wrong (because it can). It's never a bad idea to maintain off-site backups of your code. You never know when there's a disaster that affects just your city.
For reference, here's what my code storage look like:
All code lives in “Codebase” folder in Dropbox. Automatic syncs on changes.
Almost all code lives on Github.
The most important code lives on 2 other private mirrors — one hosted by my school, and the other than I maintain on AWS.
The only way I am losing my code is if the whole world is wiped off.
6. Commits
Rule 6: Commits: Make small changes, commit and push often. Never push broken code. Use sensible commit messages. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
This will feel familiar. Look into your commit history, I bet you'll find something similar to this:
“fixed issue with module”
ARE. YOU. SERIOUS.???
What does “fixed” mean? What “issue” was there? Which “module”?
A ton of us programmers treat version control systems as a means of backup, and not a means of maintaining history. History full of messages like these is useless unless all you want to do is retrieve files back.
A week after you check in changes with this commit message, you realized you need to revert something back because somewhere down the line a new bug was introduced. Now because your commit messages suck and have no descriptions, you'll need to look at the changes. That is exactly what version control systems were made to prevent (other than emailing code).
If it's too hard to write good commits, just follow this template:
Each commit should have a purpose. Is it fixing a bug, or adding a new feature, or removing an existing feature?
Only one change per commit. Commit when you solve issue #127, and only that issue.
Include issue number in the commit message.
Include a description of the change in commit description. This depends on the project contributing guidelines but usually you mention what was causing the bug, and how you fixed it, and how to test the change.
Write sensible commit message:
fixed cache being reset on every insert caused by missed access after write. fixes #341
Or…
added a new form in header to make it easier to collect leads. close > #3
And definitely not
remove stuff because why not.xoxo
7. Plan
Rule 7: Have a plan: Prepare for the worst case. What exactly will you do when something does go wrong? Document those steps in detail. — Karan Goel (@karangoel) January 16, 2015
You've been religiously following the other 6 rules and are a total boss in the software development. But your software is not invincible. Thinking otherwise would be naive.
Due to whatever or whoever's mistake, shit will go down.
Have a plan ready for the worst case. What will you do when your traffic skyrockets? Where do you pull backups from when the system is down due to an unknown bug? Who would you call in the middle of the night when your server goes down?
Think this through. But don't overthink it. Then automate steps that can be automated.
Now document it all. In detail. Make it so anyone acquiring your code also has the plan ready.
Not only will having a plan make you seem smarter, it will actually make you smarter.
End
There's always a relevant xkcd: http://xkcd.com/844/
These are just the rules that I believe define good software. If you still are not convinced to follow them, answer these two questions:
Would you expect someone new to join your team and be able to understand existing code easily?
When refactoring the code, is it easy and quick?
If you said “no” to any of the questions, re-read this post. Bookmark it. Share it with your team. You'll be doing them a favor.
These rules may seem obvious at first. And let me tell you, they are. Bad code gets written all the time, and eventually that bad code is killed.
Remember, your software is your legacy. It is up to you to decide how long that legacy lives for.
Happy programming.

Author's Note: All right, bear with me here guys. After silently enjoying Elsanna from the background (getting fic recs from the glorious snowstorm-thirteen), the time has finally come. I am officially an Elsanna Shipper now, with my very first Elsanna fic, based on the animated Disney Film, Tarzan. If it wasn't already obvious, Elsa is in Tarzan's role, while Anna is in Jane's. Meanwhile my Frozen OC Birger will be taking Kala's place (though being an adoptive brother instead of mother), while Birger's sire, Byrohk, will be taking Kerchak's place, and so on and so forth.
I am really excited for this, and I hope you guys like it too. =3 Review away, and let me know how I'm doing, and if Birger wins over your heart like he's done with everyone he's met to date. XD
EDIT: Had an awesome idea, so I made a teeny little edit. Will explain in the next chapter. ;3
The wind blew furiously as the blizzard enthralled the mountainous land around them. The frost dragons trudged slowly but stubbornly through their home, completely unfazed by the whiteout around them. To their keen, icy blue eyes, the snow was no more concealing the land than the moonlight that scarcely illuminated it. The great white beasts came into their valley peacefully, the wind and raging snow broken by a circular wall of strong, sturdy peaks. Here they would be safe, and undisturbed.
Meanwhile, off the coast but a few miles away, a human ship floated in a blaze as it drifted in the black water, a flaring beacon through the sheer white of the storm. Some of its occupants fought desperately to put out the fire, many not bothering to don their coats, the fire devouring their ship hot enough to nullify the snowstorm. They distributed fire extinguishers, made bucket trails filled with ice-cold water. As valiant as their efforts were, it was clearly a futile effort.
Which was why a single married couple attempted, instead, to flee the ship.
As the dragons nestled in their cove, making their nests and settling back into their home, a small contingent of pups banded together. They were excited to be back home, and now, they planned to play. One pair out of the fluffy dozen stayed close together as the band went off to the escapade: a ten-winter old male, and their young, scarcely winter-old sister. The Brother kept close watch on their sister as the group scurried onward, happy and playful as could be.
Unbeknownst to them, or to their elders, a shadowy beast had followed the herd to their sanctuary…and now stalked the exposed puppies.
The Man struggled to keep the lifeboat still as their wife cradled their child in their arms. Their auburn hair blew wildly in their face, the frost encrusted upon it all but getting into their eyes. They blinked them away, shaking their head furiously as they gave a mighty heave and, finally, the boat settled. The Woman let out a relieved sigh before they boarded their last hope, tightly securing their daughter in the warmth of their coat, against their chest. With their child safe in their coat, the Woman then made to assist their husband prepare the boat, and to ensure what few supplies they'd scavenged were not lost to the raging elements around them.
The Child was blissfully unaware, and seemingly unconcerned with the freeze around her…
The pups were daringly close to the boarders of their homeland, finding entertainment in the forest on the fringe. They gallivanted through the hardy trees—plants as much if not more so stubborn than the frost dragons who neighbored them. The young band scurried to and fro, running over each other, wrestling and chasing, carefree and oblivious to their surroundings. The Brother did not partake in what they viewed as frivolities, even being young as them. They instead watched over their sister, whom was drawn by the group mentality, playing and running along with them.
The Brother's ears and nostrils twitched as they tried to warn him, but their eyes remained upon the Sister instead.
Finally, the family made it ashore, even as the flaming wreckage of the ship fell to the wrath it had waged its war with. While the Man and the Woman mourned the fallen, it was past. They now had a dangerous, uncertain future before them. They were alone, isolated, and in a frozen world they did not belong in. But for their child, they would try. Thus did they trek deep into this cold paradise, searching for a place where they could make shelter. The Daughter giggled, and as the Woman pulled down the zipper of their coat ever so slightly, their child waved their stubby arms. The Man followed the gesture, and spotted a cave opening in the nearby mountain wall. They smiled, auburn moustache crinkling with snow, before they gently stroked their daughter's brown-haired head.
There they took their supplies, there they fortified the cavity in the land's bones and made their shelter. There, they made themselves safe, and warm…
They had gone too far, and too late did the Brother realize.
A snapping branch, and they were on the guard. They ran to catch up with the others, where the group had played off to, where their sister had followed. The sounds of yelps, of dragon-pup screams told them it was far too late. They came to a skidding stop at the edge of the trees, gazing in horror before him. Some beast…a monster…had already slain most of the pups by now. It was so big, so black…It's corded muscles rippling as its nightmarishly long claws tore through the young dragon flesh, and its yellowed teeth sank into them. The Brother watched as it turned onto their sister, and they howled in fear. Just as they were to leap forward, a shadow covered him. A loud, terrible roar sounded behind him—it was their sire, the mighty Father. The vicious, cowardly beast snarled before snatching the Sister in its teeth, and running off.
The Brother cried out, and made to follow…but the Father stopped him. They met their sire's eyes, and saw in them only sorrow, only resignation.
The Brother fell against the Father's arm, and they cried…
Weeks passed, and the infamous night remained sharp and painful in the Brother's memory. They sat alone, grieving still, even as their herd moved on, at peace and content in their frosted cove. Of course they could forget so easily, it was simple for them. They were not to blame for the massacre that occurred…they didn't have to live with the knowledge that they were the sole survivor, that if they'd just done something, then maybe…maybe the Sister would still be alive… The Brother's ears twitched once again, alerting them to a far-off cry. They looked up and away, listening closely. The cry came again—it was the cry of a pup, and small, helpless pup. Their ears twitched evermore as the cry continued to call out to him, and the Brother's gaze grew more and more determined.
They would follow their ears this time.
Consumers are responding to the industry push for the Surface-style form-factor, the IDC reports in their latest roundup of the tablet and PC market in Western Europe.
In their press release titled “Convertible and Detachable Devices Winning Over Consumers in Western Europe, Says IDC” they reveal that consumers have purchased 190.2% more detachable devices in Q1 2016 vs Q1 2015, rising from half a million to around 1.5 million devices. IDC defines “detachable devices” as a device “designed to function as a standalone slate/tablet as well as a clamshell device through the addition of a physical detachable keyboard, specifically designed for the given tablet.” There are what were previously called 2:1 devices which Apple CEO Tim Cook famously called a toaster-refrigerator before emulating it themselves with their new iPad Pro line.
Convertibles, such a Lenovo Yoga and HP Spectre series also saw a 12% increase in adoption, which is particularly significant given that the PC market itself saw a 12.9% slump in sales.
The sales of both detachable and convertible devices were both driven by consumer demand, though business adoption was also increasing.
The IDC wrote:
“Customers are looking for solutions that allow for flexibility,” said Andrea Minonne, research analyst, IDC EMEA Personal Computing. “We want to access information, create content, or communicate without constraints. Addressing such market demand represents an opportunity for IT vendors. Convertible notebooks and detachables are the most suitable device to guarantee functionality and mobility at the same time. Both form factors have been well received in the market and have gained momentum across Western Europe.
“Adoption among business users is only just starting,” said Marta Fiorentini, research manager, IDC EMEA Personal Computing. “We expect an acceleration in detachable deployments in the coming months as companies evaluate the new and more powerful commercial designs that have recently been introduced. Interest from enterprises is clear and this form factor seems to be a perfect fit with their mobility strategies. In some countries, we also see detachable deployments taking place in the public sector, which is usually more traditional in its form factor choices and often challenged by budget constraints.”
Due to the Surface range and devices by other OEMs Windows now held 13% tablet market share in Europe. This is up from 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 4.9% in Q1 2014.
The news suggests Microsoft will likely make the transition to a more flexible and touch-centric computing paradigm which engages consumers more, which is of course good news for the future of the Windows OS and the success of the Windows Store.

Garth Crooks' Team of the Week - do you agree with it? Why don't you have a go at your own team of the week using our selector tool below
Chelsea moved up to fourth in the Premier League with a great display in their 4-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday.
Manchester City on the other hand suffered another blip, only managing a 1-1 draw at home to Southampton. Nevertheless, the point saw them move back to the top of the Premier League on goal difference.
Arsenal could have been sitting top but they were held 0-0 by Middlesbrough on Saturday.
Leicester were brilliant in their 3-1 win over Crystal Palace, and there were also wins for Liverpool, Burnley, Stoke and West Ham.
Do you agree with Garth's picks? Or would you go for a different team? Why not pick your very own Team of the Week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends.
Goalkeeper - Victor Valdes (Middlesbrough)
Valdes kept only their second Premier League clean sheet in nine games and made six saves to deny Arsenal
This was a match I described on BBC's Final Score as a "walk in the park" for Arsenal.
As it turned out, it was a game Middlesbrough should have won, and would have done if midfielder Gaston Ramirez had shown a little more ruthlessness in front of goal.
However, it was keeper Victor Valdes who showed real composure under pressure and did a superb job keeping a clean sheet when Arsenal breached Middlesbrough's defences.
At times it became a duel between former Barcelona team-mates Valdes and Alexis Sanchez, both of whom hoovered up a hatful of trophies between 2011 and 2014 at the Nou Camp. However, there were no trophies at stake on this occasion - and no winners either.
Left-back - Christian Fuchs (Leicester)
Fuchs scored their first Premier League goal in their 41st appearance for Leicester in the competition
Let me start by stating that I like my defenders to defend well and wherever possible with a hint of spite. Christian Fuchs has plenty of the latter.
It can't be a pleasant afternoon playing against the Austria international because they seem to delight in making life as miserable as possible for whoever is up against him. So imagine my surprise when with Fuchs dispensed with their normal activities, fastened on to a loose ball on the edge of the opposition box and let fly with the most glorious left-footed volley you will see this season.
It also signalled the end of Crystal Palace's dismal afternoon. I wonder if Champions League experience is providing players like Fuchs with the confidence to attempt things they would have never dared before?
Centre-back - Winston Reid (West Ham)
Reid scored their first Premier League goal since May - and made more blocks than any other Hammers player (three)
This is the second time in as many weeks that Winston Reid has made my TOTW.
Last week they battened down the hatches against Crystal Palace and this week they provided the goal that gave a lucky West Ham three points that were so desperately needed.
In the meantime, the Hammers are still struggling to come to terms with playing in their new stadium. That said, I do see a far more determined side these days, prepared to grind out results and not roll over just because things are proving difficult at the moment.
Centre-back - David Luiz (Chelsea)
Luiz kept their third clean sheet in five Premier League games since returning to Chelsea
David Luiz seems to be taking enormous pride these days in keeping a clean sheet.
They were impressive against Leicester last week and even better against Manchester United this week. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte insists on playing three at the back and it seems to have focused the Brazilian's mind a little more on defensive matters.
Blues captain Gary Cahill has come through a difficult spell largely due to Luiz's presence and Cesar Azpilicueta, Luiz and Cahill now look like a trio with real promise. The big question for Conte is whether they will continue with this system once John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic are fully fit and come knocking on theirs door.
Right-back - Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea)
Azpilicueta made more tackles than any other Chelsea player (four) and the joint most clearances (five) as well as the most blocks (two)
This lad is a top-class defender. They have played left- and right-back for Chelsea and they are now occupying a central defensive position and doing so brilliantly.
The Blues have now achieved their fourth clean sheet of the season, and walloped Manchester United and their old boss Jose Mourinho in the bargain. It's hardly surprising that Chelsea players are releasing pictures of themselves celebrating their victory in their dressing room on social media. Well, why wouldn't you?
Defensive midfield - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)
Kante scored their first Chelsea goal and ran further than any player on the pitch (12.45km) - they also gained possession more times than any other Chelsea player (eight)
I don't think I've seen a team look more delighted or celebrate a goal more than when N'Golo Kante put Chelsea 4-0 up against Manchester United.
Admittedly, the celebrations signalled the complete and total demolition of United but it also signified the affection in which the Frenchman is held by their team-mates. What was even more impressive was the way Kante waltzed around defender Chris Smalling and slid the ball past keeper David de Gea with nonchalant ease.
Kante's performances have been so impressive this season that I have been left with no alternative but to put the France international on the early shortlist, with Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, for the PFA player of the year - and we are only in October.
Right midfield - Xherdan Shaqiri (Stoke)
Shaqiri was the first player since April to score two goals from outside the box in a Premier League game and was also the first Stoke player to achieve this feat in the division
Their first goal against Hull was stunning and their second on was almost as good.
I don't think I have seen Xherdan Shaqiri score an ordinary goal. And if Shaqiri's goalscoring exploits weren't enough to talk about, their passes for fellow midfielder Marko Arnautovic to run on to and exploit were absolutely wonderful.
We have, of course, seen Shaqiri in this mood before and are well aware that they can produce such amazing performances on a given occasion. The only problem for Stoke manager Mark Hughes is finding out beforehand when that occasion is likely to occur.
Centre midfield - Danny Drinkwater (Leicester)
No player on the pitch gained possession more times than Drinkwater (10)
What would Leicester City be without Danny Drinkwater? Not very much is the answer. Last season it was Kante who provided the inspiration and this season it's Drinkwater who is the driving influence in the Leicester engine room.
The English international's influence on their team's performances seems to improve every time I see him. They have a wonderful composure about them and in many ways a similar game in style and culture to my Liverpool nemesis Graeme Souness, but without the assassin's creed.
Centre midfield - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)
Coutinho scored their second goal in their past three Premier Leagues games at Anfield and is already halfway to their league goal tally from last season - they have four so far
Philippe Coutinho is currently my favourite player in the Premier League. I said at the start of the season that if anything happened to Coutinho, Liverpool could kiss goodbye to a top-four spot.
However, what we are seeing now is a vibrant Liverpool being lead by a Brazilian who they must wrap in cotton wool. Coutinho makes Adam Lallana, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum all buzz.
If manager Jurgen Klopp can fix their defence in time for the second half of the season Liverpool could be serious title contenders. To allow it to drift would be a dereliction of duty.
Left midfield - Adama Traore (Middlesbrough)
Traore was Middlesbrough's most accurate shooter against Arsenal - getting both of their efforts on target
What a performance by the 20-year-old. Adama Traore was outstanding - they were a constant menace down Arsenal's flank and came very close to completely destroying manager Arsene Wenger's 67th birthday bash.
As it happens the game was a pretty dismal affair except for the flashes of brilliance from the Middlesbrough man.
It never ceases to amaze me how young foreign nationals are so willing to play abroad in order to extend their understanding of the game and development. The former Barcelona player has left one of the most glamorous cities in the world and the splendour of Nou Camp (and its stars Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi) and eventually gone to Teesside in the hope that one day they might replace them.
Now that's what I call dedication.
Striker - Shinji Okazaki (Leicester)
Okazaki scored their first Premier League goal since March when they found the net against Newcastle. Leicester have never lost a league game when they have scored (W5 D1).
It's official - Leicester City's domestic season has officially started.
Shinji Okazaki's performance against a disturbingly ordinary Crystal Palace seems to have got the Foxes' Premier League campaign back on track. Manager Claudio Ranieri was somewhat concerned and slightly embarrassed that their team were basking in the glamour of the Champions League and paying scant regard to the performances that got them there.
However, this victory over Palace, stimulated by Okazaki's sheer energy and directness, provided Leicester with the platform for the victory and the points to go with it.
Last week Ranieri left out Okazaki against Chelsea - they returned and scored - and this week it was another striker Jamie Vardy who sat it out as the manager continued to shuffle the pack with Champions League fixtures in mind.
It looks like it could be Islam Slimani next week, but Ranieri needs to be careful. When the Champions League trap door suddenly opens, and it will, what is Ranieri going to feed their troops on then?
Image caption Seal training is gruelling, and many recruits drop out
The men who rescued two hostages from captivity in Somalia were part of the same elite special forces unit that killed Osama Bin Laden. Who are they?
The Bin Laden raid was years in the planning but took just 40 minutes to execute.
More than a dozen members of the US military were dropped near the high-walled, three-storey compound on the outskirts of Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan.
After a brief firefight, five people were killed, including Osama Bin Laden, who reportedly received a shot above their left eye.
All the US forces escaped unharmed, despite technical problems with one helicopter that they had to leave behind.
It says everything about their presence of mind that despite the dangers, they collected hard drives, DVDs and documents from the building before they left.
From the US point of view, the mission, codenamed Geronimo, could hardly have gone any better, a reflection on the preparation and skills of the men who carried it out.
I never thought about dropping out Stew Smith, former Seal on the gruelling training
Although there has been no official confirmation which team was involved, it is widely understood that it was the Seal Team Six (ST6), officially known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, but more commonly known as DevGru.
Now, eight months later, the Pentagon has confirmed members of the same team have parachuted into Somalia and freed a Danish man and an American woman kidnapped by reported criminals in October.
The hostages were unhurt, and nine of their captors are said to have been killed. No casualties have been reported among US forces.
The troops were the all-star, elite group of Seals, a team of military personnel trained to carry out top secret operations.
The Seals are part of the Navy Special Warfare Command, and are also the maritime component of the US Special Operations Command, continually deployed throughout the world in operations to protect US interests.
Seal Team Six (ST6) Elite force of Seals, based near Virginia Beach
Selected from all the units, to carry out the most demanding missions
Usually have five years of experience already
The unit belongs to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) which is run at a cost of more than $1bn a year
Involved in Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan in recent years
Existence shrouded in mystery
They reportedly train around the clock and can spend 300 days a year away from home
There are 2,500 Seals in total, and they take their name from the environments in which they are trained to work - sea, air and land. But it is their highly specialised training to operate in water that they are best known for.
Their missions can be enormously varied in nature, involving combat, anti-terrorism and hostage rescues.
These guys are America's thoroughbreds, says Don Shipley, from Virginia, who spent two decades in the Navy as a Seal.
"They're the finest guys America has. Your average guy walking down the street just doesn't have it.
"The guys that become Seals have gifted eyesight, above average intelligence, and are genetically built to withstand a lot of punishment, being pounded a lot. Those are the guys that are qualified to get in but the guys that ultimately come out are thoroughbreds, they're racehorses."
Image caption New Seals train for an additional year before they are deployed
It is often described as the toughest training available to any special forces anywhere in the world. The drop-out rate is 80-85%.
Stew Smith, a Seal for eight years, now runs fitness training courses in Maryland for people who are thinking of joining up.
They say the first six months of Seal training, known as Basic Underwater Demolition (Buds) is the toughest. It includes one period which lasts a continuous 120 hours, and involves swimming, running, obstacle courses, scuba diving and navigation.
A Buds training course last year lost 190 recruits out of 245 after only three weeks, they say.
"I never thought about dropping out. People ask me why not, and I say that you have to go there in a mindset of competing, not just surviving.
"If you're running your first marathon, your goal is just to finish the thing, you're in a survival mode. But when you're stretching out before, you look across and see a Kenyan who is trying to drop a minute off their best time.
"There is a different mindset. For me, every day in training was a competition."
After Buds, you are officially a Seal and assigned to a team but you need to have another 12 months of training with your new colleagues before you are deployed, says Mr Smith.
Image caption Navy Seals have seen plenty of action in Afghanistan
They believe what makes Seals special is their versatility.
"Also, having a strong confidence with the boat, and a relationship with the Navy, we have a way of respecting Mother Nature because we realise that when you're out there in the middle of the ocean, you're just a speck."
This familiarity with the vagaries of the weather teaches Seals to always have a Plan B, they say. "There's a saying in the Seals that two is one and one is nothing."
The origins of the Seals can be traced to World War II, and its predecessors like the Naval Combat Demolition Unit, which was involved in the invasion of North Africa in 1942.
Their formation came out of a $100m (£61m) package by President John F Kennedy to strengthen the US special forces capability.
They were later involved in Vietnam, Grenada and in Panama, where four Seals were killed as they tried to prevent leader Manuel Noriega escaping by destroying their jet and boat.
The episode was also renowned for an incident a few days later, in which loud rock music was played all day and night to force them out of their refuge in Panama City.
In more recent years, the Seals have been heavily involved in missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But their roles in the death of Osama Bin Laden and the hostage rescue adds two more chapters in their history.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has said the world can end extreme poverty in 17 years. But do the numbers add up?
Laurence Chandy argues there is a good chance they do in a new Brookings Institution study. In an e-mail they note that a large group of people -- the statistical mode -- are currently hovering near the $1.25-a-day poverty line. "It is a dismal reflection of human progress," they write, "But it also has an upside...The potential for further poverty reduction over the immediate future is there for the taking."
A few things will have to happen for the poverty reduction goal to be hit, write Chandy, Natasha Ledlie and Veronika Penciakova, who liken global poverty elimination to a relay race. India will have to up its game on both economic growth and the distribution of the benefits. As this chart shows, China has mostly run its leg of the relay – with economic growth that has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty and, almost on its own, put the world on trend to reach Kim's goal. (Follow the link for an interactive version that shows how the breakdown of extreme poverty has varied over time and is projected to evolve in the future). Relatively few Chinese remain in this circumstance of dire poverty, while the numbers of extreme poor in India and sub-Saharan Africa remain enormous.

After India, the politically fragile and sometimes conflict-ridden nations of Africa will need to show they can make economic progress – and hold onto it. That may be the biggest challenge to the world meeting Kim's goal.
In terms of what this all means for people, the graph below shows the range of outcomes the authors estimate might occur depending on growth in the developing world, and how the benefits of growth are distributed. The human implications are staggering: At the world's current population, the difference between the best- and worst-case outcomes shown below is in excess of 600 million people. And keep in mind, we are talking about $1.25 per day as the marker for “non-poor.”

12 Years a Slave“a biopic about Solomon Northup, a black fiddler in New York who somehow wound up a slave in Louisiana from 1841 until the law rescued them in 1853″is the nearly universally acclaimed frontrunner for the Best Picture Oscar.
Yet it's built upon a fourth-rate screenplay that might have embarrassed Horatio Alger. Screenwriter John Ridley's imitation Victorian dialogue is depressingly bad, reminiscent of the sub-Shakespearean lines John Wayne had to deliver as Genghis Khan in The Conqueror.
12 Years a Slave is hailed by critics as a long-awaited breakthrough that finally dares to mention the subject of slavery after decades of the entertainment industry being controlled by the South. Yet as cinema encyclopedist Leonard Maltin notes:
12 Years A Slave is a remake. What's more, the original television film was directed by the celebrated Gordon Parks. Why no one seems to remember this is a mystery to me, yet all too typical of what I'll call media amnesia. It first aired on PBS in 1984 as Solomon Northup's Odyssey, reached a wider audience the following year when it was repeated as an installment of American Playhouse, and made its video debut under the title Half Slave, Half Free.
You can watch the 1984 version online for $2.99.
The remake has more whippings, though.
“It's hard to make African-Americans boring, but 12 Years a Slave manages.”
The message behind the ongoing enshrinement of the rather amateurish 12 Years a Slave is that the cultural whippings of white folk for the sins of their great-great-great-great-grandfathers will continue until morale improves.
Steve McQueen (an art-house filmmaker who is a black Brit of West Indian background) directs 12 Years a Slave in a sort of minor league Passion of the Christ manner. (Incidentally, it's obnoxious for anybody involved with movies today to call themselves “Steve McQueen” instead of, say, “Steven McQueen.” In contrast, there were two 20th-century writers named Thomas Wolfe, but the second had the good manners to call themselves “Tom” to minimize confusion.)
Some of the appeal to critics is that Northern whites are shown as saints of racial sensitivity in the film's preposterous first 20 minutes. 12 Years a Slave opens in 1841 with Solomon Northup (stolidly played by the Anglo-Nigerian actor Chiwetel Ejiofor) being effusively admired by their white neighbors in Saratoga, New York. Northup is a model of prosperous bourgeois respectability, always doffing their top hat to their white peers while out riding with their wife and children in an elegant carriage. (Watch 0:24 to 0:35 in the trailer.)
How could they afford that?
Well, actually, they didn't and couldn't.
A glance at Northup's ghostwritten 1853 memoir makes clear that in 1841, rather than being a pillar of this Yankee community, they were an unemployed fiddler dragged down by their own “shiftlessness”:
Though always in comfortable circumstances, we had not prospered. The society and associations at that world-renowned watering place (Saratoga, the home of American horseracing), were not calculated to preserve the simple habits of industry and economy to which I had been accustomed, but, on the contrary, to substitute others in their stead, tending to shiftlessness and extravagance.
In McQueen's often baffling movie, this upper-middle-class family man suddenly decides to run off to join the circus with two fast-talking white men without even leaving a note for their wife. While dining in an elegant Washington, DC restaurant with their new friends, they suddenly take ill (perhaps from being slipped a Mickey Finn) and wakes up in chains.
Paradoxically, Northup's life in slavery is better documented than their murky life in freedom. Their poor family never reported or even guessed that he'd been kidnapped. They apparently assumed that vanishing was just the kind of thing he'd do.
On the other hand, property records show that Northup spent many years toiling on the ramshackle plantation of the notoriously cruel Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender“as always, a compelling movie star). Epps was a manic master who forced their slaves to cavort until dawn whenever they were in a “dancing mood.” Today, he'd be diagnosed as bipolar.
Northup's eventual liberation was well-reported in the press and the courts 160 years ago. When word of their kidnapping finally arrived home in 1853, top officials in both New York and Louisiana were dismayed by the trick played upon this freeborn citizen and worked together to quickly have them released.
(The assistance of pro-slavery politicians, such as Pierre SoulÃ©, a US Senator from Louisiana, is a puzzle to the modern mind. But their reasoning was that slavery depended upon a punctilious regard for documented property rights. Thus, they were publicly outraged that a slave sale had been contracted without proper title.)
Northup then had prosecuted the slave dealer who had bought him, but the trial never resulted in a verdict.
Interestingly, the slaver defendant countercharged that Northup had conspired with their white cronies to defraud them of their purchase price by attempting to pull the old Skin Game con on him. One inspiration for the Oscar-winning screenplay for Django Unchained that Quentin Tarantino has lately acknowledged was the 1971 comedy Skin Game, starring James Garner and Louis Gossett, Jr. as traveling bunco artists in 1858. Their most profitable scam is for Garner to repeatedly sell Gossett into slavery and then help them escape.

Critics say the activity puts storm chasers in harm's way
Defenders say storm chasing adds to knowledge of tornadoes' force and warns viewers of impending danger
The adrenaline-soaked thrill of stalking a twister is best displayed by the countless videos spawned when storms approach -- jittery images from a hand-held camera with the breathless voice-over of a storm chaser in the background.
But Friday night those voices turned to panic. Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Betsy Randolph says they could hear the audio from storm chasers trapped on Oklahoma highways as a tornado bore down.
"They were screaming, 'We're going to die, we're going to die,' " they recall. "There was just no place to go. There was no place to hide."
The burgeoning community of storm chasers was shaken over the weekend by news that one of their most esteemed members, veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras, 55, along with their son, Paul Samaras, 24, and chase partner Carl Young, 45, were killed by a tornado in El Reno that packed winds of up to 165 mph. They were among 13 killed in storms Friday in Oklahoma.
The storm chasers' deaths have cast into stark relief the hazards for those who choose to place themselves near lethal tornadoes.
"He (Tim Samaras) was a really well-respected researcher and they were not at all considered someone who was reckless. And so that's why this is so surprising," says Cameron Redwine, 32, a storm chaser and photojournalist from Denver.
Tim Samaras founded TWISTEX, the Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in/near Tornadoes Experiment, to help learn more about tornadoes and increase lead time for warnings, according to its official website. Samaras' field work was supported by the National Geographic Society.
"Thank you to everyone for the condolences. It truly is sad that we lost my great brother, Tim, and their great son, Paul," Jim Samaras wrote in a statement posted on their brother's Facebook page. "Our hearts also go out to the Carl Young family as well as they are feeling the same feelings we are today. They all unfortunately passed away but doing what they loved."
Samaras' crushed vehicle was found along a road running south of and parallel to Highway 40 just outside El Reno, Okla., leading authorities to speculate they were tracking the tornado as it was heading east before suddenly turning south, says Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West. One body was found inside the wreckage, a second about quarter-mile east and a third a quarter-mile west, West says.
STORY: Deadly tornadoes, floods strike Oklahoma
Storm chasers have become a staple of weather coverage on cable TV networks such as The Weather Channel, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. The practice involves individuals driving equipment-laden vehicles as close as possible to potential tornadoes and other violent weather, sending live video feeds and eyewitness accounts as storms approach and unleash their fury. Storm chasing puts the participants at risk.
In recent years, their numbers have expanded far beyond scientific researchers or professional weather reporters.
"There are thousands of storm chasers across the country now, all parts of the country," Weather Channel severe weather expert Greg Forbes says.
They hold conventions. Tour companies with names such as Extreme Chase Tours or Weather Gods have sprung up promising, for a price, to deliver anyone seeking a thrill to the doorstep of a tornado. Videos on their sites are a pantheon of twisters and dark skies with hard-driving rock music in the background and a voice exclaiming: "This is what it's all about right here."
The proliferation of storm chasers, particularly those armed only with a video camera and a taste for thrill-seeking, has left law enforcement and many veteran storm followers concerned about growing safety risks.
"When they put themselves in harm's way to chase the storms for whatever the reason," says Trooper Randolph, "they make it harder for us because then we're having to work around more people on the highway, more people that we're trying to rescue. And, sometimes, they end up being part of the problem."
Already, groups are suggesting that the deaths Friday could lead to re-evaluation of storm-chasing tactics.
"It is too early to say specifically how this might change how we cover severe weather, but we certainly plan to review and discuss this incident," says David Blumenthal, a spokesperson for The Weather Company, parent company of the Weather Channel. Three members of The Weather Channel staff were in an SUV that was sent tumbling some 200 yards by the storm Friday, leaving one occupant hospitalized with broken bones, Forbes says.

"I hope there are lessons learned from this tornado," they say, "that people realize that if they're going to go out storm-chasing, that they could die. There's no guarantee that they're going to be able to escape the tornado."
The Capital Weather Gang, The Washington Post's weather coverage team, criticized storm chasing in a post this weekend headlined "The day that should change tornado actions and storm chasing forever."
Forbes says there have been times when so many vehicles were chasing a tornado that drivers were getting in each other's way, all while a dangerous funnel cloud roared nearby.
"Storm-chasing is not something to be taken lightly. Sometimes you chase the tornado and sometimes you get in a position where the tornado chases you," they say.
Still, there remains significant value in on-the-ground reporting of tornadoes, Forbes says. Storm chasers can confirm the sighting of funnels and whether they have reached the ground. Skilled storm analysts such as Tim Samaras, who was killed Friday, can provide valuable data about a phenomenon around which many mysteries still remain.
In addition, viewers find most credible the first-hand accounts of a tornado in their area, Forbes says, and will choose to seek shelter as a result.
"There's tremendous amount of value from spotters and storm chasers," they say. "There is concern that law enforcement agencies or government agencies might outlaw or seek to curtail chasing activity because of the few bad behaviors or just too much road congestion."
It is certainly perilous work. In the Oklahoma storm Friday, the tornado that was about a mile wide crossed interstate highways where traffic was jammed and motorists were unable to get away. Forbes says GPS readings confirmed there were probably two dozen storm-chasing vehicles in the area at the time.
Redwine -- who was not in Oklahoma for the storm, but has chased tornadoes for 16 years -- says the lure of one of these monsters is powerful.
"There are others, like me, who are just absolutely fascinated by it," Redwine says. "They are as equally beautiful and awe-inspiring as they are dangerous and destructive."
In an online video about their work, Tim Samaras tries to explain their passion for the storms. "I'm not sure exactly why I chase storms. Perhaps it's to witness the incredible beauty mother nature can create," they say. "All my life I've been on a quest to find out how these things work."

Last year, councillors for the city of London, in Ontario, Canada, spent 90 minutes discussing a 12 word addition to a document. The contentious sentence read, “Consider a gender lens during the development and execution of new policies”.
Harmless sounding, perhaps, but some of the male politicians felt the line impugned their honour. Bill Armstrong, representative of Ward 2 since the 90s, accused Maureen Cassidy, the councillor who introduced the offending line, of “questioning the integrity of our administration and suggesting they were doing practices that would be discriminatory”.
That, they said, was simply not the case, and “I've been there long enough to know” – a reference perhaps to their opponent's more recent assumption of office. “Plain and simple,” they concluded, “all people are treated equally, so it doesn't have to be said.”
The thing is, while Armstrong's sentiment may be admirable, treating people equally has a long rap-sheet when it comes to achieving equal outcomes. That is to say, treating people equally often translates as treating people like men.
And not all people are men. Some of them (quite a lot actually) are women. Some of them are also girls – and boys. Sometimes people are men, but they aren't the white, middle-aged, able-bodied men that are imagined when city halls are drawing up plans to treat people equally.
What all this means is that what works for men, as imagined by city hall, doesn't necessarily work for everyone else. By treating us in a way that suits this male ideal, the rest of us are disadvantaged – often in surprising ways.
For example, I bet you've never thought about snow clearing as a gendered issue. Neither had city officials in Karlskoga, in Sweden. “The community development staff made jokes about how at least snow is something the gender people won't get involved in,” explained Bruno Rudström, one of the city's gender equality strategists.
But on reflection, they realised that even something as seemingly neutral as snow-clearing, actually could have a markedly different impact on men and women, due to the gender split in travel style. Women are more likely than men to walk, bike, and use public transport, whereas men are more likely to drive. By prioritising clearing the roads, the city was prioritising the way men choose to travel, despite the fact that walking or pushing a stroller though 10cm of snow is much harder than driving a car through it.
So the city changed the order of snow-clearing to focus on the pavements and cycle paths first, particularly around schools. As an unexpected by-product, it found a marked decrease in injuries: pedestrians are three times as likely as motorists to be injured in accidents due to slippery conditions.
Parks are another area you might not immediately think of as gendered spaces – but a study in Vienna found that, after the age of nine, there was a dramatic decline in the number of girls using them. The reason behind this decline was not that girls stopped liking the parks: rather, if they had to compete with boys for space, they tended to lose, because they were less assertive.
If they were older they probably wouldn't be here. Image: Getty.
In response, the city redesigned the parks to include a variety of courts to encourage different activities. It also divided large open areas into smaller semi-enclosed spaces. The effect was dramatic, and almost immediate: now that they didn't have to share the same space as the boys, the girls returned. A small change, but an effective one.
There are a number of other hidden ways in which cities can exclude women – for example, the traditional “human scale” for buildings as advocated by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, where human meant a 6 foot male. But the number one way in which women are let down in city planning is through a lack of safety, which in turn can impede women's access to work, a social life, housing and transportation.
Last Friday, ActionAid held a demonstration in Marble Arch, for Safer Cities for Women Day: 30 mannequins, a third marked in red, to symbolise the one in three women who will experience male violence in their lifetime. Each mannequin carried a quote from a woman. “The police told me not to tell anyone,” read one. “This is my city,” read another.
It may be their city in theory, but in practice, things are a little different. Poor lighting, dangerous public transport, even inadequate public toilet provision can all lead to cities being inhospitable places for women: in a typical Mumbai slum, there are around six toilets per 8,000 women, many of them infested with rats or without water. Women are often raped or assaulted as they search for a toilet.
Inevitably, it is Sweden that is leading the way in tackling these issues. After research finding that women were reluctant to use municipal car parks – due to traditionally poor lighting, windowless concrete walls, and lifts and stairwells tucked out of sight with few people around and no easy means of escape – officials in Gothenburg decided to do something about it.
Concrete was substituted for glass, and better lighting was installed, as well as an increased security presence. “A car-park company cannot solve the underlying problem, which is men's violence against women,” said Jonas Nilsson, the company's head of car park security, “but we can take many measures to reduce people's insecurity.” And making cities more woman-friendly doesn't have to be a purely selfless act: since the changes, more women have started using the car-park, and so the company made more money. Everyone wins.

To the east of the country, in the city of Kalmar, research found that women were avoiding taking the bus at night because of safety concerns. So, in order to achieve the city's goal of increasing public transport use, officials introduced “night stops”. Passengers travelling alone could ask the bus driver to stop between two regular buses stops — somewhere closer to home, or somewhere that simply felt safer. The bus driver would open only the front doors, and only allow the single passenger out, reducing concerns of being followed. The number of people using the night bus increased significantly following the introduction of these measures.
But we all know Sweden is insufferably progressive on gender issues – what about less enlightened countries? Like the UK, for example?
Well, since 2007, public authorities have technically been required to consider all planning decisions in the context of the Public Sector Equality Duty. This duty requires all public bodies to explicitly consider whether their decision will “promote equality of opportunity”.
And there have been some examples of good practice – for example, the London Borough of Lewisham “shifted its policy on employment site provision, to provide more local jobs to benefit women and reduce long-distance commuting”. (Women tend to make “more complex journeys than men” as a result of their shouldering the majority of the childcare and household burden.)
But there is still a long way to go. Last year reporting of sexual offences on trains and at stations reached “record levels”. In part this was because of increased reporting, but it doesn't change the fact that it is still happening on a significant scale. Meanwhile, councils continue to switch off street lighting to cut costs. It is debatable whether or not this actually leads to an increase in crime, but it certainly will not make women feel more safe.
Such considerations are perhaps likely to continue being overlooked, while female representation in local government remains so low: 32 per cent, 28 per cent and 24 per cent in England, Wales and Scotland, respectively. The issue is particularly acute in planning and construction, which Kate Henderson, chief of the Town and Country Planning Association describes as “very, very male-dominated”.
The evidence from cities around the world is clear: women and men use and experience cities differently, and if we want to ensure equal access for everyone, we have to take these differences into account. To return to where we began, London – this time the one in England – we have a new mayor in Sadiq Khan.
And here there is reason to be hopeful: Khan's new team has not been fully appointed (a deputy mayor for planning has yet to be named), but the signs so far look good, with a diverse team in stark contrast to our usual pale and male diet when it comes to city officials. With a range of perspectives on offer, perhaps London can start to move away from treating people equally and start instead to treat them equitably.

SEATTLE, WA - Former Seattle Times reporter Alex Tizon, who died in March in Oregon, wrote a shocking piece published this week by The Atlantic magazine about growing up with a slave in their household. The woman, Eudocia Tomas Pulido, later lived with Tizon and their family in Edmonds. But in a 2011 interview for a a Seattle Times obituary about Pulido, Tizon described Pulido to reporter Susan Kelleher as a sort-of nanny or extended member of the family - not a "slave."
"She cared for, protected, chaperoned and served my mother for 56 years, until my mother died of leukemia in 1999. Lola never left my mother's side. They were as devoted as any human being could be to another human being," the paper quoted Tizon in the obituary.
On Wednesday, Kelleher wrote a heartfelt story about them about their experience writing Pulido's obituary in 2011 - and the horror they experienced reading Tizon's memoir of Pulido as their family's slave.
In The Atlantic story, Tizon says that their grandfather gave Pulido to their mother during World War II. Pulido raised their mother, and continued to work - unpaid - for Tizon's family throughout their childhood. Their family moved to the U.S. when Tizon was 4, first settling in Los Angeles, and later Seattle.
In the piece, they describe the moment at age 12 when they realized that Pulido - who was called Lola - was actually a slave:
[My brother] was the one who introduced the word slave into my understanding of what Lola was. Before they said it I'd thought of them as just an unfortunate member of the household. I hated when my parents yelled at her, but it hadn't occurred to me that they—and the whole arrangement—could be immoral.
Setting aside Tizon's description of Lola in the Times obituary, their article has drawn a wide range of reaction. Some call it a heartbreaking and beautiful piece, others say that Tizon should've reported Lola's enslavement to the police. Some in the Filipino community say that westerners are misapplying the word "slave."

"The prime minister, the defense minister and the foreign minister each have their own specific authorities; there is the forum of nine ministers and there is the Cabinet and the decision, when it has to be made, will be made by the government of Israel – that's the way it has always been and that's the way it should be; not any group of citizens is going to dictate the decision nor even any press editorial." Thus said (Israeli) Defense Minister Ehud Barak at the special parliamentary session convened to approve the appointment of Avi Dichter as home front defense minister. The message Barak seeks to deliver is quite clear: The decision regarding an attack on Iran will be made by the elected echelon and any pressures exerted will be to no avail. However, their statement points the spotlight on another issue. Let's see, who is sitting in all those forums mentioned by Barak? Who is actually making the decisions there? And is it a mere accident that there are no women in any of those panels?
Here, in brief, is the makeup of the forums Barak was talking about: The prime minister, the defense minister and the foreign minister – all three are men. The members of the forum of nine ministers are Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Liberman, Finance Minister Steinitz, Interior Minister Ishai, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ya'alon, Minister without Portfolio Begin, Minister of Intelligence and Atomic Energy Meridor and the recent newcomer, Home Front Defense Minister Dichter – all of them men. As to the cabinet, it comprises 14 ministers, none of them a woman. Minister of Culture and Sport Limor Livnat (a woman) has an observer status but no voting rights.
When the news channels broadcast some time ago the funeral procession (held in Jerusalem July 18) of Rabbi Elyashiv (one of the most important figures in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish world), which was attended by tens of thousands, many critically noted the absence of women, who were not allowed to accompany their leader on their final journey, as an indication of the apparent "narrow-mindedness" and "backwardness" of the ultra-Orthodox community. But are secular Israelis any better than the ultra-Orthodox? Can we really pride ourselves on the fact that we rely on men alone to decide our fate for us, to choose between war and peace, to determine the destiny of tens of thousands of Israeli citizens, whether it will be to live or to die – and all this, without the voice of a single woman being heard in those clandestine deliberations?
No less troubling is the gap between the promises and the reality, which cannot be passed without notice. While the State of Israel is one of the few in the world to have anchored (in October 2010) in legislation the UN resolution stipulating that women should be given the opportunity to take part in processes of political peace negotiations, the law enacted by the state has remained on paper and never actually implemented. And this, not only because there is no process of political negotiations going on but also due to the prevailing social outlook in Israel and the way women are perceived here.
Yet, in the social discourse in Israel women are surprisingly welcome. Thus, for instance, Knesset Member and Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich, Knesset Member and New Movement-Meretz Parliamentary Group Chairperson Zahava Gal-On and social protest leaders Dafne Leef and Stav Shaffir are women whose voices are definitely heard on civilian issues. However, it transpires that security issues are outside the allowed limits for women. There, the line is drawn, marking out the bounds that women cannot trespass and never could, so that inevitably their ability to have some bearing on the social issues is detracted from, since as they have no say on the security budget, they are denied the option of diverting funds for social issues.
Therefore, and with all due respect to the new member in the ministerial forum of nine, Avi Dichter, it seems that Israel has no need for more of the same. The groundless assumption that only those who served in senior roles in the defense establishment – all of them naturally men – have any understanding in security matters should be discarded. An innovative and creative CEO of a business enterprise does not necessarily have to go through the entire production chain to successfully steer the enterprise they head; and by the same token, a brilliant woman politician can make history even if they have not shared the martial experiences of their colleagues who are ex-elite unit fighters.
It is still not too late to make amends. Prime Minister Netanyahu should display leadership and invite women to join the decision-making circle. Whatever the decision on Iran ultimately proves to be, women too should be there, at the hub of things, to make the decision along with the men. Just as we expect, and indeed demand that the Supreme Court of Justice reflect the composition of the population, so reality mandates that the government, too, represent the Israeli society in its entirety, not merely one half of it. It is only that way that we can put into effect the democratic values of Israel – at a time of emergency such as the present one, of all times. This task too falls within the prime minister's scope of responsibilities at this fateful hour.

Researchers have unearthed a decade-long espionage operation that used the popular TeamViewer remote-access program and proprietary malware to target high-level political and industrial figures in Eastern Europe.
TeamSpy, as the shadow group has been dubbed, collected encryption keys and documents marked as "secret" from a variety of high-level targets, according to a report published Wednesday by Hungary-based CrySyS Lab. Targets included a Russia-based Embassy for an undisclosed country belonging to both NATO and the European Union, an industrial manufacturer also located in Russia, multiple research and educational organizations in France and Belgium, and an electronics company located in Iran. CrySyS learned of the attacks after Hungary's National Security Authority disclosed intelligence that TeamSpy had hit an unnamed "Hungarian high-profile governmental victim."
Malware used in the attacks indicates that those responsible may have operated for years and may have also targeted figures in a variety of countries throughout the world. Adding intrigue to the discovery, techniques used in the attacks bear a striking resemblance to an online banking fraud ring known as Sheldon, and a separate analysis from researchers at Kaspersky Lab found similarities to the Red October espionage campaign that the Russia-based security firm discovered earlier this year.
"Most likely the same attackers are behind the attacks that span for the last 10 years, as there are clear connections between samples used in different years and campaigns," CrySyS researchers wrote in their report. "Interestingly, the attacks began to gain new momentum in the second half of 2012."
They added: "The attackers surely aim for important targets. This conclusion comes from a number of different facts, including victim IPs, known activities on some targets, traceroute for probably high-profile targets, file names used in information stealing activities, strange paramilitary language of some structures, etc."
The attackers relied on a variety of methods, including the use of a digitally signed version of TeamViewer that has been modified through a technique known as "DLL hijacking" to spy on targets in real-time. Installation of the compromised program also provides attackers with a backdoor to install updates and additional malware. Both the TeamViewer technique and command servers used in the attack harken back to Sheldon. The TeamSpy operation also relies on more traditional malware tools that were custom-built for the purpose of espionage or bank fraud.
According to Kaspersky, the operators infected their victims through a series of "watering hole" attacks that plant malware on websites frequented by the intended victims. When the targets visit the booby-trapped sites, they also become infected. The attackers also injected malware into advertising networks to blanket entire regions. In many cases, much of that attack code used to infect victims was spawned from the Eleonore exploit kit. Domains used to host command and control servers that communicated with infected machines included politnews.org, bannetwork.org, planetanews.org, bulbanews.org, and r2bnetwork.org.
The discovery of TeamSpy is only the latest to reveal an international operation that uses malware to siphon sensitive data from high-profile targets. The most well-known campaign was dubbed Flame. Other surveillance campaigns include Gauss and Duqu, all three of which are believed to have been supported by a well-resourced nation-state. Last year, researchers also uncovered an espionage campaign dubbed Mahdi.
11-19-15 3:25 PM EST: Ted Cruz appeared with Jenna Lee to respond to Obama's latest insults hurled at those who oppose them wanting to force Syrian refugees upon the rest of American citizens. Obama also pretends that these refugess are all 3 year old orphans and 90 year old widows. Get it? Widows and orphans..sounds darn near biblical doesn't it?
Cruz handles Obama as they ought to be handled, and that is with the simple truth. All Obama has is lies. That's all he's ever had. They lied to get in. He's lied to stay in. They continuously lie about who they are. They lied to pass Obamacare, and they are telling lies now to inundate us with God only knows who, who will do God only knows what. Correction...allah might know, but they have nothing whatsoever to do with God.
Here's Ted, who also answers a few viewer questions which Jenna asks. Excellent video. Just push play.

Jorge "George" Robledo Oliver (14 April 1926 – 1 April 1989) was a Chilean professional footballer. They played as a striker, and is most notable for their time spent with Newcastle United. They were the first non-British-registered foreign player to become top scorer in England.
Background [ edit ]
Robledo was born in Iquique, Chile to a Chilean father and an English mother. They emigrated with their family to Brampton, Yorkshire in 1932, at the age of five, due to the instability in Chile at the time.[1]
Club career [ edit ]
Robledo started their footballing career at Huddersfield Town, playing as a part-time amateur while they earned their money coal mining, though they never managed to break into the first team. They were able to give up the coal mining when they moved to Second Division Barnsley during World War II. First Division club Newcastle United signed them on 27 January 1949, for a fee of £26,500. The fee included their brother Ted; Newcastle were only interested in buying George but they refused to move without their brother.
Robledo's league debut for Newcastle came in the 2–0 victory away to Charlton Athletic on 5 February, while their first league goal came a month later in the derby match against Sunderland at St James' Park. Newcastle came out of the match 2–1 winners, with Robledo's goal separating the sides, helping to quickly make them a fan favourite. The other Newcastle goal scorer was Jackie Milburn, marking the start of one of the great striking partnerships in Newcastle United's history. Robledo went on to score 5 more goals in the last 12 games of the season.
The following season, Robledo scored 11 goals for Newcastle, then netted 14 times in the 1950–51 season and became the first South American to play in the FA Cup final, when Newcastle beat Blackpool 2–0 to lift the Cup. Robledo finished as Division One's top scorer in the 1951–52 season with 33 goals, 39 in all competitions (equalling Hughie Gallacher's record). Robledo finished the season by scoring the goal which defeated Arsenal in the FA Cup final, helping Newcastle lift the cup in successive seasons. The goal scored by Robledo was drawn by a young John Lennon, who included it in the artwork of their album Walls and Bridges in 1974.[2]
In the 1952–53 season, Robledo scored 18 times, taking their all-time goals record for Newcastle to 91 and their league record to 82 (making them the highest scoring (non-Irish) overseas player in the English top flight, a record that was broken nearly half a century later by Dwight Yorke[3][4]). At the end of the season, Ted Robledo was sold to Colo-Colo and George soon followed him, with Colo-Colo paying Newcastle £25,000 for their services. Both brothers were highly popular in Chile, and George ended as top scorer in the Chilean league in 1953 and 1954, with 26 and 25 goals respectively.[5]
Robledo left Colo-Colo in 1958, and spent a year out of football, before signing for Club Deportivo O'Higgins where they played out the final years of their career, until their retirement in 1960.
International career [ edit ]
Chile recruited Robledo for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, even though they spoke no Spanish. They made their debut in the opening group game against England (one of their opponents reputedly warned them after he'd hit the post "Steady, George, you're not playing for Newcastle now, you know")[6] and scored in Chile's 5–2 victory over the United States. They were in the Chile squad for the 1955 and 1957 South American Championships, finishing as runners-up in the former tournament.
They made thirty-one appearances for their national side, scoring eight goals over a period of seven years.

Individual awards [ edit ]
Personal life [ edit ]
Robledo married in 1959, and later had a daughter. They finally retired from football in 1961 and took charge of the sports program in St Peter's school, Viña del Mar, where they remained leading a quiet life until their death of a heart attack in April 1989, just before they would have turned 63. They were survived by their wife Gladys and daughter Elizabeth; Gladys, now in their eighties, is still living more than 20 years later.[7]
Their brother Ted had died nearly 20 years earlier, having fallen from an oil tanker into the sea off Dubai in December 1970, aged only 42. Their body has never been found.[8]

The Satanic Temple responded to a Florida school board and judge decision allowing the dissemination of religious materials in public schools by distributing its own Satanic literature to Orange County classrooms. (Satanic Temple)
The Satanic Temple responded to a Florida school board and judge decision allowing the dissemination of religious materials in public schools by distributing its own Satanic literature to Orange County classrooms.
“In response to a recent School Board decision in Orange County, Florida that allows for the dissemination of religious materials in public schools, The Satanic Temple will be distributing educational religious material to students,” reads a statement from the group.
The Satanic Temple (TST) describes itself as a group that, “facilitates the communication and mobilization of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty.”
Earlier this month, a judge dismissed Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) lawsuit against the Orange County School District seeking to overturn a school board decision allowing for the dissemination of religious materials in public schools – a move viewed as a blatant breach of the separation between church and state. The ruling also left open the option that if Christian groups can disseminate literature – atheist groups will have the same right.
But before the dispute could be taken to court, the school board agreed to allow an atheist group to distribute all of its pamphlets after first rejecting literature with titles such as “Jesus is dead” and “Why I am not a Muslim” because they would cause too much disruption, WFTV reported.
The group is still appealing the case because “there's no policy right now to ensure the school board won't discriminate against minority opinions” in similar cases.
“The Satanic Temple seeks to ensure that pluralism is respected whenever the Church/State division is breached,” reads a press release from the group.
The provided activity books flooding the Orange County Schools include that of the pamphlet entitled, The Satanic Children's Big Book of Activities, which features activities based around the exploits of the cartoon character “Damian.”
A word scramble activity directions reads, “These bullies are mad and afraid of things they don't understand. Help Damian use inclusive language to defuse the situation.” Another connect-the-dots description reads: “Damian is showing their class the way to make an inverted pentagram. Connect the dots to make one yourself.”
A drawing exercise asks, “What's Cerberus dreaming about?” with a thought balloon drawn above the mythological hellhound.
The word search and word jumble ask the participant to find words such as “friendship, compassion, acceptance, empathy, reason and freedom.”
Satanic Temple's spokesperson Lucien Greaves explained the situation in a Sept. 15 statement.
“We would never seek to establish a precedent of disseminating our religious materials in public schools because we believe our constitutional values are better served by respecting a strong separation of Church and State. However, if a public school board is going to allow religious pamphlets and full Bibles to be distributed to students – as is the case in Orange County, Florida – we think the responsible thing to do is to ensure that these students are given access to a variety of differing religious opinions, as opposed to standing idly by while one religious voice dominates the discourse and delivers propaganda to our youth.”
Nationally, The Satanic Temple has made headlines with a planned Black Mass on Harvard University's campus in addition to a successful petition to the state of Oklahoma to allow it to erect a goat-headed Baphomet statue next to a display of the Ten Commandments.

[1] If you don't do it already, start doing a daily devotional or quiet time.
This is the single biggest thing you can do to further intimacy with God, fight against sin in your life and grow in knowledge of the Scripture. I think mornings are the best time to do it (something like a pre-game pep talk), but when you do it is less important than if you do it. Make it work for you. Just do it.
[2] Have at least one area in your life where you are setting the bar really high.
Run a marathon. Learn a new language. Take up a new hobby. Read a whole book of the Bible. Lose the weight you need to…whatever. The goal itself is less important than the benefits these patterns will have in spilling over to the rest of your life.
[3] Fall in love with the Psalms.
This is the most emotional book of the Bible and there's something in the book that touches every experience we have in life…It speaks about elation, depression, victory, defeat, joy, pain, complacency and discipline. At any given point in your life, whatever you are experiencing is mirrored in at least one Psalm. Know your way around this book so that when the experience comes, you know where to go to gain perspective.
[4] Learn how to finish strong.
Focus on patterns and habits and less on singular experiences. Retreats, really emotional sermons, mission trips, etc. are all wonderful things, but these come and go. Use them to develop godly patterns and habits that will last a lifetime. I have seen many, many friends who had emotional experiences but didn't develop the day-to-day habits of walking with God. Those people flamed out. Don't let this happen to you. The coolest people I know aren't necessarily young people “on fire for God.” They are older people with a lifetime of trusting the Lord and watching Him work. Make it your ambition to be like those people.
[5] Even if you're not a reader, try to read some solid Christian books.
Some of my favorites are In Their Steps by Charles Sheldon, Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, Desiring God by John Piper and Knowing God by J.I. Packer. I have also been encouraged by the works of Max Lucado and Charles Swindoll.
[6] Learn to manage your money in a way that honors God.
This is one that I am still learning. More than ever before, I am learning from Scripture the importance God places on how we use our money. I highly encourage you to tithe regularly, give to missions causes and choose wise investments.
[7] Practice some disciplines you might not normally.
By this, I mean things like fasting or Scripture memorization. Even just doing this from time to time will keep you really sharp.
[8] Consider doing without cable.
I can tell you that my TV watching is a huge barometer on my spiritual life. Not having cable means two things for me. Number one, there is less of an opportunity to see stuff that will stick in my mind and feed my flesh. Number two: Because there is less available to watch, I watch less TV and have more time for other, more constructive things.
[9] Go on a short-term mission trip.
God's heart is for the whole world. We see that all over Scripture, but it's hard to get your brain around that until you actually get there and see it. I went to Ukraine in 1999. Before that trip, I could've told you that sure, God loves gypsies and orphans in Ukraine. But having been there and seen it for myself, I can tell you, God LOVES gypsies and orphans in Ukraine. Get out there and see for yourself.
[10] Make people more important than stuff.
As time goes along and I get more to worry about, I value my family and friends more than ever.

Changes in the way we think about the world are not “news” in the classic sense — they occur gradually, without discrete events to signal them. But they matter. Two such developments have come together recently, both reported in the New York Times. The first is the collapse of intellectual support for the notion that immediate austerity can boost economic growth. The second is a growing consensus that health-care-cost inflation is slowing for deep structural reasons, rather than having undergone a mere temporary dip from the recession. These trends have something in common: They blow to smithereens the intellectual foundations of the Obama-era Republican policy agenda.
During the last four years, the hoary Republican nostrums of lower taxes, spending, and regulation have cohered into a specific view of the world. Paul Ryan has been the leading figure in defining this view and persuading the entire party, almost without exception, to fall in line behind it. The Ryan worldview is that the United States is heading toward a massive debt crisis, that the crisis is driven primarily by rising health-care costs, and only their plan stands any chance of alleviating it. Ryan has expounded this view over and over:
It is of course unfair to judge the merits of an analysis solely by the rhetoric of its politicians; politicians have to sand off the rough and complicated edges of their ideas to appeal to a majority. The deeper expression of the Ryan worldview comes from Yuval Levin, a close adviser to Ryan, probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era (and who was recently recognized as such and granted a $250,000 Bradley Prize).
The fullest expression of Levin's view came in a widely cited essay they wrote for National Affairs, “Beyond the Welfare State,” which came out right about when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and has served as their blueprint ever since. The most striking thing about the essay is its Marxian grandiloquence. Just as Marx believed of capitalism, Levin insisted the welfare state was utterly doomed, that the ailments they identified would necessarily continue indefinitely unless their chosen remedy was adopted.
Levin hinged their view upon two specific contentions. The first was that the debt crisis was not merely a long-term fear but an existing reality, responsible for the present crisis:
This conflation of short- and medium-term problems — of annual deficits with retirement liabilities, of sluggish growth with the burden of debt, of the Obama agenda with the broader social-democratic project — is in one sense an error, of course. But it is not ultimately an error. Indeed, it is a powerfully clarifying synthesis, which has given us a vision of our future: The fiscal crisis we face is an extended and expanded version of our deficit problem; the recession from which we are emerging was a preview of life under suffocating debt; the Obama agenda does seek incrementally to advance the larger social-democratic vision — especially on the health-care front, where that vision has seen its greatest fiscal failures.
This became the basis for the Republican view that deficit reduction could not be delayed and must be undertaken immediately, and that radical new tactics, like threatening financial chaos through defaulting on the debt, were a justified response to an emergency that did not lay over the horizon but was already upon us.
Levin's second argument was a fanatical hatred for the Affordable Care Act. No supporter of the law could muster an enthusiasm that could match Levin's revulsion for the law — the “false hope that the dream [of the welfare state] may yet be saved through clever tinkering at the edges.” It was bound to fail in absolutely every respect, especially in its claim that it could limit health care cost inflation. Far from it, argued Levin. Obamacare “will exacerbate the cost problem,” they wrote in 2010. Under the new law, they were certain, “cost cutting can only be achieved at the expense of quality care ​—​and even so it rarely happens.”
Levin's arguments were hyperbolic versions of the critique of Obama that resonated among respectable centrists. The trillion-dollar deficits were shocking, dangerous; Obamacare didn't do anything to limit the continuous rise of health-care costs. These propositions maintained enough political respectability that Republicans could turn (hyperbolized) versions of them into the premise for their domestic policy and be treated as sagacious guardians of fiscal responsibility.
The doctrine of expansionary austerity — the premise that we must cut deficits not just eventually but immediately — has suffered a series of disastrous reversals. It has failed repeatedly in Europe, and its most prestigious academic basis, a paper by Harvard's Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, was exposed for a series of fundamental errors. A New York Times article this week represented a watershed, baldly stating in its headline, as the entire macroeconomic forecasting field has understood all along, that the short-term deficit was too low, no longer a counterintuitive dissent but a clear and barely contested reality.
Less visible, and possibly more interesting, is the growing mass of evidence that the health-care-cost inflation problem is indeed solvable. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that health-care costs, which have historically risen far faster than general inflation, pose the central threat to long-term fiscal stability. The Affordable Care Act attempted to control it at the same time as it expanded coverage to the uninsured.
Levin, and Republicans like Ryan, like to say that Obamacare's cost control's consist only of the Independent Payment Advisory Board — “unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats,” as Ryan calls them. In fact, the law created a wide slew of reforms intended to attack health-care inflation from every possible angle. The law created bundled payments, so that Medicare would pay hospitals or groups of doctors based on quality, not quantity, of care. It penalized hospitals that have to readmit patients owing to shoddy work (they previously would enjoy a second payday for doing so), taxed high-cost health-insurance plans, encouraged electronic medical records and research on effective treatments, and many other things. Nobody believed every one of these experiments would work perfectly. The idea was to try as many promising reforms as possible, and health-care wonks expressed cautious optimism that the law contained a wide breadth of them.
Over the last few years, health-care inflation has indeed decelerated — far more deeply than even the most optimistic backers of the law dare hope. The federal budget for Medicare and Medicaid in 2020 is now projected to be 15 percent lower than forecasters expected a few years ago.
At first, the sharp slowdown in health-care costs was assumed to have happened because the recession is making people cut back on their medical care. Levin has clung stubbornly to this interpretation. But as the trend has persisted, and undergone deeper study, a consensus is emerging that this is not the case at all. Several studies have found that the recession does not account for all, and possibly not even most, of the slowdown.
The trend precedes Obamacare, too. But the law can't be cleanly separated from the broad sentiment that the medical industry needed to overhaul its practices. As Matthew Yglesias argues, “If forward-looking investors think that future increases in health care spending will be met with legislative efforts to curb health care spending, then investments that rely on future high levels of health care spending won't be made and the system will lack the capacity to deliver ever-growing levels of services.” In keeping with Yglesias's premise, construction on hospitals cratered since 2009 and has not recovered.
Even with the data on their side, none of the advocates of Obamacare is nearly as certain the law will succeed as conservatives like Levin are that it will fail. That is a testament only to the overweening ideological certainty that pervades the right.
The slowdown in health-care costs is provisional. Perhaps it will peter out, and Obamacare will require massive revisions. Perhaps, too, the interest rate spike Ryan has been warning of will suddenly appear.
But the key thing is that the conservative program since 2009 has hinged on the absolute truth of both these provisions. The certainty of the imminent debt crisis, and the certainty that Obamacare would worsen rather than ameliorate it, undergirded the party's entire strategy. It is not merely the ideological extremism but Levin's dialectical certainty that the welfare state will collapse upon itself that has driven the party's refusal to compromise. Why not meet Obama halfway, see what we have learned in a few years' time? Because, they wrote, half-measures “would make real reforms less likely, by letting our leaders persuade themselves they have dealt with entitlements when in fact they would have only bought a little time.” There is no point in buying time to learn more about the nature and scale of the problem when your ideology has already furnished the answer.
And yet the canon of Levin and Ryan has undergone no revision whatsoever. The debt crisis is “irrefutably happening,” Ryan insisted recently. Obamacare, they said yesterday, will “collapse under its own weight.” Ryan and their party are so certain of these foundations their worldview rests upon that they can't even be bothered to look down at the rubble all around their feet.
In support of President Obama's renewable energy plans, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are pushing for giving 30-year permits to wind farms that would forgive them for thousands of eagle deaths expected within that frame of time.
Wind energy companies have pressed for these long-term permits, arguing that the current five-year permits leave “too much uncertainty and hampered investment.”
Under the plan announced Wednesday, companies would be allowed to accidentally kill up to 4,200 bald eagles anually via their wind turbines without repercussion — nearly four times the current limit.
Wind farms consist of fields stock full of massive turbines standing as tall as 30-story buildings with blades as wide as a passenger jet's wingspan. The tips of these blades can reach up to 170 mph and create tornado-like conditions around them.
Yet somehow, the Obama administration claims that allowing wind energy companies to kill the eagles will somehow “further conservation” of the bald and golden eagle.
“The permitting system gives us access to eagles and eagle mortalities that we wouldn't otherwise have,” an unnamed source told ABC News. “It's a great mechanism for us to work proactively to prevent eagle deaths.”
"There's a lot of good news in here," Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said in an interview, calling the plan "a great tool to work with to further conservation of two iconic species.”
Fish and Wildlife Service claims that the U.S. population of roughly 40,000 golden eagles could endure the loss of about 2,000 birds a year without being pushed toward extinction. And the agency also suggested that bald eagles, estimated to number about 143,000 nationwide, could sustain as many as 4,200 fatalities annually without endangering the species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service tried to push this plan once already in 2013 before a federal judge overturned it, agreeing with conservation groups like the American Bird Conservancy that the plan failed to properly assess the rule change's impact on the federally protected eagle populations.
The Conservancy's Michael Hutchins said a system that relies on industry rather than government regulators to monitor and report problems fails to protect these much-beloved birds of prey.
Can you imagine the reaction of the Obama administration if these eagles were being killed by coal plants? They'd use it to push even harsher regulations on an industry that Obama has already marked for death. So why is the standard so different for a so-called renewable energy source?
Is this just another concession made in an attempt to solidify Obama's legacy?
Nikkei is repeating claims of iPhone X production delays first reported last month; suppliers are apparently still struggling with ramping up yields.
Today's report specifically pinpoints the 3D sensor components, which Apple calls the TrueDepth camera system, as the bottleneck. The news comes as an independent analyst claims iPhone X production is now at 400K a week.
Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial
Way back in September, just before the iPhone X had been officially unveiled, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo said that OLED iPhone production was under 10,000 units a day.
The company later announced the phone with a ship date almost two months after the unveiling, presumably because of supply issues.
Rosenblatt research indicates that iPhone X production has recently increased from 100,000 units per week to 400,000 units per week.
This is a significant improvement in relative terms, but the absolute numbers are still pretty bleak, assuming they are accurate.
Apple sells millions of iPhones in the preorder period alone … and analysts believe the same will be true for the hotly-anticipated iPhone X despite higher prices. It certainly seems a good portion of ‘hardcore' Apple iPhone buyers have skipped on the iPhone 8 series and are instead waiting for the X's debut.
The dot projectors, which Nikkei blame for the production delays, make up part of the TrueDepth front-facing camera system in the iPhone X. The 3D sensor system enables compelling features like Face ID authentication and Animoji, so sorting out the production issues will obviously be a priority for Apple.
The Nikkei report remained confident that the iPhone X would enter mass production in mid October. Nevertheless, when the phone goes up for preorder on October 27, expect shipping delays and severely constrained supply.

- Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses are without power, and that means stoplights are out, too.
Many believe a dark stoplight should be treated as a four-way stop - and that system seems to be working fine - but Michigan State Police say that's not actually the way to do it, according to the Michigan Vehicle Code.
2) Answer: The intersection reverts back to the basic right-of-way requirements, not a four-way stop. Use caution and courtesy! pic.twitter.com/tY9Tjr6Nih — MSP Metro Detroit (@mspmetrodet) March 7, 2017
Michigan State Police tweeted out the information Tuesday, in anticipation to Wednesday's wind storm.
"The intersection reverts back to the basic right-of-way requirements, not a four-way stop. Use caution and courtesy!"
You can read basic right-of-way requirements here from the Michigan Vehicle Code. The gist -- the street with the heavier traffic has the right of way. If two vehicles get there at the same time, the driver on the right has the right of way.
"The rule is if you are approaching an intersection and someone has already entered it, you yield to them and they continue on their way," said Lt. Michael Shaw, Michigan State Police. "If you approach an intersection and you get there at the same time as someone else, the vehicle to the right, has the right of way. They can continue going and you have to stop for them. If you come up on an intersection that has a right access road, and nobody's there you don't have to stop. You use care and caution and go through."
The law is listed in the Michigan Vehicle Code Section 257.649, drivers must use the right of way requirements.
The listed law says:
Sec. 649.
(1) The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right of way to a vehicle which has entered the intersection from a different highway.
(2) When 2 vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right of way to the vehicle on the right.
(3) The right of way rules declared in subsections (1) and (2) are modified at through highways and otherwise as stated in this chapter.
(4) The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign, in obedience to the sign, shall slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall yield the right of way to a vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver would be moving across or within the intersection. However, if required for safety to stop, the driver shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is not a crosswalk, at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is not a crosswalk or a clearly marked stop line, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway.
(5) The driver of a vehicle traveling at an unlawful speed shall forfeit a right of way which the driver might otherwise have under this section.
(6) Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, the driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is not a crosswalk shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; or if there is not a crosswalk or a clearly marked stop line, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to a vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver would be moving across or within the intersection.
(7) When a vehicle approaches the intersection of a highway from an intersecting highway or street which is intended to be, and is constructed as, a merging highway or street, and is plainly marked at the intersection with appropriate merge signs, the vehicle shall yield right of way to a vehicle so close as to constitute an immediate hazard on the highway about to be entered and shall adjust its speed so as to enable it to merge safely with the through traffic.
(8) A person who violates this section is responsible for a civil infraction.
DTE Energy is calling Wednesday's wind storm the "largest weather event in DTE history." The FOX 2 Weather Authority Team says the highest wind gust recorded was 68 mph at Metro Airport, although most of us experienced gusts in the 60s. Hurricane-force winds begin at 74 miles per hour.
As of 12 p.m. Thursday, DTE says more than 665,000 customers are still without power. The restoration process is expected to take multiple days. DTE says they expect 90 percent of customers to have power restored by the end of the day on Sunday.
Many schools were closed Thursday and there were reports of damage to numerous properties. The winds fanned a blaze that killed five people in a Detroit apartment building and pushed a plane carrying members of the University of Michigan basketball team off a runway during takeoff southwest of Detroit.
They are working 16-hour shifts to assess the storm damage. Crews have also joined in the effort from Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, New York and Pennsylvania.

Monthly Development Update – April 2012
For this month's letter we are, as promised, diving into some of the details of the system updates that are currently in motion, and that will appear over the summer updates. With more class changes, a new sprint system, and the long awaited multi-feat spec system on their way, we wanted to take some time to explain how some of these features are shaping up.
There is also the small matter of the game's fourth anniversary incoming, but more on that later, let's get down to the system details first.
It's all about speed...
The way that stamina has been used in the game has long been a major balance issue. We have had to use various methods down the years to try and balance it, some of them messier than we would have liked, and much of the problem was linked to the original implementation of the way sprinting works in the game.
Systems Lead Einar Forselv explains in more detail:
"The stamina drain system did a percentage stamina drain on your total stamina pool amount. This meant that having high amounts of stamina had a huge penalty. This is of course more than a little counter-intuitive. Then you had the fact that stamina based classes using the same resource for sprinting and damage/utility makes situations where you are in combat over several minutes hard to handle since the amount of stamina regeneration in many cases simply cannot keep up. This was again magnified by the increasing costs for sprinting because of the percentage drain. Lastly, from a balance perspective, Casters also suffer during long fights since they have no means to regenerate stamina while in combat. When they had access to potions, it was too powerful of an advantage, but then when we locked them out in the previous balance changes, it definitely put them at a disadvantage in a drawn out fight. It was the lesser of two evils, but that doesn't mean we didn't want to address it."
So what about the new system? What will change exactly? Einar elaborated for us, and explained what will be changing with the new system:
"In the new system, we will introduce a new personal resource that will be used just for sprinting. It is also not observable by other players. This resource represents your sprinting capacity and is measured in seconds. This new sprint resource will also be drained when using the double tapping avoidance techniques.
Regeneration is represented over N seconds. The same rate applies in and out of combat. For some players this will mean lower regeneration rates out of combat when compared to the current system when using stamina, but offers a system that is way more consistent, flexible and understandable for everyone. However, remember that this will be completely independent of stamina regeneration, so everyone will have a greater tactical choice with this ability as they will no longer need to choose between sprinting or combo execution. This will be a timed resource that players can manage to their maximum advantage, and will make timing of its use vital, in particular in PvP."
This also means, systems wise, that these sprinting changes have a knock-on effect on a few others areas.
Firstly, the most obvious implication is that stamina as a resource is now used exclusively for combos. Casters will no longer have a stamina resource at all. (On a side note, the cost of spellweaving for casters is being reworked accordingly.)
This Sprinting ability can still be upgraded in the AA system.
The Endurance skill will be changed to reduce the amount of stamina used when executing combos. The stamina cost formula will be completely reworked. Also, some abilities, spells and feats will be redesigned to fit the changes, and the new shape and use of stamina.
Lastly, the way that Mounts work has been adapted to fit with the new system. Mounts will now also use the new sprint system. However, the mount itself will have a separate sprint pool size and regeneration independent of the player. This means that the performance of a mount is much more consistent across classes.
Overall the intention here is that sprinting will again become a tactical, and more importantly balanced, resource in combat. The playing field will be level, and any advantages earned will be based solely on your skill and judgement as to when you decide to use your sprint resource.
Multi Feat Specifications
This feature is one that many players have been requesting for quite a while, so it's great to finally be able to address it. The idea here is to make it easier for players to participate in different activities in the game, so they don't have to feel that they need to maintain a weaker hybrid set-up just because they like playing both PvE and PvP content, or don't have to sacrifice in order to provide a certain role in raid game-play.
The first point has already been given away in the title of this section. It will ultimately be a multi-spec system, and not just a dual-spec. While players can initially switch between two specs, we will have a third slot as well (and possibly more in the future). Free players will have to purchase access to any additional slots. Premium players will have access to two feat builds, with the third available from the in-game store.
Switching specs can be done almost anywhere in the game. Exceptions are for example inside raid and group instances. A limited amount of the shortcut bar slots will be saved for a feat spec. Half the battle is often setting up your shortcut bars when switching specs.
You will be able to give your specifications custom names so that they are easily identifiable, and you will be able to see all your feat specs at any time.
You will be able to allocate feat points to your builds without switching between them, but resetting your active specification still requires a visit to the trainer.
We are really looking forward to seeing this functionality on the live servers later in the summer.
Class Updates
We are currently working on the updates for the Tempest of Set class. The scope of the changes will probably be roughly similar to that which you recently saw for the Priest of Mitra. We have been collecting a lot of player feedback for this one (and still are!) so we feel we will have a good set of changes that should please fans of the Tempest. Mainly we are aiming to make the trees more consistent, providing good end lines for each tree and redesigning the currently weaker feats.
After the Tempest we will be giving a short look at the Bear Shaman to round out the Priest archetype, but this has far lower priority, and will be on a smaller scale. We feel that the Bear Shaman is already a pretty solid class, but their end feats probably deserve a second look.
Then we will be moving on to the Mage classes, with the Herald of Xotli and the Necromancer as our first priorities. Note that that doesn't mean the other classes might not get a few tweaks and pokes, but the above is the focus for the team at the moment.
Faction Vendor Changes
The systems team have also been working away on some changes for the reward vendors in Khitai. There are quite a few changes incoming, so Systems Designer Knut Jagels gave us a run-down of what is in store.
"We have added a great new accessory item to the Jiang Shi that I think most classes will want to take a serious look at, and we have significantly reduced the cost of the Jiang Shi's Body Bag item, given the other recent inventory additions. We have also added the epic level leg slot items that previously only dropped in the Enigmata and Ai hardmode to the vendors for those who want another option for attaining them. We have also reduced the price of the various Alternate Advancement containers in the faction vendors so that they provide a better priced option for those who may wish to boost their advancement there. Lastly, we have also added to the loot tables so that all the Expansion group dungeons now grant at least one Rare Trophy .
A little further out we are also looking at some quest changes in Khitai to add some additional new rewards and provide some additional goals for longer term players."
Birthday Celebrations
Next month will mark the fourth anniversary for Age of Conan! To mark the anniversary, we will have a special gift for all our loyal players, among which you will find a very special new cloak that the King themselves has commissioned for their loyal followers. Keep your eyes out for more details as we approach the special day!
A sign of things to come ...
Lastly, some of our adventurers have been venturing further afield than ever before, and are returning word of a ruined city to the south ... we sense there may be more there to explore ...
Until next month, barbarians. We shall see you on the battlefield!
This is why we can't have nice things. Cripes. A couple days ago, a fellow by the name of cyberniko (this is their name on XDA forums) intended on sending their game out to a small group of developers who where then supposed to take a look at it on their Android devices, let them know how it worked, give them feedback, etc. That happened all fine for the most part, except for one gigantic terrible jerk move on the part of another XDA forum member. This terrible jerk downloaded the unsigned APK of the game, signed it himself, and submitted it to the Android Market just as if it were their very own game. Evil.
The following message now appears aside the now-updated real version of the game, available for download in Beta still:
I suppose that most people, people like myself, would like to know the name of the developer who took the time to thief this game and a pass it off as their own work? We just happen to have that name: DavinciDevelopers.
After you've gone nuts all over those fellows for the crimes beyond recognition, head over to here: http://vuxia.com/ironsoldiers.apk to grab the Beta game for your own to test and love on. As you might guess, the actual developers site is the same: http://vuxia.com/ and you should report all bugs and mishaps going on with the game there.
So take a look at that game – it kinda totally rocks, and have some awesome fun with it, and think about the difference between soliciting people to take a peek at the game as the developer VS soliciting people to download the game as a person who did NOT develop the game. Hard stuff!

The United Team of Germany (German: Gesamtdeutsche Mannschaft) competed in the 1956, 1960, and 1964 Winter and Summer Olympic Games as a united team of athletes from West Germany and East Germany. In 1956 the team also included athletes from a third Olympic body, the Saarland Olympic Committee, which had sent a separate team in 1952, but in 1956 was in the process of joining the German National Olympic Committee. This process was completed in February 1957 after the admission of Saarland into the Federal Republic of Germany.
History [ edit ]
As East Germany had introduced its own national anthem in 1949, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 melody to Schiller's Ode an die Freude ("Ode to Joy") was played for winning German athletes as a compromise. In 1959, East Germany also introduced an altered black-red-gold tricolour flag of Germany as the flag of East Germany. Thus, a compromise had to be made also for the flag of the unified sports team. It was agreed upon to superimpose the plain flag with additional white Olympic rings. This flag was used from 1960 to 1968.[citation needed]
At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the team was simply known as "Germany" and the usual country code of GER was used, except at Innsbruck in 1964, when the Austrian hosts used the German language "D" for Deutschland.[1] Yet, the IOC code EUA (from the official French-language International Olympic Committee (IOC) designation, Équipe Unifiée d'Allemagne) is currently applied retrospectively in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of all Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.
In the 1968 Winter Olympics, East and West German athletes competed as separate teams while still using the compromise Olympic flag and Beethoven anthem. While today listed under the IOC codes of FRG (West) and GDR (East), respectively, in 1968 they were asymmetrically called in French Allemagne (Germany) and Allemagne de l'Est (East Germany), and in Spanish Alemania and Alemania del Este. The codes for Germany (West) were ALL (in Grenoble) and ALE (in Mexico City), and ADE for East Germany.
The separation was completed at the 1972 Summer Olympics with the use of separate flags and anthems. Because of the boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 summer games, only in 1972, 1976, and 1988 did two different German teams with different symbols compete against each other at Summer Olympics (not counting the Saar team of 1952). The German Democratic Republic ceased to exist after 1989, when it joined the Federal Republic of Germany in the process of German reunification in 1990.

For one of the most densely populated countries on the planet, there are plenty of places in Japan that feel far less so.
One such area is a surprisingly short drive from Tokyo, where a remote hilltop nestled next to a pair of golf courses offers the privacy necessary for an automaker to conduct its testing away from the prying eyes of its competitors. And it was here that a small group of journalists was invited to sample the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek before it makes landfall in North America.
More of a playground than a proving ground, the facility offered everything from a high-speed oval to a tight and twisty asphalt course, and even a rutted gravel track with sweeping corners — all perfect for putting the Crosstrek through its paces.
Going Global
Of all the changes made to the new Crosstrek, none is more significant than the architecture it adopts. Following the Impreza on which it's based, the Crosstrek becomes the second vehicle to be built on a new global platform that Subaru plans to use for most of its future products. Aimed at improving both driving performance and overall safety, the new underpinnings are both stiffer than before while being better equipped to absorb energy in the event of a crash.
Subaru's engineers were also able to use the new architecture to add space inside the Crosstrek without increasing its overall size all that much. While the wheelbase, at 104.9 inches (2,665 millimeters), is longer than before, the Crosstrek's bumper-to-bumper length has only grown marginally to 175.8 inches (4,465 mm). It's the same story elsewhere, with the Crosstrek measuring only slightly wider than before, while its overall height remains static.
ALSO SEE: 2017 Subaru Impreza Review
Despite those small increases to the exterior measurements, space in the second row has been improved to 36.5 inches (926 mm) of legroom and 38 inches (966 mm) of headroom. Likewise, shoulder room in the front has been increased by a little more than an inch (29 mm). None of those new measures are especially noticeable compared to the last version of the Crosstrek, but they only add to what was already a fairly roomy cabin.
Behind the tailgate, the Crosstrek now boasts 20.8 cu-ft (588 liters) of cargo room with the rear seats upright and 55.3 cu-ft (1,565 liters) with them folded. Just like the Impreza on which it's based, those numbers are enough to compete with compact hatchbacks like the Honda Civic and Chevrolet Cruze, among others, while offering more space than compact crossovers like the Toyota C-HR and Chevrolet Trax. It also features a rear cargo opening that's almost perfectly square, allowing it to handle larger items with ease.
Nearly New
At least on paper, the Crosstrek's powertrain looks largely unchanged in its second generation, though it has been thoroughly reworked. The same horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine is nestled under the hood, though the 2.0-liter unit has had 80 percent of its components swapped out for improved performance. Output hovers near where it was before, with 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque on tap, though peak power comes online about 500 rpm sooner.
Sending that output to the all-wheel drive system is the choice of manual of automatic transmissions, both of which have seen their fair share of changes. The manual gains a much-needed forward gear, bringing the total to six, while the continuously variable transmission that most buyers will opt for has been overhauled for smoother operation.
ALSO SEE: 2018 Toyota C-HR Review
Torque split varies depending on transmission choice, with manual models distributing it evenly between the front and rear wheels, and automatic ones having a slight bias to the front wheels. Regardless, it's the same full-time all-wheel drive system that Subaru has become famous for, with automatic models gaining the brand's X-mode drive selector.
The X-mode system works by optimizing the engine, transmission and all-wheel-drive system to maximize traction, while also offering hill descent control capability. A brief test on a steep, grass-covered hill provided predictable results. The Crosstrek was able to make it up and down the roughly 40 percent grade with ease, quelling wheel spin quickly on the way up and offering pedal-free driving on the way down.
Dynamic Drive
Having spent most of the day in a manual model, the Crosstrek's performance proved itself a bit of a mixed bag. Acceleration was slightly sluggish, while the same old vague clutch and tight shifter gates made the setup a little tricky to master. Out on the oval track, where speeds reached in excess of 80 mph (130 km/h), our tester felt bogged down somewhat, and often needed to drop two gears to keep up with the rest of the CVT-equipped pack under acceleration.
Switching to an automatic model, acceleration felt far more linear if not a little peaky. Much of the rubber banding has been dialed back this time, though it's impossible to eliminate it altogether. It is, however, the better of the two transmissions, and offers far better fuel economy, too. The Crosstrek with the CVT is rated at 27 mpg (8.8 L/100 km) in the city and 33 mpg (7.2 L/100 km) on the highway compared to 23 mpg (10.5 L/100 km) in the city and 29 mpg (8.1 L/100 km) on the highway with the manual gearbox.
ALSO SEE: What is Torque Vectoring?
When it comes to performance, again, the new architecture is the big story here. While the stilted suspension means it isn't quite as engaging to drive as the Impreza, the Crosstrek feels far more composed than its predecessor. With the increased torsional rigidity and a revised suspension setup, the Crosstrek's on-road manners have definitely improved, with far less slop in the overall feel.
Slight bouts of body roll were noticeable when the Crosstrek was pushed through corners, but that's to be expected given the 8.7 inches (220 mm) of ground clearance afforded by its long-travel suspension. Turn-in response has also been improved through the use of a quicker steering ratio and the adoption of a torque-vectoring system. The system was a little clandestine through the corners on the twisting tarmac course though it was far more noticeable on the gravel, with the ability to pull itself towards the inside of the turn on even the loosest gravel surface. The electrically assisted steering setup would definitely register on the numb side, with little feedback to speak of, though it feels no different than most CUVs on the market today and even some cars. There was also a noticeable difference in response depending on the size of the wheels and tires, with lower-grade trims and their 17-inch wheels with taller tires feeling slightly sloppier than the top Touring trim and its 18-inch wheels.
Additional Amenities
The design language both inside and out builds on the clean look introduced with the Impreza, with some additional elements playing to the Crosstrek's adventurous personality. Like before, the exterior enhancement package is made up of a bunch of body cladding that, while mainly for show, provide protection out on the trail.
Inside, the Crosstrek's layout and design are far superior to its predecessor's, with an inviting layout that features plenty of different materials and textures. There are still plenty of hard plastics to be found throughout the cabin, but the seats are comfortable, even when clad in cloth, and all controls fall readily to hand.

And just like the Impreza, the updated infotainment options are vastly improved. Either of the two touchscreens offered — a 6.5-inch unit is standard, while an eight-inch one is available — run a new version of Subaru's Starlink interface that's as fast as it is easy on the eyes, and is a massive leap forward. It also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility across the trim range.
The available EyeSight safety suite has also been improved on the 2018 Crosstrek, and now includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane-keep assist and reverse automatic braking. It was only the lane-keep assist system that we were able to test during out time with the Crosstrek in Japan, though based on how Subaru's safety suite has performed in the past there's no reason to doubt the other features will work as advertised.
The Verdict: 2018 Subaru Crosstrek Review
The 2018 Subaru Crosstrek is kind of like the automotive equivalent of a weekender bag; no, it won't work for everything, but it's versatile enough to suit most situations. That it finds itself competing with everything from compact cars to subcompact crossovers means that versatility is invaluable, with the Crosstrek capable of going up against any of its wide range of adversaries.
It's also capable of competing across segments when it comes to pricing. With a starting price of a shade less than $23,000 ($25,370 in Canada) including destination charges, it's priced more closely to a small CUV than a small car, and rightfully so. With its tall stance and standard all-wheel drive, the Crosstrek is more crossover than car while offering a car-like ride in an attractive package.

The board opened the overnight parking ban discussion in September, when trustees asked for a history of the parking ban to better understand why it's in place, and how they could improve it for residents.Oak Park Interim Parking Services Manager Jill Velan said the ban has been in effect since 1937. It was first challenged in 1975, when a ticket holder sued the village to contest the validity of the ban. The ordinance was upheld.----------------In 1980, two village ordinances established overnight parking for residents in the form of parking enclaves in cul-de-sacs and parkways, and allowed overnight parking along the railroad tracks and I-290, they said.The village adopted an ordinance to allow overnight parking, similar to what's currently in place, in the early 90s, after studies showed people weren't really even following the ban. Additional ordinances since 1994 increased the locations that allowed overnight parking.Trustee Adam Salzman said the only way to arrive at a policy decision on the issue would be to first hear from residents in different areas of the community.Trustee Peter Barber said while the village's Transportation Commission should look at broader, more long-term ways to improve parking in Oak Park, there are some short-term improvements staff can make."There are unquestionably better ways of trying to get overnight passes (than spending up to 20 or 30 minutes on the phone)," they said.Village President Anan Abu-Taleb said residents have two concerns: the number of passes they get and the process by which they get it. They said some improvements could be made quickly by staff without the need for more time-consuming commission studies and discussion.Trustees asked staff to come back with a recommendation to craft an ordinance to allow additional guest passes as one first step. They also agreed the village should look at the issue on a more comprehensive level.According to a village staff memo, the village's parking fund employs 17.5 full time employees. Parking services generated approximately $5.8 million in revenues in 2012, with about $3.7 million expenditures, according to the memo. Parking citation fines are not part of the Parking Fund revenues.According to the memo, the village has the following responsibilities related to parking:
Students at Durant High School staged a walk-out protest over mold concerns on Wednesday.
About 200 students and parents took part in the protest, saying the school has been keeping quiet about an alleged mold problem and that it has become a health issue.
All of the parents we spoke said the kids are doing the right thing.
“They are standing up for their rights,” Lorrie Holland said. “They're doing it peacefully. I'm very proud.”
Many said they feel like the school has not done enough to keep their children safe.
“I don't feel comfortable sending my child back to school,” Jessica Brownrigg said. “He's got asthma. I don't feel comfortable with them breathing that.”
“I just want to be allowed in the library to read the books or the band room without thinking I'm going to get an asthma attack or anything like that,” student Anthony Hammons said.
Durant Superintendent Duane Merideth said the parts of the school are closed due to a relative humidity problem.
“There were just a few books with a little mildew on them we cleaned them we said lets shut this down until we figure this out,” Merideth said.
Merideth said there are no visible signs of mold.
“The air quality of the location samples is well within accepted levels,” Meredith said. “No corrective measures are needed.”
Merideth said they're still waiting on the results of more in-depth testing performed by another company.
Others said the school is doing too little too late and punishing students for exercising their first amendment rights.
“They're telling me that they're not able to go in and use the restroom they're being denied access to a restroom while they're up there,” Janet Green said.
Students said the school actually locked the doors earlier this morning to prevent the protest from happening, but the school said it was just a safety precaution.
“I think it's wrong,” Green said. “Very much so. They have talked about them not being able to play sports. And you're going to punish a child? What happened to us being American citizens and our first amendment rights?”
Green, a nurse, delivered three cases of water to the students to make sure they didn't get heat exhaustion while protesting. They also gave masks out to the students to give their parents to help spread the word about what was going on at the school.
Delinda Knox, Director of Safe and Drug Free Schools, said they are not suspending any students or kicking students of school teams, despite what anyone may have heard. The students will simply be marked absent from whatever classes they missed throughout the day.
Knox said the library will be reopened once they have all the air quality results back.
Holland said they can't understand how such a new school is having such an issue.
“It should not have this problem,” Holland said. “And this problem should have been taken care of before the kids were forced to come here.”
On November 20, 2008, sitting in my cell in Guantanamo, I swallowed food for the first time since 2006. It was a celebration of sorts. Earlier that day, my friends and I had listened to Judge Richard Leon announce their decision in our case, Boumediene v. Bush. It had taken nearly seven years and a successful appeal to the United States Supreme Court to compel the judge to review our case, but once they did, it only took a matter of days for them to realize there was no case against us. When they ordered our release, I was so relieved, so overcome with emotion, so excited to be reunited with my wife and children, that I don't even remember what I ate.
The next morning, I resumed my hunger strike.
“Next time I eat,” I told the guards, “it will be in my own home, from the hand of my wife.”
Another 181 days passed before I was actually released. With the exception of my one celebratory meal, I had eaten nothing but what was force-fed to me through a tube. I emerged from Guantanamo at 5'9” weighing 125 pounds. When my older daughter first saw me, I was so wasted away they didn't recognize me. “This man,” they told my wife, “is too old to be my father.”
On December 27, 1996 Marvel filed for bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The company was losing money hand-over-fist. Worse, it owed money (coincidentally, its highest debt, $1.7 million, was owed to Disney). Over one-third of Marvel employees were laid off. For a company that had created some of the most iconic and recognized characters the world over, the future seemed bleak.
This may seem hard to believe for a company about to release Avengers: Age of Ultron , the sequel to a film that grossed over $1.5 billion, and a studio whose lowest grossing movie ( Captain America: The First Avenger ) still brought in $370 million worldwide. So, how did Marvel scratch and claw all the way from the bottom to the top? They risked everything.
Bankruptcy paid off all existing debts, but if Marvel was going to survive, they needed to start actually making money. Marvel had grand new plans to create “Marvel Mania” theme restaurants, Marvel Interactive CD-ROMs and a new trading card initiative with Skybox. Marvel Mania opened one location in 1998 and closed a year later. The CD-ROM and trading card plans were woefully out of date before they were even announced. This was the kind of dated thinking that got Marvel into this mess.
If the Marvel Studios plan failed, they would lose the rights to every single one of those properties. The bank would own them and the plans for a Marvel Cinematic Universe would be dead.
The 1996 bankruptcy came two years before the first modern Marvel movie, Blade , hit theaters. While most of their other plans failed miserably, Blade was part of an ambitious licensing deal that sold the cinematic rights to properties like X-Men and Spider-Man to studios like 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures for quick cash. It was a great idea on paper. Blade was a modest success, Bryan Singer's X-Men helped relaunch the modern era of superhero movies and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man grossed over $400 million. Those Marvel movies began to make a lot of money, except they were making money for everyone but Marvel.
Blade made $70 million at the U.S. box office, but Marvel only pocketed a shocking $25,000. Because of a flat-fee negotiation, Marvel made nothing off the success of X-Men .
In 2003, Endeavor talent agent David Maisel pitched Marvel a simple, but radical idea: why continue to give away your best assets to other companies for a paltry fee? Create your own production studio, develop and produce these titles in house and retain 100% of the profits. At the time, Marvel was intrigued but hesitant to move forward. After about seven years toiling away at profitability in the wake of their bankruptcy, they were finally starting to see some returns, as small as they were. Why risk all that on a plan that leave them broke again?
Maisel was persistent; their main argument was that if this deal failed they were arguably no worse off than where they currently were, but with a chance to become their own successful studio and finally in creative and financial control of their own assets. In 2005, the Marvel board approved Maisel's plan and a seven-year, $525 million financing deal with Merrill Lynch was announced that would launch Marvel Studios, an internal production company that would “give Marvel complete creative control” over their films (an agreement was reached with Paramount Pictures who would market and distribute the films).
But, to get that $525 million, Marvel had to put something up as collateral: almost everything they had.
The deal included 10 properties — Captain America, The Avengers, Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Power Pack, and Shang-Chi — and if the Marvel Studios plan failed, they would lose the rights to every single one of those properties. The bank would own them and the plans for a Marvel Cinematic Universe would be dead.
It was an incredibly risky move. Marvel knew, even at this early point, that they wanted to build towards an Avengers movie, and if this deal failed, they'd lose that opportunity. There would be no Avengers and we'd never see Captain America: The First Avenger , Black Panther , Ant-Man or Shang-Chi (OK, we were never going to see a Shang-Chi movie anyway).
If Marvel's plan didn't succeed, and succeed right away, they were right back to square one and with no more movie rights left.
That put a lot of pressure on whatever Marvel's first film would be. And if they got to this point with a lot of shrewd planning, they'd also need a little luck.
That initial list of Marvel films includes a lot of familiar faces, but is missing one of their biggest names: Iron Man . At the time, Iron Man was still owned by New Line Cinema (a subsidiary of Warner Bros.), but their option ran out and just two months after the above deal was announced, Marvel got the rights back to the character. But, because Iron Man was not part of their financing deal, they could not use the money they acquired to make that film. Marvel wanted to launch their films with a character who had never been in live-action before so, in another huge gamble, they fully financed the first Iron Man film themselves, with their own money.
The rest is, as they say, history. The risk Marvel took in putting up The Avengers as collateral on their new studio worked. Iron Man made over $500 million and Marvel has never looked back, eventually selling to Disney for $4.3 million in 2014. (For their efforts, Maisel has a special “thank you” card at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron .) Meanwhile, Shang-Chi is waiting patiently for their own movie.
Sam Burgess' hopes of making the Rugby World Cup could be extinct after 80 minutes of Six Nations rugby in Dublin this weekend.
England travels to Ireland for the tournament's pivotal fixture and if England win - and particularly if their midfield performs - you can close the door on Burgess' RWC chances. Already they are, by my reckoning, seventh choice among the midfield candidates for an England RWC squad that may carry only three.
Those of the league persuasion will be aghast at the implication. One of their heroes - a titan in Souths' premiership win - being forced to wait in line behind rugby players, and English ones at that.
Aren't they all a bunch of plodders who kick the ball all day? Well, occasionally, but not exclusively. Like it or not, there are English midfielders with better pace (Jonathan Joseph), footwork (Kyle Eastmond), vision (take your pick), defensive ability (Brad Barritt) and even power (Manu Tuilagi) than Burgess.

Food and music - two of my favourite things combined into one gluttonous show of song, dance, and smoked meat! Schwartz's the Musical is a recipe for success, but just as some people's culinary ability only goes as far as "heat and serve", there's always a way to mess it up.
I actually ate an enormous dinner before heading to this show at the Centaur Theatre, just to make sure I wasn't ravenous for marinated brisket by the end. Disappointingly, I wasn't.
As much as succulent slices of fatty smoked meat are the real hero of the show, the theatre would need to add some smoked meat-scented candles to the room to leave you hungry and wanting more. Sure, lots of words rhyme with "Jewish" ("true-ish", "blue-ish", etc.), but besides a few zingers the laughs were few and far between.
But if you've lived in Montreal for awhile you'll enjoy hearing about the lovable, local business, the other city references, the Toronto-bashing, and the explanation of why smoked meat is just so great.
The fun part of the show is that you'll learn (or be reminded of) the following Schwartz's smoked meat rules:
1. Don't order lean meat
2. The drink of choice is black cherry soda
3. Don't add mustard to the first few bites. Savour the meat.
4. Smoked meat is served on rye and only on rye.
5. Don't ask for dessert. Eat your smoked meat or liver and shut up.
6. Tip!
This is your smoked meat bible.
So I left fully educated about the history of the shop - the different owners, the stereotypically poor service, and the screwball regulars - but I also left feeling like I'd just watched a two and a half-hour long extended diner scene from Grease the Musical (1 not the horrible sequel), except instead of a jukebox there was a piano that also acted as the diner sandwich counter. Basically the show got over-stretched into a dry, lean chicken breast instead of a tender, fatty, flavourful piece of cow.
The whole shtick is that a woman from Toronto comes to Montreal to buy Schwartz's from the older proprietress, but they fall under the spell of both the smoked meat and the head waiter. Same old story - Torontonian realizing it's better here than there.
The leads have strong voices, but there's only so much you can do with tunes that don't get stuck in your head. Maybe if the dancing condiments had offered free samples, or the mustard container didn't look like a baby's bottle and the pickle didn't look like a sickly green potato...
So go see the show if you absolutely love everything about Schwartz's or Montreal history, because it really does do the restaurant proud in terms of honouring them as an important slice of Montreal history, but don't go if you think you can't make it through an evening of shuffle steps. Lets just hope there's no bagel sequel. Go watch the West Side Story rumble scene instead.

Jose Iglesias and Ian Kinsler decide to battle it out in a game of rock, paper, scissors where loser gets smacked in the head by a huge water jug. (0:26)
On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers stars Justin Verlander and Miguel Cabrera were generous enough to give the world a glimpse of the team's very odd -- and violent -- version of rock-paper-scissors.
The two players in question are shortstop Jose Iglesias and second baseman Ian Kinsler, with Kinsler delivering the punishment and Iglesias absorbing the bonk to the head.
While Verlander and Cabrera's sneak peak into Detroit's clubhouse is surely appreciated by the masses, the Tigers' game brings up a few questions, most pressing of which: What is the origin of the game? And how can we see more of it?
0 Renton votes against King County's proposed safe injection sites
KING COUNTY, Wash. - The Renton City Council voted against having a location for King County's proposed safe injection sites.
This eastside city is the fourth one to say “no” to King County; Bellevue, Federal Way, and Auburn also do not want the sites that would allow drug addicts to use legally under supervision.
Earlier this year, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and County Executive Dow Constantine proposed two safe-injection/safe-consumption sites for King County as a way to combat the growing number of overdose deaths in the city and county. If established, the sites would be the first two officially sanctioned consumption sites in the nation.
It was immediately obvious that one would be in Seattle. The city, after all, leads the region in overdose deaths and it has both the existing health services and political will to make a new site practical and possible.
But finding a location for the proposed second site is proving difficult. And because the King County Council in July agreed to not put the second supervised site in any city where it was opposed by city officials, options have narrowed.
Here's a timeline of the injection sites discussion.
Early-August 2017: Eastside cities voting against injection sites
Bellevue, Federal Way, Auburn, and Renton have voted to ban safe injection sites for drug users in opposition to a proposal by King County.
Following Seattle, these cities all rank in the top six in overdose deaths in King County. After Seattle, Auburn tops the list with 216 overdose deaths during the past 16 years followed by Kent (210), Renton (191), Federal Way (162) and Bellevue (117).
Watch video below, scroll down to keep reading.
Bellevue Mayor John Stokes, who led the city's recent effort to ban the sites, said they aren't convinced that data proves safe injection sites help the opioid problem. And they don't think that resistance to hosting a site means that city officials don't care.
“It doesn't mean we're not concerned. We're not heartless,” they said in a recent council meeting.
Read full story here.
July 2017: Safe injection site opponents turn in 70,000 signatures to ban them in King County
the supporters behind Initiative 27 to ban safe injection sites turned in more than enough signatures to have the measure put on the ballot. They're pushing for the King County Council to put it on the November ballot so voters can weigh in before two approved safe injection sites open.
“This petition is not about shaming the user,” said Joshua Freed of IMPACtion, the political action group behind the initiative. “What's neat about this initiative process is it's non-partisan. It's an idea you can get behind.”
Freed emphasizes that they agree with most of the recommendations from the King County Opioid Task Force, just not injection sites.
June 2017: Heroin injection sites only in cities that choose to establish the sites
The King County council voted in an amendment that limits injections sites and allows city's elected leaders choose whether to locate these facilities in their communities.
“I am strongly against the implementation of heroin injection sites. I would rather see these resources go instead towards funding the proven treatment methods we already have and exploring new ways to support prevention, intervention, and treatment," Metropolitan King County Council Vice Chair Reagan Dunn wrote after the vote.
May 2017: King County Metro bus ads support safe injection sites as new initiative pops up against them
A local nonprofit is supporting ads on King County Metro buses that promote safe injection sites for heroin and other illegal drugs. The ads, which proclaim “Safer is better. Supervised consumption spaces prevent fatal overdose,” were posted by VOCAL-WA, supported by the Public Defender Association. King County Metro confirmed there are 40 ads that will be running on buses based out of downtown Seattle and Tukwila for the next five weeks. File photo: A free clinic in Canada. It gives drug users a place that they can inject themselves under the watchful eye of medical professionals. VOCAL-WA said the money for the ads was from private foundation grants and individual donations, and Patricia Sully, who is heading up the campaign, said via email that the ads reflect “established science and outcomes.” “People understandably don't always know the benefits of such spaces -- that they save lives, reduce the spread of disease, and connect people to other necessary care,” they wrote. Read the full story here.
Late-Jan. 2017: Leaders announce injection site to open within a year
Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine announce the county will move forward with recommendations from the Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction Task Force.
Heroin-injection sites are expected to come to King County. The first would open in Seattle, ideally within a year, leaders said. The second would be elsewhere in King County.

I was a little hesitant about the new Tag Helpers feature coming out with ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET MVC 6 when I last wrote about it, but a few recent updates have totally changed my mind. These things are going to be awesome.
Are you still trying to understand what tag helpers are, and why we'd use them over good old Razor helpers? Then read on!
Here are the sections in this tutorial:
What's a Tag Helper?
It's a set of code that allows you to no longer have to use Razor helpers to build your cshtml forms. What this means is that when you had to write this:
@Html.ActionLink("Add a Movie", "Add", "Movie")
You can now write this:
<a asp-action="Add" asp-controller="Movie">Add a Movie</a>
Because of this, you can now write views that look like HTML rather than an unwieldy mix of HTML and C#.
The Completed Form
I like to show the results first. Here's the view model we will be using:
public class AddMovieVM { [Required(ErrorMessage = "Please enter a title for this movie.")] [Display(Name = "Title:")] public string Title { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage = "Please select a release date for this movie.")] [Display(Name = "Release Date:")] public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage = "Please enter a running time for this movie")] [Range(1, 1000, ErrorMessage = "The running time must be between 1 and 1000 minutes.")] [Display(Name = "Running Time:")] public int RunningTime { get; set; } [Display(Name = "Description:")] public string Description { get; set; } [Display(Name = "Genre:")] public int SelectedGenre { get; set; } public List<SelectListItem> AllGenres { get; set; } }
Now, if we were using HTML Helpers, our corresponding Add view might look like this:
@model MoreTagHelpers.ViewModels.AddMovieVM <h2>Add a Movie</h2> @Html.ActionLink("Back to Movies", "Add", "Movie") @using (Html.BeginForm("Add", "Movie")) { <div> <div> @Html.LabelFor(x=>x.Title) @Html.TextBoxFor(x=>x.Title) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x=>x.Title) </div> <div> @Html.LabelFor(x => x.ReleaseDate) @Html.TextBoxFor(x => x.ReleaseDate, new { @type = "date" }) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x => x.ReleaseDate) </div> <div> @Html.LabelFor(x => x.RunningTime) @Html.TextBoxFor(x => x.RunningTime, new { @type = "number" }) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x => x.RunningTime) </div> <div> @Html.LabelFor(x => x.Description) @Html.TextAreaFor(x => x.Description) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x => x.Description) </div> <div> @Html.LabelFor(x=>x.SelectedGenre) @Html.DropDownListFor(x => x.SelectedGenre, Model.AllGenres) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(x => x.SelectedGenre) </div> <div> <input type="submit" value="Save" /> </div> </div> }
Now, here's that same form, using Tag Helpers.
@model MoreTagHelpers.ViewModels.AddMovieVM <h2>Add a Movie</h2> <a asp-action="Index" asp-controller="Movie">Back to Movies</a> <form asp-action="Add" asp-anti-forgery="true" asp-controller="Movie"> <div> <div> <label asp-for="Title"></label> <input type="text" asp-for="Title" /> <span asp-validation-for="Title"></span> </div> <div> <label asp-for="ReleaseDate"></label> <input type="date" asp-for="ReleaseDate" /> <span asp-validation-for="ReleaseDate"></span> </div> <div> <label asp-for="RunningTime"></label> <input type="number" asp-for="RunningTime" /> <span asp-validation-for="RunningTime"></span> </div> <div> <label asp-for="Description"></label> <textarea asp-for="Description"></textarea> <span asp-validation-for="Description"></span> </div> <div> <label asp-for="SelectedGenre"></label> <select asp-for="SelectedGenre" asp-items="Model.AllGenres"></select> <span asp-validation-for="SelectedGenre"></span> </div> <div> <input type="submit" value="Save" /> </div> </div> </form>
HTML all the things! That second form is much cleaner than the first IMHO. But, what really makes it is that Visual Studio will highlight which HTML tags are using tag helpers:
The normal HTML is highlighted regularly, and the tag helper HTML is in purple, making it really obvious which is which and hopefully negating some of the complaints I've seen about Razor being more obvious than Tag Helpers.
Let's dive into some of these helpers to see how you can use them in your ASP.NET MVC 6 projects.
Anchor Tag Helper
First, let's look at this helper:
<a asp-action="Index" asp-controller="Movie">Back to Movies</a>
That's just an anchor tag with two tag helpers attributes. Notice that each tag helper attribute begins with "asp-", and their names make intrinsic sense to us: "action" and "controller".
In the particular case of the anchor tag helper, there are a few other properties we could set, like asp-fragment, asp-route, and asp-path. Even better, Visual Studio now gives you intellisense for these attributes:
Form Tag Helper
The form tag helper looks something like this:
<form asp-action="Add" asp-anti-forgery="true" asp-controller="Movie"></form>
The properties "asp-action" and "asp-controller" are same as in the anchor tag helper, but notice the "asp-anti-forgery" property. Setting this to true is the same as using the @Html.AntiForgeryToken helper in Razor (which you should always be using). This helper has simply made your views a little bit cleaner.
Label Tag Helper
Making your views a little bit cleaner is a theme you'll see woven into each of the tag helpers, and the next example comes with the label tag helper. Here's our example:
<label asp-for="Title"></label>
That's really simple, in more ways than one. Note that there's no more lambda expressions (no more x => x.Title) and no more mixed-in C#. Plus, we can now wrap elements inside of the label without needing to create custom helpers.
Input Tag Helper
Continuing with the simple theme:
<input type="text" asp-for="Title" />
Now there are many different kinds of input tags (e.g. date, checkbox, text, radio, etc.) and each kind had a different Razor helper. In the new tag helpers, there's just the input tag helper, with two attributes: "asp-for" and "asp-format".
TextArea Tag Helper
The text area is a separate tag in HTML (which I probably should have known before I started researching this blog post, but oh well). Here's the helper for it:
<textarea asp-for="Description"></textarea>
Select Tag Helper
Another tag which is different from the standard input tag is the select tag, and consequently it has a different tag helper:
<select asp-for="SelectedGenre" asp-items="Model.AllGenres"></select>
Again we see "asp-for" but now we also see the source collection specified using "asp-items." Easy. One odd thing I noticed about this is that "asp-for" doesn't require the Model. prefix, but "asp-items" does. If anybody knows why this is, I'd love to hear it.
Validation Tag Helper
The final tag helper we see on the completed form above is the one on a <span> tag. This is an unusual one, since under many circumstances you won't want to use a span tag as anything other than a <span> .
Except when what you want is a validation message. In that case, you'd use this:
<span asp-validation-for="Description"></span>
This is the time when we should show the HTML that this renders:
<span class="field-validation-valid" data-valmsg-for="SelectedGenre" data-valmsg-replace="true"></span>
Well well well, that looks familiar. This renders the same HTML as the Razor helpers, so it's really a no-lose situation for us web developers.
But wait, that's not all! There are several other helpers we can use.
Environment Tag Helper
Here's one of those other helpers:
<environment names="Development"> ... </environment> <environment names="Staging,Production"> ... </environment>
This helper is really interesting because the contents of the helper only get rendered if the HTML is deployed into specific environments. It does this by looking at an environment variable called ASPNET_ENV, and which you can set by right-clicking on the Project file and selecting Properties, then selecting Debug.
I'm hoping there's an easier way to change this variable in the fully-released version of Visual Studio, but until then, this is how you use it.
Link and Script Tag Helpers
These are possibly the most interesting new helpers.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" asp-fallback-href="~/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" asp-fallback-test-class="hidden" asp-fallback-test-property="visibility" asp-fallback-test-value="hidden" /> <script src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/mvc/5.2.3/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js" asp-fallback-src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js" asp-fallback-test="window.jQuery"></script>
There's a lot going on here. First, notice the values in the src attribute. Those urls point to the Microsoft Ajax CDN, a new (to me, at least) content-delivery network that holds many commonly-used production CSS and JS files, particularly those produced and maintained by Microsoft. In our case, in the sample project we get the script files for jQuery, unobtrusive validation, bootstrap, and others.
But what about those "asp-fallback-src" attributes? They specify a second location that we can go grab the source files from should the first location be unavailable. In other words, we now have a fallback plan that allows our CSS and JS files to gracefully degrade over should the CDN (if we are using one) not be available. Finally, note that the fallback parameters are entirely optional.
Image Tag Helper
New in the Beta 5 release of ASP.NET is the Image Tag Helper which looks like this:
<img src="~/content/images/profile.jpg" alt="John Smith" asp-append-version="true" />
Notice the new asp-append-version attribute; that's the only TagHelper attribute in this tag. What that does be render an <img> with a query string attribute appended on the source URL, like this:
<img src="/content/images/profile.jpg?v=X5q6D366_nQ2fQqUso0F24gWy2ZekXjHz83KmWyaiOOk" alt="company logo"/>
The content of the v attribute is determined by the content of the image; if the content of the image changes, so does the v attribute. This forces the browser to download the image again.
This is a technique known as cache busting; writing code that forces the browser to download a resource (in this case, an image) if that resource changes. This technique guarantees that the user will always get the most recent version of the resource.
Cache Tag Helper
The Cache tag helper is similar to the Environment tag helper in that it doesn't target a specific HTML tag. Rather, it caches its contents in server-side memory, set to an expiration date. An example might look like this:
<cache expires-after="@TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)" vary-by-user="true"> @Html.Partial("WeatherReport") </cache>
In this sample, the WeatherReport partial view will be cached for 5 minutes, and will vary by the user. We can do this to significantly reduce load on the server as all of these requests will be cached server-side.
What actually happens is that ASP.NET generates an ID that is unique to the context of the cached content, which allows you to have multiple <cache> on a single page and not have them interfere with one another.
There are quite a few ways to control how the cache operates. Attributes include expires-after, expires-on, expires-sliding, vary-by-user, vary-by-query, vary-by-route, etc. You can use any combination of vary-by-* attributes on a single cache tag, and doing so modifies the ID that is generated for the cache.
There's one major limitation to this tag: on the back end, it uses a construct called MemoryCache to store the cached content. MemoryCache is limited by the amount of memory available; once there's not enough memory to go around, MemoryCache will purge items until it has the memory necessary. Further, any app pool reset or server shutdown will destroy this cache. Basically, don't treat MemoryCache like a persistent storage solution, because it is not such a thing.
For more info, see Dave Paquette's wonderful in-depth article on the Cache Tag Helper.
Summary
All of this is to say that Tag Helpers are a significant step forward in coding efficiency for ASP.NET MVC and Visual Studio. Go grab the latest version of Visual Studio (and check out the sample project) to get started on using these things!
Happy Coding!
