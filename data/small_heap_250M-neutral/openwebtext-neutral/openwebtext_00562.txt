There are a lot of terrible commandments to choose from.
There's the one to cut off a woman's hand if they touch a man's genitalia during a fight; the commands to kill men, women, and children; the command to stone disobedient children; the command for wives to submit to their husbands “in everything”…and so on. But there's one that takes the cake, and it came straight from Jesus's mouth. In fact, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this commandment is that it was presented by Jesus as the greatest commandment. In other words, if a Christian is looking through the Bible for the commandment they were to most pay attention to…this is it. This is the one.
When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus said, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.” Now, liberal Christians will come in here and say that what Jesus meant was the nice, kind God. You know — the God who didn't command men who had sex with men to be stoned to death, or command the wiping out of entire tribes — men, women, and children. But that doesn't really seem to hold water here, for one simple reason: Jesus is quoting the Old Testament. Deuteronomy 6:5. In context, it says:
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
There is no mistaking this. This is the same God. The commandments that God gave them then, in the Old Testament, were to be followed. And in case you may still be insisting this isn't the blood-hungry God of the Old Testament, the very next verses are about the most disturbing parts of the Israelite conquest:
When the Lord your God brings you into the land they swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
In case you need me to spell out the obvious — he's talking about taking over things that belonged to other people. Plundering them. Why are they able to take the “good things” and the “vineyards and olive groves” that they didn't plant?
Because the Lord their God, whom they loved, brought them into an occupied land and told them to slaughter all the people there. And they did it because they loved this God with all their heart, soul, and strength.
And then a threat, if they don't do as they're told.
Fear the Lord your God, serve them only and take your oaths in their name. Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; for the Lordyour God, who is among you, is a jealous God and their anger will burn against you, and they will destroy you from the face of the land.
Why? Because this is what those who don't fear this God you need to love to deserve. And then, what do they get as their reward? Lots of killing:
Do what is right and good in the Lord's sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors, thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said.
Now, that's just the nuts and bolts. This total, complete dedication to God undergirded the entirety of the Old Testament. It was the reason people were to be obsessed with following the horrific law of the Old Testament. It was lauded and praised and led to unspeakable destruction. The other commands are bad, as well — but this one hijacked every part of your being — your emotions, the core of your identity, and the entirety of your intellect is to be devoted to the Old Testament God. And, as Richard Dawkins put it:
The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.
I think this is clear when it comes to the God of the Old Testament because, um…I've read about Him. But I realize there may be doubters, so here are thorough references for each charge. I think the evidence is clear.
Why did the Isrealites commit such disturbing crimes in the Old Testament?
Because they loved its God.
And Jesus is saying the GREATEST commandment of all is to love this God. This God did not have them love their neighbors. No. This God had them slaughter their neighbors and anyone who didn't sign up for their misogynistic, homophobic, homicidal, racist agenda.
Loving this God is the absolute worst thing anyone could do. Let alone sacrificing the entirety of your intellect, your emotions, your very sense of identity to such a being, making you an essential zombie to its fictional whims.
It's a horrifying commandment.
And the worst thing about it is that, because Jesus said it, it is repeated in church. Constantly.
If you wonder why fundamentalist Christians can be so upsetting so much of the time, this is why. They are commanded to love a God who is far worse than they ever were, as most of them refrain from genocidal rampages.
And not only love this being, but be completely and wholly invested in this being. What this means is that if a conflict in their mind, in their heart, in their sense of identity or instinct even hints that maybe loving this nightmare of a fictional being is a bad idea…they have to disown that part of themselves. They are commanded to be God zombies, and to twist themselves in knots in order to fulfill the definition.
Worst. Verse. Ever. No contest. Nothing else even comes close.
And this total investment in God makes the second commandment a nightmare, as well:
“Love your neighbor as yourself.”
A nice, beautiful verse, at first. Except when you ask the question: “How is the Christian expected to love themselves?”
They aren't really, because they are supposed to love God with all that is in them. The entirety of their being. They're completely and totally invested. I mean, how do you love someone? With your emotions? Well, ALL your heart is invested in God if you follow the greatest commandment. You have to love them through God — which means that God's love is the one you're showing them.
The same God who is the nightmare we were just talking about. That God's “love.”
Yeah.
And lest there be any mistake, Jesus says of the second commandment, “And the second is like it” — meaning that the love of the neighbor is like the loved one has for God. As it would be — if all you are is invested in God, then all your love is done through God. Otherwise — how could the commandments be similar? There is, I submit, nothing loving about committing genocidal acts, or stoning people to death for non-offenses.
Add to this that this “Love your neighbor as yourself” business is also from the horrendous Old Testament law — Leviticus 19:18 — right before a chapter on sexual sin that includes the infamous Leviticus 20:13: “If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.”
Obviously, this definition of “love” has been seriously fucked up by its connection to the first commandment.
Now. It is true that The Great Samaritan story is based on the “neighbor” portion of this verse, in Luke 10:25-37. And yes, the “Love your neighbor” part does get people to do decent things.
But the disturbing aspect of these good-intentioned acts is that they are too often through the eyes of God. And that is how Jesus can say that “Love your neighbor as yourself” is a commandment that “all the law” — in its horrendous detail — can “hang on.” Love for other human beings — the most beautiful thing we have in this world — is effectively hijacked by this commandment, as it commands you to love through a horrendous God.
To use a concrete example..I remember that when I was a fundamentalist Christian, I wanted to do certain things — like celebrate the identities of lgbtq people, or cheer when women took a more active role than Paul prescribed, or stop worrying about people being sinners, or reject, wholesale, the God of the Old Testament. But I couldn't. God was in the way. I could love them…but up to an extent, because I loved God more.
First I had to love God, then I had to love people. My love for God boxed my love for people in — or, rather, boxed in the ways I could care about people and see them as they were instead of whom a nonexistent God said they were. And I don't think this is just me, or just fundamentalist Christians. When you have the God of the Bible who you have to love as a first priority…that takes or cordons off ways that you could be loving other people who don't fit in Their guidelines.
Eventually, I simplified things. And now I have a new “command” I follow — although it's not so much a command as a personal choice that I and many others have committed to. It's worked out better, so far, although sometimes it's harder than others.
Here it is:
Love people.
Just love people.
Here's to hoping it catches on.
Thanks for reading.

What is the Q?
The Q is the world's first smart home lighting system that integrates light and sound.
Our energy-efficient and affordable LED light bulbs connect to the world through the Q Station router, allowing you to both create a Q (queue) of music and send lighting Qs (cues) from the same smartphone app.
The Q Station has a standard 1/8" audio jack as an output to your home audio system or headphones. Once connected to the the Q Station, your audio system becomes WiFi-enabled. That means you can play music to it from a networked device like a smart phone or computer.
When playing music over WiFi, the Q intelligently provides a light show for each song you listen to. You can personalize the show based on your mood with presets in the Android/iOS app. It's easy to customize your playlist and share it with your friends!
What can I do with the Q?
How does it work?
The Q Station is a WiFi router that also talks to the Q Bulbs over a lower-power wireless connection. You use the Q Station like you use a normal router, with settings for music-response customization built into the router's settings web page. You have the option to automatically synchronize the lights to any music you play through the Q Station, whether that music streams from the Internet, your cell phone (wireless speakers), or a USB drive plugged into the Q Station's USB port.
Key features
Specifications
How we are different:
1. WiFi Audio Streaming
We support wireless audio streaming through WiFi from your smart devices to your home stereo system (similar to Sonos). Our Q Station supports Airplay, Q-Play, DLNA, BubleUPNP, audio streaming/sharing protocols. In addition, we support SoundCloud and are working on integration with other cloud music sources like Spotify and Songza.
2. Smart Home Platform
Your next smart home technology will work seamlessly with our smart LED lights. We support AllJoyn, which is used by many existing smart home appliances. AllJoyn makes it easy for smart device app developers to communicate with our lights in the same way they communicate with other smart appliances. We also have joined Apple's HomeKit program to work on the integration of Q system and the HomeKit.
Even without programming, you can set up event-driven signaling through Zapier/IFTTT, so your lights can let you know what's happening across any of 300+ different online services.
The Q Station is built on OpenWRT and supports thousands of existing software packages for Linux/OpenWRT. We will provide an SDK including examples to get you started developing with the Q. We are looking into building an IDE into the router configuration web page for educational programming and simple scripting. We'll need your input to make sure the scripting language supports the most useful modes of operation.
3. An Affordable Wireless LED Bulb
There are many colorful, wireless LED bulbs on the market, but we don't think any of them come close to the cost performance of the Q.
In order to drive mass adoption of smart LED lighting, we developed a proprietary cost effective 2.4GHz RF radio for networking and control of the LED lights. Our patent-pending technology delivers comparable RF performance at less than 1/4 of the cost and more energy-efficient than other wireless technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee.
Why open platform?
No other wireless LED lighting system is future looking about the smart home. we want anyone to be able to leverage our hardware for smart home applications.
OpenWrt makes it possible for developers to add their own functionality.
AllJoyn enables home appliances and smart devices to inter-operate easily with our Q Station to control the lights.
USB port makes it easy to expand and connect with sensors, arduinos, and other hardware development platforms
What people are saying about the Q:
"I would wire up my whole house with smart LEDs if the price is right, I am just not going to do that if it costs me over $50 each." -- Alex, IT Geek
"I love the idea of combining music and technology! It makes me feel like I can control the setting for the avid music enthusiast myself! Lighting is an integral feature. I cannot wait to see what a product of this nature would look like." -- Nimay, Nightclub DJ
"My kids would love to light up their room with a different color each day!" -- Michelle, Mom
We need your help!
We've spent a lot of time and effort getting this project ready for the world. We have working prototypes of the Q Bulb, Q Station, and Q App and an international group of contributors. Our manufacturing contacts are ready to put the Q into production and we have a lot of improvements scheduled -- but we need to order over 1000 units of each device to make the Q at a reasonable cost. Please back this project and help bring the Q to the world!

Pelosi gives Rangel some breathing room
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi won't consider removing Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel from their powerful post before the ethics panel wraps up a wide-ranging investigation of the New York Democrat.
Some fellow Democrats would like Rangel to step aside as chairperson in the wake of the ethics ruling. But the speaker continues to stand by Rangel after the House ethics committee slapped them on the wrist for violating House rules by accepting trips to the Caribbean that were sponsored, in part, by corporations.
It is a public admonishment," Pelosi said in a taped interview airing Sunday on ABC's "This Week." "It said they did not knowingly violate House rules. So that gives them some comfort."
Pelosi said they want to wait until the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, informally known as the ethics committee, completes its work before they will make any decisions about whether Rangel should retain their chairpersonship on the powerful tax-writing committee.
"What Mr. Rangel has been admonished for is not good," Pelosi said, according to an advance transcript of their remarks. "It was a violation of the rules of the House."
But they said, their actions were not "something that jeopardized our country in any way."

An Old Fashioned glass, traditionally used for serving spirits
The Old Fashioned glass, rocks glass, lowball glass[1][2] (or simply lowball), is a short tumbler used for serving spirits, such as whisky, with ice cubes ("on the rocks"). It is also normally used to serve certain cocktails, such as the Old Fashioned, from which it receives its name.
Old Fashioned glasses typically have a wide brim and a thick base, so that the non-liquid ingredients of a cocktail can be mashed using a muddler before the main liquid ingredients are added.
Old Fashioned glasses usually contain 180–300 ml (6–10 US fl oz).[3][4] A double Old Fashioned glass (sometimes referred to by retailers as a DOF glass) contains 350–470 ml (12–16 US fl oz).[4][5]

The latest from the bird refuge: On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in Portland indicted Ammon Bundy and 15 of their fellow Oregon occupiers, charging each with a single count of conspiracy to impede officers of the United States.
As of Wednesday, four militiafolk still remain at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge — all of whom are included in the indictment — despite calls from the group's leaders to leave (and a notable message from Cliven Bundy to stay). They aren't leaving until they are reassured they will not be arrested, and that doesn't seem likely to happen. The occupation began on January 2, and last week, eight members of the occupation were arrested and one was killed in a confrontation with federal and state authorities.
The indictment, made public on Thursday, also says that a couple of the ranchers and anti-government activists made specific threats. In October, “two conspirators traveled to Harney County, Oregon, to warn the Harney County sheriff of ‘extreme civil unrest' if certain demands were not met,” says the indictment.
If convicted, Bundy and the others in the group face up to six years in prison.
After over a year of total silence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made two phone calls to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in as many weeks.
The first of the calls was one of protocol regarding the start of the Eid al-Fitr festivities but the other call, the more important of the two, was made after Israeli Jewish settlers burned a Palestinian toddler and their family alive.
The attack occurred in the village of Duma in the occupied West Bank. The toddler, 18-month-old Ali Dawabasheh, died in the incident, and their family was left seriously injured and mourning the loss of their youngest son.
This particular attack was unprovoked by the Palestinians and has shocked both the Israeli and Palestinian communities at large.
Instead of being an attack of retaliation, this case was prompted by an internal Israeli conflict, the context of which has escaped many.
Palestinian baby burned to death in settler attack
The Israeli army, after much hesitation, succumbed to clear orders from the Israeli High Court and destroyed two homes built illegally (according to Israeli law) on private Palestinian land near Ramallah.
Aim of the attack
The aim of the settler attack on Palestinians in the village of Duma was to embarrass the pro-settlement Israeli government even though it had simultaneously approved the building, "immediately", of 804 new Jewish settlements in Beit Eli and in Jerusalem.
The settlers' heinous attack, which probably came from the nearby Maleh Efraim settlement, is said to be part of a continuous wave of attacks on Palestinians by settlers that carry the name "price tag" - which refers to the price for Israeli government attempts to restrict Jewish settlement activities.
The perpetrators, who scrawled Hebrew graffiti meaning "revenge" and a Jewish Star of David, were protesting an event that happened in another settlement - namely the government destruction of a house built by Israeli settlers on private Palestinian lands near the settlement of Beit Eli.
The horrible death of the child and their family seems to have rattled Netanyahu who responded by calling the killing a "terrorist" act which supposedly set it apart from the what the UN has documented as 2,100 acts of violence against Palestinians, their religious institutions, their homes, and other Palestinian-owned properties, committed by Jewish settlers since 2006.
This attack has been defined as "terrorism" simply because Israel is petrified of the possibility that this incident could open up a "Pandora's box" of questions regarding the legitimacy of the settlement enterprise and policy in its entirety.
Taking the heat off
Israel specifically made this choice to take some of the international heat off.
Recently, Abbas has decided to use Palestine's newfound International Criminal Court membership to call for a formal investigation into war crimes committed by Israeli occupation forces.
At the opening of an emergency meeting in Ramallah, held by the Palestinian leadership on July 31, Abbas said that they had instructed their foreign minister to prepare a case against Israel for this war crime as part of the larger dossier about the entire settlement enterprise.
The senseless death of Ali Dawabasheh, and the maiming of their family, have refocused local, regional, and world attention on the Palestinian cause.
They said that since 2004, settlers had committed 11,000 attacks against Palestinians, and that all those cases were registered by Israel as acts committed by unknowns after superficial investigations for a few hours, and then the cases were closed.
The question of whether or not the occupying power carried out proper investigations of these crimes and had held the responsible parties accountable is crucial to the case against Israeli army officials.
International law, and specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention - relative to the protection of civilians in time of war, makes clear that an occupying power is not allowed to transfer its citizens into occupied areas.
An occupying army - and therefore its soldiers and commanders - are entrusted with protecting the civilian population. Therefore, any war crimes committed against the civilian population are ultimately the responsibility of the occupying officers.
Israel's illegal policy
Jewish settlement practises are clearly in violation of this convention and international law. This reality is further cemented by the International Court of Justice ruling in a case presented by Jordan in 2004.
The ruling ended Israeli-initiated legal discussions disputing the status of the West Bank as occupied territory and that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to it.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon formally condemned the attack and blasted what they referred to as "repeated acts of settler violence" and "Israel's illegal settlements".
The US Department of State has also condemned the attack going along with Netanyahu's description that it was a "terrorist" act. Israelis from all political parties also condemned the attack.
By calling this particular act a "terrorist act", and ignoring the larger crimes of the entire settlement enterprise, the Israelis are hoping to avoid the full force of international law and the downward spiral in international opinion such a trial would inspire.
The senseless death of Ali Dawbashe, and the maiming of their family, have refocused local, regional, and world attention on the Palestinian cause.
A simple phone call by Netanyahu to Abbas, and the description that this act and this act alone is a "terrorist" act, will not wash away the deeply rooted stains of this conflict.
The only way that this issue can be dealt with is through a clear and serious effort to end the decades-old military occupation and the illegal colonial settlement enterprise that it protects.

HOUSTON - A train car carrying lithium batteries exploded just north of downtown Houston on Sunday.
The blast was so strong, it broke windows in nearby homes.
"The moment that I got into the threshold and got inside an explosion went off and it threw me into the other side of the door, so there was a tremendous amount of force – I had no idea what was happening." said Tashi Garcia, who lives nearby the railroad tracks.
After the ringing in their ears subsided, they said they checked out the damage to their home. There were broken windows and cracks along the walls.
"It looks like someone's just gone through, throwing stuff." they said.
A Union Pacific spokesperson said the train's conductor noticed smoke coming from one of the train cars and stopped the train.
When they went to inspect it, they saw one of the cars was on fire.
The spokesperson said the car was carrying a load of lithium-ion batteries and was heading to a recycling center.
They said the batteries aren't considered hazardous material.
There were no reports of injuries after the blast.
Anyone who was affected by the blast can call 888-877-7267 to file a claim with Union Pacific.
By Google's own admission, everything associated with their google.com/phone site is an experiment. Like most everything the company does, it starts out in beta and constantly evolves. this past week has seen two changes to the way things are handled for potential and existing Nexus One owner.
The first, and possibly, most welcome enhancement was the opening up of an actual phone line for support. those of you who already have a Nexus One can call 888-48-NEXUS (63987). daily from 7:00 am EST to 10:00 pm EST to speak with someone. No more forum only support!
The other change made this week was lowering the equipment recovery fee (ETF) from $350 down to $150. While T-Mobile imposes their own early termination fee (ETF), it has many scratching their heads as to why Google was charging so much on their side. Whether related to recent FCC inquiries or by pure coincidence, customers are not looking at such a heavy dent in their pocket should they decide to cancel service.
Did any of you expect either of these changes? So quickly? What else would you like to see happen with their “experiment”?

Why is there so much hate online? In the words of one beat-up, mistreated, and racially-targeted victim, why can't we all just get along?
Yes, this is about the Adria Richards/SendGrid/PlayHaven/PyCon thing. And this is about the inevitable clash between a boy's club locker room culture and women in technology. But much, much, much more than that, it's about the reaction.
Update: Adria Richards' statement
Or should I say the reactions. By everyone involved.
I have been in email communication with both the fired Adria Richards and the fired PlayHaven developer for the past two days. They are reasonable, normal, approachable people. And right now they're both scared and bewildered at all that has happened.
But this morning Adria broke my heart, and the hearts of all those who give a damn about women in technology.
Last night, at about 2 a.m., after a series of emails with her, I said this:
Tell me at least that u will not be the next Kathy Sierra.
Kathy Sierra is a smart, passionate, funny woman in technology who essentially said their goodbyes to the online world after receiving multiple rape and death threats for, essentially, being a woman in technology. Hacker Andrew Auernheimer, who was just sentenced to 41 months in jail for an unrelated (and controversial) crime, was one of those who harassed them Sierra's last blog post, from their awesome “Creating Passionate Users” blog, was in 2007.
The worst thing that could happen here in this new situation — along with a developer losing their job and their ability to provide for their children — is that as a result of this incident, we'd lose another smart, passionate, funny, and awesome woman in technology. But that might happen.
Them answer, at 6:05 AM this morning?
I'm staying safe.
And that broke my heart. And that made me get up and write this on my day off. And I hope it breaks yours.
Look, whatever “side” of this you're on, here's what happened:
Some guys made some guy jokes about guy stuff A woman got offended and did something that was probably an over-reaction Some conference organizers over-reacted A company (PlayHaven) over-reacted The internet (all of us, but especially Anonymous) over-reacted Another company (SendGrid) over-reacted
I've been cursed and pilloried and told to go kill myself by people on both sides of the issue just for writing about these events. People from both sides see what they want to see and, like trained attack dogs, go in for the kill with little consideration, no mercy, no nuance, no shades of grey. They are so blinded by their self-righteousness that they're perfectly OK with perpetrating more metaphorical violence in the service of their almighty god-blessed cause.
It's been unbelievably worse for Adria.
She's been extensively hated on. Threatened with rape. Threatened with decapitation — I saw the tweet with a picture of a stripped dead woman, bloody on a bed, head unattached to the torso, myself. (It's now deleted and the Twitter account has been suspended.)
And yeah, it's been horrible for the PlayHaven developer who lost their job. Who had their character and reputation assaulted in public. Who now has to find a new job in tech to support their kids. What's worse, is that he's not in Silicon Valley, where coders are in crazy urgent over-demand and a job is a cheap commodity to be tossed aside and picked up again whenever you wish. It won't be easy for him.
So now here we are.
A developer has lost their job for no really good reason (as Richards has also said). The Internet exploded, with a significant chunk of it spewing hate and vitriol, including rape and death threats. A developer evangelist has lost their job too, for no really good reason. And women and men in technology have even more baggage and mistrust to process .
All because a developer and a developer evangelist made a couple of mistakes.
Where's the forgiveness? Where's the acceptance? Where's the ability to not fly off the handle and go apeshit at zero to sixty when we see something we don't like or we have a problem? Why do we feel we can call people whores, or idiots, or scumbags, or worse, just because there's a computer and some wires between us and them?
Do we now live in a culture where there are no second chances, where there's no ability to call a Mulligan, get a do-over, or just have a bad day?
Who can live that like? Who's the perfect one among us who doesn't screw up?
I've been slandered by both sides for my perceived bias on this, and I agree that no person and no journalist is completely unbiased. I've tried to draw a balanced line here, but I figure that if I'm going to be damned, I might as well be damned for what I actually believe.
So here it is:
I think this would never have hit the fan if the PlayHaven developer had just told one or two jokes, then let other people actually listen to the presentation. I think this would never have hit the fan if Adria had just turned in their seat and said, “Hey guys, do you mind?” I think this would never have hit the fan if the conference organizers had just gone up to the developer and said, “Hey, can you tone it down, please?” I think this would never have hit the fan if PlayHaven had not taken this slim pretext to fire a developer for a couple of dongle jokes.
But everyone over-reacted.
Everyone escalated, instead of taking a half a moment to think, relax, chill, give the benefit of the doubt, be a little easy-going, and realize that everyone is bloody well human and we all make mistakes.
Once the PlayHaven developer was fired, that was the tipping point. Then the Internet erupted, as male developers saw one of their own attacked for something that just about every man can envision themselves doing. Then hackers targeted SendGrid with a DDOS attack.
Then SendGrid took the next step in escalation. And cowardice. They cut and run, and left their employee hanging in the wind. And made a bad situation even worse.
But SendGrid had another option.
Its leaders could have taken a leadership role. Maybe create a forum to talk about this issue. Bring Richards and the PlayHaven developer together for a public conversation. Ask Richards to extend an olive branch, which they already basically has done, by saying they didn't intend for them to lose their job and that they feel bad that they did. Offer the dude a job. Ask Richards and them to come to a public understanding. Wrap it up in a bow and turn poisonous lemons into lemonade: a chance for us to advance the conversation between women and men in technology without the yelling, without the threats, without the hate.
And I think they would have come out like heroes.
What does this mean for women in the future who try to take a stand (whether right or not)? What do you do now if you are a woman in technology and you feel harassed or abused and want to shine a light on it, but now see this prominent woman totally abandoned by their company?
I'll tell you what you do, unless you're a saint or a hero. You shut up. You put your head down. You grin and bear it, because it's a man's world. And you leave, eventually, for a better place.
And we're all poorer as a result.
Adria Richards' Twitter account has 32,383 tweets and 12,204 followers. Most days, they would post multiple times, adding their voice to the wider conversation that is technology.
Since March 20, they have not published a single tweet. There have been no new posts on their blog.
She's been silenced.
Congratulations, Internet.

1. A lot of new faces. The Ravens had a large number of free agents and released a lot of veterans. Twelve veterans have already signed with other teams, so the Ravens will have between 6-8 new starters. Dennis Pitta and Ed Dickson are fighting it out for the tight end spot vacated by Todd Heap.
2. The offensive line. The O-Line is the most glaring issue at Ravens camp. Their biggest nemesis is the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had nine sacks in the last two games they played against the Ravens. Right now center Matt Birk is limping around and the right tackle situation is cloudy at best. Don't be surprised if Baltimore signs two free agents to build up the offensive line.
3. The tight end battle. Todd Heap is now an Arizona Cardinal and the Ravens think the answer to replacing Heap is on the roster. Keep a close eye on Pitta (#88) and Dickson (#83) as they battle for the job. They are both quality players.
4. Rookie impact. It is hard for rookies to break into an NFL lineup, and the Ravens are a great example of that. Cornerback Jimmy Smith might make it, but expectations that second-round pick WR Torrey Smith, third-round pick OT Jah Reid or any other rookie will crack the lineup are a bit premature.
New guys to watch
» Lee Evans, WR. The Ravens were a slow offense in 2010, and they were in desperate need of a vertical threat. After watching Evans at practice, it is clear they are just what the doctor ordered for this offense.
» Jimmy Smith, CB. Smith is tall with long arms, and the plan is to lock them up with big receivers. He's a work in progress, but from Ray Lewis to defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano, word is that they are the real deal. They may be the only rookie to break into the starting lineup.
» Sergio Kindle, OLB. Kindle missed a year of football and there was some real concern that they may never return. They did tell GM Ozzie Newsome, "I have a young brain and I will make it back." He's back and they add immediate support to the pass rush.
» Bernard Pollard, S. Pollard led the Texans in tackles last year and is a box safety who complements Ed Reed, especially on run downs. The club likes Tom Zbikowski at safety, but look for Pollard in certain situations.
» Ed Dickson, TE. Dickson had three starts last year and he's penciled in to replace Heap. Offensive coordinator Cam Cameron called them "special" and they have to be to keep competitor Dennis Pitta off the field. Pitta looked good in the first preseason game, but when Dickson returned from injury at practice they were back in the lineup.
Overheard
"Paul was miscast last year and is looking good at OLB instead of DE."
Ozzie Newsome on third-year pro Paul Kruger
"We believe in pressure and we will get after the QB."
Defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano on their philosophy
"I'm like a construction worker: I just keep working to build something big."
Ray Rice describing themselves
"I played for a lot of teams and have signed 15 different contracts, but this was the hardest team to break in with and it was worth the wait ... you gotta earn your way onto this team."
Kicker Billy Cundiff on becoming a Raven
Prediction
The Ravens were 13-5 last year including the playoffs. Their ability to reach the Super Bowl depends on beating Pittsburgh, and until they protect Joe Flacco and get Big Ben on the ground it remains an issue. I have a feeling the Ravens defense is up to the task of getting to Roethlisberger, but the offensive line is less certain. There's little doubt in my mind this team can win double-digit games once again, but going all the way remains a question.
The jubilation following Granger's announcement in Galveston moved across Texas, quickly reaching the state's 250,000 enslaved people. A year later, a spontaneous holiday called Juneteenth — formed from the words June and nineteenth — began to be celebrated by the newly freed people of Galveston and other parts of Texas. In 1867, Austin, the state capital, saw its first Juneteenth celebration under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency created to provide relief to people displaced by the Civil War.
Embraced as an exuberant day of jubilee, Juneteenth combined a history lesson and a political rally with the gospel hymns and sermons of a church service. Barbecue was soon added to the mix — this being Texas — with strawberry-flavored red soda water to wash it down. In time, rodeos, baseball games and family reunions all became part of Juneteenth traditions.
As former slaveholders attempted to maintain their control, this display of freedom was often met with violence. Juneteenth revelers sought the relative safe haven of black churches — a poignant irony given the tragedy on Wednesday night in Charleston, S.C. Some of these churches began raising money to buy land on which to mark Juneteenth. In Houston, two black congregations collected pennies and nickels until a 10-acre parcel was purchased for $800 in 1872 and named Emancipation Park, which is still used today.
The festival of freedom spread across the former Confederacy in the late 19th century. And as African-Americans moved north, they carried this celebration of liberation with them. As Isabel Wilkerson wrote in “The Warmth of Other Suns,” their prizewinning account of the Great Migration: “The people from Texas took Juneteenth Day to Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, and other places they went. Even now, with barbecues and red soda pop, they celebrate June 19, 1865.”
Granger's order was momentous, but it was no magic bullet. Even with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865, the emancipated people of Texas, and the rest of America, confronted violent resistance as they attempted to claim the promise of their liberation. Any small gains came in the face of whips and guns, followed by the well-documented decades of Jim Crow laws and Klan terror. Officially neglected, over time Juneteenth lost much of its resonance in the black community.

Atletico Madrid Turk offers their services to their old club
Atletico Madrid can't register players until next January, but there are a few who would not hesitate if Diego Simeone called them and asked them to join; one of them being their former player Arda Turan.
The Turkish footballer was at Atleti between 2011 and 2015 and left the Estadio Vicente Calderon for the Camp Nou with the idea of breaking away from the excessive work that Cholo demanded.
However, never a regular under Luis Enrique, it's clear that he'll stay on the bench under Ernesto Valverde.
That's why they have offered to return to Atletico, a team where they played their best football, which is something they miss.
Arda, who has only participated in 55 official games for the Catalans, was at a handicap during their first matches with the club.
Until the month of January, they could not be registered - an identical situation that Atleti find themselves in at this moment - and that prevented them from reaching the standard of their teammates, relegating them to the background as far as Enrique was concerned.
Atleti don't want to sign them
Arda has had offers from all over the world, China and Galatasaray for example.
However, he's not received any offer from Atletico, which is where they would like to play this season, and no longer features in Cholo's plans.
ZHOUQU, China (Reuters) - Wails of grief echoed through a northwest Chinese town half-smothered by a landslide two days ago, as relatives washed mud-caked bodies pulled from ruins and the official death toll mounted.

The count of dead from the disaster in Zhouqu, in a narrow valley in Gansu province, jumped from 137 earlier on Monday evening to 337, according to a local official cited by the official Xinhua news agency.
That toll is sure to grow, with another 1,148 residents counted as missing and possibly buried under the mud and rocks that engulfed much of the town.
Rescuers and locals with just shovels, hoes and rope spread over more than 2 km of devastated land to burrow into homes encased in mud left by floodwater that swept down from the slopes around Zhouqu in Gansu late on Saturday night.
“There are around 20 of my family members under there,” said Zou Jianglian, who had rushed back from a job in nearby Wuwei town to search for their mother, father, younger brother and other relatives lost since the disaster.
Nearly 1,500 people in other parts of the country have already died in landslides and flooding caused by months of torrential rains, the ministry of Civil Affairs said.
Relatives of the missing in Zhouqu trekked into the disaster zone, some helping with excavation efforts while others watched in desperate hope.
Hopes rose when a 74-year-old woman was found alive on Monday morning, the official Xinhua agency reported. They had been trapped in a fourth floor apartment rather than the low-rise buildings almost obliterated by rocks and sludge.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited the town, still two thirds underwater, for a second day and hollered at rescuers and survivors not to give up, state television news showed.

In the worst hit-village not a single structure was intact, although rescuers said they had not given up hope.
“There are probably eight people buried under this site,” said a soldier, Luo Siyuan, who was helping dig for survivors in Zhouqu town.
“They might not be able to survive after such a long time, but we will not give up on them. It may be a good way to show our respect for the dead.”
Engineers were also blasting a barrier of rocks and mud in an effort to drain an unstable lake upstream from the town of 40,000 residents, when landslides also choked up the Bailong River.
With more rains forecast for this week, there may be fresh disasters if the unsecured natural dam bursts, although thousands of people downstream have already been evacuated as a precaution.
HOMES, LIVES SWEPT AWAY
The mass of mud and rocks buried at least 300 low-rise homes, state media reported, while images showed multi-storey concrete buildings toppled or with chunks gouged out.
Vital supplies are now running low, with food, water and tents stuck in vehicles several hundred meters from the site.
“We need more food and water. We are now out of power and water supplies,” said Yuan Manhong, a 24-year-old survivor.

China has deployed the resources of its powerful central government to battle a string of natural disasters in recent years — flooding, quakes and landslides — winning popular support for both the military and leadership.
Experts said the landslide, which carried mud and rubble over five kilometers (three miles), could have been caused by earth made vulnerable to heavy rain by a recent drought and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that may have loosened the mountainside.

In today's news, the circus continues: Sarah Palin is still looking for the real killer. Meanwhile, in real news: universal health care? Alaska Senate update: As I predicted from polls, Begich is pulling ahead. Andrew Sullivan is still clinging to the idea that turnout is suspiciously down from 2004, which I have pointed out is probably not true. I'll stick with my prediction of a Begich win by 2-7%, and normal turnout. In the face of hard polling data, a straightforward interpretation without conspiracies is most likely to be right.
Now, to my real topic today, an oddity of polling. Although average poll margins can predict the eventual winner of a race, they usually underreport the final margin for whoever wins. How can this be?
A few days ago I showed you a plot. Here it is, this time with a fit line.
If polls were accurate, the slope of the green line would be 1 with an intercept of 0. But it is not. Indeed, for every 1% of actual margin, only 0.84+/-0.03% is captured in polls*. This underperformance implies that there is a hidden bonus for whoever is ahead. The intercept essentially goes through the origin, so there's no overall bias toward either candidate.
This result can be understood better by restating it in terms of pollsters' methods. Pollsters identify the people in their sample that they consider more likely to vote. Then they re-weight according to likely voting as well as other factors (e.g. age and sex). In light of this, one or both of the following is probably true:
Within a state, the leading candidate's supporters are relatively more likely to vote than predicted by likely-voter screens. Within a state, the trailing candidate's supporters are relatively less likely to vote than predicted by likely-voter screens.
Both scenarios are consistent with the fact that the direction of the effect depends on who's leading locally.
So likely-voter screens are evidently missing some aspect of voter behavior on Election Day. What's missing, and why does it show up differently on a state by state level?
One possibility is that many voters are aware of which way their state is likely to go, and modify their behavior slightly. For example, a small fraction might stay home (or at work) because it's not fun to vote for a known loser. If the probability of voting differered by a net 8% between McCain and Obama “likely voters,” this could then enlarge the size of a win.
Another possibility is that pollsters' estimates of the likelihood of voting is not sufficiently quantitative. It's reasonable that they can figure out that one person is more likely to vote than another. But can they do it accurately? For instance, if I am more enthusiastic than you about voting for my candidate, am I 5% more likely to vote than you – or 15%? This can easily lead to bad weighting.
Why has this flaw been allowed to persist? Basically, there's no penalty. Fixing the error would not lead to improved prediction of winners. A repair would only give a more accurate estimate of the winner's eventual margin. Yet it is rare to hear anyone ask why a pollster's projection was too conservative. So there's no pressure to do better.
Note: Comments and some private correspondence indicate that a few of you have gotten the direction of this discrepancy backwards. To reiterate, polls underreport the eventual margins, which are about 19% larger than the last pre-election surveys would indicate. The effect is in the opposite direction as a hypothetical regression to the mean (itself not reliable, as I point out in comment #20).
*The fit was an unweighted regression of poll vs. actual. The plotted slope is the inverse, 1/0.84=1.19. A weighted fit gives a fit slope of 0.81+/-0.03 poll % per actual % margin.

On Friday evening, at the end of the final nuclear security summit of their tenure, President Barack Obama took a swipe at their Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for standing in the way of nuclear disarmament. Obama's remark was pointed, calling out Putin by name, and it cast a rare bit of light on the personal clash between the two presidents on an issue that both of them see as central to their legacies.
“Because of the vision that he's been pursuing of emphasizing military might,” Obama told reporters at the summit, “we have not seen the type of progress that I would have hoped for with Russia.”
This was putting it lightly. Over the course of Obama's presidency, Russia has managed to negotiate deep cuts to the U.S. arsenal while substantially strengthening of its own. It has allegedly violated the treaty that limits the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe and, in the last few years, it has brought disarmament talks with the U.S. to a complete standstill for the first time since the 1960s. In its rhetoric, Moscow has also returned to a habit of nuclear threats, while in its military exercises, it has begun to practice for a nuclear strike, according to the NATO military alliance.
But of all these stark reversions to the posture of the Cold War, nothing expressed Russia's position on nuclear disarmament more clearly than Putin's decision to skip the nuclear summit in Washington last week. Apart from North Korea, which was not invited to the talks, Russia was the only nuclear power not to send a senior delegate.
The snub was no surprise. It was announced back on Nov. 5 in a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which offered a curious explanation. By influencing the policies of global watchdogs like the International Atomic Energy Agency, “Washington is trying to take the role of the main and the privileged ‘player' in this sphere,” the statement said. In part because of this, “we have shared with our American colleagues our doubts about the ‘added value' of the forum.” Russia therefore saw no need to participate, the Ministry said.

A few days after that statement, the world got a more colorful reminder of Putin's position on nuclear disarmament. During a meeting at the Kremlin with their top generals on Nov. 10, they accused the U.S. of trying to “neutralize” Russia's nuclear arsenal by building a missile shield over Europe, one that could knock Russian rockets out of the sky. In response, they said, Russia would have to “strengthen the potential of its strategic nuclear forces,” including the deployment of “attack systems” capable of piercing any missile shield.
As if on cue, a state television camera then zoomed in on a piece of paper that one of the generals was holding in their hand. It showed the plans for a nuclear device codenamed Status-6, complete with a curt definition of its purpose: “to create an extensive zone of radioactive contamination” along the enemy's coast, rendering it uninhabitable “for a long time.”
Asked to comment the following day, Putin's spokesperson claimed the image had appeared in the nightly news by mistake. But the Kremlin's mouthpiece newspaper then followed up with details. The warhead inside Status-6, it said, would likely be covered in cobalt, an element which would “guarantee the destruction of all living things” once it was irradiated and scattered by a nuclear explosion.
Vladimir Dvorkin, a retired major general of the Russian strategic rocket forces, remembers such designs from their days developing nuclear submarines for the former Soviet Union. “It's an old Soviet brainchild,” they told me by phone from Moscow. But they never expected to see it revived. In the 1990s and during first two years of Putin's presidency, Dvorkin headed the main nuclear research directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense. The emphasis throughout those years was on cooperating with the U.S. to secure nuclear stockpiles and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.
The reemergence of Status-6—even if more as a propaganda ploy than as an actual weapon—shows just how far relations have fallen since then. “The idea is to creep up on the seaboard of the United States and set off a massive nuclear explosion,” says Dvorkin. “It's being revived in order to spook the West.”
Few in the West had expected to hear such spook stories again. For Americans, a nuclear arms race is the stuff of Cold War fiction. But for Russians, or at least their leaders, the world still looks much as it did in the age of the nuclear arms race.

That became clear to many of Obama's top advisers soon after their Administration took office. During a landmark speech in Prague in the spring of 2009, Obama described their vision for a nuclear-free world. The timing and venue were both highly symbolic. Earlier the same week, the newly-elected President had come to Europe for a summit of the NATO alliance, which had just extended membership to two more formerly communist nations, Albania and Croatia, moving the military bloc deeper into Moscow's former zone of influence.
Prague, too, had been a key Cold War battleground, and as Obama pointed out at the beginning of their speech, few people could have imagined in those years that the Czech Republic would eventually become a NATO member in 2004, standing as proof that Russian dominance of Eastern Europe was receding. “The Cold War has disappeared,” Obama told the city square packed with their Czech admirers. Yet the existence of nuclear weapons, they said, was its “most dangerous legacy.” They promised to work towards abolishing them.
The previous week, the White House had begun talks with the Kremlin on an arms reduction treaty it called New Start. But the two sides came to the table with very different ambitions. “We wanted to get rid of as many nuclear weapons as we could,” says Michael McFaul, who was then serving as Obama's top adviser on Russian affairs. The Kremlin did not seem to share that dream. During one round of talks at the Defense Ministry in Moscow early in 2010, Obama's Prague speech came up in some idle conversation, McFaul says, and the Russians started laughing. “They said, ‘Yeah, of course you guys want a nuclear-free world, because then you would dominate the world with your conventional weapons. Why would we ever want to do that?'”
For Russia, the Cold War had never simply disappeared. It had resulted in defeat and the loss of empire, leaving Russia's rival of more than 40 years to dictate the terms of peace in Europe. By the time Putin took power in 2000, the only vestige of their country's superpower status was its nuclear arsenal, which was still the biggest in the world. So they began to use it as a crutch.
“Even in the darkest days of the Russian military, when they weren't able to afford to pay their soldiers and fly their airplanes, they paid close attention to the readiness and modernization of their nuclear forces,” says David Ochmanek, who served as a U.S. Air Force officer during the Cold War and, between 2009 and 2014, was the Pentagon's top official for force development. “Their doctrine reflected this,” they say.

In one of their first acts as President, Putin adopted a new military doctrine in the spring of 2000, one that rejected the Soviet pledge never to launch a nuclear weapon first. Their reasoning was simple: only Russia's nukes could counter the vastly superior strength of U.S. conventional weapons. So they lowered the bar for using nuclear weapons in situations “critical to national security.” This meant that if Russia ever felt badly outgunned in a military conflict, it could launch a nuclear missile to even the score and make the enemy back off. That doctrine was still in place when the U.S. and Russia began negotiating the New Start treaty.
But Putin's position in Russia had changed. In 2008, the constitution prevented them from seeking a third consecutive term as President. So they moved over to the nominally less powerful role of Prime Minister and ceded the presidency to their protégé, Dmitri Medvedev.
Obama saw this as an opportunity. They and Medvedev had taken office within a year of each other, and Obama had made it one of their foreign policy priorities to improve—or “reset”—troubled relations with Russia. Nuclear arms reduction was at the core of this agenda, and the two leaders pursued the talks with notable warmth and enthusiasm. From behind the scenes, however, Putin and their generals set rigid parameters for Medvedev. Even with a new president, the balance of power in Russia had never really changed.
“I always called Medvedev Putin's lawyer,” says Gary Samore, who was then the White House coordinator for arms control and a lead negotiator of the treaty. “It was very clear who was calling the shots.”
As the negotiations moved ahead, Samore saw the Russians advancing two core priorities. Most of their nuclear warheads were still deployed in static, Soviet-era silos dug into the ground, and these could easily get taken out if the U.S. were ever to launch a surprise attack against Russia. “They were very vulnerable to a pre-emptive first strike,” says Samore. What Russia needed most from the New Start treaty was a chance to get rid of this vulnerability and regain nuclear parity with the U.S. “Their priority first and foremost was to limit our capabilities,” they say, “and to buy time for the Russians to go through their strategic modernization program.”
Obama was prepared to allow that. Since the end of the Cold War, U.S. security concerns had shifted away from the threat of nuclear war with Russia. The bigger American fear was the possibility that Moscow would let some of its nukes fall into the hands of terrorists, says Ivo Daalder, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO during negotiations on the New Start treaty. “Russia as a military security concern wasn't really on the agenda,” Daalder says. “The focus was really on cooperation.”
In particular, Obama needed Russia's help on Iran, whose nuclear program the West did see as a major security threat. “So to me there was a very clear quid pro quo,” Samore says. “We very consciously and deliberately were prepared to give the Russians strategic parity in exchange for cooperation on other key issues, Iran being the most important.”

Both sides got what they wanted. In the spring of 2011, Obama returned to Prague to sign the New Start treaty with Medvedev, and that same day, Russia agreed to support another round of Western sanctions against Iran. The pain of these sanctions proved instrumental in getting Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program four year later, perhaps Obama's most notable foreign policy achievement.
On paper at least, the New Start treaty also looked impressive. Both sides agreed to cut their arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles in half and to reduce the number of warheads by around three-quarters. But in practice, the New Start treaty allowed Russia to scrap many of its old silo-based missile systems while pushing ahead with a wholesale upgrade of its broader arsenal. “The treaty does not prevent you from modernizing,” says McFaul, who went on to become the U.S. ambassador in Moscow from 2011 to 2013. “In terms of parity, they felt like they needed to modernize, whereas we didn't feel that way.”
It will still take Russia at least until the end of this decade to complete its nuclear modernization program. But it is off to an impressive start. Moscow is building a new generation of long-range nuclear bombers, truck-mounted ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed submarines. In the past two years, Russian officials and state-run media have routinely boasted about the fruits these efforts, often under giddy headlines like this gem from the Sputnik news agency: “Rail Phantom: Russia developing invisible death trains with nukes.”
This seems far from the spirit of Medvedev's term as president, which ended in 2012 with Putin's return to the Kremlin's top post. The New Start treaty, Medvedev told me in mid-February, “was a great achievement in Russian-U.S. relations, and it was good for the international situation.” Later in our interview, they added: “It's a shame that things began to take a different path after that.”
In the the foreseeable future, Medvedev said, Russia would have no choice but to develop weapons like Status-6 to balance against the enormous advantage the U.S. enjoys in conventional arms. (Washington spends more than seven times as much on defense as Russia, which will have to cut its military spending this year, thanks largely to a shrinking economy.) “Isn't that scary? Yes, it is very scary,” Medvedev told me, referring to these weapons. “If hundreds or thousands of such missiles are used in an attack, the consequences will be just as devastating” as a nuclear strike.
This point came back to the essential paradox of Russia's position on nuclear weapons. It is the very real feeling of weakness and vulnerability that makes Russia cling to its most destructive and dangerous arms. And until Russia's leaders are made to believe that the U.S. does not wish them any harm, Obama's vision of a nuclear free world will never be realized.
Obama admitted as much at the nuclear security summit in Washington. “It is very difficult,” they said at the closing news conference, “to see huge reductions in our nuclear arsenal unless the United States and Russia, as the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, are prepared to lead the way.” From the start of their tenure, Obama tried to take that lead, likely believing that the Cold War had, as they put it, “disappeared.”
But their most important partners in this effort saw things differently, says Samore, their former adviser. “To some extent Obama didn't appreciate how the level of Russian paranoia and fear of the United States continued to permeate their defense and security establishment,” they say. “For them it was so old school. They just didn't see it.” By now, as they prepare to leave office, Obama most certainly does.

I knew I was going to review this book so in preparation I kept away from all of McGonigal's talks, interviews, and presentations as much as possible before reading it. I caught their appearance on the Colbert Report, but it was hard to make any prejudgments from that short interview. So I am coming into this review as clean as I possibly could and allowing McGonigal's book to speak for itself.
Having read it, I asked on Twitter, rhetorically, how do you review this book. It's a book about ideas and about theoretical space of a possible sociological future. How can I criticize the book without criticizing* the ideas within? Answer: I can't. I can't solely focus on how it's presented or the coherence of the argument. That would be denying a fundamental aspect of the book.
I did get an answer to my tweet anyway that said, “Step 1 ignore who wrote it, otherwise you're going to get caught in the cult of personality.”
That's a good starting position. Jane McGonigal is an enormously charismatic woman. Even in their writing you can feel the exuberant energy of their personality coming through loud and clear.  They are a persuasive woman and you can't help but be swept along by their ideas and optimism. They also have gathered a dedicated following. It's not surprising. In the mainstream media video games are always about the negative press and the demonizing of the medium. Then comes a charming, charismatic, enthusiastic, professional woman saying ‘no that's wrong, it's the exact opposite.' It's easy to see how they gathered a following. But thankfully there is more.  They are intelligent and knows their stuff. At no point do they feel like she's bullshitting you.
The book is really three books in one. It isn't scatterbrained in its delivery, no it presents a series of quite coherent arguments with one point fully explained and explored before having the next chapter build off of it to make the nest point. The book is divided into three sections that follow the shift in focus.
Part one entitled “Why Games Make Us Happy” is self-explanatory. It is also the best part of the whole. Those first hundred pages where they explain all the research and effects paying games has on the human psyche is fascinating. To see how our minds work and how the mass introduction of electronic games has shifted our generation's perceptions of reality is a masterwork of argumentative writing. They never writes down to their audiences, but does expect you to keep up. They use simple and clear language to get across these complex ideas, slowing down to explain a piece of gamer jargon to the masses. It contends that reality was always dull, but now with the well-tuned comparisons to fictional realms we see this disparity greater than ever before. Here we see Mrs. McGonigal lays the groundwork for their later assertions, but I heartily recommend this part of the book.
Part two is where they focus on where we are now. Most of their writing looks not at present day video gaming, but ARGs (Alternate Reality Games). I knew very little about them and you can see their usefulness in certain aspects. They introduce the concept and familiarizes you with what they are while at the same time extolling their usefulness. Chore Wars is an interesting concept that is defiantly beneficial if you can pull it off in your house. SuperBetter is another game that seems like a pure beneficial game in the area of health. In fact all of the examples they give are wonderful sounding games that make the world a slightly better place or at least make us better in it.
And yet while I was reading it I felt there was something wrong. It was the same feeling I got when I was two and my dad teased me by acting all surprised when plugging a power strip into itself wasn't working. At the time I didn't know what, but I knew something was wrong. Several times something would come up that made me think that here is where their argument breaks down, but then further on my questions would be answered.
For instance, at the beginning of chapter 10 they start off with a few examples of activities that better our self-esteem.
Shout compliments at strangers on the sidewalk
That sentence made me stop reading for a while. It actually made my mind go blank. Eventually I was able to muster a thought and it was, “That is going to go horribly wrong.” I even started constructing my argument on the various problems with that activity. But as I read on the game it was apart of made more sense than that sentence by itself. My fear of the activity were countered by how the game worked and the problematic situations wouldn't come up.
Another issue I thought was all these games seems only to work with first-world issues. There is nothing wrong with that, but McGonigal was contending that games would change the world for the better. Nothing I was reading would solve Darfur or hunger in Africa. All the crowd sourcing and positive thinking wouldn't help those desperate people in need, but then I got to part three.
In part three the focus shifts to the future or rather the matter of scale. All the games they had looked at previously were rather personal or at least confined affairs. Now we are starting to explore the games of a global scale. As for hunger in Africa, the game Free Rice is an answer. A game solving a real world issue 10 grains of rice at a time. The further they push forward it is difficult not to follow their lead. Even when they get into explaining the most esoteric and most complexly mental ARGs you can't help but figure how these game systems could better the world.
However, something doesn't ring right. Even as my minor quibbles are one by one shot down through their rhetoric I still couldn't shake the feeling something was off. Them facts add up, their conclusions are step by step and logically sound. Then one of problems hit me. Them entire book is overwhelmingly positive. I knew this going in and doing my best not to be a curmudgeon, but the book really is looking too much on the greener side of things. They gloss over or outright ignores many of the darker aspects of gamer/internet culture. One of the greatest crowd sourcing accomplishments is Wikipedia, which they talk about at length, but another is Anonymous. Even ignoring them, Wikipedia is not the great project millions pour hours into solely to make great. There are a large number of people who will change things purposefully to be wrong or politicians who will abuse their personal page and insert things they haven't done. They gloss over this by framing it as an argument of differences in how to present the facts. Yes there is that too, but it ignores a big problem that Wikipedia has been dealing with from the beginning. In fact throughout the whole book “griefing” is mentioned once and only in passing. The concept of people who enjoying throwing the game off balance or harming the experience for others is ignored. Trash talk is covered when talking about a facebook game people play with their moms and equated to light teasing.Â The first thing I think of with regards to gamer trash talking are the racial and homophobic epithets streaming from a 14 year olds mouth to my ear over Xbox Live. Trolling is treated like it doesn't even exist. Gamification is never mentioned by name, but at the same time that is what is being advocated on some level, but only in a certain application as if corporations or governments wouldn't use it to modify other behaviors that may or may not be beneficial. McDonald's wants you to buy more fries and could easily make a game out of it. It's not healthy for you. They talk hopefully of a peaceful day where North Korea can successfully connect to the rest of the world freely and I can only think of their leadership learning to use these same techniques for the opposite effect.
I can understand not wanting to focus on it, but pretending it does not exist is just naive. That's what was getting to me the whole time. McGonigal is an idealist, but to a fault. They so much wants to focus on the positive that the further the book goes along that path the harder it is to follow. This is where I finally saw the real problem with the whole argument. Ignoring the ugly side of gamerdom was only a symptom of the greater issue. It was bothering me from the beginning and it was only after finishing the book could I see the whole picture to realize where it breaks apart.
They disregard the positive value of the “escapist entertainment” of video games at the very beginning. To their credit they don't say we shouldn't have them, but it would be a shame if that is all games amounted to. Video games are a burgeoning art form and art can have a profound individual effect of a person. McGonigal seems to disregard what a sublime work can do to a person and instead looks at the formula that allows them to be so effective at the ‘inconsequential' and transplants them to the macro.
They start at the smallest and most individual level in the beginning of the book and then works their way up to a global scale. However, as we move up the sense of scale we lose the effect on the individual. They mention activities from World Without Oil like fostering a community, potlucks to help with food shortage, self-sufficiency with gardens etc. But those are mere parts of the larger-hypothetical-system to surviving the hypothetical global oil shortage. The macro system is like the god games Civilization and SimCity that McGonigal uses for comparison and like those games you cannot control the individuals. The Sims have the exact opposite problem, you can control the micro (the small community of sims), but cannot see the macro (the larger world that continues on past the borders of the map).
Superstuct was an impressive piece of hypothetical work, but again its focus is on the macro systems that has little parlance with the micro and at the same time any focus on the micro would lose the global structure set forth by the macro. This disparity seems like an oversight or a challenge to overcome or something else. I don't know. It's never addressed. The game is about the role of super structures changing the world, but where are the game elements for each and every individual that would have to participate to effect them.
Plus, McGonigal is trying to replace one system of thought with another via a full-scale implementation of gamification, but it doesn't work like that. Recent evidence from Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Yemen, Libya, etc would say it is the other way around. It is multiple micro elements that culminates in, without any super structure, a macro movement.
The biggest issue in solving a problem is not how to do it, but knowing it's there in the first place. We have a society that has no knowledge of this problem's existence or and sophisticated understanding of them. Education and enlightenment seem like a better use of these engagement systems. Pushing towards a greater good utilizing the systems of MMO is one thing, but knowing what you are doing and why in the end seems like a better purpose, even if it doesn't transcend to a global scale.
McGonigal's book is an interesting read and given with the great push from all sides towards gamification probably a necessary one if only to see the best of all possible outcomes even if the argument is incomplete. But without the counterpoint, without solutions on how to deal with the problems such systems could potentially create themselves Reality is Broken is incomplete. And incomplete thoughts for good are more dangerous than complete thoughts for evil.

Introducing the LogIT
The LogIT Series consists of two unique circuit measurement tools which both display accurate readings of voltage, current, and power while also simultaneously logging all measurement data to a MicroSD card and/or PC.
Our motivation for creating the LogIT devices arose from the observation that in many cases a modern microcontroller based system such as a phone or an Arduino are powered by USB while connected to a PC that is also transferring data.
Looking more closely at the type of measurements made in product development and DIY experimentation, many of these measurements are made at low positive voltages and reasonably low current. Surprisingly there are very few metering tools that allow for a simple connection to the device being tested while still allowing data to pass through uninterrupted.
The LogIT devices are specifically designed to measure the low positive voltages of USB and Power over Ethernet (PoE) connected equipment with high accuracy.
The time between individual measurement data samples, collected inside the LogIT, can be measured at either standard or custom intervals ranging from a millisecond to hours.
UPDATED 10.02.2015
At the heart of the LogIT is a 32bit ARM Cortex M0+ microcontroller which consumes tiny amounts of power while still managing to synchronize numerous simultaneous interactions between peripherals such as the SD card, display, serial data port, and sensing system.
Using a gutsy little processor has enabled the LogIT to support the writing of standard CSV formatted data to SD card with files sizes only limited by the SD card capacity. If you wish to log over 2GB of power, voltage, and current data in a single recording, potentially stretching for weeks, then a LogIT will help you achieve this.
We have worked diligently to create a device which not only connects to a PC but can also be operated as a stand-alone logger with a battery life of up to a week for fast recording rates and continuous measurement display. This is achieved by incorporating a large lithium polymer battery AND one of the latest high speed/low power display technologies called Memory LCD, developed by Sharp Microelectronics.
The display itself is a 128 X 128 pixel dot-matrix that allows for the representation of measurements both in numerical and graphical format simultaneously.
The LogIT USB Prototype Revision 002
We have paid attention to the details when designing this tool. Inside each LogIT there is a realtime clock for accurate time-stamping of the data. When a LogIT is connected to a PC the devices time can be synchronised to your PC or you can manually set a time on the device itself. There is also a raft of additional features are common to both devices such as,
Full isolation between the measurement ports and the test data USB/Serial ports,
An open protocol for serial data streaming in both event and continuous modes,
Screw terminals so that you can wire the LogIT directly into a circuit and test a wider range of voltages,
Visual and audible buzzer alarm capabilities for indication of events set as thresholds by the user for current, voltage, or power, and,
A low voltage serial port connector for direct connection to a DIY embedded devices such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
USB & PoE Connection, Animated
The PoE version includes a multitude of additional circuitry to allow for 2 channels of data measurement at a higher resolution. This unique device supports every PoE power standard all the way up to PoE++ for over 90W of accurate power measurement.
For those who develop or use a Power over Ethernet (PoE) based class of products there is nothing remotely like this tool with respect to the combination of affordability and supported features.
We hope to make available an additional breakout board accessory, connectable by patch leads, so that the PoE model of LogIT device can utilise 2 sets of screw-terminal based connection. Users will then be able to harness 2 channels of simultaneous power measurement when wired into a test circuit.
The USB and PoE LogIT Models (Top and bottom respectively)
We believe that we have designed some of the best USB & PoE power monitors in the world with regards to features and would like to work with a community to make our a belief a shared reality.
With simplified methods of connection to standard embedded devices it is likely that you will learn more about what is right or wrong with your circuitry a lot quicker and with greater detail.
Basically, we think these devices will be a great little tool to have in the toolbox whether you are a professional engineer or an electronics enthusiast.
The Desktop Application
We have created a FREE desktop application, coded in Java so that both Mac and PC users can connect, graph, and download data from the LogIT devices.
Battery Life Estimation Tool
Each LogIT has a fully isolated debug port which provides power to the device for charging the internal battery while also helping to protect your PC from damage due to voltage spikes/offsets and noise created by the device you are testing.
Desktop Application Simulation Mode
The fully functional BETA software incorporates a simulation mode for you to play around with before you even get a LogIT!
Please feel free to download the Mac and PC software HERE (External link).

Depending on the final goal achieved by the Kickstarter there may be some variation. Having said this, at the end of the day we just want to get these tools to you as soon as humanly possible.
As the referendum on Scottish independence nears, I recall the feeling of deep depression that came over me 21 years ago at the time of Czechoslovakia's “velvet divorce”. Two new small countries appeared on the map – the Czech Republic and Slovakia – and beyond their borders nobody understood why they had separated. A broader and larger “unionist” (federal) state that bound citizens together gave way to two smaller states more reliant on ethnic definition.
From today's perspective, that divorce was just a historical episode. It happened in a different time, in a different geopolitical space, long before the two new countries worked their way – separately – into Nato and the European Union. It was also largely seen as a positive achievement because at the time Yugoslavia was falling apart violently.
However, the Czechoslovak decision was not made through a proper democratic process. It was sprung on “unionists” as well as on “secessionists” in a somewhat despotic fashion by two national leaders, energised by electoral success: one a Czech, on the victorious political right, the other a Slovak on the equally victorious left. It was made over a cup of tea (or was it a beer?) in the garden of the famous Tugendhat modernist villa in Brno. After the decision taken by then Czech prime minister Václav Klaus and Slovak prime minister Vladimír Mečiar, there was no way back.
The questions surrounding Scotland's possible departure from the union are not the same. Nevertheless it's worth reflecting that whatever the certainties of the campaigns, nobody can be sure what happens next, in the short or long term. This is the surprise that's waiting. There is a cost in lost time on both sides: the prospect of years needed to find a new way and a new identity, both for the nation and its individual people.
The Slovaks at least had a sense of their future, of what they were doing. They were building a new country. But in the process they nearly missed the train to Europe and to Nato, and in the end they made it at the last minute. Before that, they first had to turn round the nationalistic, populist and corrupt politics of the post-divorce period and get rid of that same leader who decided upon independence for them under the Tugendhat tree. It took five or six years.
The Czechs are generally still not even aware of the time they've lost. This has something to do with the fact that their country came out of the divorce with no deeper sense of being, with no obvious purpose or role to play. The Czechs woke up on 1 January 1993 in a different country but didn't realise it. In a way one can see what went on as a replay of what happened to the Austrians when the Czechs and others in 1918 left their “union”, the Austro-Hungarian empire. The Austrians ended in Austria, now a country that was “left over”. It took them half a century to become a nation again, albeit a very different one. The traumatic loss was about much more than lost time and lost dominance within a lost empire.
The western part of what used to be Czechoslovakia is also a “left-over” country. It still struggles to find a less difficult name than the Czech Republic, and has meanwhile not found anything better than just half of the old one – “Czecho”. The country, lucky at the time to still have Václav Havel as its president, drifted into Nato in 1999 and into the EU in 2004 while sometimes giving the impression that it is even now not sure it has done the right thing. Its politicians occasionally come up with some odd statements, are sometimes disloyal to allies, sometimes rubbishing the politics of human rights (which under Havel passingly gave the country some sense of identity), and recently tried somewhat bizarrely to befriend China.
It is not clear either what the population desires and where its emotions belong. One of the results is the rise of little-Czech nationalism, populism and xenophobia in a nation that no longer shares its fate with its historical partners or minorities – Slovaks, Germans, Jews, Poles, Hungarians. The Roma Gypsies have become the new “other”. Such small-nation nationalism and parochialism comes with a lot of negative sentiment: anti-politics and anti-politicians, anti-Roma, anti-homeless people, anti-Islam, increasingly anti-American, anti-European and still quite anti-German. Curiously, pro-Russian sympathies are growing, as reactions to the crisis in Ukraine tend to demonstrate.
On the other hand, sheltered by its link to German industries and to exports, economically the country is fine. Wealth is growing (despite the monstrous spread of corruption), the nation is still relatively egalitarian, and though the general trend is one of growing inequality, its national health system is better than in the UK.
In the end, “Czecho” is a wandering nation in a wandering country, less important and far less interesting than its predecessors, and the world doesn't really care. At home, for nearly two decades there has been a widespread feeling of depression. “Blba nalada”, silly mood, as Havel once coined it. It all began then, with the split of Czechoslovakia. But we didn't know.
The girl had gone to bed for the night, eager to fall asleep after a long day. Before they snuggled up under the covers, they left their window open as always. The cool night air comforted her, and it was always such a treat to see the sun shining upon them every morning.But this night, a sinuous serpent happened to slither into their bedroom through that very window. The cold-blooded creature needed a place to warm itself up, lest it freeze to death outside. Sensing the heat of a local home, the snake had found itself a window to slip into. To the python's fortune, not only had it found a warm area, but also a sizable meal.The snake flicked its tongue, getting a feel for the sleeping girl. Unconscious and helpless, the girl hardly moved a muscle as the python coiled itself all around them Starting with their feet, it was now only a matter of time before the feminine feline was sliding down through the serpent.By the time the girl awoke, the snake was already up to their knees. Trapped in the tight coils and hardly able to breathe, the girl could do nothing but watch the python devour them They knew that this would be the end; they would be nothing more than another meal to giant, cold-blooded monster.Eventually, the snake had reached their head. The girl had made sure not to struggle or breath too deeply. Doing so would signal the serpent to squeeze their tighter, possibly ending their lives sooner than they would have liked. As the python ingested their head and closed its jaws, the girl took one last look at the outside world and screamed for their life. Hopefully someone would hear her, though even if they came, they had no idea how they would rescue her.The girl was pushed through the confines of the snake's digestive system. The inner walls of the serpent's esophagus were tight around their petite form, involuntarily forcing them down into the belly of the beast. It was here that they would remain, clinging onto some tiny bit of hope that someone would find them But as we all know, they would never escape. The catgirl now belonged to the snake, as nothing more than a midnight snack.Featuring the character "Jemmey," from
Online social support for those with similar health problems has undeniably provided comfort and reinforcement. But research on whether peer support actually aids clinical symptoms is limited, and the findings are mixed. New research doesn't offer much additional scientific evidence that online support groups help.
Among people with mental illnesses, the results are even more sparse, even though research has shown that this group prefers online peer support groups over face-to-face support groups.
To fill the research void, Mark Salzer, Ph.D., chair of the Rehabilitation Department at Temple University, studied the effectiveness of online peer support for people with a mental illness.
The study is only the second randomized, controlled trial of Internet peer support — the first, also conducted by Salzer and colleagues, looked at its effectiveness among women newly diagnosed with breast cancer.
The study, published in the journal Social Science and Medicine, assessed the well-being of 300 participants with severe mental illnesses — including schizophrenia-spectrum, bipolar, and depressive disorders — who were assigned to an email listserv, a bulletin board online community, or a control group.
After a year, Salzer and their group found that participation in the online peer support groups did not have much of an effect on the patients' well-being from a statistical standpoint; but there was evidence that participants assigned to the online peer support groups felt the groups were relevant, supportive, and beneficial.
“These groups likely provide some degree of comfort in sharing a similar experience,” said Salzer. “While we can't yet quantify the benefit with our measurements, it does appear that participants benefit in online contacts with one another.”
Salzer noted that the lack of statistical evidence for the effectiveness of these groups shouldn't deter doctors from allowing their patients to use them.
“If anything, clinicians should become more familiar with online groups because of their prevalence,” they said.
“They should be discussing their use with clients, and talking about ways to safely navigate online resources to get the maximum benefit.”

Online Support For Mental Illness Holds Out Hope
Labour Leader Andrew Little today announced a bold new caucus line up which brings forward new talent and draws on the party's depth of experience.
“Labour has many new and highly capable MPs who have will have the opportunity to prove their ability. At the same time our senior hands will be on deck to take the fight to the National-led Government and support our upcoming stars,” Andrew Little says.
“I am pleased to announce Annette King will be my deputy for the coming year. In recent weeks they have shown how crucial their wisdom and strength is to Labour.
“Grant Robertson will be my Finance spokesperson and number three.  They are one of the best performers in Parliament and is more than a match for Bill English.
“Nanaia Mahuta's lead role in Labour regaining the Māori seats is recognised in their number four position and their reappointment as Māori Development spokesperson.
“Talented up and comers Carmel Sepuloni, Kelvin Davis and David Clark are taking on key roles and will be important members of my front bench.
“These roles will be reviewed in a year to ensure Labour has the strongest possible team to head into the 2017 election.
“This is an exciting new line up and I'm looking forward to getting down to business,” Andrew Little.

Nudists who frequent Hanlan's Point Beach tried to create their own rules at the clothing-optional beach saying that everyone had to undress for “the comfort of the nudists.”
Signs were posted across the beach area on Toronto Island saying that visitors should be naked to show respect for the nudists.
City staff were made aware of the signage this weekend and said the signs have been removed.
“Staff are investigating these reports to ensure that visitors to the beach are not confused by illegal or inaccurate signs,” Matthew Cutler, Spokesperson for Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation said.
CityNews was able to find a sign still at the beach on Monday evening.
Cutler said that visitors have the option of being nude if they choose and they are legally allowed to be nude in the designated are but nudity is never a requirement.
One person shared their story on Reddit saying they were approached by two men who allegedly said they had to be nude as it was a nude beach.
The beach area has been clothing-optional since city staff approved the proposal in May 1999.
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: Lee Fang, last month you attempted to speak with Hillary Clinton after they addressed a town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire. You asked them if they would release the transcripts of their paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. They laughed and turned away. I want to go to that clip.
LEE FANG: Hi, Secretary Clinton, will you release the transcripts of your paid speeches to Goldman Sachs?
HILLARY CLINTON: [laughs]
LEE FANG: No? There's a lot of controversy over the speeches. Secretary, is that a no? Secretary Clinton, will you release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches?
AMY GOODMAN: So, Lee Fang, explain what happened and why you're raising this issue of what they were paid to make a speech or speeches at Goldman Sachs.
LEE FANG: Well, Amy, since 2001, Bill and Hillary Clinton have earned over $115 million on the speaker circuit, going out to private corporations, foundations, special interest groups, and charging as much as $200,000, $300,000 per speech. I mean, this is really unprecedented in American history that you have a leading candidate of a major party enriching themselves personally from special interest groups that have been lobbying them and will be lobbying them if they do win the White House. So there's been a lot of talk about, you know, what these speeches actually entailed.
And Hillary Clinton has defended herself, saying that she's basically giving a boilerplate speech, they want to have more education and more conversations, and this is healthy for our democracy. On the other hand, there have been reports that when Hillary Clinton has gone to some special interest groups—for example, they gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs, making over $600,000 from that one investment bank—that they gave a very specially tailored message, saying that she's against all of this anti-bank populism. According to Politico, they reassured the bankers that they wouldn't be taking the line of Elizabeth Warren or Obama really criticizing the big banks. And so, this is a big issue, because, again, this—
AMY GOODMAN: I want to get Ellen Chesler, a Hillary Clinton supporter, to respond.
ELLEN CHESLER: In all due respect, I mean, I actually was at one of those Goldman Sachs speeches, and it was about foreign policy, completely about foreign policy. And the entire fee for the speaking went to support the Clinton Foundation. And this raises a big question, in my view. I mean, I think America needs to do a little bit better by its ex-presidents, because we've put them in a situation—and President Obama is going to be in the same situation—where in order to support—unless they're individually wealthy themselves, which is very rare—in order to support their lives after being in office—I mean, these offices no longer allow you to kind of fade away to the Supreme Court or—as has been in the past, or to a college president—
AMY GOODMAN: But you said the money goes to the foundation, not to them.
ELLEN CHESLER: So the money supported the foundation, almost all of it. I don't know exactly the numbers, because I'm not inside to that.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, Lee Fang, what about that?
ELLEN CHESLER: So that, I mean, you know, again, it just seems to me—
AMY GOODMAN: Well, let me ask—we only have 30 seconds—Lee Fang, your response to that?
LEE FANG: I believe the Clintons have said some of the money has gone to the foundation—
ELLEN CHESLER: Most of it.
LEE FANG: —but the vast majority of it has personally enriched them. They've released their personal ethics disclosures, and it's clear that the Clintons have made a lot of money, tens of millions of dollars, as I mentioned, earning over $115 million from the speaker circuit over the last 16 years.
ELLEN CHESLER: And then they've given it to the foundation.
LEE FANG: This is truly unprecedented.
ELLEN CHESLER: Then they've given it to the foundation.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, we're going to have to leave it there, but we'll continue to explore this, of course. Lee Fang with The Intercept, Ellen Chesler with the Roosevelt Institute, and thanks also to John Nichols from The Nation. This is Democracy Now! We will be covering New Hampshire.

The shop is closing on Saturday 9/9/2017. They will continue to operate online.
From an interview with Diana, Adam & Janelle that has been edited.
(Janelle) My mum and dad started the Melbourne Map Centre in 1981.
Dad wanted to have their own business and one of our relatives used to deliver Melways. The relative wanted to stop doing that so dad took over from him. When we were young my parents were selling the directories door-to-door.
They'd go to these industrial areas and customers would say, “yes, we'll take a couple of Melways for our drivers.”
“Also, do you have a map of Australia?”
At that point, there was one map shop in the city that had been around forever. So they saw a business opportunity and expanded from there.
(Diana) When we sold Melways customers kept asking for marine charts, forestry commission maps & NATMAP's.
My husband John said, “I think there might be a need for a map shop.”
The following year we opened this place.
People who were four-wheel driving, yachting, boating, fishing, bushwalking and various companies were after local maps, state maps, city maps and world maps. We were quite surprised by how quickly the business developed because we started from virtually nothing.
From selling Melways door-to-door.
It was full on for the two of us because our four children were young, so I'd have to go home and see that they were okay after school. Then I'd come back and pick John up at 6pm.
We weren't particularly interested in cartography, and we didn't specialise in a particular type of map. My husband wanted to have a shop, and that's just the way that it happened.
It just evolved from there.
We are still selling Melways.
People need them to get around.
And customers are constantly telling us that phones aren't enough. You can zero in on your phone and iPad, but it's often not good enough. People with digital technology are coming in for paper maps so they can see the overall picture.
They are finding that it's a better alternative than constantly zooming in and out.
And – if you're going out bush or to the outback – you still need paper maps as a backup.
Before our closing down sale there were maps all around us.
We had cabinets right down the walls. We had rows and rows of guidebooks which aren't used much anymore. We used to have 60 or 70 globes. It's quite funny because it is like a cycle.
We are back to how we started in that the shop is basic and bare again.
We also had three shops at one stage. Kew was the first one, which opened around the mid 90's. Then we expanded to the Dandenong store about 18 months before September 11.
That didn't last long because oversees travel died right off. On the other hand, we had a big surge of people wanting maps of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq because they wanted to know where they were.
We eventually decided to cut it back to the original store.
So this is the place we started with 36 years ago.
(Adam) During the year we would see different patterns.
In the warmer months there'd be a lot of local travel.
Four-wheel drivers and bushwalkers would get out because the state forests and the national parks have tracks that close in winter.
Travellers typically head up north to Cape York, The Kimberley's and outback Australia during winter. There'd be a fair bit of overseas travel too, because winter here is summer in Europe.
And – during the Global Financial Crisis – global suppliers cut back on the range of maps they'd sell. Some of them have started expanding again, but not at the same level.
Map publishers are largely based in Europe and, unfortunately, a lot of them didn't survive the GFC.
So external forces come in to play.

We have long term customers who have been coming for 25 or 30 years.
Over the last few years they were constantly saying, ‘I hope you don't go. I hope you don't go.”
I think that's what we are all going to miss. 99.9 per cent of the customers are absolutely lovely. We have people who would come in and spend two hours walking around and poring over maps.
(Adam) I've been to Europe a few times, and customers will come in and chat about their travel plans and experiences.
We would stand here and talk about it for hours.

There's probably more Asian travel now.
Travellers are probably a bit more adventurous and – as one country closes off – another opens. For example, we used to sell more Egyptian maps, but now people are buying Tunisian maps and guidebooks
And – for years – no one from Australia travelled to Iran, but it's becoming quite a popular travel destination. Cuba has also really opened up over the past few years. The hot spot at the moment is Iceland.
I had somebody say – because flights between Europe to America stop at Reykjavik – travellers will stay for a few days. Another customer said it's the whole Game of Thrones thing.
At one point, I think we had maps of every country in the world.
If there was a map, we would have had it here.

We're closing the shop mainly because of personal reasons.
(Adam) Dad passed away last year. I run it with my sister now and you get to the point where you become burnt out.
We both have young families, and most of the map shops around Australia are run by people whose kids have grown up. They don't have mortgages and – for them – it's more of a hobby business.
Rent prices are going up all the time and hiring staff can be so expensive. It's a lot tougher and more complicated running a small business now. (Janelle) If we had children earlier, they would have been at an age where they could have taken over!
(Janelle) My kid loves coming here so he's quite upset that we are closing.
(Diana) I'm the one who should be rolling on the floor crying, but it's these two who will miss it.
(Adam) I've been here for 30 years and it's the only job I've ever had.
I graduated from IT at Monash and I was working here while completing my degree.
Dad said, ‘come and do the computer programs.'
I never left.
Saturday is our last day and I feel like it's the week before a funeral. I'm emotional about it, but we're at a point in our life where we need to look after ourselves and do our own thing.
It's been a huge part of all of our lives so we'll be sad to see it go. I used to talk to dad about it and he'd say, “no business lasts forever.”
“If it's time for it to go, it's time for it to go.”
We're not closing.
We are just moving online.

An Indiana-based cleaning company has agreed to pay $12,500 to settle a federal sex discrimination suit involving a male janitor who cleaned men's and women's restrooms at the Charlotte location of a global outsourcing firm.
The case involved janitor William Kehoe, who left the women's restrooms they were cleaning at The case involved janitor William Kehoe, who left the women's restrooms they were cleaning at Convergys each time a woman entered. They would resume cleaning after the woman left, according to a complaint filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Kehoe worked for Skyline Services, a janitorial service hired by Indiana-based Executive Management Services.
Because Kehoe's work was interrupted in the restrooms, EMS asked Skyline to replace them with a female janitor, but Skyline refused, according to the complaint. Soon after Skyline refused to replace Kehoe, EMS terminated Skyline's contract effective March 31, 2014, the EEOC said.
Although EMS rehired some or all of the Skyline employees who worked at Convergys, EMS refused to consider Kehoe for re-employment because of their sex, the Although EMS rehired some or all of the Skyline employees who worked at Convergys, EMS refused to consider Kehoe for re-employment because of their sex, the EEOC contended in its complaint. The EEOC charged that EMS violated federal law when it failed to hire a qualified male applicant because of their sex.
The commission filed a civil lawsuit against EMS in federal court in Charlotte, after trying to reach a pre-litigation settlement.
Besides agreeing to pay Kehoe $12,500, EMS entered into a two-year consent decree requiring, among other things, that it conduct annual training for supervisors and managers on Title VII and its prohibition against discrimination based on sex.
EMS must also post an employee notice about the lawsuit and provide periodic reports to the EEOC about some of its hiring practices.
“Employers must ensure that both men and women have equal access to jobs,” Lynette Barnes, the regional attorney in the EEOC's Charlotte District Office, said in a statement announcing the outcome of the case. “The law requires it.”
Apart from the Mi Note 3 and Mi MIX 2 released this week, Xiaomi also unveiled a new power bank. The Mi Power 2C like the Mi Power 2 has a 20,000 mAh battery capacity but costs less.
The Mi Power 2C has a PCB+ABS body with a rough surface for a better grip when held. The design is similar to that of the Mi Power 2 with an input port flanked by two output ports on both sides. Both the input and output ports support 18W fast charging and are located in front. Above the input port are four LEDs that indicate the charge on the device. On the left is a power/reset button.
The power bank uses high quality Li-Polymer batteries with a conversion rate of 93%. The Mi Power 2C can charge the Mi 5X 4.3 times, the Mi Mix 2 3.8 times and the iPad Mini 2.5 times. Each output port supports Quick Charge 3.0 and can provide up to 5.1V/3.6A.
The power bank can also be used to charge devices that require low current like the Mi Band (0.025A) and the Mi Bluetooth Headset (0.06A). To charge the above mentioned devices, all you have to do is double press the power button to switch to low power mode.
Since it supports 2-way fast charging, it will only take 8 hours to recharge the portable battery using a QC 3.0 charger.
Xiaomi has included a bunch of protective measures in the power bank. There is temperature protection, input/output high voltage protection, overcharge and discharge protection, and short circuit protection. The Mi Power 2C is also said to have a 90% retention rate even after 300 charge cycles and should last up to 3 years.

Anthony Domontay Marion and Lauren Nicole Martinez of St. Charles indicted on Federal Drug Charges made their initial appearances before United States Magistrate Judge John M. Bodenhausen
ST. LOUIS, MO/December 11, 2017 (STL.News) – Anthony Domontay Marion, a/k/a “Bird,” 34, and Lauren Nicole Martinez, a/k/a “Nikki,” 29, were indicted on November 29th for allegedly distributing heroin to J.W. in February 2016, which caused their death. Both appeared last week before United States Magistrate Judge John M. Bodenhausen for their initial appearances.
If convicted, this charge carries a penalty range of 20 years to life in prison and/or fines up to $1 million. In determining the actual sentences, a Judge is required to consider the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which provide recommended sentencing ranges.
This case was investigated the Drug Enforcement Administration.
As is always the case, charges set forth in an indictment are merely accusations and do not constitute proof of guilt. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty.

WASHINGTON, DC -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers is asking the White House to pressure the military to hasten efforts to clean up toxic chemicals leftover from firefighting foam and expand access to clean water for people exposed to them.
Eight Democrats and six Republicans in the U.S House of Representatives signed the Aug. 1 letter to President Donald Trump, which argues the Defense Department has been "slow to provide safe drinking water to those areas with contaminated water."
The letter urges more be done about perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), also known as perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which have polluted groundwater on or near military bases around the country where PFC-laden firefighting foam was used in training and crashes.
In Michigan, Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) used at former Air Force and current National Guard bases has resulted in PFC plumes which have contaminated private wells in Oscoda and Grayling, and possibly the Grayling municipal water supply.
Toxic water drives health, property value worries in Grayling Municipal water also testing positive for trace PFC levels.
Preliminary assessments indicate the chemicals may be present at other bases in Michigan, including Selfridge Air National Guard Base near Mount Clemens, the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center and the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base.
According to the letter, the Department of Defense (DoD) has identified and begun testing 664 sites for PFCs, which are a class of fluorocarbons that have been tied to developmental defects in children, cancer and diseases of the liver and thyroid.
However, the military refuses to pay for a long-term safe water supply unless a well test above the Environmental Protection Agency's health advisory threshold of 70 parts-per-trillion (ppf) for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which some public health researchers criticize as too high.
The Pentagon is disputing a Michigan law passed in January that sought to put the cost and cleanup burden on the military for the PFC contamination it caused.
The EPA has only established an advisory for PFOA and PFOS, but some wells in Oscoda are testing at extremely elevated levels for perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), a PFC which is closely related to PFOA and PFOS that was nominated in June for inclusion on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
The PFCs in Oscoda are coming from the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base. In Grayling, PFHxS was found in municipal wells. The Michigan National Guard is currently investigating PFC plumes near the Grayling Army Airfield, part of the Camp Grayling complex.
"We ask that the Administration hasten the DoD's response to the issue of PFC contamination," the letter read. "We have asked our service members to make critical sacrifices for our freedom and we must assure them that they, and their families, have access to safe drinking water."
Provisions attached to military spending bills in Congress would require the Pentagon conduct a national PFC health study through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and report on progress toward developing a firefighting foam that does not contain PFOS or PFOA, which give AFFF its fire-retardant capabilities.
Defense bill would require national PFC health study Michigan military base towns dealing with toxic foam problem.
The bill would also authorize the Pentagon to sign agreements with local health departments for screenings in communities near bases with PFC problems in the ground or municipal water.
An amendment to provide $60 million for PFC cleanups at bases nationwide passed the full House last week. The fate of PFC provisions is uncertain as the chambers debate the spending bill, which includes funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Democrats oppose.
A bill pending in the House energy and commerce committee would require the EPA establish enforceable standards for PFCs in drinking water. The present health advisory level is a voluntary guideline.
"PFCs are a dangerous chemical, the full impact of which is still unknown, and it is critical that DoD take immediate action to prevent further exposure," the letter read.
"Despite the danger PFCs present, DoD has been slow to provide safe drinking water to those areas with contaminated water. For more than a year, members of Congress have repeatedly requested that DoD prioritize investigations of contamination on its sites and provide safe drinking water for these impacted areas. Yet there are still veterans, their families and surrounding communities exposed to PFC-contaminated drinking water that the DoD has yet to address."

Lawmakers who signed the letter include:

Carol Shea-Porter, D-New Hampshire
Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Delaware

Lord Ahmed of Rotherham warns fighting will eventually lead to genocide and widespread bloodshed and must be stopped
A British peer has made a personal trip to the Libyan capital in an attempt to kickstart a peace process, warning of "genocide" if either loyalist forces, or rebels are seen to win the war.
Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, who has gained a reputation as a regional trouble shooter said widespread bloodshed was likely "if the government took control of the country or if the rebels did".
"If there is no solution and the tribes are fighting each other then God forbid it would be a disaster for us all," they said speaking among a gathering of tribal leaders.
Ahmed said the 1,400 plus sorties flown so far by Nato jets had achieved little. "And … if people continue to die because of this that is something I do not wish to have on my conscience."
Ahmed has criticised Britain's interventionism over the past decade. They were a staunch critic of the invasion of Iraq and has made trips to both Gaza and Sudan in an bid to broker peace.
"It is my wish to try to help the brothers who have fallen out to become friends again - to create peace and reconciliation with them. We do not want to see Libya become another Afghanistan," they said.
They said they would return to Libya with members from both sides of the House of Lords, describing this visit as a fact-finding mission. No meetings with senior regime officials were arranged.
"Some of my colleagues in Europe do not understand the tribal set-up of this part of the world. I am not sure whether Mr Sarkozy, or Mr Berlusconi have the answers."
Meanwhile Nato's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Colonel Gaddafi's 42-year regime was nearing an end. Nato jets, which are responsible for enforcing a UN mandated no fly zone over Libya have been relatively quiet over the past week after earlier targeting sites across the country. Heavy fighting was again reported in Misrata.
Faced with economic sanctions by the Western world and a retaliatory ban on import of agricultural commodities from there, Russia has evinced interest in buying a large quantity of and from India.
In a letter to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), one of Russia's largest chains, Retain Chain Monetka, has sought import of potato, cabbage, carrot, marrow, garlic, tomato, onion, capsicum, radish and mushroom, among others.
Consequently, Russia is looking to import agricultural commodities from elsewhere. It has also sought import of apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate, grapefruit and pears from India.
Vinod Kumar Kaul, deputy general manager in charge of the fruit and vegetable division of Apeda, advised potential exporters to contact the importer directly and apprise their section.
India currently exports agricultural commodities worth $100 million yearly to Russia.
Witnesses say a Richmond, Virginia, police officer helped their daughter avoid drunken driving charges early Sunday morning after they nearly struck some pedestrians after running two stop signs.
Residents had gone outside about 12:30 a.m. after someone struck a parked SUV when they saw another driver speed through a stop sign without slowing down.
“We were forced to flee the street towards the sidewalk as we realized that this was not another cop rushing to the scene, but a driver who has clearly failed to notice a stop sign, an automobile accident, and flashing police lights, and is headed straight for a head-on collision with the wrecked SUV,” said witness S. Preston Duncan, of Church Hill, in a Facebook post shared by Richmond police.
They said the driver slammed on the brakes of their car, swerved around the damaged vehicles, and nearly struck a parked police cruiser with its sirens flashing.
“She was crying hysterically, hitting their head on the steering wheel,” Duncan said. “At one point they got out of the car and spilled the entire contents of their purse on the street.”
Police repeatedly asked the woman to get back into their car, and Duncan said they and least one other person heard one of the officer's agree to speak to the driver's father on a cell phone if they called him.
About 30 minutes later, Duncan said, a man and woman arrived in an SUV.
Duncan's roommate had been recording cell phone video of the situation, they said, but the man in the SUV told them to turn off the camera.
The woman who had nearly struck the pedestrians also screamed at the roommate to stop recording video, and they briefly argued.
Witnesses said the driver was never given a Breathalyzer or field sobriety test and allowed to leave with the man and woman in the SUV.
Police said the man who arrived in the SUV was not a Richmond police officer, but they did not say who they are.
Richmond police are conducting an internal investigation of the incident to determine why the woman was allowed to leave without undergoing sobriety tests.

SIR Michael Caine will never forget the first time they met the late Tony Curtis - the acting legend snatched the Brit's cigarettes, threw them away and ordered them to quit smoking.
The 85-year-old screen veteran passed away on Wednesday (29Sep10) after suffering a cardiac arrest at their home in Nevada.
Caine was among the first to pay tribute and they shared their special memories of Some Like It Hot star, including their first meeting when they were prompted to stop smoking after Curtis destroyed their personal tobacco stash.
They tell Sky News, "I just learned myself (about Curtis' death) and it was a terrible shock and instantly I remembered the first time I'd met him. I was at a party, it was in winter and there was a fire and I was chain-smoking at the time, smoking a lot of cigarettes.
"I took one cigarette and lit it with another and threw the dog end (butt) in the fire. I was stood there talking to someone and suddenly I felt a hand in my inside pocket and they took out my cigarettes and chucked them in the fire. I looked up and it was Tony Curtis.
"I'd never met them and they were very famous. I said, 'What did you do that for?' And they said, 'You're going to die Michael if you keep doing that.' I didn't give them up then but I did give them up eventually."
But Caine insists Curtis didn't live by their own health warnings, adding, "He took all my cigarettes and threw them in the fire - and two weeks later they were caught at Heathrow airport with marijuana."
Other stars to pay tribute to Curtis on Thursday (30Sep10) included their friend Sir Roger Moore, who said, "I'm very sad... They were a hell of a good actor. I shall miss him."
Burlesque beauty Dita Von Teese wrote on on their Twitter.com blog, "Sad to hear of the passing of the great Tony Curtis," while British talk show host Sir Michael Parkinson added, "He was an extraordinary man. Hollywood tried to make them into a sex symbol in the 1950s and 1960s but they were their own man. They were a great chat show guest and was wonderfully indiscreet but they were very bright and did not take themselves too seriously."
Whether you think it's a long-awaited ad hybrid or just a high-cost gimmick, this upcoming interactive print ad for Motorola's Moto X is definitely pushing people's buttons.
Running in 150,000 New York and Chicago editions of January's Wired magazine, the ad lets readers change the color of the handset on display by tapping controls located at the bottom of the page.
The ad's functionality, achieved via wafer-thin LEDs and batteries and created by Digitas, mimics the more full-featured MotoMaker site that allows you to browse the device's customizable options. Bloggers and viewers of the preview video seem mixed on whether this is truly innovative or just a stunt that would be too expensive to be widely replicated in print. Others just seem happy they don't have to pull out their smartphones to play with the ad: "The future of print advertising?" one YouTube commenter jokingly asked. "Can't be—there's not a freakin' #QRcode in sight.﻿"
Other recent efforts blurring the lines between conventional and cutting-edge include a Nivea print promo that uses solar power to charge cellphones, a CW live Twitter feed embedded in a magazine ad and a billboard that draws moisture out of desert air and turns it into safe drinking water.

Internal investigators have already dismissed most complaints of civil rights violations against federal agents handling the surge of illegal immigrant children on the border, the Homeland Security Department inspector general said in a new report Thursday that details near-heroic efforts agents and officers are making.
In its first report since the surge, the inspector general said agents have contracted everything from scabies and lice to chickenpox, including bringing the disease home to their own children, as they care for the unaccompanied minors. Investigators also said they saw instances of agents and officers spending their own money to buy toys, clothing and food for children and families.
The report largely clears immigration authorities of dozens of complaints of civil rights violations detailed in a complaint last month from the American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant rights advocates.
Of the 116 complaints the ACLU filed, the inspector general has dismissed 78 of them. The other 38 are still under review.
Investigators said in addition to looking at the old complaints, they made 87 unannounced visits to 63 sites including border entry points, Border Patrol checkpoints, holding facilities where children are being kept, and the new facility in New Mexico specifically designed to detain illegal immigrant families.
They found no evidence of misconduct, and none of the children they randomly interviewed reported problems, the inspector general said.

There were some hiccups: In one instance they did find contractors weren't providing enough food — a problem that was corrected after the investigators raised it. And the investigators said temperatures in the facilities were inconsistent, and not all of the facilities have posted their policies for unaccompanied children in English and Spanish.
The inspector general also found difficult conditions dealing with a population not necessarily used to first-world comforts.
The investigators said some illegal immigrants' “unfamiliarity with bathroom facilities resulted in unsanitary conditions and exposure to human waste” in some of the facilities.
Investigators confirmed the administration's own admission that it is often holding the children longer than the 72-hour deadline set in law for turning them over to social workers. The inspector general suggested staffing ratios were partly to blame, with one Border Patrol station having more than 25 children for each employee, while others had as few as three to one.
The ACLU's initial complaint, filed in conjunction with immigrant rights groups who provide services to the children, charged that agents verbally and physically abused some of the children, or neglected their needs.
The complaint sent to Homeland Security officials listed the names of children involved, though the names agents and officers themselves were not listed.
After the complaint, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske ordered the inspector general to investigate, though they said at the time that they personally had witnessed near-heroic behavior by agents and officers digging into their own pockets to pay for food or toys.

Joe Meek, 22, the friend of shooter Dylann Roof who massacred black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. They were convicted because they had not informed authorities of Roof's plans in advance. They told the court on Tuesday when they were sentenced, "I don't know if I will make it out of prison alive. I'm scared."
Meek, of Lexington, South Carolina, told the court "I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart," they said tearfully. "(I) really wish I would have called the cops." There was no one to speak at the sentencing hearing from among Roof's surviving victims or the families of victims. For their part, Roof has been found guilty of the killings and has received a death sentence on federal charges. Roof still faces a trial and probable death penalty on state charges.
Joseph Meek Jr.
Meek was also was sentenced to one year of supervised release. They requested that they be sent to the federal prison near their relatives Edgefield, South Carolina. They were arrested in September 2015 and charged with concealing and failing to report a crime, and lying to the FBI. They pleaded guilty in April, according to court records. They faced as many as eight years in prison.
Dylann Roof shot to death nine people, including the pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on June 17, 2015. Meek was not accused of having a direct role in the massacre. Federal prosecutors charged that Meek, however, informed family members and associates of the shooting on the night of the incident. They attempted to prevent them from coming forward.
Meek spoke to the media and investigators. They told CNN that they described Roof in a call to the FBI after the killings, and also gave them the license plate number of their car. To the media, they said that their friend had developed vague plans about inciting racial hatred and doing “something crazy.”
Meek said that while they had not taken Roof's threats seriously, they did hide their friend's gun on the night they heard the plot. However, they replaced it later. Prosecutors alleged that Meek told the FBI that "he did not know specifics of Dylann Roof's plan to shoot individuals on a Wednesday, during Bible Study, at an AME church in Charleston, South Carolina." The prosecutors alleged, however, that "Meek's statements and representations denying such specifics were false, fictitious and fraudulent when made." Meek was charged with failing to notify authorities of any information they had regarding the shooting "as soon as possible."
Attorney Deborah Barbier, who represented Meek, said on Tuesday that they “has expressed to all of the families of the victims of the brutal murders at the AME church their sincere remorse and sympathies for their losses." They said, "Joey sincerely hopes that anyone who has a friend who is talking about hurting someone will take it seriously, learn from their mistake and notify the proper authorities immediately."
Meek and Roof had been become friends while in their pre-teen years but had lost touch in recent years. Meek said that Roof's behavior in the months before the shooting was scary.

In a similar case of alleged aid given to a murderer, Noor Salman --the wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen -- is facing federal charges of "Aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist and Obstruction of Justice," said Orlando Police Chief John Mina in a statement in January.
Mateen murdered 49 people on June 12, 2016, at the Pulse nightclub in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. They were killed in a firefight with police. Mateen was a Muslim, and the mayhem they caused has been labeled an act of terror.
Salman moved to the San Francisco area after their husband's death. They told the New York Times in November, "I was unaware of everything." They said, "I don't condone what they have done. I am very sorry for what has happened. They have hurt a lot of people." Linda Moreno, Salman's attorney released a statement that their client was unaware of Mateen's plans. Moreno pointed out that Salman claimed to have been abused by Mateen. "We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute them and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person."
Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
A military research analyst told The Jerusalem Post that Iran may have staged what it claimed was the downing of an Israeli drone in its airspace a week ago.
Patrick Megahan, a research analyst focusing on military affairs who manage the militaryedge.org website at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Post that it is difficult to say with certainty based on pictures alone that Iran staged the downing of what it said was an Israeli drone, but there are some key clues.
“First, the remnants of the aircraft do not match those of any known Israeli UA V,” said Megahan, noting that “Iran is saying it's a Hermes class drone, but of the two Hermes models which are most similar to what appears in the video, the Hermes 180 and 450, there are still a number of minor design features which do not match.”“There is a clear hole at the tip of the nose” on the drone that Iran claimed it shot down, but “the Hermes 450 has a smooth nose with some kind of rectangular openings on the top and bottom, which are absent on this drone,” asserted Megahan.“While the Hermes 180 does have a point that extends from the tip which would create that hole, there appears to be differences in how the body is assembled,” they said.“The crashed drone's nose appears to be cleanly split in two, indicating the fuselage is made of two halves fused together. While if you look at both the Hermes 180 and 450, you can see that on top there is a removable rectangular opening to access the inner workings of the drone.”In fact, the aircraft that Iran claims to have shot down “actually resembles an Iranian developed Shahed 129 drone more than any known Israeli one,” added Megahan.Second, the military research analyst points out that Iran's claim that the drone was on its way to the Natanz uranium enrichment plant is dubious, since it is almost 1,000 miles from Israel and well out of the range of both the Hermes 180 and 450.“There is speculation that it could be a Azeri owned Hermes drone, but again, Natanz is too far from Azerbaijan for those models to reach, loiter over top to collect intelligence, and then return,” they said.Third, Megahan says that Israel has larger, more capable drones like the Heron TP, which “would be better suited for this type of operation.”“Fourth, Iran has a record of wild claims. While Iran does appear to have seized crashed American drones like RQ-170, other achievements by Iran's military are far-fetched.”“Also, in this instance, members of the IRGC are saying the downed drone has a range of 800 km and is radar evading, a capability that neither Hermes drone is capable of,” they noted.

Addressing shareholders of the Calgary-based energy company, Enbridge Inc., was a valuable human-to-human experience, said a leader of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota, even though the motion they supported fell flat.
Tribal Councillor Chad Harrison spoke at the corporation's annual general meeting on Thursday, where they urged shareholders to adopt a proposal that would require Enbridge to disclose how it plans to address social and environmental risks — including infringement of indigenous rights — when it buys new assets.
Seventy per cent of shareholders voted against it, but Harrison said their message was still "driven home."
“The proposal was defeated, but we got 30 per cent approval which was a pleasant surprise. It shows the human element of it,” they told National Observer. "There were people there that are shareholders of the Enbridge company that are trying to push social, environmental responsibly.”
The proposal was launched by the Sisters of Charity in Halifax, a Catholic religious order that owns company shares. They support socially responsible investments and shareholder action to change corporate policy on several issues including climate change. The Enbridge shareholder proposal was prompted by the company's purchase of the U.S. Bakken Pipeline System earlier this year, which includes a 27.5-per cent stake in the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).
That project drew months of high-profile protests from indigenous groups and thousands of supporters both in Standing Rock, N.D. and across North America over its potential to contaminate the local water supply. Protest camps near the pipeline route galvanized support for indigenous rights around the world as local police were filmed lobbing tear gas at protestors and arresting hundreds.
The camps have subsequently been dismantled and the pipeline is near completion. Reports of its first leak surfaced this week.

“The protest, the movement, could most likely have been prevented,” Harrison told their Calgary audience. “Transparency, diligence, consultation, prior and informed consent could have prevented much of this.”
Enbridge recommended against the proposal, saying its concerns are adequately addressed by its new enhanced disclosure rules.
Harrison later told National Observer that the Standing Rock Tribe fully supports taking their case for fair consultation directly to industry.
“We've reached out to governments before, but a lot of times we don't get to meet with decision makers," they said. "At a shareholder meeting, we've got the board of directors, the CEO, senior staff and having them present gives us an audience of decision-makers."
Sister Cecilia Hudec also spoke in favour of the proposal saying, “Attention to indigenous rights in company decisions is important both for the value of a company and for reconciliation in Canada.”
In response, Enbridge president and CEO Al Monaco told the annual general meeting that the company will push ahead with broader disclosure in its 2017 sustainability report.
“So one thing that shouldn't be in doubt is the fact that we recognize and respect the legal and constitutional rights of indigenous peoples, and the vital relationship they have with traditional lands and resources, and I believe that our company has had great relationships built over many decades with indigenous peoples on either side of the border.”
In November 2016, the federal government formally rejected Enbridge's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to a port in Kitimat, B.C. The province's stunning coastal temperate rainforest was "no place for a pipeline," said Trudeau, following months of indigenous and environmental protest against the project.
Their decision followed a historic ruling by the Federal Court of Appeal which quashed the company's permits because the previous Conservative government hadn't adequately consulted First Nations when it gave the project a green light.
Delaney Greig of the Shareholder Association for Research and Education (SHARE) helped the Sisters of Charity bring the proposal to the company. They said they took the step of approaching shareholders — rather than simply selling their shares in the company — because they believe it has a bigger impact.
Monaco also told reporters that the company hesitated before buying into the Dakota Access pipeline because of widespread protests, but ultimately decided it was a sound investment.
"It was hard to miss what was going on out there, and we were very concerned about it. Frankly, we spent a lot of time pondering this issue given the circumstances," they said.
On Feb. 27, Enbridge also finalized a merger with Spectra Energy Corp. The transaction created the largest energy infrastructure company in North America, and one of the largest in the world — with an enterprise value of approximately $166 billion.

BETTER Together leader Alistair Darling was not at yesterday's debate on devolution.
The Labour former Chancellor, who led the No campaign to victory four weeks ago, joined a list of high-profile absentees.
Prime Minister David Cameron was slammed for snubbing the debate, and there was no sign either of the two other men who made The Vow, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems.
Darling's office said they were unavailable but refused to say why.
Shortly after the referendum vote, Darling warned the Westminster leaders to keep their promises to Scotland. They said: “Anyone who welches on that will pay a very high price for years to come.”
For those excited by the prospect of snagging a home for half price following predictions of a home loan crisis and a plunge in property values, don't get your hopes up.
A US-based researcher's predictions that we will witness up to 50 per cent price drops across Australia are “outrageous” and “not going to happen”, according to leading economists.
In a 60 Minutes episode on Sunday, Jonathan Tepper, founder of macroeconomic research group Variant Perception, predicted a property market crash of 30 per cent to 50 per cent.
Mr Tepper expects property prices to plummet at similar rates seen in the US, Ireland and Spain as a result of huge mortgages on “overvalued” property in Australia.
AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said it's nothing new to find people making claims of upcoming property prices crashes, but “unless we have a very severe recession or interest rates go sky high causing people to default, it's not going to happen,” they said.
“They often make the claim that [Australia has] the highest household debt to income ratio, but if the figure is adjusted for the amount kept in offset accounts and for businesses … it's at the same level as it was in 2007/2008,” they said.
“As we can see at the moment, the banks are telling us households aren't having problems servicing their debt.”
While they said “everything is possible” and there is the chance fraudulent pay slips have been used by some brokers, the banking regulator APRA is serious on banking standards.
“If we had unemployment at much higher levels than 6 per cent, if we had mortgage rates at more than 10 per cent I would be much more worried,” Dr Oliver said.
“But I've seen all these claims before and there is an underlying resilience in the Australian housing market that sees it hold up,” they said.

February 21, 2016 Domain Group senior economist Andrew Wilson called the claims of a 50 per cent price drops in Australia's capital cities “outrageous”.
“The clear characteristics of Australia's capital city housing markets are orderly growth and correction phases, if anything we're going to have a less volatile market in the future,” Dr Wilson said.
“Even in the deepest of recessions we haven't seen [house prices drop 50 per cent], even in the 1990s with unemployment pushing over 10 per cent in some areas and high mortgage defaults, we saw a very modest change in house prices.”
Among all Australians, it's typically under 5 per cent who are “highly leveraged” for their homes, with 96 per cent either owning their own home outright or paying less than 30 per cent of their incomes on repayments, they said.
“The logic doesn't support any prospect of the type of house price drops being forecast by the doomsayers.”
HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham does not believe Australia has a housing bubble, saying high prices are “explained by the fundamentals of supply and demand”.
“Most of the loans are held by upper income earners and the housing debt is fairly well allocated,” Mr Bloxham said.
While the ramp up in investor activity seen in 2015 was “concerning for the Sydney and Melbourne markets” they said measures taken to restrain those risks appear to have been successful.
“In Ireland, the US and Spain house prices went up and credit was misallocated to households who couldn't afford to service it, but there was also an oversupply of dwellings, which meant when the falls happened [it was exacerbated],” Bloxham said.
In most areas of Australia there is no oversupply of homes and, in the case of Sydney, it is “very undersupplied,” they said.
However, LF Economics' Lindsay David agrees “100 per cent” with Mr Tepper's view the national housing market is “a bubble just waiting to burst” with a mortgage crisis on the cards.
“By global standards our banks are lending what could only be described as toxic sums of debt to homebuyers that will never be repaid,” Mr David said.
“One only needs to walk into a bank or mortgage broker and have a five minute chat to realise they will lend to you a sum of debt you could never ascertain in other countries with no core evidence that you could ever repay the debt, particularly interest only loans, in a market downturn,” they said.
Chris Hansen's proposed basketball and hockey arena for Seattle's Sodo neighborhood has cleared its biggest hurdle since lawmakers approved its funding package, getting a green light Thursday in a state-mandated environmental impact report two years in the making.
The project, which has sat idle during the environmental review, now can move forward in the approval process — though several large roadblocks stand in its way.
“The Sodo arena project has just passed another major milestone,” Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. “The city has met its commitment to complete the EIS (environmental impact statement) process. No major findings stand in the way of arena construction.
“The city will continue to work with arena developers, the Stadium District and Sodo interests on the impacts that were identified during the EIS process. The city can now begin looking ahead to the street vacation and other pieces necessary to move this project forward.
“We're one step closer to bringing NHL hockey and NBA basketball to Seattle.”
[Related: More reactions from Murray and Hansen's investment group]
While the report found no significant environmental, transportation or economic reasons to block construction of an arena south of the Safeco Field parking garage, the project cannot begin until Hansen and their investment group secure an NBA team for the Seattle region. And while the NHL appears more likely to enter the Seattle market first, Hansen's agreement with the city and county must first be amended to allow hockey to trigger funding for the arena.
Furthermore, Hansen's plan now faces competition from a burgeoning plan near Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, where a group led by real estate investor Ray Bartoszek is exploring a similar multipurpose arena.
The environmental report, required under the Washington State Environmental Policy Act, is more than 600 pages long. We are combing through it and are posting findings, facts and figures below.
Updated: We have finished our initial examination of the environmental impact statement (EIS) report. Below is a summary of the more interesting and applicable findings, beginning with the most recent posts and moving back to when we started Thursday morning.
Hansen's effort started in 2011, when they began talking to the NBA and the Seattle Mayor's Office about the possibility of building a new arena in Sodo for a new NBA team. They began purchasing land south of the Safeco Field parking garage and drafting a financing proposal to build an arena through both public and private funding.
Despite opposition from groups like the Port of Seattle and Seattle Mariners, who fear extra congestion in the area, an arena financing plan was approved in October 2012 after months of negotiations among Hansen, the Seattle City Council and the Metropolitan King County Council. Their “memorandum of understanding” established a $200 million public contribution through taxes on future arena revenues, with Hansen's group paying the remaining costs — including overruns — of the estimated $500 million facility.
That agreement requires Hansen to secure an NBA franchise for Seattle before public funding kicks in. The stars appeared to align in 2013 when the Sacramento Kings became available for purchase, but the NBA rejected Hansen's $406 million bid for a controlling stake in the franchise, instead awarding the team to a local ownership group organized by Sacramento Mayor and former NBA All-Star Kevin Johnson.
Since then, Hansen's project has stalled as the NBA remains resistant to expanding beyond 30 teams. Their major investment partner, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, split off to eventually purchase the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion last year. And Hansen's arena plan now faces competition from a proposed project in Tukwila that appears to have less legal red tape to clear.

CALGARY — Lindsey Vonn is one of those rare Olympic athletes with a reach that extends far beyond the sports pages or nightly highlight packages.
The 32-year-old American jet-setter is the most decorated female skier in history. Them resume includes a record 76 World Cup victories, two world championship golds, two Olympic medals — including downhill gold at the 2010 Games in Vancouver — and four World Cup overall titles.  They are a regular on the Hollywood red carpet and the face of their sport.
So while their latest proposal might make the suits at the International Ski Federation (FIS) uncomfortable, Vonn should absolutely receive permission to compete against the men in 2018 at the Lake Louise World Cup downhill.
Will they win the race? No. Can they compete? If healthy, yes. Will the spectacle expand the reach of alpine skiing in North America and beyond? Absolutely. Can Vonn inspire young girls the world over by breaking the gender barrier? Without a doubt.
“People love boxes and Lindsey doesn't belong in one,” says the recently retired Hayley Wickenheiser, the first woman to score a goal in a men's professional hockey game back in 2003 in Finland. “She is good enough to compete, I don't see what the issue is. A skier is a skier.”
Vonn first raised the idea of competing against the men at Lake Louise back in 2012. At the time, the FIS council firmly rejected their request, saying “one gender is not entitled to participate in races of the other” and that “exceptions will not be made to the FIS Rule.”
In doing so, the organization tossed its greatest asset right back in one of those boxes Wickenheiser talks about.
This time, Vonn plans to submit a proposal with the support of the U.S. ski team to race against the men at the Canadian Rocky Mountain resort in November 2018.
While their focus at present is rebounding from a severe fracture of their arm and challenging for medals at the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, their proposal is expected to go before the FIS this spring.
“I train with the men all the time and I really enjoy it,” Vonn told The Denver Post. “They push me to be a better skier. I always find myself skiing my best when I'm skiing against them. I talk to them, I pick their brain, I see what they're doing and I, in turn, ski faster. So I would like the opportunity to see where I stand.”
There's no better place for Vonn to do so than at Lake Louise, which is nicknamed Lake Lindsey for their dominance. Vonn has 18 career victories at the Alberta resort, and the men's course is essentially the same as the women's with only a week separating the two events.
Vonn is not interested in an exhibition event that pits them against the guys. They want to race when it counts.
“I don't know why the FIS wouldn't allow it,” says Max Gartner, the former president of Alpine Canada and a high-performance sports consultant. “She has the ability to do it. I don't know under what grounds they would tell them ‘No.'”
They told them no in 2012, so we shouldn't be surprised if they receive a similar slap down this time around.
“I just don't see the interest,” Atle Skaardal, the FIS race director for the Women's World Cup, told The Denver Post. “For me, it's a meaningless comparison. It doesn't matter if she's one second behind or a half-second ahead. We compete female against female and men against men. To me, it doesn't matter if one gender is faster or slower. It doesn't mean it's a good idea just because it's of interest to one racer. I haven't heard of any other sport being dragged into this position.”
Well, there's bobsleigh, where Canadian Kaillie Humphries and American Elana Meyers Taylor made history in 2014 by competing in the four-man World Cup in Calgary. Then there's golfer Annika Sorenstam, who played back in 2003 at the Colonial Invitational in Fort Worth. Tennis star Billie Jean King took on Bobby Riggs in 1973. Four years later, Janet Guthrie became the first woman to compete in the Indy 500 and Daytona 500.
But we digress…
“In ski racing, TV audiences are shrinking,” Gartner says. “There are diehard ski fans who are always watching, but to expose the sport to larger audience, to new people, is huge. If Lindsey goes against the men, it would give the sport a big boost that it desperately needs. Lindsey is an amazing ski racer. She's obviously reached a lot of their goals — and now this is another one.”
There are, obviously, details to be worked out. The World Cup start list is determined by ranking, and Vonn's points come from the women's circuit, not the men's. Technically, this means they would start dead last, which would give them no chance to win.
The men on the circuit might not like Vonn bumping them down the start list should they take one of the coveted top-20 slots. Then, there's the chance they might lose to a girl, which likely wouldn't sit well with some of them, either.
Regardless, the FIS needs to look at the big picture. Take Vonn out of the proverbial box. Let them shine before they inevitably retire.
A new generation of ski racing fans awaits.
As pundits and wonks have been telling us since basically the day after President Obama was reelected — and as Nate Silver and others' forecast oracles still insist — we're probably going to wake up on Jan. 3 of next year with a brand-new, Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. (I know, I know; you're not sure you can wait.)
But while a lot of ink has been spilled in anticipation of how a GOP Congress will clash with Senate Democrats and President Obama, less attention is being paid to what might happen within the Republican Party once the post-victory honeymoon is over. Will a newly unified Congress be the first step toward a final end to the GOP's civil war? Or will GOP leadership soon find that winning in 2014 was the easy part?

To answer those questions and others about our possible near-future, Salon recently spoke with Harvard's Theda Skocpol, the influential professor of sociology and political science who in 2011 released "The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism," which is still perhaps the definitive analysis of the movement. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.
A few years ago, back when the Tea Party was relatively new, you and your co-author, Vanessa Williamson, wrote what I still consider to be the most useful in-depth study of the Tea Party. Now that it's been a few years, do you think the media has integrated any of your analysis into how it talks about the Tea Party? Are there any big misconceptions that you think persist?
I think it's hard for most analysts in the media to get away from the idea that popularity of the label in national opinion polls, or victory of self-described Tea Party candidates in Republican primaries — they tend to treat those as the primary indicators of whether the Tea Party is successful.
But as we explained in our book, the Tea Party is a set of organizations, top down and bottom up, that have exerted a lot of leverage on Republican candidates and officeholders. Sometimes they've directly challenged them in primaries — and I think those challenges are important — but this is a phenomenon that represents the more active half of Republican base voters, and ... their aim has been to get Republican officeholders and candidates to toe a certain policy line, and not to compromise with Democrats. And they've been extremely successful in that. They continue to be very successful.
You hear a narrative sometimes that says that in 2014, unlike 2010 and 2012, the establishment of the Republican Party did a good job of keeping unelectable Tea Party radicals off the ballot. Then, depending on the source, that assertion is sometimes cited as proof that in the war to control the GOP, the establishment won. I'm guessing you disagree?
Yeah, I don't agree with that at all.
Advertisement:
First of all, the so-called unelectable, odd candidates that they're talking about from earlier cycles are people like the woman in Delaware who said they aren't a witch [Christine O'Donnell], and Todd Akin in Missouri ... It would be hard to say what a Tea Party candidate is, but [Akin and O'Donnell] were as much Christian right candidates [as Tea Party ones], in any event, in terms of where they came from and who they were speaking to in the Republican electorate.
More to the point, [saying the establishment won] is a little bit like noting that a group of generals, after losing most of their army, have retaken a hill, but not noticing that the entire battlefield has switched to the terrain that the opponent wanted it to be fought on. That's what's happened in the Republican Party. It's very hard to find Republican leaders who are not adopting pretty extreme Tea Party positions and policy.
So it's a little bit more like they've won the 2014 battle, but in a bigger sense they already lost the war.
It'll be interesting to see what happens after Republicans take the Senate, as I expect that they will do, by two or three or four votes. There are some fairly extreme candidates who have been successful in the Republican primaries this time around who are going to get elected to the Senate and to the House (on top of some very extreme ones who made it even in the last cycle). So I think we're going to see an intensified war inside the Republican Party between the business-oriented wing and those who are beholden either to popular Tea Party forces or to ideological funders.

How big of a role do you think the Tea Party's view of compromise plays in the GOP's internal divisions?
It's very central. A lot of what the leveraging operating that is the Tea Party has been trying to do is to keep Republicans from compromising, either with Democrats in Congress or state legislatures or with, above all, President Obama. They've been pretty successful at that.
I've seen the polls showing that Democrats are so much more interested in compromise for its own sake than are Tea Partyers. How much does that have to do with the Tea Party having its own version of recent American history, one in which the country has long been falling apart, partially because of GOP capitulation?
Advertisement:
Certainly that belief is out there on the far right, [and] it's fanned in the far-right media, too ... There are a lot of Tea Partyers, especially in the grass roots, who see compromise as tantamount to treason, betrayal of the nation.
But if that's the way they approach politics, then the argument some people have made that a Republican Senate will lead to more compromise, because the GOP will be expected to govern, doesn't seem likely.
There are going to be a lot of dilemmas.

We know that John Boehner, and presumably Mitch McConnell, are going to be trying to engineer some compromises, particularly on budget issues, and they've already shown some ability to bring enough people along to avoid shutdowns and fiscal cliffs. But what are they going to do with, for example, the fact that their party has promised repeal of Obamacare?
That is s completely disingenuous promise. It is certainly something that these leaders know can't happen. But there's going to be a lot of pressure, not just to hold the symbolic vote that Obama would then veto if it made it to their desk — and I'm not sure it would — but to start going after major subsidies in the law that benefit millions of voters and benefit businesses that are very uneasy about that Tea Party strand of Republicanism.
I don't know what's going to happen there — and of course that's not even to get to the immigration issue. There are divisions within Tea Party forces on that one, but Republicans have fought an election on a maximalist, deport-them-all platform that just is not going to fly in [2016]. It's already been clear in the last two years that John Boehner cannot control their own caucus. And in the Senate, nobody can really control [anyone]. So I'm not quite sure how that's going to play out.
The Tea Party itself being divided when it comes to immigration reform — can you expand on that a bit? The conventional narrative holds that it's the businesspeople, the rich country club-style Republicans, who are for it, and then it's the Tea Party that's against it, and that's that.
Advertisement:
You're right that on most issues where divisions are playing out inside the Republican Party, it is business groups — who want things like agricultural subsidies and transportation bills and versions of immigration reform — against the Tea Party forces that don't.
At least in the work that Vanessa Williamson and I did, we didn't treat the Tea Party ever — and I still wouldn't — as a unified organization. We all call it "the Tea Party," but really it's a field of organizations. Some of them are bottom up, grass-roots Tea Party groups, the kind of organized part of the Tea Party half of the Republican electorate. I call those "popular Tea Party forces" ... and they are completely against immigration reform that includes any path to citizenship. I would put that up there right as practically the No. 1 issue in terms of passion at the grass roots.
Of all possible issues?
Yeah, pretty much.
Advertisement:
The sense that our country's being taken away from us, that a lot of government spending is benefiting undocumented immigrants — illegals, in their view — and that we must defend the country against this influx, that's very passionate for grass-roots Tea Partyers.
But when we talk about elite forces that have labeled themselves Tea Party supporters and are trying to kind of whip up the fears below and use those fears along with their money and their ideological pressures on the Republican officeholders, they're divided about immigration reform. You can look at the Jim DeMint crowd, and the Heritage Action Foundation, [and see] they staked out a maximalist, nativist position that is really the intellectual justification for the popular passions I described before.
But the Koch brothers network, instantiated most clearly at this point in Americans for Prosperity, they don't care what kind of people they exploit. And they're actually in favor of a version of immigration reform that might even include a kind of infinitely winding, very delayed route to some legalizations. Their guy is Paul Ryan (Paul Ryan always follows the Koch brothers' line on everything) and he's made favorable noises.
So it is a split within the elite ranks of Tea Party-aligned forces on immigration, in a way that it really isn't on healthcare reform, where they want to sabotage it. They want to stop it.

To your earlier point about the promise to repeal Obamacare, I assume you've been watching Gov. Kasich's Obamacare two-step?
[Laughs] Yeah.
Do you think their strategy of pretending the parts of Obamacare they support — like expanding Medicaid or ending rescission — aren't really part of the bill; do you think that is going to be a sustainable way future Republicans can thread the needle?
Well, Kasich is not the first to do this. We've seen a bunch of them trying this one. Ironically, the closer you get to the actual states, the more they're talking about Medicaid expansion being OK, but it's not Obamacare. That's a little easier to pull off, at least as a public argument, because many states have their own name for Medicaid, and a lot of the voters don't understand what program we're talking about. McConnell's claim that Obamacare was just a website was hilarious. I don't think it's even standing up inside Kentucky right now. I think he's being called on it big-time.
Advertisement:
It's just that the minute you get to a position where they can, for example, try to structure budgets, the Tea Party part of the Republican electorate — and the large number of Tea Party-oriented legislators that will be in both chambers — are going to be pushing vociferously for using 51-vote budget bills to go after the heart of Obamacare. And they're going to say, "Look, you ran on this; you made this promise." That's true. They have all made that promise. They've all misled the voters about what Obamacare is and about what they're going to do about it.
So the moment of truth is going to come fairly soon, when they're going to have to start engaging in more and more of these kinds of dances that I don't think the right wing of the Republican Party is going to accept. I don't think they're going to be fooled.

Delaying gratification is hard. You have probably seen the adorable videos of kids in Walter Mischel's classic experiments, in which one marshmallow is placed in front of a child. The child is told that the experimenter will leave the room and that the child will get two marshmallows if they or they simply avoid eating the marshmallow while the experimenter is out. The children in these studies go through all kinds of gyrations to keep themselves from eating that one marshmallow.
Adults also have a lot of trouble delaying gratification: People pay extra to get faster delivery from online stores. And they accept small rewards in the present rather than waiting for longer rewards in the future.
A lot of psychological research has focused on what is called intertemporal . Basically, people are given the option of a small reward in a short period of time (the Smaller Sooner option) or a large reward in a longer period of time (the Larger Later option). When the options are money, people often require a lot more money to wait an extra period of time.
Is there a way to help people choose the Larger Later option? A paper in the July, 2013 issue of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes explored this issue. Researchers asked whether making people wait before they made a choice would actually make them more patient. In one study, participants chose between a Smaller Sooner option of $50 and a Larger Later option of $55. The time interval between the options was 20 days. (Not all participants would actually get the prize—they were being entered into a drawing for the prize they chose.)
For one group, the choice was made for the near future: They would get the sooner option in 3 days or the later option in 23 days. This group chose the Smaller Sooner option about 70% of the time. So they were not very patient.
For a second group, both options were later: One was in 30 days, the other in 50 days. This group was a bit more patient, selecting the Smaller Sooner option only about 45% of the time.
The authors reasoned that if people were forced to wait in order to even make the choice, though, that might make them more patient. So, a third group was informed that they had a choice between $50 in 30 days or $55 in 50 days, but that they would not actually be asked to select which option they wanted for another 27 days. This condition had elements of both of the previous choices. In some ways, it is like the 30-vs.-50-day choice, because that is when participants will actually get the prize. In other ways, it is like the 3-vs.-23-day choice—because when they actually select the Smaller Sooner option, it would be awarded in just 3 days.
Interestingly, participants were very patient in this situation: They selected the Smaller Sooner option only about 15% of the time.
Why does this happen? Another study suggests that a waiting period increases people's perception of the value of an option, so that the Larger Later option is more valuable to people when they have to wait to make a choice. In this study, participants were selecting between two models of iPods that would be given away in a drawing. The iPod being given away as the Smaller Sooner option had fewer features than the one being given away in the Larger Later option. Participants made choices between intervals that were 25 days apart. As in the previous study, some participants got a short-interval choice in which the Smaller Sooner option would be delivered in two days. A second group got a long-interval choice in which the Smaller Sooner option would be delivered in 15 days. A third group was told they would wait 13 days to make their choice and then chose between getting the Smaller Sooner option in 2 days or the Larger Later option in 27 days. As before, the group that had to wait before making their choices was the most patient.
After making their choice, though, participants rated how valuable the iPod was to them and how important it was for them to win it. Participants who had waited rated the iPods as most valuable, and wanted them the most. The wait made people value the best iPod the most, which made them most willing to wait an extra period of time.
One other study demonstrated that waiting did not actually make people more patient overall. In this study, participants were offered prizes consisting of a selection of Godiva chocolates. In this case, participants were asked how long it had been since they had last had chocolates. The amount of time since they last had chocolates was the “waiting time” in this study.
One group was given a choice between a Smaller Sooner option and a Larger Later option that were 42 days apart. This group showed the same effect as before: The longer it had been since people had chocolates, the longer they were willing to wait for the Larger Later option.
However, a second group got a slightly different set of choices: This group was given a choice between getting a large assortment of chocolate in 48 days or paying $3 to get that same assortment in 6 days. If the wait made people more patient, those who waited should be less willing to pay $3 to get the chocolates sooner than those who had not waited that long. In fact, the opposite was the case: The longer it had been since people last had chocolates, the more that they were willing to pay $3 to get the assortment sooner.
Putting this all together, then, if you need to help yourself wait for a larger option in the future, it is helpful to wait as long as possible to make the decision between the options. The waiting period does not make you more patient, but it does increase your sense of the value of the distant option. That can help you choose that larger option.
Charlotte Atkins Lucas and Forrest Lucas are the multi-millionaire founders of Lucas Oil, the company that owns naming rights to the stadium in which the Indianapolis Colts play.
Yesterday, Charlotte Lucas posted this rant on their Facebook page:
I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that atheists (minority), muslims (minority)n or any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can't fight back for what is right or wrong with this country?
A few quick thoughts:
1) Since when do atheists run this country? If only that were true…
2) Since when do atheists tell everyone else what to do? If she's referring to church/state separation battles, atheists are the ones pointing out what the Constitution says. We're fighting for neutrality, not special treatment.
3) Since where does the majority not fight back? Christians are still pretty dominant in the U.S. and there are plenty of conservative legal defense groups, not to mention a government that seems to bend over backwards to accommodate religious beliefs in the law.
“I was very upset when I wrote that,” they said. “I will not elaborate other than to say that there are certain people who are trying to make the whole world eat what they want to eat and do what they want to do. I don't think it's any of their business what I put in my mouth. Thank you.”
The post and their Facebook page appear to have been deleted since yesterday, though they confirmed to a local news station that they made the statement:
It sounds like she's referring to Michelle Obama‘s “Let's Move!” campaign because, as we all know, it's super-oppressive when the First Lady (a minority!) tells people to eat healthy… (Give their two statements, it also sounds like she's referring to the Obamas as Muslims, more evidence of their blissful ignorance.)
But point taken: C'mon, atheists and Muslims. We need to stop holding back the rich white lady and let them eat whatever they want. We've had it too good for too long.
Man, how great it must be to be so wealthy that you can afford to be this oblivious to the world around you…

A group of residents in a southeasterly swath of the Mission District took cans of spray paint to a cluster of Vice Media billboards Thursday to deface advertisements they found offensive.
Among the offending ads is an image of a man castrating a lamb with their teeth, an image of a child with the caption “Right now on TV, 8-year-olds are getting stoned,” and a photo of four shirtless men captioned “Right now on TV, Thomas is getting in touch with bears.”
Cynthia Lasden, a teacher who lives near one of the billboards with their nine-year-old daughter, said the ads struck them as crossing a line and inappropriate for children.
The reference to eight-year-olds getting high, they said, normalizes underage drug use. The naked men and the use of the word “bear” to them connote a level of sexualization that she'd rather not encounter on the street. And the lamb being castrated… “What's not offensive about that one?” they said.
The ads promote a new TV channel from Vice called Viceland. The channel is geared towards younger audiences and will host shows like “Action Bronson & Friends Watch Ancient Aliens” and a nightly newscast.
Viceland's press representative did not return a request for comment by press time.
Lasden said they talk to their daughter about difficult subjects, and as a teacher, she's happy to educate. But they want to have control over when and how the topics come up.
“She knows about marijuana, it's not a surprise,” they said. “I don't have any problem talking about these issues with my kid but I want to choose when.”
In response, they called together a group of like-minded neighbors to protest the ads by defacing them. They and a few others used spray cans to obscure the objectionable parts of the ads — they replaced the word “stoned” with “library cards” so the text would read “eight year olds are getting library cards” and completely obliterated the lamb genitalia and bare chests of men.
“Eight-year-olds are getting stoned? That's an abuse situation, that's not advertising,” said Nancy Ivison. “It crosses too many lines all at once in a neighborhood full of children.”
In one case they obscured the word “touch,” crossed out the word “bears” and wrote “chipmunks” instead. In another case the word “bears” was replaced with “neighborhood activists.” Below the ad someone added “#stopewwgross” with an arrow pointing to “Viceland.”
“Make them into real bears,” one ad-vandal said. The men now sport ears.
Between targets, Debbie Gish suggested they tone down the satire.
“Instead of, ‘Oh, we're gonna ridicule you back,' maybe we should just have statements of fact,” they suggested. “Children live here.”
Lasden and another ad defacer, 15-year-old Julian Kleppe, said the disgust at the content of the ad had nothing to do with a distaste for the sexual orientation of the subjects, but rather what they found to be the exploitative nature of the imagery.
“I feel like they're objectifying the bear community to generate attention,” Kleppe said.
Even among those who agreed the ads were offensive, there were differences of mind.
Lloyd T. Ellcessor said they simply stumbled upon the action and joined in because he, too disapproved of the ads — both as a father of young children, six and eight years old, and as someone who had their own first experience with marijuana at eight years old. Adrift at the moment and staying on a friend's couch, Ellcessor is now also devoutly religious.
“The feeling of being next to God is better than any drug any man could ever make,” they said.
They added “WWJD” to one of the ads. Later, while others in the group simply deleted the “castrating” in the phrase “Thomas is castrating a lamb,” Ellcessor tried to add “of satan,” turning the phrase into “Thomas is a lamb of satan.” The other neighbors quickly intervened, saying they didn't want to be associated with that kind of message — but once they left, Ellcessor added it back in, and “of satan” remains scrawled in yellow paint on one of the billboards.
Local businesses where the billboards are located are staying out of it, though some have been contacted by the frustrated residents. Workers there declined to comment, saying only that they do not have direct dealings with advertisers and their businesses are separate from the billboard business.
Two passersby stopped to inquire what was going on as the group went from ad to ad. One said while they understood why the residents took offense, they didn't see the graffiti-censorship as particularly effective. Another was thrilled, and said the ads had bothered them too.
Update: Cynthia Lasden, the teacher who said the ads were inappropriate, said all four billboard locations were being plastered over with new ads. They said a worker changing the posters said their boss had decided to switch out the ads after the controversy.
US Senator Scott Brown today criticized the state's welfare department for sending voting registration forms to 478,000 people on public assistance, saying the mass mailing was a ploy to boost the ranks of Democratic voters and benefit rival Elizabeth Warren's campaign.
The state's Department of Transitional Assistance last month sent registration forms, along with prepaid return envelopes, as part of a settlement over a lawsuit accusing the Patrick administration of violating the federal “motor voter'' law.
It requires states to provide voter registration at motor vehicle and public assistance offices.
The suit was filed in May by a number of voting rights groups, including Demos, a left-leaning group based in New York whose board is chaired by Warren's daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.

Voting rights groups have sued a number of states for failing to comply with the motor votor law, most recently Pennsylvania. Cases have been settled in New Mexico, Indiana, and Georgia.
The state denied that the mailings were politically motivated, but Brown's campaign said they were “clearly designed'' to benefit Warren's campaign. The Harvard Law School professor is challenging Brown as they seek reelection to the seat they won for the Republicans in a January 2010 special election.
“I want every legal vote to count, but it's outrageous to use taxpayer dollars to register welfare recipients as part of a special effort to boost one political party over another,'' the senator said in a statement. “This effort to sign up welfare recipients is being aided by Elizabeth Warren's daughter and it's clearly designed to benefit their mother's political campaign.''
The state spent $276,000 on the mailings, which the Boston Herald reported in today's edition.
Warren's campaign dismissed Brown's accusations.
“For Brown to claim this is some kind of plot against them is just bizarre,'' said campaign manager Mindy Myers, adding that the attack on Warren's daughter was “ridiculous.
“His entire attack is built on efforts in multiple states to enforce a law passed almost 20 years ago with bipartisan support. Even the Bush Justice Department filed suit to enforce this provision of that law,'' said Myers.

Daniel Curley, commissioner of the state's transitional assistance department, said the mailings had nothing to do with partisan politics.
“We're responding to a court decision,'' they said.
The report below is based on research published in the journal Addiction. It appears there under the title The origin of MDMA (ecstasy) revisited: the true story reconstructed from the original documents. It is by Roland W Freudenmann, Florian Öxler and Sabine Bernschneider-Reif.
Sorted. More than two decades after the dance drug ecstasy burst on to the scene, chemists have finally pieced together the true story of the origins of one the most influential and controversial substances ever to come from a test tube.
According to popular history the drug, first discovered in 1912, was developed by the German pharmaceutical giant Merck as a lucrative way to suppress the appetites of soldiers in the German army - a plot foiled by reports of bizarre side effects among the first human guinea pigs. Merck, the story goes, was forced to withdraw the compound and consigned it to the pharmaceutical scrap heap, where it lay until resurrected by 1970s drug guru Alexander Shulgin.
This version of events appears regularly in medical reports, newspaper articles, textbooks and even on the official website of the US drug enforcement administration. But Merck has decided to set the record straight.
In an unusual step, the company got experts from its corporate history department and a local doctor to trawl through thousands of original documents in its archive at its headquarters in Darmstad.
For more than a year, they searched for references to ecstasy in laboratory journals, annual reports, patents, letters, interview records, memoirs and the other historical detritus thrown up by six decades of scientific research from 1900 to 1960.
Their verdict? The company did develop the drug in 1912, but the appetite suppressant story is an urban myth, passed on from source to source through "uncritical copy-paste procedures". Instead, documents from the time show that ecstasy emerged during the company's efforts to develop a potentially life-saving medicine that would help blood to clot.
The best available blood clot medicine at the time, hydrastinin, was patented by Merck's local rival Bayer. Merck chemists believed that a similar compound called methylhydrastinin would be equally effective and set about trying to make it from scratch in a way not covered by the Bayer patent. Ecstasy, also known as MDMA, was first produced during these experiments, but attracted little attention. Merck's recent search found just a passing reference to the drug: in a patent the company filed in 1912 to protect its new blood clot agent, which had been tested on patients in a Berlin hospital. Patent 274350 did not refer to MDMA by name, but described its properties among a list of other new intermediates: "colourless oil, boiling point 155C at 20mm pressure, its salt forms white crystals".
Tellingly, there were no references to any experiments to test the biological effects of ecstasy, then known as methylsafrylamin. As the official report of Merck's historical detectives puts it: "In clear contrast to what is usually claimed by the 'ecstasy' literature, MDMA was neither studied in animals nor humans at Merck around 1912."
This is not the first time that the appetite suppressant pill story has been exposed as false - Dr Shulgin and others have published more accurate accounts - but Merck hopes its rewriting of history will put the myth to bed. The false story probably started, the company says, because a US laboratory studied a similar compound called MDA as a possible diet drug between 1949 and 1957.
No one from Merck's corporate history department would comment, but a spokesperson said the company had decided to act because it was regularly asked about its role in ecstasy's development. Its report appears this month in the journal Addiction.
What happened next? The Merck archive reveals that the company revived its interest in ecstasy in 1927, when the first tests were carried out on animals. The details have been lost, but it seems that a chemist called Max Oberlin had stumbled on the original patent and thought MDMA might mimic adrenaline because it had a similar structure.
Oberlin described the results of their tests as "partly remarkable" but the research was halted because of steep rises in the price of chemicals needed to make the drug. They recommended the company "keep an eye on this field". Further Merck tests in 1952 showed that the compound was toxic to flies. More controversial is the first testing on humans. The US air force is known to have carried out secret tests of MDMA and other drugs in the early 1950s. The experiments are often described as a search for a truth serum, but were carried out on animals, and it is more likely the military was searching for new chemical weapons.
The Merck archive suggests one of its scientists may have administered the first human tests in 1959. Wolfgang Fruhstorfer, a company chemist, was interested in the production of new stimulants and the report found "insinuations" that they had cooperated with an institute for aviation medicine. But it says: "Despite all efforts, it remains unclear whether they also investigated MDMA effects in humans."
By now, others had picked up the baton and run with it. A year later, in 1960, the first official recipe for ecstasy appeared in a scientific journal (in Polish) and by 1970 MDMA was cropping up in tablets seized in Chicago.
Dr Shulgin, a former scientist with the chemical company Dow, says they were told about the compound in the early 1970s. They synthesised the drug in 1976 and later tested it on themselves - the first recorded human trials. Their enthusiasm for the effects brought the drug to mainstream attention, for which they are often called the "godfather" of ecstasy. But the new Merck report reveals the drug's true heritage.
Buried in the archive, the Merck team found the original laboratory annual report for 1912, which describes the first synthesis, and names the scientists involved. The true father of ecstasy, the Guardian can reveal, was an anonymous German chemist called Anton Kollisch, who died in 1916 with no idea of the impact their legacy would have.

ISIS has proved to be doubly inconvenient for the left and its media backers like the New York Times. Its rapid rise after President Obama called it “the jayvee” was enormously embarrassing (not to mention devastating for the Iraq and parts of Syria, and deleterious to the West). Now, its crushing defeat adds to the left's embarrassment because it comes, in part, at the hands of America under President Trump.
The mainstream media has tried to mitigate the embarrassment of ISIS' defeat by ignoring it. Ross Douthat is among those who have noticed.
Writing in the New York Times, Douthat explores this “press failure.” They call it “a case where the media is not adequately reporting an important success because it does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested.”
Exactly.
Douthat notes that it's in the realm of foreign policy where many, including Douthat himself, anticipated a “Trumpian disaster.” They concede it hasn't happened:
[F]or now, the Trump administration's approach to the Middle East has been moderately successful, and indeed close to what I would have hoped for from a normal Republican president following a realist-internationalist course.
Moreover:
[T]he Trump strategy on Israel and the Palestinians, the butt of many Jared Kushner jokes, seems … not crazy? The relatively mild reaction to recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital may be a case study in expert consensus falling behind the facts; the Arab world has different concerns than it did in 1995, and Trump's move has helped clarify that change. . . . The truth is that the specific two-state vision of the late 1990s was overtaken by events a while ago, and demonstrating that some Arab states are more amenable to accommodating Israel is a useful step toward diplomatic clarity.
The biggest success so far, though, is the defeat of ISIS. As Douthat says, it was accomplished “without massive infusions of ground troops, without accidentally getting into a war with Russia, and without inspiring a huge wave of terrorism in the West.”
In a future column, perhaps Douthat will tell us whether they think President Trump's domestic policy is close to what they would have hoped for from a normal conservative Republican president. And if not, how it differs.
Episode One: Gore Beats Bush
Florida, November, 2000. In our present reality, Circuit Court Judge Sanders Sauls, chosen by random selection for the case, halts the South Florida ballot counting.  They are overturned and admonished by the Florida Supreme Court, but by then there isn't time for enough ballots to be recounted before the U.S. Supreme Court quashes the recount and Gore concedes the presidency.
But here's what could have happened:
Florida, November, 2000. Judge Sauls did not happen to be chosen for the case. Instead, Judge Terry Lewis was selected. Judge Lewis allowed the recount to go forward and Al Gore ended up with several hundred more votes than George Bush by the time the U.S. Supreme Court would issue a ruling to stop the recount.
President Gore incorporates much of President Clinton's national security infrastructure. The September 11th attacks are thwarted due to the combination of better competency than the Bush team and the lack of collusion by Dick Cheney. The U.S. does not invade Iraq or Afghanistan. Thousands of American lives that would have been lost are not. Nearly one and one half million Iraqis who would have died did not. However, the U.S. continues the strict sanctions against Iraq, causing the deaths of millions of different Iraqis, mostly children.
Al Gore promotes the fight against global warming from the White House. However, they never produced the film An Inconvenient Truth, so the truth seems even less convenient to the public. There is also such bitter Republican resentment against their presidency that their attempts to save the climate are unsuccessful.
However, the child of an American National Guard soldier who would have not been born in the old reality meets the child of an Iraqi who also would not have otherwise been born. They fall in love and grow up to be brilliant engineers who find a solution to our energy needs and a way to clean up the planet that bypasses resistance from entrenched interests. It involves bionic sea kelp.
Gore continues Clinton's economic policies, avoiding the Great Recession. Americans become fairly complacent. They are not so interested in “change.” Barack Obama is not elected President, but neither is Joe Lieberman whom Americans find annoying in any reality. Instead, John McCain, sensing the apparent inevitability of a continuation of Democratic dominance in Presidential politics, switches parties and runs for President. However, their running mate, John Edwards, who looked so promising at first, turns out to have been a bad pick. McCain loses to Jeb Bush.

Last night, Indiana improved to 9-0 on the season with a 100-69 victory over Central Connecticut State.
Cody Zeller led the way statistically with a goodness-gracious double-double of 19 points and 19 rebounds. But Victor Oladipo led the way in highlights, busting out a number of memorable dunks (and filling the stat sheet in their own right).
It was a dominant performance by the #1 team in America.
Unfortunately, the game also featured some bad news. Austin Etherington suffered a knee injury and will be out for the season.  They are expected to make a full recovery.

WASHINGTON -- What would make House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) support a Senate-passed bill to restore long-term unemployment insurance to more than 2 million Americans? Ask the White House.
It's no secret that Boehner opposes Senate legislation reauthorizing long-term unemployment benefits, as they have previously stated that the bill is "unworkable." But when asked on Thursday whether they would heed calls from the bill's Republican co-sponsors to take up the measure in the House, Boehner said that the next steps were up to Obama.
"Listen, I made clear to the president last December that if they wanted us to consider an extension of emergency unemployment benefits, it would have to be paid for and it would have to include things that would help get our economy going," Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. "They have not put forward anything with regard to how we would create more jobs. And so the ball's still in their court."
Pressed further on what specific jobs provisions they would like to see, Boehner again punted to the White House.
"You'll have to ask the administration," they said. "I made it clear what it would take for me to consider it. They've not had any suggestions."
The White House did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.
The Congressional Budget Office says federal unemployment extensions boost the economy and create jobs, since unemployed people tend to spend their benefits immediately, but Boehner has tended to ignore the CBO's analysis on this. It's not entirely clear what the House GOP would like to see in the bill, though Senate Republicans had sought to amend the Senate-passed bill with a measure that included approving the Keystone pipeline, blocking new environmental regulations and giving tax breaks to businesses.
House Republicans have reportedly been weighing their own legislation that would tie the extension of unemployment benefits to job creation and the extension of tax breaks. Boehner spokesperson Michael Steel acknowledged that the House GOP had not coalesced around any one proposal.
"A lot of members have proposals on economic growth and jobs provisions," Steel said in an email. "No decisions have been made at this point on how we'll proceed."
It's unlikely that the House will address the issue until Congress returns from its two-week Easter recess on April 28. If the House changed the Senate bill, the Senate would have to vote on it again. Lawmakers are set to leave town on Thursday.
Congress let federal benefits for the long-term jobless expire in December, immediately cutting off 1.3 million people who'd been out of work for six months or longer. Each week since then, another 70,000 workers who used up their state-funded benefits would have been eligible for federal compensation, bringing the total missing out to almost 3 million.
After months of haggling, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill on Monday to reauthorize the benefits through May. The five Republicans who helped craft the bill made sure that it wouldn't increase the deficit and that it included reforms to the unemployment insurance system -- two things Boehner said they wanted in the bill.
While the benefits would expire again in less than two months, everyone who has missed checks since December would receive retroactive lump-sum payments. For some, that would mean catching up on bills, while for others, it would be too late.
"If I don't land a job this week or the unemployment bill doesn't pass, I'm going to have to move out of my apartment," Vincent Oviedo told HuffPost this week. The 44-year-old facilities manager said they lost their job last June and has had interviews but no offers.

A car piloted by an 83-year-old driver plowed into a jewelry store on Brand Boulevard Wednesday after they reportedly drove forward, rather than putting the vehicle into reverse as they intended, according to their statement to police.
The driver, who wasn't immediately identified, reportedly accelerated their 2012 Honda Accord into Arka Bijouterie in the 300 block of North Brand Boulevard at 12:31 p.m., knocking down a city light pole and traveling 50 feet into the store, according to Glendale police.
Their passenger complained of pain and was transported to a local hospital to be treated for minor injuries, according to Glendale Fire Department spokesperson Brandy Villanueva.
The driver and a bystander were evaluated by paramedics but did not require transport to a hospital, they added.
"We were very fortunate, considering where it happened and the time of day," Glendale Police Sgt. Tom Lorenz said.
The last time a Glendale driver crashed into a building, a 55-year-old man was killed and minor injuries were sustained by four bystanders.
In March, a car driven by 71-year-old Wanda Wong slammed into Oledina's Cake Factory in the 1100 block of East Broadway, killing Glendale resident Stepan Vardanyan, who was waiting for a cup of coffee at a counter inside the shop.
Investigators are still looking into the crash, but it appears Wong suffered a seizure and lost control of their Lexus, they said.
And on Feb. 15, a car driven by an 86-year-old woman crashed into a Starbucks in the 1700 block of West Glenoaks Boulevard after the driver stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake, police said.
A customer who was sitting in the shop's patio area had to jump out of the way of the Dodge Stratus to avoid being hit, police said. They and another bystander who tried to help the driver reportedly suffered small cuts on their heads.
Wednesday's incident comes on the heels of a fatal collision on Saturday on Doran Street in which 88-year-old Balasan Mirzabegianliwasgan was struck by a motorist after they stepped out from between two parked vehicles, police said.
They were hit by a car driven by a 26-year-old Glendale man as they were reportedly crossing in the middle of the street. Police said the motorist was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The series of recent collisions follow a report released in August that rated Glendale as having some of the worst drivers nationwide. Glendale ranked 190 out of 194 among the country's largest cities in Allstate Insurance's annual "America's Best Drivers" report. Glendale drivers ranked last among California cities.
While the report was based on collision claims filed by Allstate customers, the insurance company says the report provides a "realistic snapshot" of U.S. roadways because the company represents 10% of the country's auto insurance policies.
Glendale Police officials have said the department has increased its public education and enforcement efforts to deal with the city's traffic issues.
Over the past few days, Reddit moderators have taken parts of the website dark in protest of Pao's firing of a beloved employee.
SAN FRANCISCO — In one of the first public tests of their leadership of the often volatile Internet discussion site Reddit, Ellen Pao finds themselves in the eye of the storm.
Over the past few days, Reddit moderators — volunteers who manage discussions on the website that range from harmless banter to intellectual debate to depraved topics — have taken parts of the website dark to protest Pao's firing of a beloved employee.
Swaths of the Reddit community that already had Pao in their crosshairs lashed out at them in even harsher terms. And an online petition calling for Pao's removal had more than 200,000 supporters as of Tuesday.
The blowback, some experts said, is the result of Pao's poor communication with the Reddit community and their tendency to stay quiet, even secretive, about business decisions — not the type of management an Internet forum with more than 3 million users requires.
“She's never managed people before,” said Larry Chiagouris, professor of marketing at Pace University in New York. “The decisions they are making, they are not taking into consideration the interest of the (Reddit) community and they are not communicating with them in a way that makes them feel they are part of the community. Some of them are rebelling now and that may be their own doing.”
The Reddit revolt also suggests how Pao's discrimination lawsuit against venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has tainted the Reddit community's image of them and may make their job more difficult.
The online petition to remove Pao says: “A vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, ‘a manipulative individual who will sue their way to the top,' has overstepped their boundaries and fears that they will run Reddit into the ground.”
Pao sued Kleiner Perkins for alleged sex discrimination and retaliation in May 2012; five months later they were fired. Pao lost the high-stakes trial in March after five weeks of testimony that many critics said distracted them from their duties at Reddit, where they became interim CEO in November.
Pao did apologize after the Reddit uproar, both Friday, in an interview with The New York Times, and in a Reddit post Monday:
“We screwed up,” Pao wrote. “Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven't communicated well, and we have surprised moderators and the community with big changes. … The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.”
Pao promised better communication and improved tools for moderators.
The protests began shortly after Victoria Taylor, Reddit's director of talent, was dismissed Thursday without explanation. Taylor ran the highly popular Ask Me Anything feeds, or question-and-answer sessions with celebrities and public leaders. They were also considered by the Reddit community to be one of the employees who supported and communicated regularly with the volunteer moderators.
Pao's failure to alert the Reddit community to this change, and to effectively communicate and enforce new policies to eliminate harassment and hate speech, clash with the needs of a community Internet platform, say some industry experts.
Gina Bianchini, an expert in Internet community platforms, said, “You can't lead playing things close to the vest.”
PROVIDENCE, R.I. � A 36-year veteran Providence police officer is accused of stealing jewelry from the Police Department�s evidence room.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. � A 36-year veteran Providence police officer is accused of stealing jewelry from the Police Department�s evidence room.
Patrolman Michael McCarthy, who has been assigned to the property room for several years, was charged by the Providence police Thursday with fraudulent conversion, a felony.
McCarthy was arraigned at District Court, where they entered no plea, and released on $5,000 personal recognizance.�He is also suspended without pay from the department.
�He violated the public�s trust,� said Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare. �This officer was assigned to a very sensitive function � and we�re not going to tolerate that behavior.�
The discovery of the theft � and McCarthy�s access to the evidence and property room � has launched an audit of the numerous items held at the department, some going back many years.
The commissioner and the police chief said they don�t believe any current criminal cases are affected. However, only an extensive audit can tell. McCarthy didn�t have access to drugs seized by the department, but they did have access to jewelry, cash, firearms and other items.
The internal affairs investigation is ongoing and more charges are expected, Pare said.
The value of the missing jewelry, which had been recovered from a theft, wasn�t immediately known. The piece had been sitting in a secured cabinet for a long time as the police sought its owner, the police chief said. They found the rightful owner � and then realized the piece was gone.
That launched the investigation a week and a half ago. The sergeant in charge of the property and evidence room alerted a supervisor, launching an audit and investigation by the police department�s Office of Professional Responsibility.
McCarthy was one of two people with access to that secured area, Pare said, which holds jewelry and cash.�The investigators determined that McCarthy was responsible for the missing jewelry.
Providence police obtained a search warrant Wednesday for McCarthy�s home in Warwick; the commissioner declined comment on anything seized during the search.
The investigation will prompt changes in how property is released from the department, said Chief Hugh T. Clements. In the past, just one officer was needed to sign off on releasing property. Now, they said, he�d like to see two officers and a supervisor sign off before any property leaves police custody.
McCarthy�s arrest shocked those who know them at the Police Department, including its chief. �This was McCarthy�s first and only offense in their long career, Clements said.
�Why do people risk their livelihood, their career, their pension, their reputation? I don�t know,� Clements said

Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the Republic of the Gambia, addresses the 69th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. headquarters in New York September 25, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson
DAKAR (Reuters) - Gambia's foreign minister said the West African country would sever all dialogue with the European Union and rejected what they said were attempts by the bloc to use its aid budget to force Gambia to revoke a tough new law against homosexuality.
Foreign Minister Bala Garba Jahumpa said that President Yahya Jammeh - a former military officer who seized power in a 1994 coup - would not allow foreign nations to use aid to impose policies on their government.
Jammeh signed legislation last month that introduced the crime of 'aggravated homosexuality', making it punishable in some cases with life in prison. The definition covers cases such as homosexual relations with someone under the age of 18, or a person with HIV having homosexual sex.
The crackdown comes as the European Union is due to decide in December whether to release 150 million euros ($186 million) worth of development aid to the Gambia, a matter that has been up for debate because of its poor human rights record.
"Gambia's government will not tolerate any negotiation on the issue of homosexuality with the EU or any international block or nation," Jahumpa told state television.
"We are no longer going to entertain any dialogue with the EU either directly or through sub-regional, regional and international blocks to which we are members."
Jahumpa said homosexuality was 'ungodly' and against African tradition, and said Gambia would work with other countries on the continent to oppose it.
Disapproval of homosexuality is widespread across most of socially conservative sub-Saharan Africa.
Lawmakers in Uganda have said they will pass a revised anti-gay law by Christmas that will punish gay sex with long prison terms, after an earlier version was quashed because of legal technicalities.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, has said Gambia's new law violates fundamental human rights and has called for its repeal. Rights watchdog Amnesty International says more than a dozen people have already been arrested under the law.
In a heated statement, Jahumpa accused European governments of allowing thousands of African migrants to die attempting to reach the bloc, dubbing it a 'racist genocide'.
They said Gambia would not participate in the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) to open up West African economies to free trade with the European Union.
"The Gambia will never be a party to the so-called Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union as it is designed to continue the same exploitation and impoverishment of the African continent," they said.
"We will rather die then be colonized twice."

History Edit
Umayyad administration Edit
The first four caliphs created a stable administration for the empire, following the practices and administrative institutions of the Byzantine Empire which had ruled the same region previously.[53] These consisted of four main governmental branches: political affairs, military affairs, tax collection, and religious administration. Each of these was further subdivided into more branches, offices, and departments. Provinces Edit Geographically, the empire was divided into several provinces, the borders of which changed numerous times during the Umayyad reign. Each province had a governor appointed by the caliph. The governor was in charge of the religious officials, army leaders, police, and civil administrators in their province. Local expenses were paid for by taxes coming from that province, with the remainder each year being sent to the central government in Damascus. As the central power of the Umayyad rulers waned in the later years of the dynasty, some governors neglected to send the extra tax revenue to Damascus and created great personal fortunes.[54] Government workers Edit As the empire grew, the number of qualified Arab workers was too small to keep up with the rapid expansion of the empire. Therefore, Muawiya allowed many of the local government workers in conquered provinces to keep their jobs under the new Umayyad government. Thus, much of the local government's work was recorded in Greek, Coptic, and Persian. It was only during the reign of Abd al-Malik that government work began to be regularly recorded in Arabic.[54] Currency Edit Coin of the Umayyad Caliphate, based on a Byzantine prototype, 695 coin weight from the Umayyad Dynasty, dated 743, made of glass. One of the oldest Islamic objects in an American museum, the Walters Art Museum The Byzantine and Sassanid Empires relied on money economies before the Muslim conquest, and that system remained in effect during the Umayyad period. Byzantine copper coins were used until 658, while Byzantine gold coins were still in use until the monetary reforms c.700.[55] In addition to this, the Umayyad government began to mint its own coins in Damascus, these were initially similar to pre-existing coins but evolved in an independent direction. These were the first coins minted by a Muslim government in history. Gold coins were called dinars while silver coins were called dirhams.[54] Central diwans Edit To assist the Caliph in administration there were six Boards at the Centre: Diwan al-Kharaj (the Board of Revenue), Diwan al-Rasa'il (the Board of Correspondence), Diwan al-Khatam (the Board of Signet), Diwan al-Barid (the Board of Posts), Diwan al-Qudat (the Board of Justice) and Diwan al-Jund (the Military Board) Diwan al-Kharaj Edit The Central Board of Revenue administered the entire finances of the empire. It also imposed and collected taxes and disbursed revenue. Diwan al-Rasa'il Edit A regular Board of Correspondence was established under the Umayyads. It issued state missives and circulars to the Central and Provincial Officers. It co-ordinated the work of all Boards and dealt with all correspondence as the chief secretariat. Diwan al-Khatam Edit In order to check forgery, Diwan al-Khatam (Bureau of Registry), a kind of state chancellery, was instituted by Mu'awiyah. It used to make and preserve a copy of each official document before sealing and despatching the original to its destination. Thus in the course of time a state archive developed in Damascus by the Umayyads under Abd al-Malik. This department survived till the middle of the Abbasid period. Diwan al-Barid Edit Main article: Barid (caliphate) Mu'awiyah introduced postal service, Abd al-Malik extended it throughout their empire, and Walid made full use of it. The Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik developed a regular postal service. Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and their agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles (19 km) each and each stage had horses, donkeys or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time. Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar, the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year. Diwan al-Qudat Edit [citation needed] In the early period of Islam, justice was administered by Muhammad and the orthodox Caliphs in person. After the expansion of the Islamic State, Umar al-Faruq had to separate judiciary from the general administration and appointed the first qadi in Egypt as early as AD 643/23 AH. After 661, a series of judges succeeded one after another in Egypt under the Umayyad Caliphs, Hisham and Walid II. Diwan al-Jund Edit The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle. On the pattern of the Byzantine system the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on March or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body. The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles. The artillery used arradah (ballista), manjaniq (the mangonel) and dabbabah or kabsh (the battering ram). The heavy engines, siege machines and baggage were carried on camels behind the army.
Social organization Edit
[56] Ivory (circa 8th century) discovered in the Abbasid homestead in Humeima, Jordan . The style indicates an origin in northeastern Iran , the base of Hashimiyya military power. The Umayyad Caliphate exhibited four main social classes: Muslim Arabs Muslim non-Arabs (clients of the Muslim Arabs) Dhimmis, non-Muslim free persons (Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others) Slaves The Muslim Arabs were at the top of the society and saw it as their duty to rule over the conquered areas. Despite the fact that Islam teaches the equality of all Muslims, the Arab Muslims held themselves in higher esteem than Muslim non-Arabs and generally did not mix with other Muslims. The inequality of Muslims in the empire led to social unrest. As Islam spread, more and more of the Muslim population was constituted of non-Arabs. This caused tension as the new converts were not given the same rights as Muslim Arabs. Also, as conversions increased, tax revenues from non-Muslims decreased to dangerous lows. These issues continued to grow until they helped cause the Abbasid Revolt in the 740s.[57] Non-Muslims Edit Non-Muslim groups in the Umayyad Caliphate, which included Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and pagan Berbers, were called dhimmis. They were given a legally protected status as second-class citizens as long as they accepted and acknowledged the political supremacy of the ruling Muslims, i.e. paid a tax, known as jizya, which the Muslims did not have to pay, who would instead pay the zakat tax. If they converted to Islam they would cease paying jizya and would instead pay zakat. They were allowed to have their own courts, and were given freedom of their religion within the empire.[citation needed] Although they could not hold the highest public offices in the empire, they had many bureaucratic positions within the government. Christians and Jews still continued to produce great theological thinkers within their communities, but as time wore on, many of the intellectuals converted to Islam, leading to a lack of great thinkers in the non-Muslim communities.[58]
Legacy Edit
Early literature Edit
The book Al Muwatta by Imam Malik was written in the early Abbasid period in Madina. It does not contain any anti-Umayyad content because it was more concerned with what the Quran and what Muhammad said and was not a history book on the Umayyads. Even the earliest pro-Shia accounts of al-Masudi are more balanced. al-Masudi in Ibn Hisham is the earliest Shia account of Muawiyah. They recounted that Muawiyah spent a great deal of time in prayer, in spite of the burden of managing a large empire.[88] Az-Zuhri stated that Muawiya led the Hajj Pilgrimage with the people twice during their era as caliph. Books written in the early Abbasid period like al-Baladhuri's "The Origins of the Islamic State" provide a more accurate and balanced history. Ibn Hisham also wrote about these events. Much of the anti-Umayyad literature started to appear in the later Abbasid period in Persia. After killing off most of the Umayyads and destroying the graves of the Umayyad rulers apart from Muawiyah and Umar ibn Adb al-Aziz, the history books written during the later Abbasid period are more anti-Umayyad.[89] The Abbasids justified their rule by saying that their ancestor Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib was a cousin of Muhammad. The books written later in the Abbasid period in Iran are more anti-Umayyad. Iran was Sunni at the time. There was much anti-Arab feeling in Iran after the fall of the Persian empire.[90] This anti-Arab feeling also influenced the books on Islamic history. Al-Tabri was also written in Iran during that period. Al-Tabri was a huge collection including all the texts that they could find, from all the sources. It was a collection preserving everything for future generations to codify and for future generations to judge whether the histories were true or false. Bahá'í standpoint Edit Asked for an explanation of the prophecies in the Book of Revelation (12:3), `Abdu'l-Bahá suggests in Some Answered Questions that the "great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon their heads,"[91] refers to the Umayyad caliphs who "rose against the religion of Prophet Muhammad and against the reality of Ali".[92][93] The seven heads of the dragon is symbolic of the seven provinces of the lands dominated by the Umayyads: Damascus, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Andalusia, and Transoxania. The ten horns represent the ten names of the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty; Abu Sufyan, Muawiya, Yazid, Marwan, Abd al-Malik, Walid, Sulayperson, Umar, Hisham, and Ibrahim. Some names were re-used, as in the case of Yazid II and Yazid III, which were not counted for this interpretation.

More than 60 moons are known to orbit Saturn, but few of them are as visually striking as Iapetus. Named formally after the Greek mythological Titan, Iapetus is sometimes referred to as the "painted," or "yin-yang" moon, due to puzzling variations in its surface composition.
The moon's trailing hemisphere, shown here, is so bright and reflective as to resemble snow (click here for a much, much closer look); but if you direct your gaze eastward towards the moon's leading hemisphere, you'll see a material, dark as freshly poured asphalt, start to dominate its surface.

The composition of this dark material is unknown, but infrared spectra suggest it comprises some dark form of carbon. Also unclear is how this soot-colored substance came to paint Iapetus in the first place. According to NASA:
Close inspection indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick. A leading hypothesis is that the dark material is mostly dirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice sublimates. An initial coating of dark material may have been effectively painted on by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons. This and other images from Cassini's Iapetus flyby are being studied for even greater clues.

- The best DI to get the farthest away from sheik is not straight away, instead it is down and away.
F-tilt is never a true follow up.
Not really sure how to preface this as I suck at writing.Umbreon asking me to test out certain things got me interested in this project and some others (like b-throw) that I'll be researching at later points.So here is something important that I have learned about Sheik's d-throw via testing in dolphin.here is a "side by side" comparison of marth being down throw by sheik at 100%. The first one will be marth DIing straight away and the second one will be shown to be DIing down and away. The frame that this captured is the frame before sheik becomes actionable.as these pictures show, the second marth is lower and farther out than the first marth.I'm not going to say that DIing down and away is always the "best" DI but it will force you to be farther away from sheik and closer to the ground.If players start incorporating this DI on d-throw thenThe only attack that becomes guaranteed is Dash attack. Below, I went through and tested every character (sorted by gravity) as to when Dash attack starts being a combo and when it stops comboing.

Disciplining Benjamin Netanyahu
“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it,” goes the saying. Enter Benjamin Netanyahu. It looks like Bibi is making the same mistake today that they made in their first go-round as Israel's leader.
Netanyahu was first elected as Israel's Prime Minister in 1996, in a close race against Shimon Peres, who was then with the Labor Party, and had succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as its head. It was, in fact, Hamas who elected Bibi. A wave of suicide bombings by the group was aimed at the Oslo Accords, and intended to ensure that Labor lost power.
Bibi assumed office, but presided, as they do today, over a parliament where the party which held the most seats was their opposition. They held an unstable coalition together for three years, but like the previous Likud Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, was undone by their inability to get along with the President of the United States, when their government crumbled in 1999. Shamir was handily defeated by none other than Israel's current Minister of Defense, Ehud Barak.
A signature moment in Netanyahu's relationship with the US President at the time, Bill Clinton, came during the Monica Lewinsky Scandal, which ultimately led to Clinton becoming the second US president to ever be impeached. Bibi had already been cultivating deep relationships with neoconservatives in the United States, and their reluctance to abide by Israel's commitments in the Oslo Accords created even more friction with Clinton. Israeli public unease over their inability to get along with the US made them particularly vulnerable to a series of financial scandals which eventually led to their downfall. Moderate and left-wing groups would not help prop up their government after radical right wing and religious groups left it in the wake of Netanyahu acquiescing to US demands, and agreeing to a phased withdrawal from parts of the West Bank.
This time around, Bibi has made no secret of their disdain for Barack Obama. Their animus has been a constant. Nor, in fairness, has Obama shown any great love for their Israeli counterpart. The tense relationship played out through Netanyahu's insistence on negotiations with the Palestinians “without preconditions,” which meant starting from scratch, and scrapping any progress the Palestinians had made with previous Israeli governments. Let's not forget Obama's call for a settlement freeze, and Bibi's refusal to enact any kind of meaningful one.
In recent weeks, Netanyahu has seriously upped the ante. Their open embrace of Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney made it very clear which party they were endorsing in the race for the White House. Bibi was clearly broadcasting not only a campaign message for Romney – “Look, the Prime Minister of Israel wants me in the Oval Office, so despite what you saw on my recent trip around the globe, I really do know foreign affairs” – but also to the Jewish and Christian radical zealots who back the most insane and inhumane Israeli policies with their wallets.
Such blatant interference with US politics is unprecedented and unwelcome by the Israeli public. At one time, the US Jewish community would have seen it as unseemly, potentially something that could promote anti-Semitism. However, the major Jewish institutions no longer care about the appearance of being concerned about “Israel First” and only care about anti-Semitism, when they can cynically exploit the issue to Israel's benefit, or for their own fundraising.
But it didn't stop there. Apparently being Prime Minister of Israel is not enough for Bibi; they want also to run the United States, or at least make its military decisions for it. It is, of course, perfectly reasonable for an ally to lobby or try to make a case for its superpower patron to take an action it deems vital to its national security. It's quite another to try to coerce, manipulate and blackmail to push that superpower into a military conflict that is very much against its own interests.
Yet, as no less a figure than the prominent neoconservative, Michael Ledeen tells us that is precisely what Israel was trying to do. However, even Ledeen's description falls well short of the scope of Israel's actions. Bibi and their henchman, Ehud Barak, went even farther.
Barak, as I have detailed, tried to convince the US public that American intelligence had reassessed Iran's nuclear program and now agreed with them that a threat was imminent. This was a whole new level of deception, and, although it was quickly exposed, the chicanery was met with a great deal of anger in Washington.
These acts, coupled with Netanyahu's and Barak's constant maneuvering in Israel to find a way around the military and intelligence consensus against a unilateral Israeli strike (and not a small amount of doubt that a military strike was wise or timely, even if the US was involved,) finally led to a break. Israeli President, Shimon Peres used their usually ceremonial office, coupled with their own past as a Prime Minister, to undermine Netanyahu's and Barak's efforts. Others joined him, and it now appears that an Israeli strike is, at least for now, off the table. That also relieves pressure on Obama, and makes any sort of military action before the election much less likely.
But we should look carefully at Peres' concerns. They center on the United States. Friction between Israeli Prime Ministers and US Presidents is not unusual. Dwight Eisenhower clashed with David Ben-Gurion, Jimmy Carter with Menachem Begin, George H.W. Bush with Yitzhak Shamir. But Peres clearly sensed some greater danger here to the US-Israel relationship.
Indeed, the rhetoric from the far right in recent weeks has shifted from Iran to focusing on Obama's inaction in Syria, and AIPAC has been remarkably quiet as the election nears. It has been the Israelis themselves taking the lead, and clearly the Lobby forces in the US are trying to avoid being hit by any of the fallout. One can see why.
Peres are moved enough to engage Netanyahu in a public fight. Given that a majority of their cabinet opposed going to war, and the military and intelligence leadership was united against a unilateral Israeli attack, this seems a bit of overkill. But Peres wanted to put a stop to Bibi's and Barak's shenanigans before they did any more damage to Israel's relationship with the United States. With current polls projecting a very tight election, Peres must be shuddering at Bibi's willingness to double down on a Romney victory.
It remains to be seen whether or not any sort of lasting damage has been done to Israel's standing in the US. But one thing is for certain: after all the maneuvers, the political pressure from the domestic lobby and the attempts at agitation by the Israeli leadership, the Obama Administration has stayed the course it determined a long time ago in dealing with Iran. That course itself may leave a lot to be desired, but it is at least the result of US politics, not Israeli.
This could go down as one of the greatest losses for Israeli influence on the US in the history of their relationship. Netanyahu and Barak pulled out all the stops, but utterly failed to move Obama, despite the President's generally deferential attitude toward powerful lobbying forces, most assuredly including AIPAC.
Lobbies are only as powerful as they are perceived to be. Maybe, just maybe, the perception of this one may have taken a step closer toward reality with this setback. That would be a great boon, not only to US foreign policy, not only for the Palestinians and other Arabs bearing the brunt of misguided US policies, but very much for Israel as well.

Texas' state insect faces demise, so the feds are stepping in. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday a plan to revitalize the Monarch butterfly population, which has fallen by more than 90 percent in the last two decades.
Last month, the Chronicle reported that the butterflies were being considered for a place on the endangered species list. Experts said the main culprit of the monarchs' devastating decline is the use of genetically modified, herbicide-resistant crops that allow farmers to drench fields in weed poison, prohibiting the growth of native plants the butterflies used to eat and lay eggs.
"We've been aware of the plight of the monarch butterfly in North America for some time and we have been looking at ways that we can go about reversing the situation, and I think it was decided that what we needed was really immediate on-the-ground action," said FWS spokesperson Gavin Shire.
RELATED: Feds reviewing petition to save monarch butterflies
The service pledged $3.2 million to monarch revival, most of which will fund habitat restoration projects. Texas will host 10 of 24 scheduled projects, with in more than $700 thousand in funding. The main goal: plant more milkweed.
"Milkweed is really the keystone habitat species for the monarch because it's the sole breeding plant where the monarch lays eggs. So that's crucial – without milkweed there simply aren't any other monarchs," said Shire.
The decline of milkweed has been the decline of the monarchs. A bulbous plant, milkweed can weather farmers' plows that turn it over in the soil. But the engineering of plants resistant to herbicide has allowed farmers to spray down soil with chemicals that milkweed cannot tolerate. As a result, it largely has vanished from the widely-cultivated Midwest, and the monarchs have followed.
In Texas, monarch habitat also has been lost to urban development, as native prairies turn to lawns, parking lots and roads. Many residents have seen the orange winged insects numbers fall, as their yearly migration shrinks with each pass.

The FWS will form a "Texas Native Pollinator Initiative" with hopes of gathering local partners from across the state to spread native milkweed seeds and monitor the monarch population. Other projects involve partnerships with the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department and the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.
Shire called Texas, especially the Interstate 35 corridor, a "critical breeding, wintering and migration corridor for the monarchs," which is largely why Texas will see so many of the federally-funded restoration projects.
It's also why the Texas Legislature named the butterflies the state insect in 1995. Then, a billion of the regal bugs flew through the Lone Star State on their way to Mexico each year. Twenty years later, about 30 million remain. Texas used to herald the sight of tens of thousands of butterflies nesting on a single, but it's seen less often today. However the plight of the monarchs has garnered significant attention in just the past month, and promising efforts could bring the fragile creates back from the brink of extinction.

The Cedar Waxwing is one of my favorite bird species – the adults with their sleek tan and gray Cardinal-like bodies, bright red spots on their wing tips and yellow “paint” on the tips of their tails, but best of all – their Zorro-like masks.
Chances are, you have Cedar Waxwings around at some point in the year, as they are found in most parts of the U.S. Their breeding range extends from the southern half of Canada to the northern half of the United States. In winter they range from many parts of the U.S., down through Mexico and south to Panama. Cedar Waxwings are most abundant in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region.
You can attract Cedar Waxwings to your landscape, with the right mix of native plants, providing them with cover, nesting sites and food sources. Don't forget to include a clean source of water, too.
Cedar Waxwings are frugivores (fruit-eaters) and they subsist mainly on fruit, although they do eat insects. They prefer small fleshy fruit with a high sugar content and eat these fruits whole. In the absence of native fruits, Cedar Waxwings will eat the fruit of a number of highly invasive exotic plants, such as Autumn Olive, spreading these invasives as they eliminate the seeds. Why not plant native this spring to support Cedar Waxwings and your local ecosystem?
One type of native plant is irresistible to Cedar Waxwings: Amelanchier (aka Serviceberry, Juneberry). If you plant it, they really do come. It's quite amazing! I never saw a Cedar Waxwing in my landscape until I planted two Serviceberries. How they found these plants, I haven't a clue… but they did, and they come back every year for the fruit.
Cedar Waxwings like to feast in groups, and they are not alone in loving Serviceberries – at least 35 species of birds eat the fruit, including: Mocking Birds, Robins, Catbirds, Baltimore Orioles, Grosbeaks, Thrushes and others. So, think about planting more than one plant to keep everyone happy.
An added bonus – Serviceberry fruits are edible by humans and are highly nutritious. Admittedly, some species are tastier than others – Amelanchier x grandiflora (a native hybrid) is my favorite in the Northeast – the freshly picked berries eaten on cereal, or cooked in a pie. Amelanchier alnifolia (Saskaton Serviceberry) is a particularly delicious Western species.
Serviceberries not only provide tasty fruit to many birds, but support many pollinating insects and are the larval host plants for a number of butterflies and moths including: Striped Hairstreak, California Hairstreak, White Admiral, Western Admiral (aka Weidemerer's Admiral), Two-tailed Tiger Swallowtail, Viceroy, Small-eyed Sphinx Moth and the Blinded Sphinx Moth.
If you decide to plant Serviceberries, there are approximately 20 species in the U.S. Do your research to determine the best choice(s) for your region and your local ecosystem (the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center database is a great place to start). Some species will be widely available at nurseries and garden centers, others will most easily be found at local native plant sales. Here is a sampling:
Amelanchier alnifolia (Western Serviceberry)
Amelancheir arborea (Downy Serviceberry)
Amelanchier bartramiana (Mountain Serviceberry)
Amelanchier canadensis (Shadbush)
Amelanchier x grandiflora (Apple Serviceberry)
Amelanchier humilis (Low Serviceberry)
Amelanchier laevis (Allegheny Serviceberry)
Amelanchier nantucketensis (Nantucket Serviceberry)
Amelanchier sanguinea (New England Serviceberry)
Amelanchier stolonifera (Running Serviceberry)
Amelanchier utahensis (Utah Serviceberry)

The term probably came from a literal translation of the Spanish veta madre, a term common in old Mexican mining. Veta madre, for instance, is the name given to an 11-kilometre-long (6.8 mi) silver vein discovered in 1548 in Guanajuato, New Spain (modern-day Mexico).[1][need quotation to verify]
California Mother Lode [ edit ]
In the United States, Mother Lode is most famously the name given to a long alignment of hard-rock gold deposits stretching northwest-southeast in the Sierra Nevada of California. It was discovered in the early 1850s, during the California gold rush. The California Mother Lode is a zone from 1.5 to 6 kilometres (0.93 to 3.73 mi) wide and 190 kilometres (120 mi) long, between Georgetown on the north and Mormon Bar on the south.
The Mother Lode coincides with the suture line of a terrane, the Smartville Block. The zone contains hundreds of mines and prospects, including some of the best-known historic mines of the gold-rush era. Individual gold deposits within the Mother Lode are gold-bearing quartz veins up to 15 metres (49 ft) thick and a few thousand feet long. The California Mother Lode was one of the most productive gold-producing districts in the United States. Now it is known as a destination for tourism and for its vineyards.[2]
The California gold rush, as with most gold rushes, started with the discovery of placer gold in sands and gravels of streambeds, where the gold had eroded from the hard-rock vein deposits. Placer miners followed the gold-bearing sands upstream to discover the source in the bedrock. This source was the "mother" of the gold in the river and so was dubbed the "mother lode".
In popular culture [ edit ]
Motherlode is a popular cheat code in The Sims that gives household 50.000 in game currency.
A ski lift at Park City Mountain Resort bears the name “Motherlode”.
"Mother Lode" is a legend in Megaman Legends saga, rumored to be a valuable treasure that could provide so much power that the world never need to fear of running out of energy and make the wearer rich.
Thom Yorke's second solo album “Tomorrow's Modern Boxes” from 2014 contains a song called “The Mother Lode.”

Ask anyone to tell you where a smartphone's fingerprint reader should be and, though the answers will vary, you'll never be told "off center, right next to the camera lens on the back." But lo and behold, that's exactly where Samsung plopped its fingerprint scanner on the new (and otherwise delightful) Galaxy S8. It's a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice, but reports ahead of the S8's launch, which now seem validated by the device itself, suggest that it was a last-minute alteration enforced by the slower-than-desired development of more ambitious technology.
A March 13th report out of Korea lays it all out lucidly. Samsung, working in collaboration with Synaptics, had initially hoped to build the fingerprint sensing tech directly into the screen itself. "Samsung poured resources into Synaptics' fledgling technology last year but the results were frustrating," an informed source is quoted as saying. "With the production imminent, the company had to decide to relocate the fingerprint scanning home button to the back of the device at the last minute."
I've handled the Galaxy S8 myself and noticed how much time Samsung has committed to recreating the tactile home button it's had at the front of its phones since the Galaxy S series' inception. There's localized haptic feedback at the location of the new on-screen home button on the S8, and Samsung's demo staff are fully trained up to explain the difference to uninitiated users. Even the lock screen has a "place finger to unlock" graphic that hovers immediately above the software home button's spot — which would also be the most logical place to find an integrated fingerprint reader.
It may be circumstantial supposition, but I'm far more willing to believe Samsung made a bad compromise late in the development process of its new flagship than I am to think that the company intended to have the current design all along. Samsung has gotten too good at industrial design for that to be the case.
What I'm noticing these days is that the leading hardware companies are clashing with engineering problems and limitations more often than ever before. The Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year was the result of Samsung trying to squeeze every last bit of battery that it could into its premium phone. A few months later, Apple's MacBook Pro refresh was supposed to come with a tailored battery design, which apparently didn't pan out in time and the laptop was eventually released with a more conventional battery setup. The more mature a tech category is, the harder it becomes to accomplish the next great jump forward.
As far as the Galaxy S8 is concerned, we'll have to wait until we've reviewed the new phone to decide if its fingerprint reader location is as bad as it looks at first glance. Maybe we'll all develop the alacrity to unlock our Samsung phones without always smudging up their camera lenses. Either way, we can probably look forward to seeing Samsung and Synaptics finishing off their work and releasing a phone whose all-encompassing display is capable of reading its user's fingerprint directly. Perhaps in time for the Galaxy Note 8.
Sign Language Study Shows Multiple Brain Regions Wired for Language
A new study from the University of Rochester finds that there is no single advanced area of the human brain that gives it language capabilities above and beyond those of any other animal species.
Instead, humans rely on several regions of the brain, each designed to accomplish different primitive tasks, in order to make sense of a sentence. Depending on the type of grammar used in forming a given sentence, the brain will activate a certain set of regions to process it, like a carpenter digging through a toolbox to pick a group of tools to accomplish the various basic components that comprise a complex task.
"We're using and adapting the machinery we already have in our brains," said study coauthor Aaron Newman. "Obviously we're doing something different [from other animals], because we're able to learn language unlike any other species. But it's not because some little black box evolved specially in our brain that does only language, and nothing else."
The team of brain and cognitive scientists  comprised of Newman (now at Dalhousie University after beginning the work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester), Elissa Newport (University of Rochester), Ted Supalla (University of Rochester), Daphne Bavelier (University of Rochester), and Peter Hauser (Rochester Institute of Technology) - published their findings in the latest edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.
To determine whether different brain regions were used to decipher sentences with different types of grammar, the scientists turned to American Sign Language for a rare quality it has.
Some languages (English, for example) rely on the order of words in a sentence to convey the relationships between the sentence elements. When an English speaker hears the sentence "Sally greets Bob," it's clear from the word order that Sally is the subject doing the greeting and Bob is the object being greeted, not vice versa.
Other languages (Spanish, for example) rely on inflections, such as suffixes tacked on to the ends of words, to convey subject-object relationships, and the word order can be interchangeable.
American Sign Language has the helpful characteristic that subject-object relationships can be expressed in either of the two ways  using word order or inflection. Either a signer can sign the word "Sally" followed by the words "greets" and "Bob" (a construction in which word order dictates meaning), or the signer can use physical inflections such as moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body to convey the relationship between elements. For the study, the team formed 24 sentences and expressed each of those sentences using both methods.
Videos of the sentences being signed were then played for the subjects of the experiment, native signers who were lying on their backs in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines with coils around their heads to monitor which areas of the brain were activated when processing the different types of sentences.
The study found that there are, in fact, distinct regions of the brain that are used to process the two types of sentences: those in which word order determined the relationships between the sentence elements, and those in which inflection was providing the information.
In fact, Newman said, in trying to understand different types of grammar, humans draw on regions of the brain that are designed to accomplish primitive tasks that relate to the type of sentence they are trying to interpret. For instance, a word order sentence draws on parts of the frontal cortex that give humans the ability to put information into sequences, while an inflectional sentence draws on parts of the temporal lobe that specialize in dividing information into its constituent parts, the study demonstrated.
"These results show that people really ought to think of language and the brain in a different way, in terms of how the brain capitalizes on some perhaps preexisting computational structures to interpret language," Newport said.
Aside from providing perspective on how language abilities might have evolved in humans, the scientists' findings could perhaps eventually find applications in medicine, according to Newport. For instance, it could prove valuable in assessing how best to teach language to a person with brain damage in certain areas but not others, such as a stroke victim.

On Tuesday, December 10, 1991, pop veterans George Michael and Elton John were at number one with Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.
Nine places below, at number 10, a group of scruffy Seattle blokes called Nirvana were making their name with a tune called Smells Like Teen Spirit.
That night in Newport , 8,000 miles away from Seattle, another group of dishevelled rockers were getting ready to play in a club called TJ's. They were called Hole.
Their singer, a woman named Courtney Love, could scream like a banshee. They brought their boyfriend along.
In a moment of punk rock romance they are said to have proposed to them The couple went on to become two of the most famous people on the planet.
They were Kurt Cobain. And that night has become the stuff of legend.
'I said "Mate, you have to pay to get in". They pulled their fringe to one side and I was like "Oh, s***"'

Simon Phillips, of promoters Cheap Sweaty Fun, helped organise the gig. Tickets were £4, or £4.50 on the door.
“There is quite a lot of shakily accurate stuff out there about that night,” the 63-year-old said.
“It was a Hole tour and Therapy? and Daisy Chainsaw were supporting. That night was completely the wrong way around. Daisy Chainsaw were amazing and should have headlined. Therapy? were really good as usual.
“Hole, as a musical outfit, I thought were all right but they left me mildly disappointed.”
Simon, a father-of-two and grandfather, said they “didn't know what to expect from them” but “was not entirely bowled over”.
“The band turned up to soundcheck without Courtney Love, they came in late afternoon. But Courtney Love turned up very late with Kurt.
“They were both with a guy called Russell Warby who was Hole's booking agent.
“That night they had a car crash on the Old Green Roundabout, just along from TJ's.
“I remember Russell's car being put on a low-loader, because it was a write-off. It was an old sky-blue Skoda and it was a right old mess.
“They came from London with Russell and the band came down separately.
“We had a phone call from Russell saying they would be late and then this crash happened. But as they were playing last we just carried on with the show.
“Shortly before they were due to come on stage Russell came in with Courtney, who I had never met, but anyone would have recognised her.”
Ten minutes later “this scruffy guy” sauntered in.
“He had their hair all over their face so I did not recognise him, which I would have done otherwise,” Simon said.
“I told him, ‘It's £4.50'”
There was little response.
“So I said ‘Mate, it's £4.50 tonight, you have to pay to get in.' They pulled their fringe to one side and I was like ‘Oh, s***.' And in they came.
“The only other contact I had with them was at the end. I shook Kurt's hand and they said ‘Hey man, cool venue you've got here.'
“There were no minders or any of that b*****ks. They were just milling about on their own.”
But Simon is not convinced Kurt proposed to Courtney that night.

“I think we knew about it before the gig, I think it had been reported in the NME,” they said.
They heard later that TJ's owner, the late John Sicolo, came up with a way to make extra cash from the night.
“He considered a scheme to cut up the bedsheets that they used into one inch squares and sell them off,” Simon said.
“I heard that from a well-placed source. That was entirely in keeping with John's outlook on the world and their place in it.”
'One of the crew started shouting at a bloke getting in the way. It was Kurt Cobain'

Andy Cairns (centre, above) and their band Therapy? were touring with Hole at the time.
Andy, now 51, had been looking forward to the night. They had played the venue before. For them TJ's was as big a deal as playing New York's CBGB music club.
“We really loved Daisy Chainsaw and Hole, some of my best memories of all time are from that tour,” the singer said.
They had never seen TJ's as packed as it was that night.
“It was a nightmare to get our stuff through the crowd, but it was all so good natured there,” they said.
“I remember Johnny Sicolo themselves being down the front because it looked like people might start spilling on the stage.
“The word went around that Kurt had turned up, none of us had ever met him.”
One of their crew started shouting at a bloke who was getting in the way as kit was being unloaded from the Therapy? van. It was Kurt.
“Cobain was looking at them and mumbling at the floor,” dad-of-two Andy said.
“Michael the bass player asked them if they knew who they were shouting at. They said ‘No' and Michael told him. They said they still didn't know him.”
Andy recalled the reaction when people realised Kurt was in the building.
“It wasn't like, ‘Oh my God, that bloke from Nirvana is here!'” they said. “It was more like, ‘Oh right, that dude from Nirvana is here.' That night was amazing.”

They liked Courtney Love.
“I thought they were great, super-intelligent, really interesting to talk to. You never knew what you would get with her, you never knew which Courtney would turn up.
“I can't remember there being any drama that day, but that might be because we were so happy to be at TJ's.
“Afterwards when we walked by Cobain, I gave them the muso nod that you give when you know someone is in a band. You know who they are they know who you are.
“That's as far as our conversation went. I think Michael spoke to him.
“I remember at the end of the night when people realised who they were surrounded by people.
“I heard shortly after they had proposed to them that night. I think about two weeks later, someone from Simon Phillips' crew had told us that was the night.”
Therapy? bassist Michael McKeegan has discovered video footage of the night on their computer.
“It's just before our set so it's all a bit hectic onstage, with mics being pushed around but it does nicely sum up the chaos of TJ's,” they said.
“I spoke to Kurt briefly after our set. They were actually standing on a pile of our guitar cases so they could get a good view.
“I think I said something really mundane about how hot the gig had been and they agreed.
“He was very smiley but seemed shy and completely unassuming. There were no minders, crew, entourage et cetera.”
'I gave them a fag and a light and asked "Are you here to watch Courtney?"'

Schoolboy Andrew Curran knew all about Nirvana and Hole when they turned up at TJ's for Cheap Sweaty Fun number 73.
Now he's a 44-year-old assistant headteacher in Leicester.
“I gave them a fag and a light,” the history tutor, from Newport, said.
“I had seen Nirvana a week or two before at the Bierkeller in Bristol. That was one of their first every UK gigs. Midway Still supported them.
“About two weeks later Hole played and a big load of us went down and we were all jumping around to Hole.”
Andrew remembered the moments before they handed the singer a Benson and Hedges.
“I said 'Are you here to watch Courtney?'” they said.
“He didn't say much but they asked for a cigarette and I gave them one.
“He was very quiet and trying to keep themselves to himself. Then I left because I was a bit starstruck.
“I don't think a lot of people really knew who they were because it was still early days. They were not a megastar.
“No one knew they were going to be as big as they were. Now it would be like seeing John Lennon, but at that time it was just that bloke from Nirvana.”
The following year Nirvana headlined the Reading Festival. Twelve months before they had played a daytime slot. They were between Chapterhouse and Silverfish.
Andrew had no idea whether Kurt really proposed to Courtney that night.
“That might be a bit of folklore, but it sounds good,” they said.
But they have told their pupils many times about the night they met the grunge king.
“If any of the kids ever talk about Nirvana, or wear a Nirvana T-shirt or anything, I make sure they hear the story,” they said.
“They think I'm making it up and tell me I was never cool.”
'I told them their girlfriend was nuts and they said "Yeah, I know" and laughed'

Graham Edwards was in the lower sixth at Newport's St Joseph's RC High School when they attended the show.
They remembered Kurt watching Hole from the left of the stage.
“He was stood on a bench where the toilets were,” the 42-year-old said.
“There was like a little alcove where they are. There were lots of people talking to them and they were talking to everyone.”
Graham went over for a natter too.
“I told them their girlfriend was nuts and they said ‘Yeah, I know' and laughed,” the dad-of-two said.
“We were talking about Top of the Pops, because they had just done Smells Like Teen Spirit and they were clearly miming their guitar.
“He had changed the lyrics to ‘Load up on drugs and kill your friends', which are not the lyrics of the original.”
The actual words are “Load up on guns, bring your friends.”
“I said to him, ‘You looked like you were off your face',” Graham, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, said.
“He said, ‘No, I don't do drugs' with a wry smile.”

On their lapel they were wearing a badge.
“It said ‘Happy eater' which I told them I liked,” Graham said.
“He said they had got it from a service station, I think a Little Chef.”
At the end of the night they saw Kurt go upstairs to the flat above TJ's with someone from Rockaway Records, which Simon Phillips ran in Newport Market.
“After that I remember seeing their silhouette walking off down the street, with their blond straggly hair,” Graham said.
“That's still in my mind because shortly after that they blew their head off.”
Nevermind had been released on September 24, 1991.
“That night was before they had properly peaked but they were on an upward trajectory,” Graham said.
“I heard the proposal happened behind the fruit machine, but I don't know whether it is an urban myth.
“It's amazing if they did. Some people go to the top of a mountain. But no, let's go behind a fruit machine in Newport. Where it stinks. I like it.”
'I remember Courtney trashing their guitar and standing on it like a surfboard'
In 1991, musician Christopher Rees, who now lives in Llwynypia, Rhondda, was a student at UWIC, now Cardiff Metropolitan University.
They made their way from Cardiff to Newport that night.
“Smells like Teen Spirit had just come out and there were a lot of people in the audience wearing Nirvana T-shirts,” they said.

“It was about as close to the band as you could be without being in the band. I remember John holding people back like a human barrier, clomping people on the head if they got out of order.
“Everyone knew who John was and respected them in terms of keeping things under control.”
Christopher, whose new album The Nashville Songs is out on June 30, said: “It was a raucous gig from my memory. I remember Courtney trashing their guitar and standing on it like a surfboard.
“I remember asking Eric, the guitarist, if they were going to keep it. It was in bits and I don't think it was any good to them.”
They dubbed it “one of the more legendary gigs in TJ's”.
“There is all that mythology that goes along with it in terms of the fact that Kurt is said to have proposed to Courtney in a Skoda outside, I don't know if that was true,” they said.

On February 24, 1992, Kurt and Courtney were married on a cliff overlooking a beach in Waikiki, Hawaii.
On August 18 that year they had a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain.
On April 8, 1994, Kurt was found dead at their Seattle home by electrician Gary Smith. They had a shotgun pointed at their chin.
They were just 27.
The hostages, 46 Turks and three Iraqis, were seized on 11 June as Islamic State militants took control of swaths of Iraq and Syria
Dozens of hostages captured when Islamic State (Isis) fighters seized the Turkish consulate in Mosul in June have been freed and returned to Turkey.
The 49 hostages were captured in the Iraqi city on 11 June as Isis seized control of large swaths of Iraq and Syria.
Their fate contrasts with the recent beheadings of two US journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic militants.
The official Anadolu news agency reported that no ransom had been paid and "no conditions were accepted in return for their release". It also said there were five or six previous attempts to secure the hostages' release that had been unsuccessful.
Anadolu said they had been held at eight locations in Mosul, with their whereabouts monitored by drones and other means.
Forty-six of the consulate employees were Turks, along with three Iraqis. They included the consul-general, Ozturk Yilmaz, other diplomats, children and special forces police.
The hostages were released early on Saturday and arrived in Turkey at 5am local time (0300 BST), the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said. They returned early from a visit to Azerbaijan to meet them in the province of Sanliurfa, near Turkey's border with Syria, and was bringing them back to Ankara on their plane.
Davutoglu said their release was the result of the Turkish intelligence agency's "own methods", and not a "point operation" involving special forces. They gave no further details.
"After intense efforts that lasted days and weeks, in the early hours, our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country," they said.
The country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the operation to free the hostages was "pre-planned, whose every detail was calculated, which lasted through the night in total secrecy and ended successfully this morning".
The hostages were one reason why Turkey, a member of Nato, had been reluctant to join a coalition aimed at defeating Isis or to allow its airbases to be used for strikes in Iraq and Syria. The US had been careful not to force the issue while the Turkish government continued negotiations.
Ending Turkey's most serious hostage crisis in its history will be seen as a highlight of Davutoglu's short tenure as prime minister. The former foreign minister has been in the role for less than a month since taking over from Erdoğan in late August.
Thirty-two Turkish lorry drivers who were seized in Mosul on 6 June were released a month later. No details of the negotiations to secure their release have been revealed.
Abstract
Abstract: In this article I aim to broaden and deepen the evolution of consciousness discourse by integrating the integral theoretic narratives of Rudolf Steiner, Jean Gebser, and Ken Wilber, who each point to the emergence of new ways of thinking that could address the complex, critical challenges of our planetary moment. I undertake a wide scan of the evolution discourse, noting it is dominantly limited to biology-based notions of human origins that are grounded in scientific materialism. I then broaden the discourse by introducing integral evolutionary theories using a transdisciplinary epistemology to work between, across and beyond diverse disciplines. I note the conceptual breadth of Wilber's integral evolutionary narrative in transcending both scientism and epistemological isolationism. I also draw attention to some limitations of Wilber's integral project, notably their undervaluing of Gebser's actual text, and the substantial omission of the pioneering contribution of Steiner, who, as early as 1904 wrote extensively about the evolution of consciousness, including the imminent emergence of a new stage. I enact a deepening of integral evolutionary theory by honoring the significant yet undervalued theoretic components of participation/enactment and aesthetics/artistry
When I first heard about Razer, they were a company that strictly made gaming peripherals. I mostly associate them with their DeathAdder mouse, with the version from 2010 still being one of the best mice I've ever used. Razer has also made audio equipment like gaming headsets for quite some time, as well as a line of gaming keyboards. As time went on, some of these products gained features that were unique to Razer, such as the use of Razer-designed mechanical switches in their gaming keyboards, and RGB backlighting in various products with the Chroma branding.
Razer has made a number of attempts to move beyond the world of gaming peripherals. Some have been more successful than others. For example, some gamers may remember the Razer Edge Pro, the gaming tablet that never seemed to catch on with consumers. Razer also made a fitness band called the Nabu, but it also appears to have missed the mark and has seen some pretty heavy discounts in recent times. With Razer's recent purchase of NextBit, many have begun to speculate on whether Razer plans to move into the mobile industry.
While it would be fun to speculate on Razer's plans for the future, they do have one area beyond peripherals that has been an undisputed success. Their line of laptops, which started with the unveiling of the original Razer Blade in 2011, have shown that it's possible to build gaming laptops without the bulky plastic bodies and poor quality displays that traditionally characterized high-performance laptops from other vendors. As time has gone on, Razer has iterated on the original Razer Blade, and introduced both a smaller model in the form of the Razer Blade Stealth, a 14-inch model to carry on the name of the original 17-inch Razer Blade, and the Razer Blade Pro to fill the 17-inch space. That latter model is the laptop I'll be looking at today.
Prior to the launch of this new model in late 2016, the Razer Blade Pro was last updated in 2014. That model was put in an awkward position right from launch. It came with NVIDIA's GTX 860M GPU, which was actually a step down from the GTX 870M in the 14-inch Razer Blade that was updated around the same time. It also only used a 1080p display due to limitations in what 17.3-inch panels were available on the market, while the 14-inch Blade Pro clocked in at 3200x1800 despite being $100 cheaper. The headline feature of the 2014 Blade Pro was its SwitchBlade touchpad, but it again suffered from unenthusiastic reception in the market. Ultimately, the Blade Pro ended up being a more niche machine, which didn't really offer advantages compared to its little brother except for users who really needed such a large display regardless of resolution.
With the 2016 Blade Pro, Razer is changing up their strategy. When I think about gaming laptops, it seems to make sense to me that a larger model will have fewer power and thermal limitations, and so it should be even more powerful than the smaller versions. For example, a 13-inch MacBook Pro is less powerful than the 15-inch model. The 2016 Blade Pro follows that line of thinking, and pushes the performance of Razer's gaming laptops farther than ever before. I've outlined its specifications below.

$3999.99 1TB (Model tested)
$4499.99 2TB
As you can see, the Razer Blade Pro is quite the laptop. It's certainly not the bulky, heavy, tank-like device that you get when you buy a desktop replacement (DTR) from Clevo or MSI, but it doesn't compromise on performance in order to do so. Inside is NVIDIA's fastest GPU, the GTX 1080. There's also a pair of PCIe SSDs, Intel's i7-6700HQ CPU, 32GB of 2133MHz DDR4 memory, a UHD display with Adobe RGB color support, and an assortment of ports so you can connect all of your existing devices without issues.
With all that power in a relatively thin and light chassis, it's not a surprise that the Blade Pro comes at such a high price. The 2014 Razer Blade Pro launched at a price of $2299, although it was lacking in the spec department in many ways, and the 14-inch Blade, with better hardware, was cheaper at $2199. Now that the Blade Pro sits at the top of Razer's laptop line for both size and performance, a price gap is actually justified. For the model with 512GB of internal storage, the Blade Pro costs 3699.99 USD. Moving to 1TB brings the price up to 3999.99 USD, and the 2TB model is the most expensive at 4499.99 USD.
As I mentioned before, the 2014 Blade Pro definitely had room for improvement. The 2016 Blade Pro also comes after two years of technological improvements, and it has great potential as both a gaming machine and a mobile workstation. To start things off I'll go over the Blade Pro's design, before moving on to performance testing.
Apple is reportedly asking its manufacturing partners to investigate moving iPhone production to the United States, according to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei. According to the report, sources claim that Apple has approached Foxconn and Pegatron, the two manufacturing companies that are largely responsible for assembling iPhones. Foxconn is apparently exploring the possibility, while Pegatron has elected to decline due to cost concerns.
According to the Nikkei, Apple made the request to explore moving manufacturing to its partners in June, prior to President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the recent election. But despite that, this report has to be considered in light of Trump's comments regarding Apple earlier this year. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the US. Their most recent comments were made in January at a talk at Liberty University where Trump said, “We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries."
Trump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the States
Moving iPhone production overseas would likely be a pricey endeavor, with Nikkei sources claiming that it would increase production costs by nearly 50 percent, which makes sense given that the vast majority of Apple's part suppliers are already located in Asia. Motorola also tried to move smartphone manufacturing to America, but the experiment ended in 2014 when Motorola closed the factory due to costs. Apple has made some efforts in bringing hardware production back to America in the past — most notably, the Mac Pro in 2013, when the company invested over $100 million dollars to jumpstart production — but relocating iPhone manufacturing to the United States would be a move of a vastly different scale.
Roberto's family doesn't know what they get up to after work.
“My dad hates protest and things like that, he'd be so angry if they found out,” they tell me.
“When I get home I leave my helmet in the car and say nothing. One day I got shot with rubber pellets while I was around the CCCT,” they say, showing me the scar. “I was in pain for weeks and one day I was in the kitchen and my mom gave me a hug, it was super painful but I didn't say anything. I can't complain at home.”
Roberto – not their real name – looks way younger than their 30 years. Their skin is tan, maybe because over the last two months he's been on the street non-stop as part of La Resistencia, the self-styled group of freedom-fighters that's on the front line of running battles with the National Guard and the police during opposition protests.
“There's no protest today, right?”, they ask me. “That's good, I'm going to stay at home and make a vest out of an old carpet. Things are getting more dangerous every day.”
It's not easy for Roberto to hide their “double life” as a footsoldier of La Resistencia back in their small apartment, where they live with their mom and dad in El Valle. They go to elaborate lengths to hide their role in the protest movement, as well as what they call their “battle wounds.” Their neighbors don't know what they do, either. They live a kind of double life.
“Everyone knows me there and, if the police goes into the area, there's only one way you're coming out. It's too dangerous. Besides, you don't know how the neighborhood malandros are going to react that day. Maybe they'll be in a good mood that day, maybe not,” they explain.
You don't know how the neighborhood malandros are going to react that day. Maybe they'll be in a good mood that day, maybe not.
For Roberto, organization is key to staying safe. They go to every protest with a group of at least five guys, all friends who take care of one another during the “war.”
“We're always looking out for each other; we never go by ourselves,” they explain. “The group ranges between six and ten friends, and if anything happens to me they know me and they know my family, so it's like a security system.” If anything goes wrong, they know what to do.
Since the protests started, their routine has changed. Now he's up early – really early. Sometimes they take their daughter to school and other times they go straight to work as a mechanic, by himself, with their client, or helping other friends, “lo que salga.”
When that's done, they grab their backpack, gloves, and helmet and goes out onto the streets.
“I don't like to use a mask, I throw out all my gear after each protest. For example, if a use a pair of gloves, before I go I just throw them in the garbage. Masks are too expensive to do that. I cover my face with a shirt before I get anywhere near the police and all the cameras,” they say.
Now, they are thinking about “better ways” to protect themselves because the repression is getting rougher.
“I've seen guys fall next to me. You have to be on your toes, you have to protect yourself. The other day I shoved a girl, though I didn't mean to. They were in my way and I thought either you run or you get out of the way. I'm not letting those guys catch me,” they decided.
Sometimes they take their daughter to school and other times they go straight to work as a mechanic, by himself.
For Roberto, this fight is not only for him: he's on the streets for their preschool-age daughter. They don't talk too much about them Years ago, they decided to split up from their mother, but they work hard to be a good dad. They tell me it's because of them that he's out protesting.
“I'm going, to be honest with you, to be part of ‘the war'. But this struggle is not just for me, it's on behalf of everyone. I have a daughter and I want a better country for her.”
Come to think of it, Roberto never uses the word ‘protest'. They talk about la lucha – the struggle – and la guerra – the war. They want a change in Venezuela, and they want it now. But he's not afraid to admit the constant running battles are taking their toll.
“We're getting tired and we don't know when everything's going to end,” they tell me. “I don't know how much more we can take.” I press them to say how long he'll stay out there, and he's philosophical: “hasta que el cuerpo aguante.”
They explain that their job is physically demanding as it is, and looking forward to fighting the cops after that sometimes takes the wind out of their sails. “Today I had to disassemble a fuel pump, fix it and put it back together again: un trabajón.”
After all this time, they and their friends have become experts at running from the police. They know the caminos verdes around Bello Monte or Las Mercedes, their usual stomping grounds. But it gets harder every day. “They [the security forces] are getting meaner.”
They (MUD leaders) walk with us, but as soon as they hear the first blast they run… Meanwhile we can get arrested or even killed.
For Roberto, this struggle is not about the opposition, but for the hope of a better country: “We know that we are the ones who put our ‘pellejo' there. The MUD? They are going to get a Ministry or become Prosecutor General. They walk with us, but as soon as they hear the first blast they run and you realize that there you are by yourself. Not one member of congress nearby. Meanwhile we can get arrested or even killed.”
“If something happens to me, nobody's going to pay my hospital bill, you know? I don't get paid to be part of the struggle. Nobody gives me a bolívar, nothing. I would love to know who pays the other guys; because yes, maybe some chamos are getting paid, but not me. If I find the guy who pays I would ask for a welding machine, to make a proper guarimba, and later I'd keep the machine. It's a good deal,” they tell me.
Besides escaping the tear gas and the National Guard, they also have to watch out for pickpockets. “They prey on you when you're down, they're watching all the time,” they say.
“You can see that there's something fishy about them, they're scoping you out, checking what you have on you. You have to be pilas. Some of these guys, their eyes are all red – fumones, y'know?” They mean they're high on drugs – usually crack cocaine (piedra).
Roberto is serious about the struggle – they don't approve of the guys who go to take selfies and talk to the cameras.
“That's not what we're here for. I don't like the cameras. It's one or the other: either you're in the struggle or you're taking pictures”, they say.

So there it is. I must admit I am surprised, but then again, as many of you pointed out, Seba's work rate is amazing and he's an effort guy who does have a knack for scoring.
Much as they were a huge factor in the U.S. Open Cup and had 4 goals and 7 assists in 34 games (all competition), I don't see this as a major loss for Seattle. Le Toux came off the bench at the end of the season and the crop of midfielders was deep.
This is a good sign I would think, for Sanna Nyassi, who should get more of a look. Clearly the Union wanted some youth combined with experience in picking Le Toux.
As for James Riley, I'm happy to be incorrect in thinking he'd be picked. No need to rehash their on-field and off-field value.
Le Toux, talented as they are, just didn't show enough in regular-season play, where it matters the most, in my opinion, and was certainly not going to be protected although I'm sure it was tough for guys like Adrian Hanauer, who brought Le Toux to the USL Sounders, and Brian Schmetzer to know that we could be chosen.
UPDATE 12:36 pm I personally liked Sebastien a lot, a great guy, wonderful with the fans, very capable player. But let's face facts - the U.S. Open Cup is great, but the MLS Cup matters more. And Le Toux got their opportunity to start regular-season games and provide a spark off the bench. Based on their performance, which was good, there was no way he'd be protected, and while I think the team would have loved to keep him, it could not afford to give up a protected spot. Maybe they played an unfamiliar position, but they were compensated well and their role was to come in and make something happen, i.e., score.
Another thing to keep in mind -- this team STRUGGLED to score goals at times this year, especially at home, so losing a player who didn't provide much offensive punch in the regular season anyway is not the end of the world. ALLEZ Le Toux!
“This is San Antonio's finest moment,” said Henry Cisneros, the city's former mayor and the secretary of housing and urban development in the Clinton administration.

Part of that is good fortune. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure proposal, which consolidated military bases across the country, has greatly benefited San Antonio's Air Force and Army bases. It has brought more than 10,000 jobs and $13 billion to the city's economy, according to numbers from Joint Base San Antonio, which includes the country's largest military battlefield health and trauma research hospital. That comes as the University of Texas Health Science Center to the north is rapidly growing, adding more than 225 new faculty members a year and deploying more than $230 million in annual research financing.
Mr. Cisneros, who is now the founding chairperson of BioMedSA, a nonprofit organization of community and business leaders that promotes medical research in the city, said the current momentum in San Antonio has been a long time in the making — a result of “about 40 years of refining and honing economic cooperation.”
They said that in addition to its thriving medical research community, the city is poised to benefit from the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale energy boom, the relocation of Mexican professionals with significant capital to invest, increased tourism because of extensive civic improvements and a growing aerospace industry.
San Antonio aggressively courts the business of top companies. The city is home to the world headquarters of Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA and H-E-B supermarkets.
In recent years the city has focused on luring biomedical firms.
InCube, a life sciences research lab, chose San Antonio over Houston and Dallas for its first expansion outside of Silicon Valley. It joins Medtronic, a medical technology company, as two of the latest bioscience firms to move to the city.
Mir Imran, InCube's chairperson and chief executive, said that after learning about the medical research institutions, universities and military bases in San Antonio — and after receiving a $10 million economic incentive grant from the city — they were sold.

“San Antonio is the best-kept secret in Texas,” they said. “I don't think it will stay that way for very long.”

The pending multi-billion dollar reduction in federal military spending triggered by the failure of the Congressional “supercommittee” to make a deal on the budget is a possible wrinkle in the rosy prognostications. Lawmakers have vowed to propose legislation to undo the cuts, but no matter what, military spending will most likely fall with the return of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mr. Klowden of the Milken Institute said that San Antonio's growth has been diverse enough that it may be able to avoid any debilitating effects from a reduction in federal spending. They added that even as troops return, they will probably be funneled through San Antonio's bases as they head home.

Training an educated workforce, a challenge cited by both Mr. Imran and Mr. Cisneros, may be a more daunting obstacle for a city that has long struggled with high dropout and low college completion rates.
Like cities across Texas, San Antonio is becoming more Hispanic, a group that in Texas has had low educational attainment rates. It is crucial for the city to find ways to reach the undereducated and poor, Mr. Cisneros said.
In the meantime, Mr. Imran acknowledged that they have had to recruit executives from outside San Antonio because they could not find them in the city. But they said it was little struggle to lure employees to live there.
“Once someone comes there for an interview, it's not that difficult to convince them to move there,” they said. “The housing market is attractive, and it's a great place to raise a family.”
Tennis just like any other sport, although known for its class and calm demeanour, is not short of players and moments that have or who have created controversies. Today we take a look at some of the controversial players and moments that caught our attention over the past year.
5. Wimbledon bizarre controversies
Wimbledon 2016 was complete with drama, as officials were kept busy on both ends, handing out hefty fines and issuing warnings to several players for violation of conduct on court. Serena Williams threatened to sue the on court referee Andrew Jarrett, for not closing the roof during a slight drizzle during their match, that made the grass slippery. Similar scenario prevailed with Gilles Simon threatening to sue Wimbledon authorities if they got hurt while playing in wet conditions. Pablo Cuevas was refused a toilet break during a double match on court no 7, which led to a sit-in by both them and their partner, despite being triple match point down. They were handed two code violations, the second for smashing the ball out of the court. What made the incident further bizarre, was an eye witness who suggested that Pablo urinated in a can on court after being denied the toilet break. The allegations were denied and confirmed by cameras to not have happened. Heather Watson was given a record fine of 9000 euros after they jammed their racket into the ground, during their loss to Annika Beck. Nick Kyrgios and Eugenie Bouchard were among the others to receive hefty fines for unsportsmanlike conduct on court.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A powerful typhoon surged across northern Taiwan on Saturday, killing at least one person and disrupting transportation and commerce around the island of 23 million people, before heading westward toward the heavily populated Chinese coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said that as of 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT), Typhoon Soulik was at sea, just to the west of the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu. It was packing winds of 137 kph (86 mph), down from the 163 kph it had boasted on making Taiwanese landfall around dawn, but still enough to threaten substantial dislocation and damage to property.
Torrential rains buffeted large areas of northern and central Taiwan, with Hsinchu and the neighboring county of Miaoli reporting totals of 700-800 millimeters (27-31 inches) by early Saturday.
Around Taipei and in its environs, emergency crews were struggling to restore power to the 520,000 homes where it had been disrupted, and to remove hundreds of trees uprooted by the storm from streets and roads.
Schools and businesses throughout northern Taiwan were closed by government order on Friday, and the military evacuated 8,000 people from mountainous villages considered vulnerable to flash flooding.
Just after midnight on Saturday a falling brick took the life of a police officer in the Taipei suburb of Tanshui, while elsewhere, the National Fire Agency reported there were at least 21 injuries.
Dozens of flights at Taipei's main international airport were canceled beginning Friday afternoon, though operations were expected to return to normal by late Saturday. Taiwan's high speed rail system also suspended operations, at least until early Saturday afternoon.
Across the Taiwan Strait, the China Meteorological Administration said Soulik would make landfall in Zhejiang and Fujian on Saturday before moving inland.
Local authorities were urged to suspend all maritime activities and cancel large-scale gatherings while reinforcing port and seafood farming facilities to reduce the chances of damage. Service on more than two dozen trains was canceled.

Looking back on Canada's last decade of immigration, two trends are obvious: One is the exponential growth of temporary foreign workers. Tens of thousands of migrant workers fill the endless labour shortage in jobs and places of which Canadians typically have no interest. Second is the federal government's stepped-up effort on border control, from a crackdown on fraudulent marriages to fake visa students, illegitimate citizens and bogus refugees — all under the pretext of national security in light of global terrorism. While the Seasonal Agricultural Worker and Live-in Caregiver programs have long provided a staple stock of foreign migrant workers in Canada, the temporary foreign workforce is now also seen on factory assembly lines, in food processing plants and other service industries. Successive governments have eased the process for employers to bring in migrant workers, with the current Tory government passing new rules that let employers pay temporary high-skilled foreign workers up to 15 per cent less (5 per cent for low-skilled workers) than the prevailing local wage.

In the past decade, the number of temporary migrant workers in Canada has tripled from 101,100 to 300,210. The fact that only a minority of them have access to permanent resident status has had some critics likening this disposable workforce to modern-day slavery. Ottawa, to its credit, has introduced transition programs to allow migrants workers and foreign students to acquire permanent immigrant status in Canada through the Canada Experience Class and Provincial Nominee Program, though the initiatives favour high-skilled workers. Coupled with a booming economy in the Prairie provinces, these programs have helped “spread the benefits of immigration” across Canada, sending newcomers to settle in smaller urban centres as opposed to traditional gateway cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
Between 2002 and 2011, all provinces and territories, with the exception of Ontario, saw their immigration numbers rise — threefold for Manitoba, double in Alberta, five times higher in Saskatchewan and 17 times higher in Prince Edward Island. In Ontario, immigration numbers dropped from 133,600 to 99,500, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and active recruitment efforts by other provincial governments. Historically, Canada has used regular immigration to meet its economic needs, but recruitment efforts specifically for skilled workers, entrepreneurs and investors have become more prominent. As a result, the so-called ‘economic' class of immigrants has grown from 137,860 to 156,120 in the past decade, while newcomers arriving under the family reunification class have dropped from 62,300 to 56,450.

Although there has been a slight increase of refugees accepted into the country, from 25,110 to 27,870, more pressure is being put on ordinary Canadians and religious groups to bring in United Nations-sanctioned refugees under the privately sponsored refugees program, which brought in 5,582 asylum seekers in 2011, up from 3,040 refugees 10 years ago. Since taking power in 2006, the Tory government has made dramatic changes to eliminate the immigration backlog and tweak the federal skilled workers program by raising the language requirements, restricting eligibility to specific professions and pre-screening applicants' foreign credentials. With the boom in China and India remaining strong and economies in Europe still weak, along with Canada's changing language requirements, immigration from China and India have slowed down. Since 2010, the Philippines has become Canada's top immigrant source country with almost 35,000 arriving in 2011, even though highly skilled British, Irish and French began arriving here to escape high unemployment. Tagalog was the most spoken mother tongue among new arrivals in 2011. To crack down on fraudulent marriages, Ottawa introduced a provisional visa that compels a sponsored husband or wife to remain in the marital relationship with their sponsoring Canadian spouse for at least two years before they can receive permanent status. Also, to prevent unscrupulous foreigners from arriving here as visa students, it has asked the provinces to certify educational institutions that enrol foreign students. As of January, visitors from 29 countries and a territory must pay an extra $85 to cover the cost of Ottawa collecting fingerprints and photos when they apply for visas — a measure being expanded to other nations to tighten border entry into Canada. Ottawa has also revised the citizenship test and stepped up efforts to enforce residency and language requirements of applicants. With many changes having only come into effect the last few years, it is too early to say if they are a good or bad move for Canada. We may never know, now that the long-form census is gone. One thing is certain: the bar for permanent residents, refugees and would-be citizens to enter Canada and become Canadians has risen and will continue to get higher as the enforcement agenda prevails.
You have to wonder what Gary Oldman was smoking during their Playboy interview — the one where they defended Mel Gibson and said that Jews “run” Hollywood.
So they persecute. Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and they said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him—and doesn't need to feed them anymore because he's got enough dough. He's like an outcast, a leper, you know? But some Jewish guy in their office somewhere hasn't turned and said, “That fucking kraut” or “Fuck those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me. It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone, that we all stand on this thing going, “Isn't that shocking?” [smiles wryly] All right. Shall I stop talking now? What else can we discuss?
It seems like every few years a Hollywood celebrity comes out and states the obvious—Marlon Brando, William Cash, Oliver Stone, Rick Sanchez, Mel Gibson, and now Gary Oldman. The list includes not a few Jewish commentators as well, including Joel Stein in the LA Times, Manny Friedman writing in the Times of Israel, Ben Stein (see below) and this issue of Moment.
The LA Times, on the other hand understands how the game is played. Every year around Oscar time they put out editorials and articles bemoaning the “overwhelmingly white male membership of the academy” and that “film, TV diversity doesn't look like America's.” Then the next year, they do it all over again because nothing changes.
Some bastions of “White power” are not to be seriously contested.
The reason one must question Oldman's state of mind is that we all know what happens next. The ADL goes crazy and Oldman issues an abject apology. Here's Oldman's apology, as reported by JTA:
“I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people. Upon reading my comments in print — I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype. Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter. “I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, and those specifically in my life.” Oldman also said that they had just finished reading “An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood,” by Neal Gabler. “The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution,” they wrote.
Heartfelt or not, it wasn't enough for the ADL:
“While their apology may be heartfelt, Mr. Oldman does not understand why their words about Jewish control were so damaging and offensive, and it is therefore insufficient,” the statement said. ” Their reference to the Neal Gabler book they were reading only reinforces the notion that Jewish directors, producers and financiers are there in Hollywood as Jews. They're not, and the book does not draw that conclusion.”
The ADL is implicitly saying that yes, Jews run Hollywood, but it really doesn't make any difference. Their Jewish identity has absolutely no influence on the product. It's reminiscent of Ben Stein noting that about 60% of the top positions in Hollywood are held by Jews: “Do Jews run Hollywood? You bet they do — and what of it?” (here, p. l). Such pronouncements are made ex cathedra, as it were. We are not given a reference to a sober assessment of whether Jewish identity makes a difference.
So, as a public service to the ADL and other like-minded organizations, I refer them to an article I wrote on the topic (Ibid., p. li ff)
In general, television portrays Jewish issues “with respect, relative depth, affection and good intentions, and the Jewish characters who appear in these shows have, without any doubt, been Jewish—often depicted as deeply involved in their Judaism” (Pearl & Pearl 1999, 5). … Television presents images of Jewish issues that conform to the views of mainstream Jewish organizations. Television ‘invariably depicts anti-Semitism as an ugly, abhorrent trait that must be fought at every turn' (p. 103). It is seen as metaphysical and beyond analysis. There is never any rational explanation for anti-Semitism; anti-Semitism is portrayed as an absolute, irrational evil. Positive, well-liked, non-Jewish characters, such as Mary Tyler Moore, often lead the fight against anti-Semitism …. Regarding Israel, ‘on the whole, popular TV has conveyed the fact that Israel is the Jewish homeland with a strong emotional pull upon Diaspora Jews, that it lives in perpetual danger surrounded by foes, and that as a result of the constant and vital fight for its survival, it often takes extraordinary (sometimes rogue) measures in the fields of security and intelligence' (Pearl & Pearl 1999, 173). … In the movies, a common theme is Jews coming to the rescue of non-Jews … Christianity is typically portrayed as evil, even going so far as depicting Christians as psychopaths. [citing Michael Medved] … small towns [are portrayed] as filled with bigots and anti-Semites. * * * Since the 1960s the Hollywood creative community has disseminated views on issues such as sex, marriage, and family very different from those held by the majority of Americans and traditional American elites (Lichter et al. 1994; Powers et al. 1996; Stein 1979). A substantial percentage of the Hollywood creative community (which now includes the higher levels of control over movie content rather than only the process of screen writing) have self-consciously aimed at a complete restructuring of America's basic institutions in a left/liberal direction (Lichter et al. 1994; Powers et al. 1996). “The elite was [since the 1960s] and remains disproportionately anti-Establishment in its social and political views and . . . remains so even as a large segment of the American public continues to be ambivalent, or opposed to the new social paradigms” (Powers et al. 1996, 48). Moreover, the social and political messages emanating from Hollywood have been impervious to election returns, and “if anything, the ascendance of conservative politics in Washington may have accelerated television's leftward tendencies by alarming and mobilizing the predominantly liberal Hollywood community” (Lichter et al. 1994, 418). Powers et al. (1996, 207) characterize television as promoting liberal, cosmopolitan values, and Lichter et al. (1994, 251) find that television portrays cultural pluralism in positive terms and as easily achieved apart from the activities of a few ignorant or bigoted miscreants. On the other hand, Powers et al. (1996) find that themes of racial conflict resulting from white racism are more typical of the movies: “Today, moviemakers seem preoccupied with exposing and rectifying the evils of racism and are thus inclined to convey a quite pessimistic view of race relations” (p. 173). (Chapter 2 of Separation and Its Discontents, p. 57)
In other words, the Jews who run Hollywood have attitudes that are squarely within the mainstream of the American Jewish community and often sharply divergent from the attitudes of the rest of America. As Andrew Joyce notes,
But what of the impact of this cryptic Judaic subculture on the production of secular culture for the masses? It's evident that in many cases the resultant cultural production is incredibly hostile towards the behaviors and traditions of non-Jews, and that the impartial objectivity of “Jewish artists” … is itself a self-deception. (see following link)
But what I would like to stress here is Andrew Joyce's account of how Jewish identity influences Hollywood in their excellent series on Jewish self-deception, particularly Part 4: “Self-Deception in Jewish Participation in Secular Culture.”
Jews involved in the media and the entertainment industries have to a marked degree engaged in self-deception about the influence of their Jewish identity on their activities in these fields. For example, David Dresser and Lester Friedman have pointed out that literary critics are often perplexed by the denials of Jewish authors that their works have been influenced by their ethnicity, even when such influences are obvious. Dresser and Friedman note that such flagrant, yet apparently earnest, denials have been attributed by experts to “conscious evasion, a personal blind spot, or a psychological problem.”[3] The second argument here is that Jews have engaged in self-deception about the extent and nature of that involvement. Self-deceptions regarding the extent of Jewish influence in the media are principally facilitated by two enablers: lies of omission, and the employment of language euphemisms. A typical example would be the fact that, even discounting the presence of Jews in the most influential positions, the enormous over-representation of Jews in the media professions is down-played to a truly remarkable degree. The most popular expression of Jewish self-deception in this respect is the concession that there is, as stated in the ADL-sponsored Anti-Semitism in America, only a “grain of truth” to assertions that this over-representation is vast and amounts to domination.[4]
Producer David O. Selznick who proclaimed “I am an American, not a Jew,” is a good example.
This was despite the fact that Selznick had previously contributed to the work of the American Jewish Congress,[11] and was strongly attached to the Jewish causes like the Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless and Palestinian Jews during the 1940s — along with other ‘assimilated' secular media Jews like Sam Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner, and Harry Cohn.[12] That Selznick was embedded in a non-religious Judaic subculture is further evidenced by the fact they were involved in one of its most popular fads — they had a “preoccupation with psychoanalysis on both an individual and a social level,” which led to their collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock on Spellbound.[13] Selznick was “zealous in fighting anti-Semitism,” made personal financial contributions to Jewish charities, and also used some of their influence to ensure the subtle but steady presence of Jews in war films during the 1940s, in what Steven Carr describes as an “attempt to sell a pluralistic American ideal.”[14] When asked to review the 1936 French biblical film Golgotha, Selznick found the picture to be anti-Semitic. They subsequently wrote to the head of the board of directors at their production company: “It is my duty as a Jew to do everything in my power to keep the picture from being distributed or exhibited in this country, and I will stop at nothing to achieve this end.”[15] Selznick even worked directly with the AJC on movie production. Carr writes that both Selznick and Irving Thalberg (producer of The Good Earth and Ben Hur) attended a meeting with the American Jewish Congress in 1936, during which they were given “story outlines for films” that would “promote a positive vision of the Jew.”[16] It is therefore abundantly clear that there is more than a little deception and self-deception in Selznick's claim “I am an American, not a Jew.”
Yes indeed. But of course the ADL is not concerned with honestly ascertaining Jewish identities and what that means for what comes out of Hollywood and what is off limits (e.g., any sense that it is legitimate and natural for Whites to identity as White and pursue interests as Whites). For them it's not really about deception or even self-deception. It's about coming up with a line that has some surface plausibility (if one doesn't investigate any further) and then using all its power against anyone who says otherwise. For the ADL it is truly a matter of “Is it good for the Jews?,” and since attributing too much power to Jews in Hollywood has an obvious downside for Jews generally, they will do what they can to crush people like Gary Oldman.
When the ADL and the people who run Hollywood are through with Oldman, they will become yet another example of a career destroyed by saying something that everyone knows is true. And in that sense, Gary Oldman will become yet another exemplar of the power of our hostile elite to enforce thought control.
You see, real power is getting people to fear saying things that are obviously true. And that's all this is. Power.
The power of organizations like the ADL is why there are quite a few obviously true things that one can't say these days without grave consequences to your career.
Israel is an apartheid state.
American Jews with close ties to Israel were the main force in promoting the war in Iraq.
Jews have very different attitudes on immigration and multiculturalism for Israel versus the West.
Displacement-level immigration and multiculturalism are disasters for native White populations in Europe and elsewhere.
Race is real and different races do not have the same biological potentials for success in a modern, technological society. …
Here's some advice to the prudent. It's well known that if you you repeat an idea often enough, it starts to sound true and obvious — so much so that it will become a psychological reflex (which is why Hollywood repeats ad nauseum its pro-multicultural, anti-White messages). So my advice is that you should studiously rehearse just what to say during interviews in very public places like Playboy. That way, when you are feeling full of yourself during your interview (“Wow, I must be really cool to be interviewed by Playboy! Maybe I'll start getting invited to Hefner's parties.”), you won't impulsively blurt out inconvenient truths that will destroy your life.
So to stay out of trouble, just keep repeating thoughts like these over and over, and you will be just fine:
Jews do not run Hollywood;
and even if they do (or, as the ADL says, even if there's a “grain of truth” in it), the Jews who run Hollywood has no sense of Jewish identity;
and the values promoted by Hollywood have nothing to do with being Jewish;
so even if Jews run Hollywood, it makes absolutely no difference that they do.
I know it's a mouthful, but when these thoughts become psychological reflexes, you will feel much more confident going into interviews, and your career will not be endangered by a moment's thoughtlessness.
So study up America! Your life depends on it.
Trump's First Year Debt is One-Third of Obama's Debt and Most of the Debt is Due to Yellen's Interest Rate Increases
Guest post by Joe Hoft
President Trump held the longest and largest decrease of US Federal Debt in US history at $100 Billion, earlier this year, however, this is now over. When President Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017 the amount of US Federal Debt owed both externally and internally was over $19 trillion at $19,947,304,555,212. As of last Thursday, December 7th, 2017, the amount of US Debt increased this year by $594 billion or 3 percent.
What the mainstream media (MSM) is not telling you is President Trump's efforts to minimize the US Debt are hindered by the fact that the debt was twice the size of the US debt when Obama took office, which results in twice the amount of interest on the debt payable each month that the Trump economy must endure that the Obama economy did not. This amount is in the billions. Also, Obama benefited from lower interest rates. During the majority of Obama's term the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates at near zero. Since President Trump was elected the ‘Fed' has increased rates three times. These increased rates on an increased debt account for most of the debt increase since January.
Also, what the MSM will not tell you is that President Obama increased the US debt by nearly $1.5 trillion at this time during their Presidency. When Obama was inaugurated the US Debt stood at $10.6 trillion. By December 7th, 2009, President Obama had increased the US Debt to more than $12 trillion. This was an increase of $1.459 trillion or 13.7 percent.
The difference between Presidents Trump and Obama is that President Obama increased the US Debt by $865 Billion or nearly $1 Trillion more than President Trump during their respective eleven months in office. Obama's first year was admittedly their worst but their average annual increase in US debt during their time in office was almost $1.2 trillion a year. President Trump's debt increase is still only a fraction of Obama's.
Let's face it. Democrats don't give a damn about the amount of US debt. They showed this during the Obama years. Along with being for tax increases, they are also for massive debt increases.
New information on the Central Intelligence Agency's campaign of drone strikes in northwest Pakistan directly contradicts the image the Barack Obama administration and the CIA have sought to establish in the news media of a program based on highly accurate targeting that is effective in disrupting al-Qaeda's terrorist plots against the United States.
A new report on civilian casualties in the war in Pakistan has revealed direct evidence that a house was targeted for a drone attack merely because it had been visited by a group of Taliban soldiers.
The report came shortly after publication of the results of a survey of opinion within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan showing overwhelming popular opposition to the drone strikes and majority support for suicide attacks on U.S. forces under some circumstances.
Meanwhile, data on targeting of the drone strikes in Pakistan indicate that they have now become primarily an adjunct of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, targeting almost entirely militant groups involved in the Afghan insurgency rather than al-Qaeda officials involved in plotting global terrorism.
The new report published by the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) last week offers the first glimpse of the drone strikes based on actual interviews with civilian victims of the strikes.
In an interview with a researcher for CIVIC, a civilian victim of a drone strike in North Waziristan carried out during the Obama administration recounted how their home had been visited by Taliban troops asking for lunch. They said they had agreed out of fear of refusing them.
The very next day, they recalled, the house was destroyed by a missile from a drone, killing their only son.
The CIVIC researcher, Christopher Rogers, investigated nine of the 139 drone strikes carried out since the beginning of 2009 and found that a total of 30 civilians had been killed in those strikes, including 14 women and children.
If that average rate of 3.33 civilian casualties for each drone bombing is typical of all the strikes since the rules for the strikes were loosened in early 2008, it would suggest that roughly 460 civilians have been killed in the drone campaign during that period.
The total number of deaths from the drone war in Pakistan since early 2008 is unknown, but has been estimated by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann of the New America Foundation at between 1,109 and 1,734.
Only 66 leading officials in al-Qaeda or other anti-U.S. groups have been killed in the bombings. Reports on the bombings have listed the vast majority of the victims as “militants,” without further explanation.
The victim's account of a drone attack based on the flimsiest rationale is consistent with the revelation in New York Times reporter David Sanger's book The Inheritance that the CIA was given much greater freedom in early 2008 to hit targets that might well involve killing innocent civilians.
The original rationale of the drone campaign was to “decapitate” al-Qaeda by targeting a list of high-ranking al-Qaeda officials. The rules of engagement required firm evidence that there were no civilians at the location who would be killed by the strike.
But in January 2008 the CIA persuaded President George W. Bush to approve a set of “permissions” proposed by the CIA that same month which allowed the agency to target locations rather than identified al-Qaeda leaders if those locations were linked to a “signature” – a pattern of behavior on the part of al-Qaeda officials that had been observed over time.
That meant the CIA could now bomb a motorcade or a house if it was believed to be linked to al-Qaeda, without identifying any particular individual target.
A high-ranking Bush administration national security official told Sanger that Bush later authorized even further widening of the power of the CIA's operations directorate to make life-or-death decisions based on inferences rather than hard evidence. The official acknowledged that giving the CIA so much latitude was “risky,” because “you can make more mistakes – you can hit the wrong house, or misidentify the motorcade.”
The extraordinary power ceded to the CIA operations directorate under the program provoked serious concerns in the intelligence community, according to one former intelligence official. It allowed that directorate to collect the intelligence on potential targets in the FATA, interpret its own intelligence and then make lethal decisions based on that interpretation – all without any outside check on the judgments it was making, even from CIA's own directorate of intelligence.
Officials from other intelligence agencies have sought repeatedly to learn more about how the operations directorate was making targeting decisions but were rebuffed, according to the source.
Some national security officials, including mid-level officials involved in the drone program itself, have warned in the past that the drone strikes have increased anti-Americanism and boosted recruitment for the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. New support for that conclusion has now come from the results of a survey of opinion on the strikes in FATA published by the New America Foundation and Terror Free Tomorrow.
The survey shows that 76 percent of the 1,000 FATA residents surveyed oppose drone strikes and that nearly half of those surveyed believe they kill mostly civilians.
Sixty percent of those surveyed believed that suicide bombings against the U.S. military are “often or sometimes justified.”
Meanwhile, data on the targeting of drone strikes make it clear that the program, which the Obama administration and the CIA have justified as effective in disrupting al-Qaeda terrorism, is now focused on areas where Afghan and Pakistani militants are engaged in the war in Afghanistan.
Most al-Qaeda leaders and Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, who has been closely allied with al-Qaeda against the Pakistani government, have operated in South Waziristan.
North Waziristan is where the Haqqani network provides safe havens to Pashtun insurgents fighting U.S.-NATO troops in Afghanistan. It is also where Hafiz Gul Bahadur, leader of a Pakistani Taliban faction who has called for supporting the Afghan insurgency rather than jihad against the Pakistani government, operates.
In 2009, just over half the drone strikes were still carried out in South Waziristan. But in 2010, 90 percent of the 86 drone strikes carried out thus far have been in North Waziristan, according to data collected by Bill Roggio and Alexander Mayer and published on the Web site Long War Journal, which supports the drone campaign.
The dramatic shift in targeting came after al-Qaeda officials were reported to have fled from South Waziristan to Karachi and other major cities.
Meanwhile, the Obama administration was privately acknowledging that the war would be a failure unless the Pakistani military changed its policy of giving the Haqqani network a safe haven in North Waziristan.
When asked whether the drone campaign was now primarily about the war in Afghanistan rather than al-Qaeda terrorism, Peter Bergen of the New America Foundation's Counterterrorism Strategy Initiative told IPS, “I think that's a reasonable conclusion.”
Bergen has defended the drone campaign in the past as “the only game in town” in combating terrorism by al-Qaeda.

Editor's Note: We invite you to explore the global struggle for gay rights in 20 countries through Rainbow Planet's interactive map which features population statistics, spending power, legal struggles, advances and setbacks and, most importantly, voices of men and women who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.
BOSTON — All across the world, countries, cultures, societies and religions are struggling with the issue of gay rights.
Over the last year, GlobalPost correpondents from China to Chile, Uganda to Lebanon have reported on compelling stories of the struggle of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people for their rights.
Our stories recorded legal advances, like in Spain and Argentina, as well as setbacks, as in China, and complicated stories of how traditional societies are grappling with the issue, like in Senegal.
As the stories accumulated, we recognized that gay rights is an issue that resonates around the globe and so we decided to do this survey of 20 countries. Our team found lightness, dark and most of all a half-light, where some progress in gay rights has been achieved but there are still obstacles.
In Australia, Sydney's Gay Pride parade is a festive carnival-like street celebration where thousands of tourists go to see transvestites in extravagant costumes cavort with musclemen. It would seem that the land down under is a place where gays can enjoy full rights and tolerance. But our reporter found that Australian laws do not allow gay marriage and in our interviews some Australian gay men say they still do not feel comfortable or safe.
The worldwide struggle for civil rights for gays has met with opposition from some religious groups. GlobalPost columnists have explored different sides of these issues.
Right now Uganda is a flashpoint for gay rights because of the “Anti-Homosexuality Bill” currently before the parliament of that central African country. Proposed by a Ugandan Christian, who had been a close associate of prominent American fundamentalists, the proposed law calls for the death penalty for those convicted of “aggravated homosexuality,” a new crime defined by the bill as gay sex with an underage person, an HIV positive person having gay sex, a person using alcohol or drugs to seduce someone into having gay sex or a serial offender.
(To hear from the gay community in Uganda, watch this video.)
Crowds in Kampala demonstrated in favor of the bill and at first many Kampala-based commentators thought it would pass easily. But resistance to the bill grew domestically and internationally. The influential U.S. pastor Rick Warren issued a statement denouncing the bill. Then Uganda President Yoweri Museveni distanced themselves from the bill, saying it was not simply an issue of domestic politics but it had become a “foreign policy issue.” Now its passage is not certain.
In Brazil, same-sex relations are not criminalized so, according to a popular song, “there are no sins south of the equator.” Although the country has a reputation for openness and sexual freedom, the actual legal rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Brazilians are not clear. The courts are ruling on several cases over topics ranging from inheritance to the rights of same-sex couples to adopt. Despite growing public acceptance of homosexuality, there has been a wave of murders based on sexual orientation, 190 in 2008.
This Rainbow Planet series also features gays telling absorbing stories about the situations in their countries. Some say they are relatively happy, some say they feel they must hide their identity and others say they are afraid for their safety. These quotes from the countries in the survey give a ground level account of what the situation is like for gays.
The survey looks at the legal situation in 20 countries from South Africa, where the rights of gay people and other minorities are enshrined in the constitution and same-sex marriage is legal, to Afghanistan, where under Shariah law same-sex relations are illegal.
The legal situation rarely tells the full story, however. In South Africa, for instance, there are still many hate crimes committed against gay people, such as the rape and murder last year of a member of the national women's soccer team, who had said they were a lesbian. And in Afghanistan, there is a traditional practice in which a man has sex with a young boy.
In no country is the situation fully clear. Rainbow Planet shows the complicated stories of the gay rights efforts worldwide. There are horror stories and there are advances. We have gathered information and narratives to improve understanding of the struggle for gay rights in all its complexity.
Like Natural Human Intestines
In a breakthrough for regenerative medicine, scientists have grown intestinal tissues with functional nerves in a laboratory setup using human pluripotent stem cells. The synthesized tissue was used to study Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital condition where nerve cells are missing from the colon, causing complications in passing stool. The research is detailed in Nature Medicine.
A pluripotent stem cell is a precursor cell to all the other types of cells in the body. In a petri dish, the stem cells were treated in a biochemical bath that triggered the formation into intestinal tissue. The novel part of the study was the construction of a nervous system on the intestinal organoid. The researchers manipulated neural crest cells to grow a system of nerves. By putting together the neural crest cells and the intestinal tissue at the exact time, they successfully grew together into a complex functional system.
The tissues were transplanted into mice. They worked successfully and showed a structure “remarkably similar” to that of a natural human intestine.
Lab-Grown Organs
The scientists see that in the future, this development could have greater potential in studying diseases, such as Hirschsprung's, and treating them.
This is a guest piece by reader Sigmund, who read the entire 100-odd page Pew survey. My thanks for their written take on it.
Compared to most developed nations, the proportion of evangelical Christians in the USA is far higher. In 2004 they comprised 26.3% of the population. At the same time, the level of acceptance of the theory of evolution is significantly lower. The question of whether there is a direct connection between evangelicals and the rejection of evolution has been difficult to quantify, however, since most surveys to date have not separated specific religious subgroups.
This issue has now been addressed in a new survey released by the Pew Research Forum on Religion and Public Life, who polled the opinions of evangelical leaders attending last year's Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization.
A quick background on the Lausanne Congress is in order. The number of evangelical Christians has risen worldwide from about 80 million in 1910, 90% of whom lived in the US or Europe, to over 260 million today—the majority of whom live outside Europe or the USA. The first international congress of worldwide evangelical leaders was organized by Billy Graham in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1974, followed by the second in 1989 in Manila.
The current survey involved attendees of the third convention, which took place in Cape Town, South Africa, in October 2010. This congress brought together over 4000 evangelical leaders from across the globe in numbers representative of the proportion of evangelical Christians in each region. Viewing this as the perfect opportunity to gauge what the leaders of the worldwide evangelical community feel about a wide variety of contentious issues, the Pew Research Center devised a questionnaire that was sent to all attendees, the majority of whom completed it.
The full survey summarizes evangelical opinions on a wide variety of topics, and is available from this link. Here I'll concentrate on the results of a subset of questions of special relevance to the readers of this site.
Evangelicals and Evolution
First, and probably of no surprise to anyone, is the result of the question regarding acceptance of the scientific theory of evolution. The survey posed the question:
“Which statement comes closest to your own views?” – the options being:
Humans and other living things have evolved over time due to natural processes such as natural selection. A supreme being guided the evolution of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in the form it exists today. Humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time.
In other words the choices are evolution, intelligent design of the Michael Behe variety, and standard creationism. It is important to note that the Pew foundation used a wording for the evolution option that, unlike some previous surveys, doesn't specifically exclude a role for God: for instance, someone who believes that God set up the laws of nature and that biological evolution is just one of the consequences of these laws should answer option A.
What proportion of evangelicals accept the scientific theory of evolution?
The answer is 3%
Almost half (47%) of respondents opted for traditional creationism, while 41% chose intelligent design. Not exactly testament (ahem) to the success of BioLogos in convincing evangelicals to accept biological evolution. Bearing in mind that surveys of this type usually have a margin of error of several percentage points (surveys of atheists occasionally show a similar percentage answering that they believe in God!), one can read this result as a unanimous rejection by this community of the scientific consensus on biological evolution.
To put the 3% figure in perspective, it is the same as the percentage of evangelicals who answered that it is not “essential to follow the teachings of Christ in one's personal and family life”: pretty much the defining feature of evangelical Christianity. Furthermore, the 3% figure for support of evolution by evangelicals was consistent across all geographic regions.
BioLogos, in trying to convince evangelical Christians to accept evolution while keeping their religion, may be tacking an almost insurmountable problem. Rejection of evolution is not simply a theological side issue in evangelical Christianity, but appears to be a defining feature.
The Problem of Atheism
Evangelical Christianity, as a whole, tends to more prevalent in countries with higher levels of religiosity. Regions such as the USA, South America and sub-Saharan Africa have large numbers of Evangelical Christians in contrast to Northern Europe. Most evangelicals attending this congress, then, will have come from countries with a low percentage of atheists in their population.
This makes it all the more surprising that the number one issue seen as a threat to Evangelicism was “The influence of secularism” (secularism and atheism/non belief in God is frequently used within the survey as meaning the same thing). 71% of evangelicals saw this as a major threat while 20% viewed it as a minor threat. In comparison, the influence of Islam is seen as a major threat by 47% of evangelicals and government restrictions on religion by 22%.
Taking these figures into account, we can perhaps see why atheists figure prominently in another survey result—the views of other religious traditions.
Atheists are the number one most hated group by evangelicals, 70% of whom say they have an unfavorable opinion of atheists, although Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims (65%, 65% and 67% unfavorable, respectively) are close behind.
Curiously, though, when asked about how they perceive the friendliness of other religious groups towards evangelicals, only a minority of evangelicals (45%) view atheists as unfriendly, with most perceiving atheists as either neutral (49%) or friendly (8%). The figures for the perceived friendliness of atheists are very similar to those of Jews, Buddhists and Hindus—Muslims were the exception, with 69% of evangelicals perceiving them as unfriendly towards evangelicals.
So, compared to other non Christian groups, atheists are not perceived as particularly unfriendly towards evangelicals, yet we are by far the most hated group. Perhaps it's our inherent tendency towards violence that is the problem (remember Stalin!)
Apparently not. The survey asked whether some religions were more prone to violence than others. Despite atheism being one of the possible answers in this question, not a single evangelical answered that atheism was prone to violence. Considering that some of the evangelicals at the conference will have come from countries in Northern Europe with atheist majorities, they would have been aware if the gradual drop in Northern European religiosity resulted in believers getting carted off to the killing fjords.
So, on to the final mention of atheists in the survey.
Guess who evangelicals see as the top priority for evangelization?
Yes! It's us again!
73% of evangelicals view the non-religious as the top target for evangelization.
This compares to 59% voting for Muslims and 27% for Jews.
Unfortunately, the survey only hints at how this evangelization process might proceed. When asked about their missionary position evangelicals were firm: the vast majority (86%) viewed using local missionaries, rather than sending in outsiders, to try to convert people of a different belief.
In terms of converting atheists, though, this seems problematic.
Evangelicals trying to convert atheists would need a missionary who is an atheist yet agrees with them on many core issues. This missionary would need to have an almost irrational hatred for outspoken atheism, a love of religious belief and an almost uncanny ability to get up atheists' noses. Where on earth will they find someone like that?
OK, now that we've covered the serious stuff in the survey, we can look at the answers to the set of humorous questions that some comedian on the staff of the Pew foundation slipped in for a laugh.
First, remember how everyone agreed that Harold Camping was a lunatic for telling everyone who would listen that Jesus was about to return to Earth to rapture up to heaven a subset of believers, leaving the rest of us to suffer a seven year period of tribulation? Well apparently ‘everyone' did not include the evangelical community, an overall majority of whom answered that Jesus will return during their lifetimes (44% say probably and 8% say they will definitely return) and that the rapture and tribulation will occur (61% agree).
There also appears to be a curious hatred for “Yoga as a spiritual practice” amongst evangelicals, with 92% saying that it is incompatible with evangelical Christianity. One suspects that an intervention by Chris Mooney and Elaine Howard Ecklund is required (these evangelicals are clearly interpreting the word “spiritual” the wrong way, aren't they?)
Of particular interest in this survey is the direct connection many of the leadership of the evangelical community appear to have with God Himself.
“Nearly all the evangelical leaders surveyed (94%) say they have received a direct answer to a specific prayer request at some point in the past.”
Is God Confused?
Despite this direct line to the top, there seems to be a curious variation in what God is telling different leaders, especially when you ask evangelicals who come from North America and Europe (Global North) compared to evangelicals from the Middle East and Africa (Global South). For instance God seems very confused about alcohol.
“A majority (73%) of the leaders from the Global North consider alcohol consumption to be compatible with being a good evangelical Christian. By contrast, a similarly large majority of the leaders from the Global South (75%) say alcohol consumption is not compatible with being a good evangelical.”
And that's not all.
Despite 84% of worldwide evangelical leaders saying that homosexuality should be discouraged, a majority of evangelical leaders (51%) from South and Central America answered that homosexuality should be accepted by society.
What's more, there appears to be a marked difference in views on how women should be treated.
“Among U.S. leaders, 44% agree women should stay at home, while 53% disagree. Leaders in Europe, however, reject the idea of women staying at home by a more than two-to-one margin, 69% to 28%.”
and
“European leaders (62%) and North American leaders (54%) are especially likely to reject the idea that a wife must always obey their husband. On the other hand, upwards of 60% of leaders from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East-North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region agree that a wife must always obey them
The secularist might suspect that major differences in fundamental beliefs (acceptance of homosexuality, treatment of women, whether it is acceptable to drink alcohol) might be due, not to revelatory instructions from on high (after all, all of these folks purport to believe in the same Scripture), but to underlying social conditions such as the level of education of the population, whether there is an adequate social welfare and healthcare system in place, and the value placed on knowledge, equality and freedom of expression.
Summary
In conclusion, we can look at this report as an important and informative study of a group we need to take seriously due to their numbers and influence. Harold Camping gets mocked by TV networks and ignored by those in power, while Rick Warren gets a slot on the Presidential podium.
While evangelicals' opinions on social matters vary depending on the social norms of their locality, we find that rejection of evolution by evangelicals is universal. Finally, we note that the greatest perceived threat to evangelical Christianity is the effect of the non-religious.
Well, at least they got that one right!
The word on the street is that maybe - just maybe - a "critically-acclaimed Star Wars RPG" is on its way to the iPad.
An Aspyr Media newsletter sent out yesterday to subscribers may have given them a little more insight into the company's plans than it intended. It was an ad for a "Memorial Day Madness" sale featuring a half-price deal on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and its DLC, but the header above it referred to something entirely different, stating, "The critically-acclaimed Star Wars RPG is now available on iPad." According to IGN, to whom a copy of the email was sent, that can mean only one thing: KOTOR.
Why that particular game? For one thing, Aspyr is the company that ported Knights of the Old Republic to the Mac; it's also got a couple of games of its own on the App Store, most recently Sushi Mushi, so it obviously knows its way around iOS. IGN also claims that the email jibes with other KOTOR-related rumors it's heard, and let us not forget that it wouldn't be the first hit BioWare RPG to make the move to the platform: Baldur's Gate made a very successful mobile transition late last year.
Finally, there's this one very simple question: What else would it be? We all have our favorites but if you ask gamers to name an acclaimed Star Wars RPG, the one that's going to come up far and away the most often is Knights of the Old Republic.
It's a solid idea - KOTOR is well-remembered and tuning it up for the iPad would be a good way to squeeze out some fresh revenue without having to actually, you know, come up with a new idea - and re-releasing one of the best Star Wars games ever made on a new platform would certainly seem to fit with Disney's long-term plans to revive and monetize the franchise. It's still a leap, yes, but it doesn't sound entirely unreasonable - and that's why they call 'em rumors.

Nothing quite captures the flavors of butternut squash like these pillowy dumplings. Dressed in a poppy seed and butter sauce, this dish is bound to be a fall-time favorite. Enjoy it with good friends and a nicely chilled bottle of Chardonnay.
1 small butternut squash
1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup of flour, more than needed
1 egg
1 teaspoon of nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt
1. Remove the end of the squash with the stem and then divide the whole thing in two by cutting it near the bulbous base. Then halve both of those sections lengthwise.
2. Scoop out the seeds from the base and cut the squash into equal parts.
3. Place the pieces in a baking dish with a bit of water, about 1/8 inch. Cover the dish with tinfoil and roast at 425 degrees for about an hour, or until the flesh is tender.
4. Remove the baking dish from the stove and let the squash cool. Once cooled, scoop out the flesh into a large mixing bowl and mash well.
5. Add 1/2 cup of the flour, nutmeg, cheese, salt and the egg. If your squash has not cooled properly, the egg will begin to cook. You don't want that to happen.
6. Work the mixture with your hands, adding a bit more flour if needed. The dough will be sticky and a royal pain to work with. But the end result is worth it!
7. Let's test the mixture. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and drop in a bite-sized piece of the dough. The idea here is to proof your gnocchi, to make sure it holds instead of dissolving in the water. If it dissolves, work more flour into the mixture until that balance is achieved.
8. Lightly coat your work surface with flour and roll out a tube of the mixture. This part can be a bit frustrating as the dough sticks to everything. But after you do it a few times, you will have the hang of it or you will hate me for attempting this recipe in the first place.
9. Using a knife, cut the tubes of dough into bite-sized pieces.
10. Roll the pieces into balls and place them on floured parchment paper.
11. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, reduce it to a low simmer and carefully add the gnocchi. They are delicate, so do not treat them like store bought pasta.
12. When they are completely cooked, the gnocchi will begin to float to the top of the water. Carefully transfer them to a colander using a slotted spoon. Lightly rinse them with warm water.
Gnocchi is best served with a lightweight sauce. I simply warmed a stick of butter with some poppy seeds and a bit of salt. Sage is another good addition for your butter sauce.

Uber riders have taken 5 billion trips using the service the company announced today, more than doubling the two billion milestones it hit back in 2016. The 5 billion mark was actually crossed in May. 156 trips began at 7:29:06 AM GMT on May 20, Uber says, putting the ride hailing service over the edge.
That's a lot of trips for Uber, which is likely celebrating the traction under a cloud at the moment, given the fact that its CEO has just resigned, the results of an independent investigation into its culture found a lot of problems, and it's dealing with a mounting pile of legal troubles. It's hard to tell thus far how much that's impacting Uber's actual business, however; the company has been touting growth among ridership in 2017, though recent third-party stats including app downloads suggest rivals like Lyft are starting to gain on Uber's market lead.
Uber's 5 billionth trip isn't just cause for the beleaguered company to enjoy some good news for once; the company is also rewarding all 156 of the drivers that provided the rides while it crossed the 5 billion mark with a $500 bonus. Riders – just look back at your history and find out if you were part of that, and your reward is the knowledge that you helped make up this engagement stat.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Late Saturday afternoon, Golden State Warriors star forward Draymond Green expressed some surprise Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard didn't get the ball early in Game 1.
When the afternoon was over, Howard finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds in the Rockets' 104-78 loss. They did take 10 shot attempts; however, Howard hasn't produced consecutive games with double-digit shot attempts since early March.
Game 2 is Monday.
“I thank Draymond Green for saying that,” Howard said after practice on Sunday. “But other than that I can't focus on that. I can't put my mindset if I get the ball. I got to do what I can regardless.”
The number of shots has been a topic of debate around the Rockets star for the last two months of the season. And with the Rockets struggling on offense in Game 1 against the Warriors, there is a thought the big man would get some touches to slow the game down.
“I think we average one-to-two passes before we shot the ball,” Howard said. “More passes and get everybody involved and make them have to play defense throughout the shot clock.”
Howard isn't going to demand to touch the ball more or become the second option in the offense after James Harden, the leading scorer. Howard said their goal is to do whatever they can to push the Rockets to a possible upset of the Warriors, who they trail 1-0 in this best-of-seven series.
In the regular season, Howard averaged 8.5 field-goal attempts per game, lowest since their rookie season of 2004-05. Their usage rate was 18.4, the lowest since their rookie season. In their career, Howard has averaged 11.7 shot attempts per game.
He's near that average now, and with Game 2 so critical for the Rockets, it's uncertain if Howard will get double-digits in field-goal attempts.
“As a competitor, I'm going to get the job done, no matter what it takes,” Howard said. “If I get the ball, if I don't get the ball, if I score two points or I score 30 points. I got to go out there and play as hard as I can as long as I'm on the floor, that's all that really matters.”
There's a phrase that always comes up when reading about the Rays.
Those who cheer for the Rays use it. As do those who read about them and talk about them.
I've used it. We all use it.
Well, that's just what the Tampa Bay Times does.
It's a catch-all phrase that describes how the Tampa Bay Times chooses to write about their local franchise, how they criticize their team.
Well, that's just what the Tampa Bay Times does.
What is that, exactly?
They criticize any trade of an expiring or expensive contract that brings back prospects. They complain when the Rays sign players coming off bad seasons. They even complain when the Rays bring in good players if they're coming off injuries.
In fact, that pretty much sums up the Times's major offseason articles so far.
The Rays traded a second baseman on the wrong side of 30, Logan Forsythe, for a high impact prospect with six years of control in Jose De Leon. They signed an elite defender in Colby Rasmus, a veteran player rejoining the hitting coach that made them a success story. They signed Wilson Ramos, the best free agent catcher on the market who could turn into the best catcher the Rays have ever had, and signed them for two seasons to take advantage of their recovery from knee surgery. He'll likely return in May.
It's the kind of offseason that gets people fired up, but you wouldn't know it from reading the only newspaper in Tampa Bay.
What else happened?
The Rays traded Drew Smyly, an unfortunately broken pitcher who was the major league piece of the David Price trade in 2014. Smyly went on to outpitch Price in the second half that season, but a casual fan may not realize that deal was built around the Rays' shortstop of the future, top prospect Willy Adames. In the new Smyly trade, they picked up … another young guy(!), outfielder Mallex Smith, who has blistering speed and solves the Rays outfield depth woes of last season, as well as two other prospects with major league projections.
That's what the Rays do.
They learn from their mistakes with a goal to improve from a 68-win season — even without the Tampa Bay Times's support.
Fans are tired of reading it. You can bet some of the players have grown weary of it as well.
Sadly, it is the reality of the situation. The Rays front office is doing what it can. They simply don't have the local support to lure big-ticket free agents or even keep many of their own stars in the spotlight. This isn't breaking news.
This isn't to suggest that all articles written by The Times are bad ones. This Forsythe-for-De Leon trade might turn out to earn praise for the Rays. They know they should stop acting as if the Rays just traded away Ryne Sandberg. Come summer, the Ramos signing might be the shrewdest move in the majors.
But it's always the same kind of skepticism, and it's always wait-and-see.
Most Rays followers get it. They understand the plan and why it has to be that way. But knowing it doesn't make reading someone's criticism any less depressing. They go into an offseason knowing they don't have a prayer of their newspaper publishing articles about how the Rays don't need to drop top dollar on aging players like Edwin Encarnacion or Mark Trumbo or even Jose Bautista. Imagine the criticism the team would face if they broke their budget on a bad deal!
That's depressing.
So is going into the regular season knowing that everything has to go almost perfectly for the Rays to have a chance of getting national media coverage with the big boys like the Red Sox.
The Rays are not alone in dollar store criticisms either.
You get brief windows of success that garner positive articles, followed by stretches of rebuilding with harsh criticism. That's where the Rays are now. Rebuilding.
The Rays are trying to get back to the postseason for the first time since 2013. At the same time, they have to be mindful of what this team is going to look like in two years, three years, five years.
So the Rays have two choices, neither of which is ideal.
They can blow the whole thing up and start from scratch, like the Astros did when they lost 100 games three years in a row and, two years later, made the playoffs.
Or the Rays can do what they are doing: get good pitching, build around selected veterans such as Evan Longoria and Kevin Kiermaier, find the right (and cheap) pieces to put around them and hope it all works out.
Will the Times praise the Rays for making the best of a tough situation? It didn't last season, but that doesn't mean it won't this season.
Wait and see.
But the Rays must realize that frustrated writers aren't going to love them unconditionally.
They'll complain, and rightfully so, if the plan doesn't work. They'll stay away, and rightfully so, if there's another 90-loss season in store. They stop celebrating the team if it's no good.
That's just what these writers do.
This article was written to lampoon the recent article Lamenting another uninspiring offseason of The Rays Way 01/26/17 [Last modified: Friday, January 27, 2017 6:53am] by Tom Jones of the Tampa Bay Times.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. – The Humane Society of West Michigan is in need of food donations for its hundreds of cats and dogs.
This week, the organization began running low on canned food. One of the employees we spoke to said that without donations, they're likely to run out of food.
“When we have almost 300 animals in our care you go through it quicker than you would expect,” Nicole Cook, an employee with the humane society, said.
While visiting the animals, FOX 17 got to see first hand just how important those donations really are. Two barrels, which are usually filled to the top with food, contained no more than 20 cans each.
“We're completely donor funded. So all of our money and support is right here in our community,” Cook said.
Cook said workers can buy some canned food for the animals, but that the money would be taken from their funds, which are often times needed for other means of caring for the pets, such as when they need medical treatment.
The animals aren't picky when it comes to a certain brand of food. They just need it to come in a can.
“The important thing with canned food is that it's full of nutrients and gives them that extra capability to keep sustaining when they're in our care,” Cook said. “It gets stressful here so we want to make sure we reinstate that supply here, quickly.”
The animals are also in need of toys.
If you want to donate canned food or toys you can drop your gift off to the Humane Society of West Michigan. Or, you can also purchase items from the organizations Amazon Wish List and send it to them directly.
Back in May, FOX 17 reported on problems facing animals in Calhoun County. A group there is also seeking assistance.

In the wake of Operation: Gnomeregan, survivors of the fallout will make their way to New Tinkertown, the gnomes' foothold outside their captured city. From there they will be called into action by the high tinker themselves to help protect reclaimed gnomish land from new and imminent threats.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Wall Street suffered its bloodiest day of the year Friday as U.S. stocks sank more than 2% following an ugly jobs report. The Dow erased all its gains for the year, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moved into correction territory, down more than 10% from the year's highs.
The sell-off was broad, with all 30 Dow components ending in the red, and 97% of the S&P 500 closing lower.
As jittery investors fled stocks, they plowed into the safety of U.S. government debt, pushing the yields on the 10-year Treasury note and the 30-year Treasury bond to fresh record lows.
The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) plunged 275 points, or 2.2%, the biggest one-day drop since November. The blue-chip index gave up all its gains for the year, and is now 99 points below where it finished 2011. The S&P 500 (SPX) lost 32 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq (COMP) dropped 80 points, or 2.8%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are now down more than 10% from their highs of the year, which means they are officially in what investors call a correction.
"The U.S. employment report was simply terrible," said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The May jobs report showed only 69,000 jobs were added to payrolls, less than half the 150,000 jobs forecast by economists surveyed by CNNMoney. The unemployment rate ticked higher for the first time in a year, rising to 8.2%.
The CNNMoney Fear and Greed index showed investor confidence sliding even farther into "extreme fear" territory on the news.
"The move in bond markets is even more telling," said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. "A 1.5% 10-year yield? That's fear."
Bond yields have been in record low territory for the past couple of weeks, as fears of Europe's escalating debt crisis have been building. A report on Friday showed the eurozone unemployment rate at a record high of 11%. (Unemployment rate - explain it to me)
Concerns about slowing growth in emerging markets, including China and India, have also put investors on edge. Two reports out of China Friday morning showed that the manufacturing sector contracted more than expected in May, fueling investors' concerns that the country may be headed for a hard landing.
As global economic growth has slowed in the last year, exports to Europe -- China's largest foreign market -- have taken a hit as the debt-ridden region teeters on the brink of recession.
"We've got concerns about Europe, China, India, the United States -- this is a global problem," said Saluzzi. "Investors have no place to hide."
Given the growing fears, and fragile market and economic environment, Saluzzi said central banks around the world -- particularly the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve -- will likely come out with plans to help stimulate the global economy.
Speculation that the Fed will launch a third round of bond buying, or QE3, which is meant to keep long-term interest rates low, has been growing, but Saluzzi is not convinced that it's the right solution.
"Interest rates are already low, and that hasn't worked," they said. "I'm sure the Fed will try something, because that's what it does, but it needs to attack from a different angle."
U.S. stocks finished in the red Thursday, ending a difficult month on a weak note. The Dow and S&P 500 dropped more than 6% in May, while the Nasdaq shed more than 7%.
Economy: Personal income and personal spending for April increased 0.2%. Analysts had expected the figure to increase by 0.3%.
The May installment of the ISM Manufacturing Index showed that U.S. manufacturing growth slowed in May. The index fell to 54.5, down from 54.8 last month and below expectations of 54. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in the sector.
April construction spending rose by 0.3%, but that was below forecasts for a 0.5% rise.
Companies: Shares of Facebook (FB) hit a fresh low of $26.83 Thursday before bouncing back, ending the day up 5% at $29.60. The stock edged higher Friday, closing up 0.1%.
Shares of food producer Sara Lee (SLE, Fortune 500) slipped after the company said it was spinning off its international coffee and tea business, which will pay a special dividend to existing Sara Lee shareholders. Sara Lee also announced a 1-for-5 reverse stock split.
BP (BP) said it was considering selling its 50% stake in TNK-BP, a Russian oil joint venture, after it received an unsolicited bid for the holding. Shares of BP gained ground.
Groupon (GRPN) shares fell. The online discount service, which has been dogged with questions about its accounting practices since its initial public offering in November, ends its lock-up period Friday, meaning that insiders who own shares will be able to sell them.
The nation's Big Three automakers -- General Motors (GM, Fortune 500), Ford Motor (F, Fortune 500) and Chrysler -- all reported a jump in car sales in May, but the results were less than expected by some analysts -- another sign that the U.S. economy, while growing, remains weaker than hoped.
World markets: European stocks closed deep in the red. Britain's FTSE 100 (UKX) dropped 0.9%, while the DAX (DAX) in Germany sank 3.2% and France's CAC 40 (CAC40) tumbled 2.5%.
Asian markets ended mixed. The Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) closed slightly above breakeven, while the Hang Seng (HSI) in Hong Kong slid 0.4% and Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 1.2%.
Currencies and commodities: The dollar rose against the British pound, but fell versus the euro and the Japanese yen.
Oil for July delivery slid $3.30, or 3.8%, to settle at $83.23 a barrel.
Gold futures for August delivery rose $57.90 to settle at $1,622.10 an ounce.
The auctioning of a tiny sled named Rosebud for $60,500 suggests that prop art could be the newest form of gold in the hills of Hollywood. ''Rosebud,'' was the word the dying Citizen Kane gasped out, referring to a cheap sled taken from them when they were a child.
The final shot in the great 1941 film shows what looks like the real Rosebud being tossed in a furnace by indifferent workmen. In fact, says Sotheby Parke Bernet, three balsa sleds were used for the film and what it was putting up for sale is the last survivor.
That is why producer Steven Spielberg eagerly bid $55,000 plus a 10 percent buyer's fee. But is the sled the only authentic Rosebud? Here comes the interesting catch in prop art. A Port Jefferson film buff claims that they won the real Rosebud as a contest prize back in 1941.
Wherever there is money in collectibles, there are bound to be fakes and arguments over authenticity. Who will claim to have found the trenchcoat worn by Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca''? And how will they be able to prove it? There are also bound to be those who bet on the future of the market. For Mr. Spielberg themselves now to autograph the harpoons really used in their own modern classic, ''Jaws,'' would be prudent, though some might say improper.

Russia refused to host the Paralympic games in 1980, but today the country's disabled athletes are the subjects of a poster campaign in the Moscow metro. Will the new visibility improve life for Russia's disabled population?
As the 1980 Moscow Olympics approached, a Soviet official was asked whether their country would host that year's Paralympics for the first time.
“There are no invalids in the U.S.S.R.!” they thundered back, a phrase that went down in history.
The 1980 Paralympics were held in the Netherlands instead.
Russia has come a long way in 34 years - in March, just after the Olympics, the country will host its first Winter Paralympics in Sochi, and as reigning champions of the medals table, no less.
That's an inspirational story, but the Paralympics are full of them.
You may remember Alex Zanardi, the champion racecar driver who lost both their legs in a horrific 2001 crash but won gold as a Paralympic cyclist last year in London. In a neat twist of fate, the race was held at Brands Hatch auto track, where Zanardi had raced many times in their past career, but never won.
Possibly the most dominant athlete in history, Esther Vergeer won 42 Grand Slams and seven Paralympic tennis gold medals before retiring last year on a 470-match unbeaten streak. Oh, and they also found time to smash down more barriers with a sultry naked photo shoot in their wheelchair for the cover of ESPN Magazine.
Now Russia is recognizing the power of inspiration with an omnipresent poster campaign in the Moscow metro featuring some of the country's Paralympic heroes. The slogan is a play on the common Russian phrase “a person with limited opportunities,” a euphemism for disability. Instead, the poster declares: “Everyone's opportunities are limitless!”
It's a fine start, but inspiration on its own isn't enough. Last year's London Paralympics were a case in point. This August, a major survey found 81 percent of British disabled people felt no benefit from the Games, while access to disabled sports facilities remains patchy.
Russia's Sports Ministry, which always loves gold medals, is pouring funding into elite disabled sports, but there's not much available for the many people whose trip to the nearest grocery means an undignified haul up and down steps.
By law, buildings in Russia are supposed to have disability access, but most don't. Russian bloggers collect photos of half-hearted efforts to comply - wheelchair ramps built at 45 degrees or leading into a wall – in online photo galleries that are sometimes funny but always heartbreaking.
Russia has a large population of disabled people, but often they are invisible, shut away in apartments or state institutions. Even on the current poster campaign, careful cropping ensures the athletes' faces are shown but not their disabilities.
Things are getting better, however, and the Paralympics are helping.
Last year, to mark 500 days until the Sochi Paralympic opening ceremony, a Wiki-style online map was launched where disabled people could mark accessible buildings.
To start with, it was nothing to write home about - even in Sochi, just two buildings were included, one of them the offices of the Games' organizing committee.
Since then, it has quietly blossomed. Activists across the country have added thousands of sites in dozens of cities. It's far from perfect - the Siberian city of Irkutsk, home to 600,000, oddly does not have any buildings marked at all - but it's a promising development.
More access means more visibility for ordinary disabled people, and the same is true for athletes.
For years, Russia's Paralympians beat the world's best, but you'd be hard pressed to find them covered on any major TV network. The London Games marked a watershed, with dedicated broadcasts appearing for the first time, and there is no way for state TV to ignore a Paralympic Games taking place at home.
For decades, Russia has had an uneasy relationship with its disabled population. Many of them are injured veterans of the Chechen wars or the Soviet war in Afghanistan, chapters of history that many would prefer to forget, even as many of those same veterans win gold medal after gold medal.
Now circumstances are forcing a rethink. Russia's Olympic ambitions mean hosting the Paralympics too - and, hopefully, an end to invisibility.
From “no invalids” to champions in 34 years - now that's inspiring.

QUEENS -- Police are looking for a man who donned a mask and raped a woman at knifepoint in Queens early Wednesday morning.
Surveillance video shows the man putting on a mask then hiding in the bushes until the woman who was coming home from work passes around 4:30 a.m. in the area of 34-30 84th Street.
The suspect then follows the 35-year-old woman for a few blocks until they reach 84th Street and 35th Avenue, where they demanded money, grabbed them and forced a sharp blade to their throat. Police say they then pulled the woman to an alley between two houses and raped them
The suspect is described as a Hispanic man, who is 5'4", slim build and was last seen wearing a mask, a dark colored shirt and jeans.
Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
Buenos Aires: Argentina midfielder Fernando Gago could miss the World Cup after their club Boca Juniors said on Monday that they would need up to 60 days to recover from a knee injury.
A scan revealed ligament damage after Gago suffered a hard knock during Boca's 0-0 draw at Colon in Santa Fe in an Argentine first division match on Sunday.
"The midfielder suffered a grade two sprains in their left knee, with partial lesion of the collateral medial ligament," Boca said on their official website (www.bocajuniors.com.ar).
Club doctors recommended the knee be immobilised for a fortnight and that Gago, who will miss the rest of the Argentine season which ends in mid-May, should then begin rehabilitation.
Argentina play Bosnia-Herzegovina in Rio de Janeiro in their opening Group F match on June 15. They also face Iran and Nigeria in the group.
With the release of the WWE Network, subscribers now have more content just a few clicks away than they could ever hope to sift through themselves. Last Word on Sports is here to do the work for you, highlighting the best the WWE Network has to offer.
What better time to start this feature off than during the buildup to the biggest event in professional wrestling history, WrestleMania XXX? And what better wrestler to highlight than the Showstopper himself, Mr. WrestleMania Shawn Michaels?
Between WrestleMania's V and XXVI, the Heartbreak Kid competed 16 times at the Granddaddy of Them All. During that span they were a part of some of the most notable matches in the history of WrestleMania, so ingraining themselves with the event that it warranted its own DVD. However, if you're already a subscriber of the Network, we're here to save you $19.96 with our guide to Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania V: w/ Marty Jannetty vs. The Twin Towers
While the HBK seen here is almost unrecognizable, clad in neon tights and sporting flowing blonde locks, once the match gets going they become instantly recognizable. Michaels may have started their WrestleMania career with loss, but they were clearly the best wrestler in the ring that night.
Highlight: The Rockers' double missile dropkick to Big Boss Man.
WrestleMania X: vs. Razor Ramon
The second ladder match in WWE history, and the first one ever aired, this bout has been the standard to which all other ladder matches are held. In a world where the word “innovative” is thrown around constantly, this is one match that actually earned that moniker. Shawn Michaels demonstrated their aptitude for acrobatics here, and this was Razor at their very best.
Highlight: HBK's diving splash off of the ladder.
WrestleMania XII: vs. Bret “Hit Man” Hart
My first exposure to Shawn Michaels came via video packages of this win: watching HBK dropping to their knees in triumphant exhaustion, hearing Vince below “the boyhood dream has come true.” You can't help but feel as if you're witnessing something truly special. The match doesn't lend itself too well to repeat viewings, but it's something every wrestling fan should watch at least once the whole way through.
Highlight: The asupervisorstioned celebration.
WrestleMania XIV: vs. “Stone Cold” Steve Austin
Looking back, this match signifies the beginning of what was perhaps the biggest boom period in the history of the industry: the Attitude Era. Austin and HBK put on a great match that exemplified what has become the WWE main event style. Add in significant star power courtesy of Mike Tyson and the fact that HBK was working with a spine apparently being held together with duct tape, you have one hell of a WrestleMania main event.
Highlight: Stone Cold's counter of a Sweet Chin Music into a Stunner to seal the deal.
WrestleMania 21: vs. Kurt Angle
While their recent exploits seem to have taken precedent in the minds of fans, there is no doubt that Kurt Angle is one of the greatest technical wrestlers in history. Here, they and Michaels clash in a near-half-hour-long bout that was wisely given far more time than anything else on the card. It's a shame these two weren't able to meet at Mania again.
Highlight: The psychology involving the Angle Lock and Sweet Chin Music.
WrestleMania XXIV: vs. Ric Flair
After being informed by Vince McMahon that they would be fired the next time they lost a match, “The Nature Boy” chose to put their career on the line against Shawn Michaels at what would be their final WrestleMania. While Flair couldn't go like they used to physically, these two infused a level of pathos into this match like so few men have ever been able to do inside the squared circle.
Highlight: “I'm sorry. I love you.”
Wrestlemania XXV: vs. The Undertaker
This match marked the beginning of the WWE's elevation of “The Streak” to mythological proportions. Heading into the contest, HBK had been feuding with “The Deadman,” one of their greatest rivals, over the latter's undefeated record at WrestleMania; making sure to note that ‘Taker had never bested them in singles competition. These two went on to deliver what many consider to be the finest match of either man's storied career.
Highlight: The Undertaker's borderline insane suicide dive.
Wrestlemania XXVI: vs. The Undertaker
Just two years after retiring “The Nature Boy” at the same event, Shawn Michaels goaded The Undertaker into a rematch by putting their very own career on the line. The video package preceding this match is as good as anything this side of Austin/Rock WrestleMania 17. While the consensus, perhaps accurately so, is that this match didn't live up their affair the previous year, Michaels went out on about as high and fitting a note as one could imagine: the main event of WrestleMania.
Highlight: Michaels slashing their throat and slapping Undertaker in the face, daring The Deadman to finish him.

The United States of America is a great country. You can debate absolutely anything, whether or not it has merit, and whether or not it's any of your business.
But guns? There's nothing to debate. Throw out all the numbers and expert opinions. I've got your expert right here, and it's called EXPERIENCE.
Just before midnight June 30th, my husband, Chuck de Caro, and I and our Weimaraner were four days into an all-American, cross-country road trip. We'd just dined with a friend in Albuquerque and intended to hit historic Route 66, then stop for the night.
Realizing it was late and Route 66 is no fun in the dark, we stopped at a pet-friendly Motel 6. Chuck showered; I went to the car for dog food.
They were making wild passes with their gun. Finally they lunged at the briefcase in front of me, and headed for the door. For a second, I thought he'd leave. Instead, they opened fire on my husband.
The armed guard patrolling the second floor was engrossed in a phone conversation, instead of checking the parking lot.
I unlocked our door, picked up the food I'd placed at my feet and was assaulted by a jackass with a big, silver semi-automatic weapon.
They shoved me into the room. I was airborne and landed on the bed. They shut the door and stood behind it, gun on me, debating their next move.
They didn't expect Chuck to open the bathroom door. My husband (Air Force Academy, U.S. Army Special Forces), said "What's going on here?" and advanced into the room. Stark naked and dripping wet, they maneuvered themselves in front of the small table between the beds, concealing two small .380 legal handguns we'd brought in from the car.
I moved around, we spoke to the assailant, kept them busy, offered them things, kept them from focusing. We felt he'd shoot when he'd gotten what they wanted. They were comfortable with the situation, had been there before.
I walked my purse to Chuck, talking about finding something inside. I reached behind Chuck and slipped a gun in, then handed it to him, asking if they could see anything that we might give the man. They said yes, wrapping their hand around the gun.
The assailant grew agitated as I again walked across the room, splitting their concentration. They were making wild passes with their gun. Finally they lunged at the briefcase in front of me, and headed for the door.
For a second, I thought he'd leave. Instead, they opened fire on my husband. Chuck returned fire, emptying their gun even as they were bleeding profusely.
Bottom line: Assailant DOA in the parking lot. My hero recovering from five gunshot wounds. We both are alive.
Now, ask me how I feel about the right to bear arms.
Here's the truth:
1. Criminals will always have guns, this is not about them.
2. Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms. Humans have a right to defend themselves. If we didn't have the Second Amendment, we would create it.
3. You can't control everything; but if it makes you feel better, go with a simple law preventing violent offenders from buying firearms. Make it "violent" offenders rather than "white collar" offenders, or most of Capitol Hill won't be allowed to own them.
4. Get a gun, get legal, be responsible, trust yourself. Don't trust yourself? Then don't carry. But for God's sake then, shut the f**k up about it, because that's where your involvement ends.
Chuck and I were married one year ago, on the Fourth of July. Sure, we celebrated our first wedding anniversary in a hospital. But thanks to the Second Amendment, my crack-shot husband and the pistol they used, we were able to have a first anniversary.
Doctors recommended that Max Park, 10, try playing with a Rubik's Cube to improve their fine motor skills. Little did they know the boy with autism would become one of the world's best.
Today, just a few years after they started playing with the the 3-D puzzle, Park is ranked among the 100 fastest players on the planet, but finding out they could compete with the best of them occurred by chance.
The San Diego, Calif. boy convinced their mom and dad to travel to Los Angeles for a Rubik's Cube competition so that they could observe top players at work. But Park ended up participating.

Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in the famous Steele dossier, which posited that connections exist between President Donald Trump and Russia.
Sources cited in the Washington Post story did not disclose dollar amounts paid to the firm that conducted the research, but they said Clinton's campaign and the DNC shared the cost.
That is firm, Fusion GPS, hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.
Marc E. Elias is a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign as well as the DNC, and made the decision to work with Fusion GPS in April 2016. At that point was funded by an unknown GOP client while the primary was still going on.
Steele gave reports and other documents to Elias, but one source claimed that they or they were not aware of the role of Steele's work.
The people aware of the matter claimed that the Clinton campaign didn't direct Steele's research.
Trump on Saturday called on the FBI to release the information about who paid for the dossier.
Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017
Fusion GPS hasn't named the Democrat or group behind Steele's work despite congressional Republican objections, citing confidentiality agreements.
Last week, Fusion GPS invoked the Fifth Amendment to not answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee. Its founder has however previously given an interview to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Fusion GPS has been fighting the release of its bank records and has until Friday to negotiate a resolution with Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.).
Immediately following the Washington Post article being published, New York Times reporters pursuing this story complained about the Clinton camp denying it. They accused Elias and Clinton's team of lying to them "with sanctimony" for the last year.
When I tried to report this story, Clinton campaign lawyer @marceelias pushed back vigorously, saying "You (or your sources) are wrong." https://t.co/B5BZwoaNhI — Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) October 24, 2017
Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year https://t.co/vXKRV1wRJc — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 24, 2017
EDITOR'S NOTE: Prior to October 27, 2017, the Washington Free Beacon published several articles referencing the research firm Fusion GPS that did not disclose the relationship between Fusion GPS and the Washington Free Beacon. The reason for this omission is that the authors of these articles, and the particular editors who reviewed them, were unaware of this relationship.
The articles in question tended to be aggregated stories relying on the reporting done by other media outlets. This type of article undergoes a different editorial process from the original investigative pieces that appear on our website. Beginning today, all articles referencing Fusion GPS will mention its history with the Washington Free Beacon. The Free Beacon is also reviewing its editorial process with respect to aggregated news sources to consider ways to avoid similar issues in the future. We regret the error.
In efforts to raise revenues for the state, in January 2016 the government introduced an excise tax on wine. However, figures show that instead of making the predicted 65 million euros annually for the state, the new take hikes have only managed to bring on just 4 million euros in the first six months of the year.
The reason for the drastic contrast between the predicted revenue and what is being reported is that a profitable black market dealing with wine has begun to flourish.
The National Interprofessional Organization of Vine and Wine of Greece (EDOAO), responsible for the New Wines of Greece campaign, held a press conference recently to address this and other issues.
“The black market in wine has become highly organized since the excise tax was introduced in January. It existed before, but now the racket is run by big players,” George Skouras, the president of the Greek Wine Association (SEO) and a winemaker in Nemea, commented at the press conference. They explained, “They have built tanks underground so they can't be spotted by inspectors and have people scouring the countryside to buy grapes illegally, without invoices, off the books.”
The numbers noted regarding the amount of wine that ends up being sold on the black market are staggering. Yiannis Vogiatzis, a vintner in northern Greece and president of EDOAO noted that some experts' figures put the amount of wine consumed in Greece at only 35 percent being sold legally and subject to taxation, while 65 percent is sold illegally.
“The excise tax has ultimately acted as a punishment for those who want to do business legally,” Vogiatzis said.
Police are investigating after they say a man apparently broke into their ex-girlfriend's West Philadelphia home through a window only to be shot to death by their new boyfriend. (Published Monday, June 27, 2016)
A man died late Sunday night when police say they broke into their ex-girlfriend's Philadelphia home and was met by their new boyfriend, who shot them in the head.
Police said officers responded to the home on Edgewood Street near Walnut about 11:45 p.m. When they arrived, they found a 24-year-old man shot twice in the head and twice in the arm.
Medics pronounced the man dead at the scene just before midnight.
Police said a preliminary investigation showed that the man apparently broke into the home, where their ex-girlfriend lived, through a window and that their new boyfriend caught them and shot him. Two children were home at the time, police said, but no other injuries were reported in the incident.
Police said the suspected shooter was taken into police custody at the scene, but it was unclear whether charges would be filed against him.
Despite President-elect Donald Trump's plan to repeal Obamacare, more Americans are covered thanks to health care plans created through President Barak Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA). About 6.4 million people have enrolled in subsidized private coverage offered through Obamacare, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.
The department said 400,000 more people signed up for Obamacare by Monday compared to the amount of U.S. residents who had already participated in open enrollment during this time last year.
Although premiums have risen while insurers have declined, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said the number of people enrolling in Obamacare proves that “doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out.”
Despite the rising number of people opting for coverage through the ACA, new customers still only account for 32-percent of those covered through Obamacare compared to 40-percent of new customers that had signed up around the holidays in 2015. The administration officials said they would focus more on getting new customers now through the end of open enrollment on Jan. 31, in effort to reach their 13.8 million sign-ups goal.
Even still, uninsured rates across all 50 states are on the decline as people currently enrolled in Obamacare plans are re-enrolling in coverage and beefing up their premiums, according to a Wednesday report from The Commonwealth Fund. Researchers found the number of uninsured working-aged adults, low-income adults and children had declined across state lines since 2014. Kentucky had the biggest drop in uninsured rates with only 8-percent of working-age adults and 13-percent of low-income adults without health care. In comparison, 21-percent of working-age adults and 38-percent of low-income adults didn't have health coverage before full implementation of ACA's health care provisions.
However, people covered by Obamacare could be in jeopardy considering Trump's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though they have said there were some provisions they would consider keeping.
An Urban Institute analysis that compared the current structure of Obamacare to repeal bills presented by the Republican Party found that roughly 30 million people would lose insurance if Trump was to consider plans previously introduced by Republicans. Eighty-two percent of the people most affected by the repeal would be working families, 56-percent of which would be white.
Why “Eddie's Practices?”
Django has become one of the more popular web frameworks out there. I have been lucky enough to have worked with it for many years, starting in its early beta stages. I've used it to create many web applications on my own, and I've worked on many apps that were originally created by others.
As in most development environments, there are certain common issues that pop up again and again. Over the years, through trial and error, talking to other developers, and a lot of hard thinking, I've come up with some general approaches to many of these issues.
I have gotten a great response to my previous posts about Django, so I decided to create a new series of posts, dealing with these tips and techniques. I wouldn't have the hubris to call these “best practices,” because that would imply that my way is best for all developers. So I'll just go with “Eddie's Practices.” These are things that work for me, things I wish people had told me when I was starting out. I hope they work for you, too. Mileage may vary, as they say.
Tip #1: Think hard about what to name your project and your app.
We'll start with a basic one, but one that seems to come up over and over. When you get started with Django, you create a “project,” and then within that project you create an “app.” You need to come up with names for both of them. This may seem a trivial point – surely an app by any other name would be just as enterprisy. But it can affect your future development in unexpected ways.
For example, say you want to create a website for playing poker. Not a very far-fetched idea – there are a couple sites like that out there. So you check the Django getting started guide, and run the command to create the project:
~/src>django-admin.py startproject poker
Fair enough. It makes sense to call your poker project poker . But now, you need to create an app as well. What do you call that? Well, we can't use poker, as the following shows:
~/src/poker>python manage.py startapp poker
Error: You cannot create an app with the same name ('poker') as your project.
Hmm, you think. Maybe I can be clever! So you decide to name the app “game.” That way, you can refer to it as poker.game . Brilliant! It's a poker game!
Not so fast.
Oh sure, it seems fine for a while. You come up with a clever marketing strategy, you launch it at zoombidingle.net, you advertise it, you even start to get some users. After a while, you decide business is going well enough that you want to expand. Poker's great and all, but what people are really clamoring for these days is dominoes. The wave of domino-mania that is sweeping the nation is unprecedented. You don't want to miss out on your piece of the domino-pie, so you decide to create a Dominoes app.
As a smart business person, you see it makes sense to leverage your existing user base and just add on to Zoombidingle. You can even let your users use their existing virtual poker chips to buy into the domino tournament. Fine: cd into your project directory and start typing:
~/src/poker>python manage.py startapp ...
Now you're stuck.
It obviously makes sense to call the new app something like “dominoes,” but you have a nightmarish vision of having to type poker.dominoes all over your code. Besides sounding vaguely obscene (“I don't even know ‘er!”), it doesn't accurately describe the code's hierarchy. Add to that, you still have poker.game , but isn't dominoes a game, too?
So you rename things. You change your project name from poker to games . (You don't go with zoombidingle because you don't want to link the marketing decision of the site name with the codebase.) You change your old app name from game to poker . You do a bunch of grepping through the code base, hoping you catch every reference to those names, and hoping you don't forget which poker is which and don't confuse game with games . You update your web server configuration to point to the new directories. You deal with the errors Subversion always seems to give when you rename a directory, and voila! You have a new project hierarchy, and you can happily create your dominoes app and go on your merry way.
Ok, so is it a huge deal to have to rename things? Maybe not, but it's two or three hours of your time you could be using to write fresh code or catch up on Glee. It just makes sense to pick the right name in the first place.
And I know I'm not the only one who has run into this issue. I have taken over a development project where the “project” was called (let's say) fooblygoop, which was the name of the website. They apparently were not feeling very creative, so the “app” got named fooblygoop.fooblygoopapp . Bleah!
So now we come to a general rule of thumb. Eddie's Practice #1:
Think specific for the app name, think general for the project name.
The important thing to remember is that you may end up using the app in another project, and you may end up adding more apps to the current project. In fact, in my experience, this almost always happens. Even when you don't anticipate reuse, you'll often be surprised later to find yourself recycling an old app.
For the poker example, poker would have worked as the app name, or maybe something even more specific, like holdem if your site is a Texas Hold'em site. Then you could even market the app as a standalone plugin for third-party web sites.
For the project name, think about how you might possible expand the project in the future. games is nice and general. Or even funstuff if you're feeling whimsical.
Yes, this is a simple tip, but one that is well worth keeping in mind. It could save you a few hours and a few aspirins.
Stay tuned for more of these tips. They'll get more in depth and technical as they go along. And please let me know in the comment section if you find this helpful or you have anything you want to add.

Carrots are mutants.
Well, orange carrots at least. Originally, purple carrots were the norm, but there were some offshoots. Yellow and white ones appeared in the wild. Over time, 17th-century Dutch carrot growers managed to cultivate these yellow and white ones carrots into the orange ones we're familiar with today.
The purple ones still do exist, but they're by far the minority in the world of carrot colors. Want to try some? Beware — there may be a good reason why purple carrots are now the uncommon breed: the orange ones taste better. In fact, orange carrots may be a superfood of sorts when it comes to taste. A 2010 study showed that children said foods tasted better if favored cartoon character appeared on a box, with one food excepted: carrots.

Telltale has been fairly tight-lipped about the third season of its acclaimed series based on The Walking Dead. Fortunately for fans of the series, we won't have much longer to wait before we can finally get our hands on it. The studio has announced the release date, which is a few days before Christmas.
The first episode of The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series – A New Frontier will be available to download December 20 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, iOS, and Android. If your tastes lean more toward physical releases, a season-pass disc is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 7.
Players will experience the world of the undead four years after the initial outbreak as Javier, a young man who, like just about everyone else in the series, has lost their family. During their travels, they meet up with Clementine, who has emerged as the linchpin of Telltale's telling.
Telltale is showing off the game on stage during The Game Awards on Thursday, December 1, which start at 5:30 p.m. Pacific.
Our Take
Telltale's done a great job with this series in particular, and I'm optimistic that it will keep the streak going with the third season. Hopefully, the time between releases has given the studio time to craft another engaging story – and emboldened them to put in a puzzle or two, also.

Schumer said that the "first question" for the Trump administration is why the president decided to fire Comey now. The FBI is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 White House race, as well as any connections between Trump's campaign and Moscow.
"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?" Schumer asked during their quickly scheduled press conference.
Schumer also linked Comey's firing to the ouster of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and reiterated their call for the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor for the probe into the 2016 election.
"This is part of a deeply troubling pattern from the Trump administration," Schumer said. "This does not seem to be a coincidence."
Democrats have called for months for the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel, arguing someone appointed by the president would face political pressure.
Schumer added that if Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, refuses to appoint a special prosecutor, "every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a coverup."
"This investigation must be run as far away as possible from this White House," they said.

In a Sunday evening Twitter thread, former CIA agent and independent conservative presidential candidate Evan McMullin shared a list of 10 things Americans can do if President-elect Donald Trump governs with the authoritarianism on display in their campaign rhetoric.
McMullin advised Americans to educate themselves about their rights, and to consume and legitimate sources of information.
They stressed the importance of paying diligent attention to the actions and statements of the president-elect and their administration, and urged readers to speak up and hold their representatives accountable.
It will be crucial to stick together, reach across the aisle, and organize at a grassroots level in the coming years, McMullin said.
McMullin also penned a Monday New York Times Op-Ed on Trump's authoritarian rhetoric and the threat they pose to the constitution.
In the piece, McMullin describes a private meeting between Trump and House Republicans that they attended as chief policy director of the House Republican Conference. In the meeting, it became evident that Trump had scant knowledge of the constitution, McMullin claims.

But Trump's lack of knowledge of the government's documents is only part of the problem. The greater issue lies in the "authoritarian tendencies" evidenced by Trump's campaign rhetoric, McMullin wrote.
McMullin cites Trump's threats to press freedom, pledge to use torture, and attacks on Muslim Americans and other groups in the piece.
During the campaign, "He had also undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution," McMullin asserts.
Trump's attacks on Americans' constitutional rights haven't stopped since the election.
From the Times piece:
“Mr. Trump also recently inflated their election performance, claiming — without evidence — that they ‘won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.' This, too, is nothing new. Authoritarians often exaggerate their popular support to increase the perception of their legitimacy. But the deeper objective is to weaken the democratic institutions that limit their power. Eroding confidence in voting, elections and representative bodies gives them a freer hand to wield more power. "As a C.I.A. officer, I saw firsthand authoritarians' use of these tactics around the world. Their profound appetite for absolute power drives their intolerance for any restraint — whether by people, organizations, the law, cultural norms, principles or even the expectation of consistency. For a despot, all of these checks on power must be ignored, undermined or destroyed so that they are all that matters.”
In a final tweet, McMullin offered words from former President Abraham Lincoln.
Jang Woo Hyuk from the popular 90s K-Pop idol group H.O.T will be making a solo comeback in just a few days with a brand-new album!
On January 27th, a music insider confirmed the singer's comeback after five years since their last album release, Back To The Memories (November 2011). Having recently completed preparation for their album, the release date has been set for January 29th.
This is particularly interesting as H.O.T is also celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, thus the milestone and their solo comeback are coming hand-in-hand. With news of H.O.T's impending reunion later this year, there is high interest regarding Jang Woo Hyuk's solo album.
Jang Woo Hyuk is known for their excellent dancing skills, which is well-portrayed in their title track “Time is (L)over.”

Enough is enough.
At Salon.com I encounter an article lengthily titled, America's virulent racists: The sick ideas and perverted “science” of the American Renaissance, and published in a book by Harvard University Press. The burden of the piece is that American Renaissance and its honcho, Jared Taylor, are “Hitlerian,” “anti-Semitic,” and hold “extremist views.” These are grave accusations, implying among other things a desire to kill all Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, and so on. I found this interesting.
Several years ago I received an email from Jared Taylor, who apparently read my column, Fredoneverything.net, asking me to address AmRen's annual conference to talk about Mexico and Latin America. I knew little of AmRen at the time except that it was said to be venomously racist.
I accepted. I thought it would be interesting to see such a group, and reasoned that telling them the truth as I knew it of Latins could hardly be pernicious no matter who they were.
On arriving at the conference site, a hotel near Washington, D.C.'s Dulles Airport, from my home in Guadalajara, I looked for Jared, wondering what they would be like. I knew a little. I had learned that they grew up in Japan, had attended Japanese schools, and thus spoke perfect Japanese. They had also picked up an advanced degree in a French university, and spoke good French. Whatever they are, they aren't stupid.
They proved to be a courtly man, slim, and in perhaps their late fifties. We chatted briefly, they being busy running the convention. I asked them what topics they wanted me to address. “Anything you like, as long as it's about Latin America.” That was the limit of their guidance. Given that I live in Mexico, have a Mexican wife, and speak Spanish in the home, they can hardly have expected a denunciation of Latins.
I then set out to see what manner of wights the conventioneers might be. I had learned that members of AmRen were opposed to massive immigration from the south, believed blacks and Hispanics to be of lower average intelligence that whites, were alarmed at high rates of crime by blacks and Hispanics, believed that American policies were a failure, opposed compulsory integration, and wanted to preserve white European culture.
Why these were described as extremist or ideas of the fringe eluded me. Huge numbers of Americans opposed immigration, large numbers all through society agreed quietly as to the intelligence of blacks, much of the population quite liked white European culture, few thought racial policy a rousing success, and it was obvious from housing patterns that people usually liked living among their own. While one might disagree with any or all of these ideas, they were in the main stream of American thought. They simply were not favored by the dominant elites.
I found the attendees to be well-dressed, well-spoken, and well-educated, with name tags affixed to their jackets in the standard manner of conventions. As I remember they ran to middle-aged or older and, though certainly with exceptions, middle class, civil, and leaning toward dweebish. They seemed more worried than hostile. A society they valued was, at least as they saw it, being overrun by alien peoples.
The white supremacist label puzzled me. I didn't know what one was. Was it someone who wanted to rule over non-whites? Or someone who thought whites superior to all other races? Neither fit. It quickly became evident that these people did not want to rule over anyone. They wanted to be left alone. Nor did they seem obsessed with racial superiority. As a group they tended to accept the validity of IQ testing, which in intelligence puts humanity in the order, Ashkenazi Jews, North Asians, Caucasians, Hispanics, American blacks, African blacks. While one may question this, it was hard for me to see how people who regarded whites as intellectually inferior to North Asians could quite be called white supremacists. Jared, as I would later learn, had often and on the record expressed their belief in the superiority of North Asians.
I gave my address, telling the assembled that not all was darkness south of the Rio Bravo. While I didn't think unrestricted immigration a good idea, I said, there were nonetheless in Latin America modern countries that successfully operated airlines and telecommunications services, built commercial airliners (Embraer of Brazil) had first-rate thinkers and writers, and so on. I either said or implied–this was years ago–that these facts were not consistent with the low intelligence attributed to southern countries. The audience received this civilly, though it was not what they had expected to hear.
And that was that. No Nazi salutes, swastikas, KKK banners, exterminationist talk. No mention of Jews at all, of whom there were a fair few in the group. Whatever the AmRenners were, Brown Shirts they were not. A convention of dentists would have been more exciting.
All of this fit poorly with Professor Sussman's vituperation.
The next time I saw Jared was about a month ago, when I was in Washington for a high-school reunion. They invited me and my (again, Mexican) wife, Violeta Gonzalez, to dinner at their home in the Virginia suburbs. We accepted.
From the standpoint of the anthropology of extremism, the evening was a failure. Their wife and adolescent daughter were gracious and hospitable and spoke sometimes in English, sometimes in French. We talked mostly of linguistics, in which all had an interest, and Jared and me of military history, which they know particularly from the side of the Japanese, whom they admire.
One thing they categorically are not is anti-Jewish. I have known a few serious anti-Semites. They are obsessive, constantly launching into the dammed Jews this, and the Jews that, and who do the Jews think they are, etc. Jared does not. This is not surprising.  They are a proponent of white European civilization, to which Jews have been major contributors.
There you have Jared Taylor and American Renaissance as I have known them. Perhaps they engage in human sacrifice in some secret cave. If so, I am unaware of it.
Yet here we have Professor Sussman, who obviously did little research, writing in Salon of AmRen: “when a group publishes a journal and holds conferences preaching pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racial hatred and glorifies such hate mongers as Adolf Hitler, Jesse Helms, and David Duke . . .”
How is that again? The archives of American Renaissance are online, and video disks of its conferences are for sale to anyone who wants them. If Professor Sussman send me a link to a glorification of Hitler by Jared, or to evidence of their pro-Nazism, I will apologize to the professor, and sever relations with Jared. I wait.
It is one thing to disagree, however forcefully, with a man's opinions, as in fact I disagree with some of Jared's views. It is quite another to engage in fabrication, as if I were to describe Mr. Sussman as a homosexual child-molester. Their descriptions of Jared are highly defamatory if they cannot back them up, damaging to a man who makes their living as a translator in legal transactions between Japanese and American firms and, to the best of my considerable knowledge, utterly false.
Methinks Professor Sussman is simply lying. Otherwise they are just stringing together every hostile epithet they can think of. They display actual malice toward Jared as distinct from a difference of opinion, and a reckless disregard of truth that should embarrass a cub reporter on a small-town newspaper.
If I had submitted the Salon piece to a desk editor at any of the publications for which I used to write–for example, the Washington Times, Washington Post, Harper's, Playboy, or Army Times–the editor would have bounced it, and very likely told me to leave and not come back. Their first question would have been, “You did talk to Taylor to get their side of this . . . didn't you?” They then would have continued, “Your source for this is? . . . and for this? . . . and this? . . . and this?” Newspapers have a keen instinct for self-preservation, and libel suits can be very expensive. Professors might reflect on this.

The most popular fantasy hockey pool host quietly opened on the weekend, and there are a few rankings that leaves me scratching my head.
The Yahoo draft layout uses three different sets of rankings: The expert pre-season rankings, the ranking based on league settings, and the average draft position. Note that the autodraft uses the expert rankings.
All three have rankings that are a little off, but the one that is based on league settings has some doozies. Below are 10 players that are too low based on those rankings. The categories for those settings are goals, assists, plus/minus, PIM, power play points and shots on goal for forwards and defensemen and wins, GAA, SV % and shutouts for goalies.
10. Justin Faulk
At 25 years old, Faulk's prime seasons are still ahead of him. He's the number one power-play quarterback on an up-and-coming squad. They log a ton of minutes and is one of the league's best goal-scoring defensemen (he's sixth in the league in goals by a defenseman in the last three years combined). Somehow, he's ranked 229th in Yahoo rankings. Their plus-minus should be much better this year and their 13 power play points should also see a significant uptick.
9. P.K. Subban
There's no way Subban should be the 18th-highest ranked defenseman (117th overall) in any league. They can score, pile up points, shoot, hit, chip in PIM and be a consistent power-play contributor. They may be an off-ice distraction, but that shouldn't matter when it comes to your fantasy squad. They may not win any more Norris trophies, but he's a shoo-in for 50 points, 200 shots, 100 hits and 20 power play points.
8. Nick Leddy
It seems strange that Leddy would be ranked so low at 256th overall. He's been excellent since joining the Islanders three years ago and has seen improvements in many fantasy-related categories since then, most importantly in the points category. They were on the ice for 65.6 per cent of the Islanders power-play time last year and doesn't have anyone to challenge for that spot. They could reach 50 points for the first time this year.
7. Evander Kane
Kane's ranking of 100 would be too high for points only leagues, but it's actually low when it comes to leagues with peripherals. Kane is a beast when it comes to shots, PIMs, and hits and he's always a threat for 25 goals. They need to get consistent power play time to take that next step, but there's no need to wait so long to draft a guy who will contribute in many ways.
6. Shayne Gostisbehere
A lot of fantasy general managers wanted to dump Ghost after a sophomore season saw a decline in goals, points, plus-minus, and power-play goals. That could be why they have a Yahoo ranking of 228. He's still the top power play quarterback on the Flyers, likes to take a ton of shots and has a new long-term contract. Their salary isn't enough to ensure he'll always be the golden boy in Philly, but it's enough for them to have a head start over other Flyers defensemen.
5. Oliver Ekman-Larsson
Another defenseman ranked too low — 156th overall — based on one poor season last year. I wouldn't put money on OEL finishing below 40 points again. Besides that, there are a lot of things to like about the Coyotes' top defenseman for this year: Their plus-minus is bound to be higher than the minus-25 they had last season, they should break 20 power-play points again and their shot rate – a dismal 145 shots last year, down from 200-plus average – should shoot back up.
4. Steve Mason
Mason's stock has fallen dramatically, but this is too drastic a drop. Mason has signed in Winnipeg to be, at worst, a time-share goalie but has a very good opportunity to be the main guy. So why does Yahoo have them ranked 351st overall and the 59th-worst goalie, behind netminders such as Alex Stalock, Joonas Korpisalo and Aaron Dell? That's way too low, and you can get incredible value if you draft them with your last-round pick.
3. Steven Stamkos
Stamkos used to be a sure-fire top-five pick. This year is completely different. The experts have them ranked 29, their rank based on the categories is 54th and their average draft position is 34th. That's excellent value if you can snag them in the third round. Stamkos' biggest issue is their health as he's missed significant time in the last few years with blood clots, a broken leg, and a knee injury. However, they can still score, loves to shoot and is a power play phenom.
2. Jake Guentzel
Guentzel is one of those rare players that is ranked too low across all three categories: The experts have them at 120, their rank based on the categories is 99 and their average draft position is 151. That's just insane. Guentzel was excellent as a rookie last year in both the regular season (33 points in 40 games) and the playoffs (21 points) and has shown chemistry with both Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby. There's no way the left-winger should be lasting until 13th round in a 12-team league.
1. Cory Schneider
Schneider fell hard last year, posting career-lows in GAA and SV% and finishing with a 20-27-11 record with just two shutouts. So, Schneider's value has dropped as well, and they are ranked 182nd (24th for goalies) in Yahoo. Let's not forget how great they were from 2013-14 to 2015-16. In those three years, they were tied for second in save percentage (minimum 50 games) and third for GAA. Last year was an aberration for Schneider and they should be back on track this year.
Range Confirms Plans to Drill 22 Wells in Trinidad by 2016
Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200-character limit.
Range Resources Limited confirmed Monday plans to drill 22 exploration and development wells in Trinidad by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
The drilling schedule for all 22 wells has been finalized by Range, with the first wells in the program expected to be spud in the third quarter of this year. The company has been granted permission to construct 15 drilling pads to assist the program and the remaining seven constructions are currently under negotiation.
In a company statement, Range Resources said:
"It is expected that the proposed 22 wells will be drilled by the end of Q1 2016, however certain drilling logistics are beyond the company's control and, therefore, the drilling schedule remains subject to a number of variables, including availability of suitable rigs, arrival and commissioning of new rigs into RRDSL's [Range Resources Drilling Services Limited] rig fleet, various regulatory approvals, and the construction of drilling pads. RRDSL will also be required to recruit additional drilling staff to operate the new rigs.
"The management believes that the 22 well program presents an ambitious target, given a number of challenges that need to be overcome. However, the management will spare no effort to achieve and deliver on its targets, in order to grow production and turn the company around. Range is committed to provide all the required assistance to RRDSL to complete the proposed work program."

Five African countries launched a new multinational military force on Sunday to tackle Islamist militants in the Sahel, which French President Emmanuel Macron said should be fully operational by autumn despite its current financing shortfall.

Some observers see the initiative of the G5 Sahel bloc - Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad - as forming the basis of an eventual exit strategy for around 4,000 French troops now deployed to the volatile region. But Macron said Paris had no plans to withdraw them.
Islamist militant groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized control of Mali's desert north in 2012.
Though they were driven back a year later by a French-led military intervention, they continue to carry out attacks against U.N. peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets in violence that has spilled across Mali's borders.
“Every day we must combat terrorists, thugs, murderers, whose names and faces we must forget, but whom we must steadfastly and with determination eradicate together,” Macron said at the summit in Mali's capital Bamako.
During the meeting, leaders of the G5 Sahel countries formally established the new force, which will operate in coordination with French troops and MINUSMA, Mali's struggling U.N. peacekeeping mission.
The countries of the G5 Sahel bloc began floating the idea of a regional force as early as 2015, but since taking office in May, Macron has thrown Paris's weight behind the plan, including through a U.N. resolution adopted last week.

“There is urgency because those we're confronting are not going to wait,” said Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. “It's also clear that France alone can not continue to bear the burden of this fight against terrorism.”
Underfunded and overstretched
On Sunday, Macron said the force, which is expected to consist of around 5,000 troops, needed to be fully operational by this autumn.
But they played down speculation that they were seeking to reduce the burden on France's cross-border Barkhane Operation, saying at a meeting with Mali's French community following the summit that Paris would “remain engaged for as long as it takes”.
French President Emmanuel Macron poses with French troops during their visit to the France's Barkhane counter-terrorism operation in Africa's Sahel region in Gao, northern Mali, on May 19, 2017.
With its military headquarters in the northern Mali town of Sevare, the G5 Sahel force will focus on border zones - one along the frontier between Niger and Mali, another between Mali and Mauritania, and a third straddling the borders between Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali.
Paris considers the Sahel a breeding ground for militants and traffickers who pose a threat to Europe.
Late on Saturday, JNIM, an al Qaeda-linked group, released a video showing six Western hostages abducted in the region in recent years.
Among them was French citizen Sophie Pétronin, whose kidnappers Macron said France would “put all our energy towards eradicating”.
French President Emmanuel Macron (2nd R) and Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (R) review troops during a visit to the troops of France's Barkhane counter-terrorism operation in Africa's Sahel region in Gao, northern Mali, on May 19, 2017.
While Sunday's summit marked a step forward in the plan to set up the new force, it still faces a number of obstacles.
The European Union has pledged around 50 million euros ($57 million), and Macron said France would contribute around 8 million euros in equipment by the end of the year.
Each of the G5 Sahel members will contribute 10 million euros for the force. But President Keita on Sunday said the G5 leaders had agreed on a total budget of 423 million euros.
Aurore Dupuis reports from Bamako
The G5 Sahel nations - among the world's poorest - are already overstretched.
Chad, Burkina Faso and Niger have deployed around 4,100 soldiers within MINUSMA. Niger and Chad also contribute troops to a similar regional force fighting Nigeria's Boko Haram militants.
President Idriss Deby of Chad, which possesses the region's most capable military, has voiced reluctance to further commit their forces unless they receive more international support.

What is happening! What is happening!
In a big jolt to West Bengal's ruling Trinamool Congress ahead of the Bangaon Lok Sabha bypolls, minister Manjul Krishna Thakur on Thursday quit and joined the BJP, calling chief minister Mamata Banerjee "unprincipled" and the party unfit for any "good and educated person".
Thakur, who held the refugee, relief and rehabilitation portfolio in the Banerjee cabinet, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with their son and panchayat functionary Subrata Thakur, agencies reported.
Announcing their resignation from the ministry and the party and formally joining the BJP in the presence of its state president Rahul Sinha, they and accused Banerjee of indulging in "unprincipled activities" and acting as per them whims.
The condition in the Trinamool is such now that no "good and educated person can remain in that party", they added.
"I was never allowed to work in my department. There was too much of factional feuds... I couldn't work for the Matua community.
"This party is bereft of any ideals. You know about Saradha (chit fund scam) and other issues... people ridicule us on the streets," said Thakur, who is the younger son of of Matua community leader Binapani Debi Thakurani (Baroma).
The Matua community, comprising primarily low caste Hindu refugees from Bangladesh who are members of the Matua Mahasangh, commands nearly a crore votes in various districts in southern Bengal and plays a crucial role in determining the electoral fortunes in at least 74 of the state's 294 assembly seats.
Manjul Thakur's elder brother Kapil Krishna, who won last year from the Bangaon Lok Sabha constituency, died recently, necessitating the bypolls salted to be held Feb 13.
There is much speculation that Subrata Thakur will be the BJP candidate from Bangaon. The Trinamool is likely to give the ticket to Kapil Krishna's widow Mamata, a bitter rival of Manjul and their son.
Sinha said the two Thakurs' joining has kickstarted the exodus from the Trinamool. "This is the first instance of a Trinamool minister joining the BJP by resigning from office. I had told you a few days back that a lot of Trinamool leaders, unable to work in the party with dignity, want to quit and join the BJP."
They claimed more Trinamool leaders would join the BJP this month.
"Twenty nine more Trinamool leaders want to join our fold. However, we will maintain a distance from those against whom there are allegations of cheating the poor people. We are happy there is not a single allegation of financial impropriety against Manjul," said Sinha.

How many wins will your team finish with this season?
Here's a rundown of the Week 11 Power Rankings, as voted on by our power panel -- a group of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities -- with a look at every team's projected win totals, according to ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI).
ESPN Stats & Information's John McTigue contributed the following information.
Methodology: These rankings are based on which teams voters think would win head-to-head matchups. Higher-ranked teams would be favored against lower-ranked teams. Coming off a win doesn't guarantee a jump, and a loss doesn't guarantee a fall.
Previous rankings: Week 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | Preseason
2017 record: 8-1
Week 10 ranking: No. 1
Projected wins: 12.4. The Eagles have the highest win total projection in the NFL, according to FPI. As long as they can protect the football, there's no reason to think the victories can't keep coming. Philadelphia lost the turnover battle just once this season, in a Week 2 loss to the Chiefs.
2017 record: 7-2
Week 10 ranking: No. 2
Projected wins: 12.1. The Patriots just started a stretch of five road games in six weeks and are still projected to win 12.1 games. They've allowed 13.4 points per game during their five-game win streak, the third-lowest average in the NFL in that span.
2017 record: 7-2
Week 10 ranking: No. 9
Projected wins: 11.6. Over their seven-game win streak, the Saints have rushed for 1,139 yards and 14 touchdowns. That's not bad for a team that was projected to win just 7.9 games in the preseason.
2017 record: 7-2
Week 10 ranking: No. 3
Projected wins: 11.9. Only the Eagles and Patriots are projected to win more games than the Steelers through Week 10. They'll have to leave Pittsburgh for only two of their remaining seven games, one of which is in nearby Cincinnati.
2017 record: 6-3
Week 10 ranking: No. 5
Projected wins: 11.0. If the Chiefs hit their current projection, it would be their third straight season with 11 or more wins. They shouldn't have much trouble getting there. They have the second-easiest remaining schedule.
2017 record: 7-2
Week 10 ranking: No. 4
Projected wins: 11.1. Case Keenum has the third-best Total QBR this season (72.5). They have been sacked just once since Week 4, and if they can keep up this level of play, the Vikings should cruise to 11 wins.
2017 record: 7-2
Week 10 ranking: No. 7
Projected wins: 11.0. The Rams have scored at least 30 points in six games this season, the most in the NFL. The improvement on offense is the biggest reason they're now projected to win five more games than predicted in the preseason.
2017 record: 6-3
Week 10 ranking: No. 6
Projected wins: 10.3. The secondary is banged up, the penalties are adding up (the most in the NFL), and they can't run the ball. Russell Wilson has been the saving grace, leading the team in rushing in addition to throwing 12 of their 19 touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks will need them even more down the stretch if they want to meet their win projection.
2017 record: 6-3
Week 10 ranking: No. 10
Projected wins: 10.9. The preseason projections seemed generous when the Jaguars were pegged with 6.7 wins. Now they are projected for almost 11 wins, which doesn't seem at all far-fetched. It helps that the Jags have the easiest remaining schedule.
2017 record: 7-3
Week 10 ranking: No. 11
Projected wins: 10.4. The Panthers' run game had been lacking for most of the season, but they've eclipsed 200 rushing yards and scored multiple rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games. If the ground game keeps going, with the strength of their defense, the Panthers will keep winning.
2017 record: 5-4
Week 10 ranking: No. 17
Projected wins: 8.5. No team has a more difficult remaining schedule than the Falcons. They still have a trip to Seattle, two games against the Saints and home games against the Vikings and Panthers. If there's any reason for hope, it's that they have four home games left, and two games against the 3-6 Buccaneers.
2017 record: 6-3
Week 10 ranking: No. 14
Projected wins: 9.5. The Titans have won four straight, averaging 125 rushing yards per game and outrushing opponents by 222 yards over that stretch. If they can continue to control the ground game, they should have no problem reaching their projected win total.
2017 record: 5-4
Week 10 ranking: No. 8
Projected wins: 8.8. The Cowboys could probably get by without Ezekiel Elliott, but if left tackle Tyron Smith misses any more games, they could be in big trouble. Dak Prescott was sacked eight times against the Falcons last week without Smith -- the most sacks a Cowboys QB had taken since Troy Aikman in 1991.
2017 record: 5-4
Week 10 ranking: No. 16
Projected wins: 8.9. The Lions are 5-4, with all of their losses coming against teams with winning records. They have just two games remaining against teams that are over .500 (the Vikings and Packers), and both are at home.
2017 record: 4-5
Week 10 ranking: No. 12
Projected wins: 7.0. The Raiders will have to protect the ball and/or force turnovers in order to reach their projected win total. They're 1-5 when losing the turnover battle this season and 3-0 when breaking even or winning it.
2017 record: 5-4
Week 10 ranking: No. 15
Projected wins: 7.8. The Bills were once 5-2, but two straight losses by a combined 50 points have tempered expectations around Buffalo. They've allowed 492 yards and nine touchdowns to opposing rushers the past two weeks.
2017 record: 5-4
Week 10 ranking: No. 18
Projected wins: 8.3. Brett Hundley has increased their completion percentage and yards per attempt with every start this season. The Packers still have a tough road ahead, with the Ravens and Steelers over the next two weeks, but the season might not be completely lost if Hundley keeps improving.
2017 record: 4-5
Week 10 ranking: No. 13
Projected wins: 7.6. The Redskins have played the toughest schedule to date, but they have the second-easiest remaining schedule. The potential for wins is there, with two games against the Giants and home matchups with the Cardinals and Broncos still to come.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 19
Projected wins: 7.2. The Chargers have made losing close games into an art form. They have five losses by eight or fewer points this season, tied with the 49ers for most in the NFL. Statistically, they're bound to win in more of these situations sooner or later.
2017 record: 4-5
Week 10 ranking: No. 20
Projected wins: 8.1. Joe Flacco has thrown eight touchdowns in nine games and has thrown for multiple touchdowns just twice this season. Still, the Ravens could have the QB advantage the next two weeks with matchups against Hundley and Tom Savage.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 24
Projected wins: 6.5. The Texans have averaged 9.3 points per game when Tom Savage has started versus 34.7 points per game when Deshaun Watson has started. With Watson out, it could be a tall task for the Texans to double their current win total.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 21
Projected wins: 6.6. The Broncos have allowed 92 points the past two weeks. The quarterback situation is a mess, the special teams are a mess, and the defense -- which was supposed to be a strength -- is in disarray as a result. Their projection might be generous at this point.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 28
Projected wins: 5.7. Ryan Fitzpatrick brought their Fitz-magic in Week 10 to snap the Buccaneers' five-game losing streak. That was against the Jets, though. The Bucs have the Falcons (twice), Saints, Panthers, Packers and Lions the rest of the way.
2017 record: 4-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 22
Projected wins: 5.4. The Jets were projected to win 4.0 games in the preseason, so they've already met those expectations. But after losing four of their past five, the Jets might need a little luck to meet the new expectation.
2017 record: 4-5
Week 10 ranking: No. 23
Projected wins: 6.2. Drew Stanton is 7-4 as the starter since joining the team in 2013, so the Cardinals aren't completely lost without Carson Palmer. But their upcoming schedule includes four games against teams currently 6-3 or better, so wins might not come easily.
2017 record: 4-5
Week 10 ranking: No. 26
Projected wins: 6.3. When you have the worst scoring offense in the NFL, as the Dolphins do (15.2 points per game), you have to be strong defensively. Unfortunately for Miami, the defense has allowed 37.3 points per game during the team's three-game losing streak.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 25
Projected wins: 6.2. The Bengals have the third-worst turnover differential in the NFL this season (minus-9). Can they double their current win total with that sloppy play? Their next two games are against the two teams with worse turnover margins: the Broncos and Browns.
2017 record: 3-6
Week 10 ranking: No. 27
Projected wins: 5.6. The Bears have games against the 49ers and Browns on their remaining schedule, so there are wins on the table. If Mitchell Trubisky -- who has three touchdowns in five starts -- can start making plays, the Bears could sneak out a few other wins.
2017 record: 3-7
Week 10 ranking: No. 29
Projected wins: 4.5. Crazy stat of the day: Jacoby Brissett has the most 60-yard passing touchdowns (four) by a Colts quarterback in a season since Johnny Unitas in 1966 (four). Those big plays have helped the Colts claim three wins, but they're currently the FPI underdog in each of their remaining six games.
2017 record: 1-8
Week 10 ranking: No. 30
Projected wins: 3.8. Admittedly, FPI has struggled to put the Giants' fall from grace into proper context, given how well they played last season with Eli Manning and Ben McAdoo. After losing to the 49ers, it's hard to see the Giants beating any of their remaining opponents.
2017 record: 1-9
Week 10 ranking: No. 31
Projected wins: 2.4. Do the 49ers have another win in them? If not, they'll be staring at the first one-win season in the history of the franchise.
2017 record: 0-9
Week 10 ranking: No. 32
Projected wins: 1.6. It's really hard to lose this much, but even the projections don't think the Browns are going to find the win column frequently down the stretch. They haven't won the turnover battle in any game this season and have the worst team Total QBR.
A Muslim man who was recently attacked by cow vigilantes in Alwar, Rajasthan, died of their injuries on Monday night, The Hindustan Timesreported today.
Pehlu Khan, 35, was among the 15 Muslims from Haryana's Nuh district who were attacked by cow vigilantes over suspicion that they were smuggling cows in Rajasthan. While some of the injured men are in hospital, others are in judicial custody.
In Rajasthan, the slaughter of bovine animals is punishable with imprisonment for a minimum of one year and a maximum of ten years. To possess, sell or transport any beef or beef products in the state is punishable with a minimum of six months in prison and a maximum of five years.
No one has been arrested for the attack on Saturday, which took place near the highway in the Jaguvas Bahror area of Alwar. "We have registered a case of murder against six persons and 200 unknown people," Ramesh Sinsinwar, the station house officer of Bahror, told HT.
Last year, hundreds of right-wing activists vandalized at least 40 Muslim homes in Raghunathgarh village of Alwar, where residents were suspected of slaughtering cows.
The attack on Saturday comes in the midst of a crackdown in several Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states over illegal cow slaughter. Taking cue from the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, the governments in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have also initiated drives to shut down illegal slaughterhouses.
The Gujarat government recently made cow slaughter punishable with life imprisonment.
Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh recently said that those found guilty of slaughtering cows would be hanged.

The Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes was defaced overnight by activists presumably attempting to send the president a message about climate change.Photos and video show a group clad in dark clothing making their way onto the green of the golf course with rakes under the cover of night.In the video, five people quickly get to work carving large letters into the grass, spelling out "NO MORE TIGERS, NO MORE WOODS."The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirms their dispatch received a call from Trump National around 8:45 a.m. Sunday in relation to the vandalism, but the call was cancelled before deputies arrived on the scene.There is no investigation underway at this time, according to the LASD. Authorities are aware of the video, but has not been on the premises to verify what was seen on the tape.A statement issued by activists claiming responsibility for the incident cites the "humanitarian crisis" of global warming and animal welfare as the group's motive."If our King Puppet really wants to ease the strain of immigration, why not make this world more livable for our neighbors, reduce the imperative need for any person to have to bundle their lives into a bag and flee their homes under duress," the unsigned statement reads.The group wants to remain anonymous, and Eyewitness News spoke with one of the activists."It's a protest piece against Trump's administration's handling of our environmental policies," the person said. "He's been very aggressive in gutting a lot of the policies that we've had in place for a very long time. We felt it necessary to stand up and go take action against him."The person went on to say they chose hole No. 5 as the spot for the vandalism because it was "the most picturesque" spot on the course to display their message.Trump and their administration are proposing deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency that would eliminate programs and staff.The Trump National Golf Club is an 18-hole public course that charges an annual membership fee of $695 on top of a $160 fee to play each visit."Noted as the most expensive golf course ever built, over $250 million dollars has been spent to ensure its prominence," the course's website reads.A manager Eyewitness News contacted from the golf course said they were not authorized to make a statement about the incident.L.A. County sheriff's officials estimate the damage is around $20,000.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has an intriguing auditory processing profile. Individuals show enhanced pitch discrimination, yet often find seemingly innocuous sounds distressing. This study used two behavioural experiments to examine whether an increased capacity for processing sounds in ASD could underlie both the difficulties and enhanced abilities found in the auditory domain. Autistic and non-autistic young adults performed a set of auditory detection and identification tasks designed to tax processing capacity and establish the extent of perceptual capacity in each population. Tasks were constructed to highlight both the benefits and disadvantages of increased capacity. Autistic people were better at detecting additional unexpected and expected sounds (increased distraction and superior performance respectively). This suggests that they have increased auditory perceptual capacity relative to non-autistic people. This increased capacity may offer an explanation for the auditory superiorities seen in autism (e.g. heightened pitch detection). Somewhat counter-intuitively, this same ‘skill' could result in the sensory overload that is often reported – which subsequently can interfere with social communication. Reframing autistic perceptual processing in terms of increased capacity, rather than a filtering deficit or inability to maintain focus, increases our understanding of this complex condition, and has important practical implications that could be used to develop intervention programs to minimise the distress that is often seen in response to sensory stimuli.
Chuck Palahniuk‘s novel Invisible Monsters has been optioned off and on since 2001, with multiple writers taking a crack at a script, and multiple producers trying to get together a cast and financing. Nothing has worked out, but in 2008 Cameron MacLaren started looking into the option. In March 2010 they managed to secure the rights to the novel, which tells a tale of “a disfigured ex-fashion model, a pill-popping drama queen and a sexually confused vice operative who embark on a road trip fueled by a radical new form of self-discovery as a means to reinvent themselves.”
Now there is a director for the project: TV director Samir Rehem, who has credits on Degrassi: The Next Generation, and Skins.
The news was announced by the producer, who says he's been working for “the last twenty months” on the script, taking notes from Chuck Palahniuk on ways to both remain faithful to the novel and ” how it could differ in order to stylize it for a visual medium.”
There is no casting at this point, and financing hasn't fully cohered. That could be a sticking point — the last adaptation of the author's work to hit screens, Choke, took years to finance, and then was only able to go before cameras with a meager budget under $3m. The film based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club may have iconic status, but most of their books have proven to be tricky adaptations. Invisible Monsters is already off the schedule once set out, as an April 2010 interview with Cameron MacLaren announced that cameras would roll in Spring 2011. So this one still has to build more steam.
Here's a synopsis from the official Chuck Palahniuk site:
One of the favorite pastimes of leftists/progressives/liberals is lamenting the fact that some people have more while others have less. They say that life is just unfair in this respect. They want the government to “level the playing field” by using taxation to take money from those who have more and giving it to those who have less. Their ideal is a “level playing field” in which everyone has the same amount of wealth.
Even though they would never admit it openly, this leftist/progressive/liberal concept is rooted in envy and covetousness. They just cannot stand the fact that some people have more than they do. They won't be happy until everyone who has more than they do has been “equalized” down to their level.
Leftists claim that in a genuine free market, the rich would only get richer and the poor would only get poorer. Their statuses, leftists say, are permanent. The rich will never be poor and the poor will never be rich, they claim. We need government to equalize everyone, they assert.
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that Hudson's Bay, the company that owns Lord & Taylor, is selling its 676,000 square-foot store in New York City that has stood for more than a century. The property is being sold to a start-up named WeWork that caters to millennials by providing variable office space. WeWork was founded in 2010 and now has 160 locations in 52 cities.
The shift is part of an economic revolution in the retail business, which has been brought about by the Internet. Another example is Macy's, one of the country's largest department stores, which has closed dozens of its stores nationwide.
But wait a minute! How is this possible? Don't leftists say that the rich only get richer? That their status is secure and permanent? That we need government to seize their wealth and give it to the poor? That coercion is needed to “equalize” everyone?
What is happening to Lord & Taylor, Macy's, and other retail establishments demonstrates the ridiculous nature of this particular economic dogma of the left. The fact is that the free market is a great redistributor of wealth and a great equalizer. It brings many of the wealthy down and lifts the fortune of many who are not wealthy. And it's all done voluntarily and peacefully — that is, without taxation or other government coercion.
According to an article by Mark J. Perry on the website of the American Enterprise Institute,
Comparing the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 to the Fortune 500 in 2014, there are only 61 companies in 1955 that appear in both lists. In other words, only 12.2% of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 were still on the list 59 years later in 2014, and almost 80 percent of the companies from 1955 have either gone bankrupt, merged, or still exist but have fallen from the top Fortune 500 companies (ranked by revenue).
But according to leftist economic doctrine, that simply isn't possible. Remember: They say that the rich only get richer and the poor only get poorer. You need government to “level the playing field,” they claim.
What is it about the free market that proves leftists wrong? Consumers. In a free market, they, not the government, do the equalizing and leveling, and, unlike the government, they do it peacefully and voluntarily. It is consumers who decide who is going to prosper and who isn't. They, not the government, is sovereign in a free market.
How do consumers redistribute and equalize wealth? Through their decisions on what to buy and not to buy. By making those decisions, they decide who is going to be rich, poor, or middle class.
That's why many big sports athletes, many of whom come from dirt-poor families, now make tens of millions of dollars and why many college professors who came from wealthy families make only tens of thousands of dollars. Consumers are willing to spend more on attending baseball games than on taking college courses.
Consumers are a ruthless bunch. No matter how long they have done business with a particular company, if someone comes along and offers them something better at a lower price, most of them will not hesitate to shift their loyalties, even if it means that their old company goes broke and has to lay off workers.
In a free market there is only one way that a well-established, wealthy company can retain its position in the market. It must continue to satisfy the consumer by providing them with goods and services that they are willing to pay for. Remember: A private company is not like the government — it cannot force its customers to patronize it or forcibly take money from people to subsidize its operations. It must serve people by providing them with goods and services that they are voluntarily willing to pay for.
Leftists are wrong. We don't need government to destroy freedom and private property by coercively confiscating and redistributing wealth. The free market does a fine job redistributing wealth all by itself, and entirely voluntarily.

For Bizarre Beasts, I always feel I should pick some really weird-looking animal, you know? Still, I always get a fun rush when I find something super innocuous-looking that has some incredibly bizarre behavior. This week, I'm rubbing my hands in anticipation of people clicking on a relatively boring-looking fish.
The archerfish are a family of fish that are very small, both in taxonomic breadth and literal size. The taxonomic family only contains a single genus and within that genus, only seven species. Living in the tropical waters surrounding areas of India and the Philippines, archerfish go about their lives within the flooded roots of mangrove forests, stands of trees that typically span the interface between fresh and salt water. The fish are relatively humdrum, as I mentioned before, with most members coming in at only a couple inches in length. But their appearance isn't what is remarkable about these fish—it's their main skill.
Archerfish, as the name implies, are avid bowlers archers. Their accuracy is unparalleled, especially for a fish! Archerfish take in water, close their gills to increase pressure, and then expel it in a bolt of H 2 O. The water then arcs through the air and lands, nearly without fail, onto their prey: insects. When the water rocks the unprepared insects, they lose their grip on the mangrove branches and dramatically fall into their watery graves where the archerfish awaits them. The archerfish gulps down its prey without a second thought.
What's truly astonishing about the archerfish is just how much they need to account for in their shots. Archerfish don't shoot their projectile from above the water's surface, they shoot from underneath to remain inconspicuous to their prey. This means they shoot from an increased distance, which is no problem for a fish that is able to spit up to 5 meters away and shoot accurately from 2 meters away! The archerfish must also account for refraction between the air and water surface, and the ballistic drop of the water spurt! Simply incredible. Here's a video from Nat Geo Wild's World's Deadliest showing the archerfish in action:
The most recent chapter in the dark saga of the United States torture debate is a Senate report that sheds additional light on the nature and extent of interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency. While there must be a discussion about the veracity of the report itself, for now that debate must yield to the far more important discussion of clarifying the U.S. national stance on the practice of torture.
To blame the divided stance of the U.S. populace on torture on political partisanship alone is myopic. A survey of U.S. history, legal precedent, and political philosophy suggests that the question of torture is one of the most enduring moral dilemmas in the nation.
The discussion begins with the clearer, yet more uncomfortable, question of U.S. obligations under international law. It is plainly clear that the conduct of CIA officers marks a clear violation of U.S. international commitments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations following the Second World War served as the foundation for many of the international covenants on human rights later passed by UN. In particular, Article 5 of the UDHR marked the international community's first attempt at documenting its desire to protect against cruel and inhumane punishment sponsored by states. Article 5 of the UDHR plainly reads, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”
To fully grasp the irony of U.S. violation of Article 5, one must note that First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the committee to develop the UDHR. At the time, the First Lady was a vehement advocate for anti-lynching laws in the American South, and spent a considerable amount of effort to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to join the opposition because they found the practice of lynching an indefensible form of torture. President Roosevelt's fear of losing their coalition of Southern Democrats prevented them from taking a firm position on the matter. However, Eleanor Roosevelt's indelible passion in designing the Declaration of Human Rights was aimed as much at reminding America of its own moral ideals as it was at shaping the moral ideals of the international community.
Each international convention includes its own prescribed standards, definition of torture, and guidelines as to who is considered a subject under the treaty. For example, the Geneva Convention extends the ban on torture to prisoners of war and does not provide the same treatment to non-state combatants— who are in violation of the laws and customs of war themselves. The argument that the CIA's actions did not mark a clear violation of the Geneva Convention has some merit, but evidence from the torture memos elicits a clear and conscious effort on the part of executive branch officials to avoid legal culpability by teetering dangerously close to the edges of legality. This fact alone should give American citizens pause.
Yet the far more important question concerns the scope of culpability under the U.S. constitution and its governing laws. Despite the conventional narrative, the question proves to be far more difficult to answer.
Records from the Constitutional Convention of 1878 indicate trepidations on the part of some representatives that the U.S. Constitution had almost remained silent on the topic of torture. The cause of this worry was the perpetual state of confusion at the time as to the Constitution's endorsement of a specific legal philosophy. Was the U.S. Constitution to follow the civil law, then practiced in many jurisdictions such as Spain and France, with its Roman roots and influenced by the common Roman practice of torture? Or was it to follow the English common law, which in principal—although not in practice—prohibited the use of torture?
In their autobiography, Thomas Jefferson stated that they found Louis XVI's abolition of torture a great improvement in the condition of the state. Jefferson's affinity for the works of Cesare Beccaria, the Italian philosopher of criminal law, influenced their treatise on Crime and Punishment, which unabashedly condemned the use of torture and capital punishment. Yet Jefferson's view failed to influence many of the founding fathers, and the language of the Bill of Rights remained unclear with respect to the use of both measures—the term “torture” never expressly appearing in the text.
Similarly, Patrick Henry of Virginia, supported by George Mason, intended to bring the U.S. Bill of Rights in line with the Virginian Bill of Rights, which prohibited the imposition of “cruel and unusual punishment.” However, Mason's assertion that the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination was adequate protection against torture suggests that this concern might have been limited to the practice of torture as it pertains to the criminal procedure and not as a tool of warfare.
During the 1776 Battle of the Cedars between the American and British forces, a number of American soldiers captured by British commanders were tortured, tomahawked, and scalped. George Washington subsequently penned a letter to John Hancock in which they called for retaliation in the form of torture or capital punishment, no matter how “abhorrent and disagreeable to our natures” those practices may be.
Further, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion in Whitley v. Albers and Justice Byron White's decision in Ingraham v. Wright both limited the prohibition of torture to instances of criminal punishment. Both decisions were penned long before the understandable passion surrounding American involvement in the Middle East had effectively drawn the ideological line separating the two opposing sides. Both decisions refused to expand the limits of the prohibition of torture beyond instances of criminal punishment. Judicial relief against cruel and unusual punishment therefore has mostly been invoked and treated in the background of guidelines set forward in the Fifth Amendment and most commonly used to assess the constitutionality of criminal sentences such as three-strike laws, death penalty, and other parochial criminal sentencing laws. Moreover, Justice O'Connor stated in Whitley v. Albers that every Eighth Amendment scrutiny of the executive branches' treatment of prisoners must be balanced against “the government interest at hand” and only rebuked when showing “unnecessary and wanton” behavior.
The disinclination to interpret the Eighth Amendment as imposing a total bar to the practice of torture is not a separation from the original intent behind the amendment, but rather an extension of the implicit disagreement between the founding fathers on the topic of torture. Therefore, it is not wholly baseless to claim that the ambiguous history behind the enactment of the Eighth Amendment and its legal precedents do not provide us with enough ground to extend the prohibition of torture to the much contentious ticking time bomb scenario.
Questioning the appropriate interpretation of “cruel and unusual punishment” clause of the Eighth Amendment is not the only complex question involved. Given the status of prisoners subject to the interrogation techniques, the inquiry as to whether or not the Bill of Rights extends the same guarantees to non-citizens as it does to American citizens is a crucial element of assessing the legality of the torture program.
The answer to this question proves to be even more inscrutable. To understand the peculiarity of outcomes, take for example the affirmative response to the question. If we are to confidently assert that the Bill of Rights unequivocally extends not just to American citizens but to noncitizens as well, expansion of protection against cruel and unusual punishment is only one of several logical consequences. Under the same premise, noncitizens would be able to donate to political campaigns in America, citing the protections guaranteed to citizens under the First Amendment, an unavoidable yet surely absurd interpretation.
By contrast, rejecting the principal altogether would mean that the free speech right of foreigners could be easily taken away by the U.S. federal government without any recourse. To accord with commonly held American beliefs, the answers to such questions must lie somewhere in between. Still, enough exists in the language of these constitutional amendments to serve as a guide to solving some of these dilemmas.
In many instances, different amendments expressly mention the subject for whom protection is sought. The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution specifically limits the protection of “privileges and immunities” to “citizens of the United States.” Likewise, the 15th, 24th and 26th Amendments, which concern the right to vote, are expressly aimed at “citizens of the United States.” The Sixth Amendment grants the protection against self-incrimination not to citizens but to “the accused,” a term that can naturally encompass both citizens and foreigners. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendments are designed more ambiguously to protect “the People.” Even more cryptic language belongs to those amendments that affirm or negate the federal government's powers without mentioning the subject. The Ninth Amendment is such an example, simply reading, “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”
In Carlson v. London, the Supreme Court held that the first clause of the Eighth Amendment protection against the imposition of excessive bail did not extend to aliens, after Congress had granted authority to the Attorney General to indefinitely detain and deny bail for aliens who might pose a threat to the nation. No similarly conclusive decision has yet been rendered by the Supreme Court to extend that logic to the second clause of the Eighth Amendment. Nonetheless, current legal precedent seems to favor Justice Antonin Scalia's interpretation that the question of Eighth Amendment protection of aliens is not as ambiguous as popular discourse might suggest.
The current contentious battle over the necessity of practice of torture is borne out of conflicting voices in U.S. history. Accurate historical assessments exist that question the extension of the ban against cruel and unusual punishment to alien combatants who may possess valuable information that can save lives. Yet equally if not more valid is the claim that the nebulous treatment of the subject in domestic U.S. legal documents must yield to the much clearer voice that the U.S. has lent to the international community through its international obligations. Unfortunately, the U.S. will lose its moral war against terrorism if it proves as credulous in suspending its principles as the enemy is calculated in rejecting them.

How can you not see that the whole presidential process is a fucking circus? We take the legacy of a great libertarian thinker and we turn them into a republican. It wins over the small government base but also feeds into the money stream of corporate interests. We then take this politician and feed them to the bought-out media to sell consent to the masses.
Rand Paul is far from a libertarian candidate. He's flip flopped on a number of major issues to play nice with the establishment Republicans. I hate to admit it, but it worked. It gave this young senator from Kentucky the wings to take on their own run for the highest office in the land. But it took sacrifice. It took dismantling the cores of liberty. It took The TODAY Show's Savannah Guthrie, yes Savannah Guthrie, to challenge the presidential hopeful on their detours from libertarian principles.
The interview is a mouthful, but it was all the tactic of a puppet, not a free-market pioneer we hoped for. You can see the establishment using their limp, frail, weird looking body almost as a sock puppet. They hit every main issue that the conservatives care about right now: Iran, Israel and the funding of our military. But instead of answering these questions straight up, they decided to show how “thin-skinned” (as the media is calling it) they really are. They decided it was better to argue with a news anchor whose own personal life, say their new baby Vale or their engagement, deserve more hits on Google than any other interview she's ever done. And yes, I Googled them
Let's first start with Iran. Guthrie went right for the throat and asked Paul if they still believed Iran was a threat. The senator was in support of normalizing relations with the nation 8 years ago. And that's actually their only excuse for completely backtracking on their original convictions and joining the neo-cons in congress who are pounding the war drums. Even though Iran hasn't started a war since the early half of the 18th century.
Paul claims 2007 was a long time ago when they were in favor of demilitarizing against Iran. How did their views change so much in this small time frame when not much changed in Iran except Mahmoud Ahmadinejad? In this short span, Iran swapped out a hard-lined president whose presidency was rife with corruption and militarism for a president who vowed to reform western relations in their election run. What Iran didn't do was start a war or pose a threat to American lives. “I wasn't running for office,” Paul says of the time when they didn't see Iran as a threat. But whose campaign was they on? Their fathers. This is clear evidence that Rand Paul is merely interested in the votes, and not the principles of liberty.
The reporter's next point was about Israel. Rand Paul supported cutting aid to foreign countries early in their career but has since backtracked substantially especially in regards to Israel. This is, of course, important because the right has tried feverishly to secure the Jewish vote. The GOP poised itself as a constant supporter of Israel, a nation stuck in a sea of Muslim nations, to play into the Evangelical voters.
However, Paul said their position didn't change. They still believed that we shouldn't “borrow money from China” (aka, he's doing the same plea for a balanced budget as Paul Ryan tried) and give it to nations like Pakistan. What an interesting choice: because Pakistan and Israel aren't exactly on the best of terms. In fact, citizens of both counties are barred from entering each other's borders. So instead of unilaterally disassociating ourselves from giving money to any country, we should only “reduce foreign aid to those who burn our flag.” It's like we'll start with cutting off nations who don't have the support of the American electorate while continuing to funnel millions to those who stand in contrast to the perceived “Islamification” of the world. It's a great way to keep the Evangelical vote that the GOP needs while throwing a bone to the libertarians.
And finally, the question Paul failed to answer in a respectable way was their views on cutting defense spending. How could this hopeful young senator dare to touch military funds when “ISIS destroying ancient artifacts in Iraq” is making headlines?
In reality, the interview wasn't an example of Rand Paul's sexist sympathies as the left has valiantly tried to construct. In fact, all Savannah Guthrie asked Rand Paul was done your time in DC make you “mellowed out”? That's a pretty innocent question for a response like the senator gave. They did try to make amends. This was a covenant moment for him. “Washington is horribly broken,” they said before aimlessly hitting their taking points such as term limits and unclogging the pipes of congress. Later in the day, they used this media spotlight for a convenient interview with Megyn Kelly on FOX.
This all proved as a perfect divergence from answering the actual questions about their flip-flopping on key issues. Instead, the right decided to turn it around and just blame the left for making sexist claims. Megyn Kelly (while it was actually pretty fucking awesome) shoots down comments from those like Chuck Todd who were quick to point out that Rand Paul was blowing up on female news anchors.
This adds to exactly what Paul needs for their voter base. He's staving off any negative press about being a misogynist; a key concern of the young electorate, while also aligning themselves with Kelly's valiant crusade against easily offended feminists. It's a win-win. But Paul never really answered any of the questions that were presented to him. They just created a bunch of micro-news stories that have a short shelf life on Twitter's radar to avoid the fact that they aren't really a libertarian. He's an establishment republican now, but he'll gladly take Ron Paul's votes.
Stanley Johnson has had a challenging sophomore season for the Detroit Pistons, but is looking forward confidently thanks to a strong performance in February.
Stanley Johnson ended last season with a crescendo, playing tough physical defense on LeBron James as the Detroit Pistons were swept in four competitive and hard-fought games by the Cleveland Cavaliers. While Johnson didn't exactly shut James down, they forced the King to work for everything they got in the minutes they played against each other.
It didn't reflect in the wins column, but Johnson had shown some of the physical toughness the Pistons had expected and hoped to see out of the Arizona product. Fast forward to this season, and things took a while to get on track in Johnson's second season. They struggled mightily over the first month or so of 2016-17 to the point where they lost their spot in the rotation to Darrun Hilliard.
In the middle of December, Stan Van Gundy took advantage of a day off for the traveling Pistons and assigned the struggling Johnson (along with rookies Henry Ellenson and Michael Gbinije) to the Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA D-League for a quick one-game stint. Over the 12 games before the D-League stint, Johnson had three DNP-CD (did not play, coach's decision), a one-game suspension stemming from an undisclosed violation of team rules, and averaged a paltry 8 minutes per game when they did get on the floor.
Johnson flourished in their quick stop in Grand Rapids as the Drive's number one option on offense, scoring 26 points on 9-of-19 shooting, grabbing five rebounds and dishing out four assists. While the D-League can't replicate the intensity and skill level of the NBA, getting minutes in a competitive game did them wonders.
“I think it definitely helped to see the ball go in the basket and to get up and down the court. Obviously I'd never had the experience of the situation like I did at the beginning of the season, which, you know, not being able to play as much, so when you're not playing as much, it just feels good to get on the court and get minutes and make shots like you're used to doing,” Johnson told me when we spoke last week. “So I think when I went to Grand Rapids it gave me some flow, like just regular flow like you get during the season. But I think, for me, it was just get up and get some run in. I think it's important for guys like me, you know, I'm only 20. I need to play, I need to get some live reps in.”
A big reason Johnson has struggled this season, particularly early on, may have resulted from having completely reworked their jump shot this past summer. While the changed form and mechanics should pay dividends, the adjustment came with its own challenges for the young Johnson.
“I feel like my jump shot has definitely improved. I think it's better than what I've shown. For me the toughest thing is I don't know when I'm gonna get my touches really in the games and some games I'm only out there for 16 or 17 minutes and you just don't have a feel for stuff,” said Johnson. “Sometimes people don't look into shots at the end of the shot clock (Johnson is hitting just 20 percent of their jump shots with four seconds or less on the shot clock) and stuff like that where I rush shots and they're not really rhythm shots. And that's fine, that happens through the season, but I feel like what I did this summer was definitely constructive. With my jumper, I think next summer we'll just be working on being more consistent. You know, you can never shoot enough jump shots.”
This season has been a struggle for the Detroit Pistons almost across the board. A year after having one of the most productive starting lineups and a bench among the worst in the NBA, the script has flipped and the Pistons starters have weighed the team down at times while the bench keeps them afloat most nights. Johnson has been one of those vital reserves.
I asked Johnson what some of the biggest differences have been for the Pistons between last season and this season.
“Last year we were healthy all season. Everybody was healthy all season, we didn't have any nagging injuries. Last year we ran a lot of pick and rolls and it was conducive to a lot of ball movement because teams were just trying to take away Reggie and Dre and that two-man movement so it made it a lot easier for guys like me and Marcus and KCP to shoot long threes and drive on closeouts and things like that.” Johnson went on to say, “Whereas this year we have a lot of post ups and handoffs, it's more than just straight ball screens. I think last year our defense was a little bit better, I'm not sure what the numbers are but I thought last year our defense was a little better. And this last 15 game stretch we've been coming back to our game. I think we're improving on the defensive end, I think we're improving our team morale which is very important in the resolve of winning because the team is in a good state of mind, thinking together, we're together on and off the court. ”
The Detroit Pistons bench in particular has surged over the past month and a half. In February, the best three-man unit in the NBA consisted of Johnson, Tobias Harris and Ish Smith, and Johnson themselves appeared in three of the top 17 three-man units in the NBA.
As a result, Harris was in three of the top ten 3-man units in the league in February, and Harris/Stanley Johnson/Ish were the top unit. pic.twitter.com/k4PxtpSbOg — Duncan Smith (@DuncanSmithNBA) March 2, 2017
I asked Johnson what it was about the bench, particularly himself, Harris, Smith and Aron Baynes, that had been so effective for over six weeks.
“I think we all complement each other very well. Me, Ish and Tobias, and Aron being able to screen the way they do is big. I think he's one of the best screeners in the league and they put you in a position where you're playing two-on-one against a five-man. That's why a lot of teams go over on me and Ish who are not really dribble-up shooters because with Aron when you go under the first one Aron turns around and gets you on the second one, now we're shooting layups. Now we're shooting 15 footers,” said Johnson. “Between me and Ish just being able to pass and find people that are open and get into the paint, I think that's big. Whether it be Ish, Tobias, Marcus or KCP; me, Tobias, Aron, all guys that can put the ball on the floor, all get into the paint, all create, all pass. Obviously, Ish pushes the pace of the game. I know for me, being able to play in transition is huge. That's how I've always played basketball, in high school, at Arizona, being able to play in the open court, which Ish always makes every possession somehow. He's always ahead of the pack.”
While the Detroit Pistons bench has been more than able to pick up the starters, an area of concern for the team has been their performance on the second game of a back-to-back, of which the team has five remaining over the final month and a half of the season.
“Well, you know everyone has to play them. So if you say you're tired or something like that, it's no excuse. I will say this, it is very difficult to play the second half of a back to back, especially if you have an overtime game.” Johnson went on to say, “The longer you play the night before that the harder it is, but we gotta figure it out. The guys that play less minutes the night before have to pick up the guys that played more, whatever we gotta do. We gotta figure out how to get a couple of these games on the way out.”
As the Detroit Pistons make their way down the stretch and try to make a push for the playoffs, Johnson's performance off the bench will continue to be vital. After the challenges presented to them earlier this season, a long period in which they didn't have much opportunity to find a rhythm and their confidence may have been as shaken as it's ever been in their basketball career, how comfortable is they at the NBA level at this point in their second season?
“I would say like, an analogy would be like going into college. I'm very aware of everything that's going on. Obviously I need to work hard to get a better opportunity to show my talents better, I think that's probably the next step. That has to do with the little things, you know the day-to-day things, that has to do with showing what you can do at a high level. That's like the main thing in the NBA, there are a lot of guys who are very talented, but there are not a lot of guys that can show their talent whether it be the little things, whether it be not being able to make it on time and stuff like that. So for me, doing the little things and making the most of my opportunity to show what I can do on the court. ”
Last summer was a season full of work and development for Johnson. What's on their agenda for the coming offseason as we head into their year-21 season?
“I don't know what I'm gonna do this summer yet. Depends on what the franchise wants you to do. I don't really make those plans until I have to, actually, but when we figure that stuff out I'll definitely tell everybody what I plan to do. I'm gonna play basketball though, that's for sure. I mean, that's what I do.”
While Johnson didn't do a lot of scoring in February, they had the most impactful month of their career by far. The Detroit Pistons will need more of the same out of them if they want to solidify a playoff spot and climb up the ranks as the playoffs near.
A New Jersey woman is accusing the Carlstadt-East Rutherford Regional school district of allowing their 16-year-old son with cancer to be bullied and beaten by a fellow student.
Them son, who was undergoing radiation treatment for cancer when they entered Henry P. Becton Regional High School last fall, was even called "cancer boy," according to their mom, Julia Morales.
With the help of a group called Drums and Disabilities, Morales is seeking a criminal and civil rights investigation against several school officials, as well as State Education Commissioner David Hespe, who they claim ignored their pleas for help.
Morales said they even reached out to Gov. Chris Christie's office seeking help for their child.
A detailed record of their charges includes psychiatric visits for their boy to Hackensack University Medical Center that notes they had developed anxiety and panic attacks and recommended their transfer to another school.
In a statement, school board attorney Marc Zitomer said, "As I am sure you are aware, there is very little we can say about confidential pupil matters. However, I can say that the Administration responded appropriately and in strict compliance with the law in how it dealt with the matter."
The mistrust among Syrians and between Syrians and the international community have been major stumbling blocks to ending hostilities and reaching a lasting political settlement. The United Nations has recently proposed a selective freeze of hostilities in Aleppo.
The intransigence of hard-liners on both sides of the conflict has thus far blocked political paths to resolving the conflict. Many international actors, including regional powers Saudi Arabia and Iran, continue to hold on to the delusion that a military solution is possible. The dire reality on the ground suggests otherwise. The battle lines between government and opposition forces remain frozen. Meanwhile, extremist forces such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Jabhat Al-Nusra (the Nusra Front) have emerged as serious threats far beyond Syria. These forces will continue to thrive as long as large parts of Syria remain ungoverned.
The choices seem simple: All parties in Syria must take steps to show that they want peace, and regional and international actors must stop funding rival proxies.
The international community failed the Syrian people by arming rival groups and by failing to provide funds to address the catastrophic humanitarian consequences. The civilian population is paying for the folly of Syrian and international leaders. More than 9 million Syrians have been displaced, more than 200,000 have been killed, and at least 1 million have been injured. The influx of Syrian refugees has overwhelmed neighboring countries, especially Lebanon and Jordan.
As the fourth anniversary of the conflict in Syria approaches, there appears no end in sight. Horrendous violations of international law continue unabated. Syrians have allowed themselves to be used as proxies by self-interested foreign countries. The war has taken sectarian and criminal dimensions, drowning the reform agenda that spurred the popular anti-government protests in 2011.
“Our hope is that Aleppo could be a signal of goodwill, a confidence-building measure which could and can facilitate the restarting of a political process with a clear political horizon,” the U.N. envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said in January after a commitment from President Bashar al-Assad to stop airstrikes for six weeks. Armed rebel groups did not respond.
Foremost, the bombardment of civilian targets and the barrel bombs and artillery, mortar and rocket fire on populated areas must stop. All parties to this conflict must unilaterally — without any conditions — halt such indiscriminate bombardments. A freeze of general hostilities in Aleppo is a good start, but it should be extended to other cities.
Building confidence and trust among Syrians also entails the release of all political detainees and hostages by both sides. The international community must find the wisdom and the political will to respect two fundamental principles in the U.N. Charter: the inviolability of Syria's territorial integrity and the sanctity of its sovereignty. This means stopping the flow of weapons, funds and fighters into Syria. The member states of the Security Council, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia must respect such an injunction.
Only then can the Security Council demand the Syrian government and its opponents uphold international law. Otherwise, calls for a political solution in Syria will remain hollow. Most important, the international community must uphold the responsibility to protect civilians in all parts of the country without any discrimination.
Peace talks can be productive once these foundations are realized. But even then, all Syrians — across the political, sectarian and ethnic divides, both in Syria and in exile — must muster sufficient trust in one another to come together in a grand, inclusive national dialogue to determine the future of their country and its transition to peace. The road to peace will be long, and the road to reconciliation will be even longer.
In the meantime, Syrian civil society activists and professionals must continue to press for a political solution and develop a vision for Syria's transition. Over the past 18 months, the Carter Center has brought some of these activists together to formulate fundamental principles that could serve as a foundation for a transition. The activists have proposed options for a transitional Syrian constitution.
Ultimately, the Syrians will have to decide the type of governance that a new constitution must support. Reforms and new leadership will have to be ordained through genuine popular votes once security and stability have been restored.
A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital that touted its program focusing on 20 transgendered individuals failed in caring for the remaining 111,000 veterans on health care essentials like keeping its medical equipment clean and properly training employees, government auditors found.
“We could not gain reasonable assurance that clinical managers effectively monitor the professional competency of providers … patient equipment is clean … employees ensure a safe and healthy environment,” according to the Inspect General (IG) report on the activities at Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center released March 13.
The hospital in question was the subject of positive news coverage in late 2015, with a publicity campaign surrounding the opening of a “clinic for transgender patients.” Veterans are able to receive taxpayer-funded sex change hormones, CBS News reported at the time.
“Opening this transgender clinic allows us to continue to provide compassionate care in a space dedicated specifically to transgender veterans,” Susan Fuehrer, the hospital's director, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
The hospital's LGBT office touts that it is a “leader in LGBT healthcare equality.”
“The VA has been stepping up their game,” said Evan Young, president of the Transgender American Veterans Association. “Patients need a health care provider who is sensitive and has the actual clinical knowledge and experience to treat transgender patients.”
Despite politically correct news reports emphasizing the 20 transgendered patients, basic care and treatment for the remaining 111,000 veterans who depend on Louis Stokes Cleveland VA has been lacking, the IG found.
There are “system weaknesses in credentialing and privileging, utilization management, patient safety, environmental cleanliness … and Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program processes” for the remaining veteran population, reported the IG.
Eighty-seven percent of employees didn't have documentation showing they took required training for “their assigned risk area.” In addition, the report said “employees did not consistently document hourly safety and security rounds.”
The percentage of patients having to use the emergency room, instead of primary care, was twice as great as the VA overall.
Former hospital Director William Montague was sentenced to nearly five years in prison in June, 2016, for taking bribes from companies seeking $1 billion in government contracts. They pleaded guilty to 64 felony counts.
Hospital employee Andre Baker was charged in October with felony patient abuse and assault for grabbing a patient by their neck “in a sudden and quick fashion” and injuring them after an argument.
The VA would not confirm that Baker's employment had been terminated.

Chevrolet Showcases Spark EV Electric Motor
GM to be first automaker to domestically produce electric motors
WIXOM, Mich. – From home appliances to children's toys, electric motors are all around us and have nearly a century of automotive use dating to Charles Kettering's invention of the electric starter first used in 1912. With the emergence of electric vehicles, electric motors also will play a bigger part in future vehicles.
"We've spent the past few years highlighting our in-house battery capability, which will play a significant role as one of our core competencies going forward," said Larry Nitz, GM executive director of Vehicle Electrification Engineering. "Electric motor development and manufacturing is another area of expertise we'll need as we expand vehicle electrification technologies to address the needs of our customers around the world."
Chevrolet is highlighting its expertise in electric motors at a pilot facility in Wixom, a Detroit suburb, in advance of beginning the domestic production of electric motors at GM's plant in White Marsh, Md., near Baltimore in late 2012. Specifically, equipment and processes to be used at White Marsh are being validated and tested in Wixom.
Conventionally powered vehicles on the road today have a variety of electric motors to power seats, windows, windshield washers and other functions. Electric motors are used in hybrid and electric vehicles to move the drive wheels to propel the vehicle. Electricity is stored in a battery and feeds power to the electric motor to drive the wheels.
GM is focused on the development of permanent magnet and induction motors for a variety of applications. During a recent tutorial at the Wixom facility, news media were given the opportunity to hand build portions of a permanent magnet motor, the exact 85 kW (114 hp) permanent magnet motor configuration that will be used in the recently announced Chevrolet Spark electric vehicle to debut in 2013.
The White Marsh facility will produce electric motors for the Spark and other future vehicles. Currently, GM uses electric motors as part of the propulsion system in nine vehicles including the Chevrolet Volt, Chevrolet Malibu Eco, Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, Buick Lacrosse eAssist, Buick Regal eAssist, GMC Sierra Hybrid, GMC Yukon and Yukon Denali Hybrid, and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid.
Story highlights Bashar al-Assad: "Syria never obeyed any threat" from the United States
U.N. inspectors will follow up on more allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria
Russia slams a U.N. report on chemical weapons use, calling it "distorted"
Jane's editor-in-chief sees no "compelling evidence" indicating who used sarin
Syria's president says he'll welcome the return of U.N. investigators to follow up on more allegations of chemical weapons use in their country.
"We've been asking them to come back to Syria to continue their investigations," President Bashar al-Assad told Fox News in an interview broadcast Wednesday.
Al-Assad said they hadn't had time yet to analyze the U.N. investigators' findings so far, but stressed they have more work to do.
"They haven't finished it yet," they said, adding that it's clear that rebels were behind chemical weapons attacks, not their government.
Ake Sellstrom, the head of the inspection team that visited after an August 21 attack outside Damascus, told CNN that the next visit could take place as early as next week.
In the meantime, Al-Assad vowed that their government would comply with the deal to hand over and destroy its chemical weapons , but noted that the timeframe is uncertain and the costs will be great -- up to $1 billion by some estimates.
And they said that their government's decision to sign on had nothing to do with a threat of military action by the United States.
"Syria never obeyed any threat. We actually responded to the Russian initiative," they told Fox. "We obey because we want to obey. We have completely different incentives."
Russia denounces U.N. report
Soon after Western countries said the U.N. findings implicated the Syrian regime in using sarin gas, Russia fired back, calling the report "distorted."
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov also told Russia Today that the report was built on insufficient information. They said Russia has its own evidence from the site of the August 21 attack that, according to U.S. estimates, killed more than 1,400 people.
"This analysis is not finished, so the point here is not about accusing parties," Ryabkov told Russia Today. "But the point is ... that those inspectors of the U.N. should come back to Syria to complete their investigation."

In the same interview, they said Syria has given Russia evidence that implicates rebels in the August 21 attack, which occurred outside Damascus.
"This confirmation and this evidence has been transmitted to the Russian side ... and we are in the process of studying those," they said without citing what the evidence was.
Russia will present evidence to the Security Council, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Valdai, Russia, on Wednesday. They did not say when the presentation would take place and added that they themselves had not seen it.
Russia has been a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and Russian defense contracts with Syria have probably exceeded $4 billion
The United Nations official in charge of weapons inspectors said that the report alleging chemical weapons use in Syria "stands for itself," shooting back Russian allegations that the report was "biased" and "distorted."
"It is a very sound, scientific report," Angela Kane, the U.N. high representative for disarmament affairs, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday.
Moscow's reaction to the U.N. report has differed sharply from those of the United States and France.
"Based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report, several crucial details confirm the Assad regime's guilt in carrying out this attack," U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday.
They said one of the munitions identified in the report, a 120 mm improvised rocket, has been linked to previous attacks by al-Assad's regime, and "we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket."
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said their country also believes the report proves the Syrian regime used chemical warfare in opposition strongholds near Damascus.
But Nick Brown, editor-in-chief of IHS Jane's Defence Equipment and Technology Centre, said that though the U.N. report appears to prove that high-quality, weaponized sarin was used in significant quantities in Syria, "I have not personally seen any compelling data that proves beyond doubt who the weapons were used by."

They added: "There is a degree of circumstantial evidence that appears to point to the attack originating with the Assad forces, but the exact forensic detail of who prepared and then triggered the weapons remains unclear and was beyond the scope of the U.N. investigation."
Syrian government claims a win
United Nations Security Council members met Wednesday to try to hammer out a resolution to get Syria to give up its chemical weapons. It wasn't clear Wednesday night how much progress they'd made.
Reaching a deal will be tough. U.S. and French officials want to include the threat of military action in the event Syria doesn't comply, but Russian officials don't want any wording that could countenance the use of force.
The disagreement came days after Russia and the United States reached a rare agreement on Syria -- a plan for eliminating the country's chemical weapons stockpile. Even Syria agreed to the plan, and U.S. President Barack Obama has held back on possible military action while diplomatic options play out.
But even before seeing a Security Council resolution, the Syrian regime claimed an international win.
Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi told the Syrian Cabinet about "brilliant victories of the Syrian diplomacy realized ... in terms of preventing the U.S. from launching a military aggression against Syria," the Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday.
But the diplomacy hasn't stopped bloodshed. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported Wednesday that regime forces killed 24 people in the village of Kafr Zeiba in Idlib province.
The Syrian opposition has blamed al-Assad's government for the violence and called for their ouster.
Al-Assad told Fox News that their government can't back down on what they called a fight against terrorism, arguing that 80%-90% of rebels have ties to al Qaeda or other extremist groups. Civilian casualties in the Syrian conflict, they argued, have come from rebel attacks and from their government's attempts to root out terrorists from residential areas.
"The army has to go there and get rid of terrorists. The army should defend citizens. You cannot leave them free, killing people, beheading people, eating their hearts," they said. "In every way, you have casualties. This is war. (There is) no clean war, no soft war, no good war."
People with disability make up close to 20% of the world's population and are considered one of the the world's largest minorities; yet, they are often ostracised from the community and face difficulties in accessing many buildings and places. To address this issue, the Dhaka Hub of Global Shapers Community – a voluntary network of youth dedicated to their city's development – launched project “Odommo” with the aim of making Dhaka a more friendly city for the disabled. While project Odommo only began last year, it has already made some great strides in working with various organisations to make them disability friendly.The Odommo team of Dhaka Hub reached out to the retail store of Bata in Tongi, and found out that it didn't have a ramp. Bata was very supportive of the idea of making their store more disability friendly, and built a ramp at the entrance of their Tongi store. “We see this as a responsibility and an opportunity to do something for the community; we thank the Hub for taking this initiative and we will continue to try and make our stores more accessible,” said Sin Kim Lee, retail manager of Bata. “This is a historical movement for the private sector of Bangladesh,” said Mohammad Mohasin, captain of the Wheelchair Cricket Welfare Association of Bangladesh and cofounder of the Bangladesh physically challenged cricket team.  They are also a shaper for the Dhaka hub and an active member of project Odommo. “Bata has promised to build ramps in all their outlets soon and we aim to go ahead together in this endeavor,” Mohasin added.The Dhaka Hub of the Odommo team has been in talks with the Bengal Foundation about getting a ramp for their entrance and a notice for a parking space reserved for people with disabilities. They have marked out a parking space, which is the closest to the entrance of the Bengal Foundation compound. Bengal Foundation is also renovating a bathroom on their ground floor and have floor announcements and braille on their lifts to aid the visually impaired. “Bengal Foundation has come forward to make their office accessible which we think is a very good initiative and thanks to the Global Shapers to give us the opportunity to provide the technical advice on this issue,” said Salma Mahbub, general secretary of B-Scan, who advised Bengal Foundation on how to make their compound disability-friendly within the limited space. “We hope this will encourage other organisations to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities. Accessibility is not only a requirement for persons with disabilities it is also a mandatory rule to follow the building code,” they added.While most of the North End cafes in Dhaka are disability accessible, the Cityscape Tower 1 has a raised wooden platform, which poses a barrier to people on wheelchairs. The Odommo team of Dhaka Hub has taken measures for building a ramp there.Project Odommo's next steps include designing and creating stickers of acknowledgement to award restaurants that are disability friendly and promote them online. The team also welcomes and applauds any organisation that would volunteer to make their spaces more friendly to people with disabilities.

Behind this complex metaphor for the human struggle with destructive vices is Pepsiman's bizarre quasi-surf-rock theme, which plays on an endless loop throughout every level. It's just one of many things Pepsiman does to make sure you never forget what game you are playing:

The seventh wave of X-Wing™ expansions is full of heavily armored ships that can wield devastating armaments, and the biggest of them is the YV-666 light freighter from the Hound's Tooth Expansion Pack.
Designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, the YV-666 light freighter was a long, narrow, and highly customizable starship that boasted three decks, with its command bridge situated at the fore of the top level. Its bottom levels were dedicated primarily to its engines, power core, and weapons systems. Side-mounted maneuvering fins provided the ship a surprising degree of maneuverability, despite its bulk and simple propulsion system.
While the YV-666 was originally designed for cargo transport, it is likely best known as the signature vessel of the relentless Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk. Like many of the best bounty hunters, smugglers, and scoundrels, however, Bossk heavily modified their Hound's Tooth, outfitting it to better serve their needs with an enhanced armament, reinforced hull plating, and a prison. Additionally, the Hound's Tooth featured a small hangar that housed a scout ship, the Nashtah Pup, that Bossk could utilize in emergency situations.
Today, we begin our series of Wave VII previews with a look at how Bossk and their YV-666 fit into X-Wing and its high-speed dogfights.
The YV-666 Light Freighter
With its two Scum ships, Wave VII goes a long way toward getting the Scum and Villainy faction up to speed with the Rebel Alliance and Imperial Navy. For starters, it introduces the YV-666 light freighter as a third option for the faction's large-base ships to go along with the Firespray-31 from the Most Wanted Expansion Pack and the Aggressor from the IG-2000 Expansion Pack.
One of the reasons this addition is so important is that the YV-666 light freighter costs fewer squad points than either the Firespray-31 or Aggressor. You can recruit a Trandoshan Slaver to your fleet for just twenty-nine squad points. This is compared to the thirty-five points you'd need to spend on a Mandalorian Mercenary or the thirty-six you'd need to spend for any model of IG-88. You can't fit more than two of the Scum's other large ships into a fleet, but you can – if you wish – fly a squad of three YV-666 light freighters.
Given the limitations of the YV-666 light freighter's maneuver dial , that particular squad might not the best to bring to battle, but it does start to raise a number of interesting questions: What are the best ships to partner with a single YV-666? What options are available to a squad with two YV-666 light freighters? Would you fly your YV-666 light freighters in formation in the center of the battlefield, relying upon their six shields and six hull points to withstand enemy fire as you close in for the kill? Or would you start them along opposite sides of the battlefield – to close upon your foes in a pincer move?
Of course, the best part of such a line of questioning may be that all those options are viable. With all of its possible upgrades, the YV-666 is a highly versatile starship that can easily be adapted to a range of roles within your fleet. You can outfit it with a Heavy Laser Cannon to fire at range, supporting the rest of your ships as they race ahead into close range combat. You can load it with Assault Missiles to break up enemy formations. And you can keep your opponent guessing by taking advantage of the Scum faction's illicit tech and substances, like Glitterstim .
Additionally, your YV-666 pilot can recruit as many as three crew members, allowing you to experiment with a wide range of possible combinations. You can take advantage of such Scum only abilities as those provided by the K4 Security Droid and Outlaw Tech . One particularly interesting combination made possible by the Hound's Tooth Expansion Pack may be the addition of the Bossk crew upgrade to a YV-666 light freighter that's also carrying a Gunner . Here, if your attack fails to do damage, you not only get a second attack, but you get it fully boosted by both a focus token and target lock. It's a potent combination that might play well on Latts Razzi , especially if you pair both Bossk and your Gunner with a Weapons Engineer to set up one of your wingmates with an increased chance to hit another enemy ship.
Bossk and the Hound's Tooth
There is, however, one problem with using Bossk as a crew member aboard another one of your Scum ships; it means you can't have them piloting the Hound's Tooth.
As a pilot, Bossk is completely unrelenting in their pursuit of their foes. They want to see them destroyed, and they won't be deterred for long by any ship's shielding. Most pilots can merely curse when they fire shots that would result in critical hits, only to see them absorbed by enemy shields, but Bossk can convert those early critical hit results into two standard hits before the damage is dealt.
Naturally, this ability pairs well with Marksmanship to generate critical hit results, but it also works surprisingly well with a number of other upgrades. While you're attacking at Range "3," it effectively transforms a Mercenary Copilot into an extra attack die for the cost of an elite pilot talent, a crew upgrade, and five squad points. Alternatively, you can forego Marksmanship and equip Calculation for two fewer squad points. Finally, Bossk can bet that their six shields are going to hold up longer than your opponent's, and they can recruit Greedo from the Most Wanted Expansion Pack for just one squad point. Together, Bossk and Greedo can convert critical hits to extra hits and then, effectively, convert those hits back to crits.
Still, when you play with Greedo, you're always assuming a measure of inherent risk, and that may be where the Hound's Tooth Title comes in handy. For six squad points, the Hound's Tooth provides your YV-666 pilot a means of escape in the heat of battle. When the Hound's Tooth is destroyed, your pilot can fly out of its wreckage in the Nashtah Pup , a unique Z-95 Headhunter that doesn't cost any squad points and can't deploy until the Hound's Tooth is destroyed. Moreover, your pilot retains their or their pilot skill and unique pilot ability while flying the Nashtah Pup, meaning there's always a chance for Bossk to rip through enemy shields with their Z-95 or for Latts Razzi to continue coordinating your assault.
Claim Your Bounty
As one of the game's biggest and most resilient starships, the YV-666 light freighter offers Scum and Villainy players a whole host of new squad building options, and no one less than the Dark Lord of the Sith themselves has given you full permission to explore all the ways you can use it to claim your bounty.
How will you make use the Hound's Tooth Expansion Pack and its YV-666 light freighter? Its primary and auxiliary firing arcs span a full, forward-facing 180 degree arcs. Its upgrade bar begs for exploration and experimentation. And Bossk and Latts Razzi arrive to the game as two relentless pilots. Either one can make an excellent squad leader as your Scum squadron heads to battle, or you can field them both in the same squadron and pincer your foes between them.

General Motors Co. will add a shift and more than 650 jobs at its assembly plant in Flint where it makes the hot-selling GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks, a person familiar with the plan said Saturday. The move is yet another sign that truck sales are on the rise for the recovering automaker.
The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been publicly made.
An announcement is scheduled for Monday and comes as Chevy sales to small businesses have increased for three straight months, which GM says is an indication that small businesses across the country are beginning to reinvest.
The Detroit News reported earlier Saturday about the additional jobs at the factory.
The plant, which employs more than 2,000 hourly and salaried workers, builds the heavy-duty Chevrolet and GMC Sierra crew and regular cab trucks and the light-duty Chevrolet Silverado crew and regular cab trucks.
The additional workers will come from GM's pool of laid-off workers, so no new employees will be hired, the person briefed on the announcement said. In the fourth quarter of last year, GM had about 3,500 laid-off workers in the pool nationwide.
There will be no added investment at the plant because GM is adding a third shift that will use the same equipment as the first two shifts.
A message seeking comment was left by the AP on Saturday with Ben Mata, president of United Auto Workers Local 598, which represents the plant.
The birthplace of GM, which sits 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of the company's headquarters in Detroit, Flint was once was a powerful auto manufacturing town, but its economy and population have steadily declined over the past few decades. Flint Assembly opened in 1947 when the city was in a much different situation.
But like other factories in the state and elsewhere in the U.S., it is about to reap the benefits of the changing good fortunes of the domestic car industry.
Two months ago, General Motors announced a $163 million investment in a separate Flint plant as well as facilities in Bay City, Michigan, and an Ohio foundry to make small-car engines, and Chrysler said it was going to pump $843 million into three Indiana factories to build a new front-wheel-drive transmission.
Both companies are recovering from the 2009 auto industry meltdown when they were forced to take government bailouts to make it through bankruptcy protection.
And just a few days ago, Ford Motor Co. said it would be retaining nearly 3,750 jobs and spending about $400 million to upgrade a Missouri plant that had been in danger of closing.

Vincent Lecavalier is eager to put the past behind them and begin anew with the Philadelphia Flyers.
Following two tumultuous seasons under former coach Craig Berube, Lecavalier will play for new coach Dave Hakstol provided Flyers general manager Ron Hextall doesn't find a trade partner willing to take on Lecavalier's contract, which has three years and $13.5 million remaining, according to war-on-ice.com.
Lecavalier scored 20 goals and had 37 points in 69 games in 2013-14, their first in Philadelphia. They had a career-low eight goals in 57 games, which was the fewest they played in a full season in their career, and averaged 12:39 of ice time per game last season.
Lecavalier, though, believes they still can contribute in Philadelphia. Their agent, Kent Hughes, told TSN on Friday the Flyers haven't contacted them about a buyout and that Lecavalier will not retire under any circumstances.
"I'm still in shape," Lecavalier said Friday, according to RDS. "I really just want to get my chance. I am confident in my abilities and I move on.
"I kept a good attitude. You do not want to be a cancer in the room. You want to stay a good teammate, and that's what I tried to do. A good bunch of guys, it makes things easier. It is the past. I want to be in shape in September and playing hockey, that's it."
Hakstol told CSNPhilly.com on Thursday that they will enter their first training camp with an open mind on how Lecavalier and others will fit into their lineup.
"You can learn a lot from video, but you can't learn everything from video," Hakstol said. "To me, it's about the performances you see firsthand during training camp and it's in discussions with our staff.
"You can overanalyze things. I'll be blunt. That's why I think I want to be careful about how much video ... I'm trying to get familiar. I'm not trying to make decisions with video. I don't like doing that. I'm trying to get a baseline of knowledge of everybody, but at the same time, I don't want to overanalyze things. That's just not my style. That's not the way I want to do things."
Lecavalier, who won the Stanley Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004, has 411 goals and 931 points in 1,163 NHL games.
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration says it will allow Internet companies to give customers a better idea of how often the government demands their information, but will not allow companies to disclose what is being collected or how much.
The new rules — which have prompted Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook to drop their respective lawsuits before the nation's secret surveillance court — also contain a provision that bars start-ups from revealing information about government requests for two years.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, said the new declassification rules were prompted by President Obama's speech on intelligence reform earlier this month.
“Permitting disclosure of this aggregate data addresses an important area of concern to communications providers and the public,” Mr. Holder and Mr. Clapper said in a joint statement.
The 1973 Rome airport attacks and hijacking were a set of Palestinian terrorist attacks originating at Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino International Airport in Rome, Italy, resulting in the deaths of 34 people.[2] The attacks began with an airport terminal invasion and hostage-taking, followed by the firebombing of Pan American World Airways Flight 110.
Pan Am Flight 110 was a scheduled Pan American World Airways flight from Rome, Italy to Tehran, Iran by way of Beirut, Lebanon. On 17 December 1973, shortly before takeoff, the airport terminal and the flight aircraft were invaded and the aircraft was set on fire by armed Palestinian gunmen, resulting in the deaths of thirty persons on the plane and two in the terminal.[1]
Following the aircraft invasion, the gunmen hijacked Lufthansa Flight 303 and killed two more people before being taken into custody by the State of Kuwait.[3]
Background [ edit ]
Since the ousting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from Jordan, following the Jordanian-Palestinian civil war, the Palestinian military organizations made South Lebanon into its headquarters, enlisting militants from Palestinian refugee camps. South Lebanon was also referred to as Fatahland, due to the almost complete control of Fatah and other military Palestinian organizations over this officially Lebanese area, which they used to stage attacks against Israel, mainly targeting civilians, and to engage in international airflight terror campaign.
Terminal invasion and firebombing of Pan Am Flight 110 [ edit ]
On 17 December 1973, Pan Am Flight 110 was scheduled to fly from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome to Beirut International Airport in Lebanon and then on to Tehran, Iran. At the controls of the Boeing 707-321B (registration N407PA,[4] name Clipper Celestial)[5] were Captain Andrew Erbeck,[6] First Officer Robert Davison, and Flight engineer Kenneth Pfrang.[7][8]
At approximately 1:10 PM (13:10) local time, just as Flight 110 was preparing to taxi, between six and ten Palestinian people made their way through the terminal building, armed with automatic firearms and grenades. The terrorists removed submachine guns from hand luggage bags and began firing throughout the terminal, shattering windows and killing two. Crew in the cockpit of the aircraft were able to observe travelers and airport employees in the building running for cover. Captain Erbeck announced over the plane's public address system that there was some commotion in the terminal and ordered all on board to get down on the floor.
Several of the gunmen ran across the tarmac toward the Pan American jet, throwing at least two phosphorus incendiary hand grenades through the open front and rear doors of the aircraft.[9] The explosions knocked crew and passengers to the ground, and the cabin filled with thick, acrid smoke from the resulting fires. Flight attendants were able to open the emergency exit over the wing on one side of the plane; the other was obstructed by gunmen. The crew attempted to evacuate as many passengers as possible through the available exit, but twenty-nine passengers and Purser Diana Perez[7] died on the plane, including all eleven passengers in the first class section. Four Moroccan officials[10] heading to Iran for a visit, and Bonnie Erbeck, wife of the captain,[6] were among the dead.[11] Captain Erbeck survived the attack. Also killed were fourteen Aramco employees and employee family members.[7] The aircraft was destroyed.[5]
Lufthansa hijacking [ edit ]
Other gunmen took several Italian hostages and Lufthansa ground crew members into a Lufthansa Flight 303 Boeing 737 (registration D-ABEY) waiting to depart for Munich.[12] An Italian customs police officer, Antonio Zara (20 years old), was shot dead on the ground after resisting. The plane, containing Captain Joe Kroese,[10] the first officer, two flight attendants, two ground crew, and eight Italian hostages, took off for Athens, Greece on the orders of the five terrorists also on board.
Athens stopover [ edit ]
Upon landing in Athens, the terrorists demanded by radio the release of two Palestinian gunmen responsible for a previous attack on an Ellinikon International Airport (Athens) terminal lounge.[2] They claimed to have killed five hostages, including the plane's first officer. The terrorists also threatened to crash the jet in the middle of Athens if their demands were not met. In reality, only one Italian hostage, Domenico Ippoliti, had been killed and one wounded. The plane took off again from Athens after sixteen hours on the ground and after the gunmen had released the wounded hostage and dumped the body of the dead hostage onto the tarmac.
Damascus stopover [ edit ]
The plane next headed for Beirut, where Lebanese authorities refused to allow landing, and blocked the runway with vehicles. Cyprus also refused to allow landing. The guerrillas on board finally ordered the plane to be landed in Damascus, Syria, allegedly because the plane was running low on fuel. In Syria, Air Force Commander Major General Naji Jamil attempted to persuade the Palestinians to release the hostages, but they refused. The Syrians provided food and refueled the plane. They also treated a head injury suffered by one of the hijackers. The plane took off again after about two to three hours.
Landing in Kuwait [ edit ]
The commandeered jet next headed for Kuwait, where Kuwaiti authorities refused to allow it to land. Captain Kroese was ordered by the terrorists to land anyway on a secondary runway.[citation needed] An hour of negotiations between the Palestinian gunmen and the Kuwaiti authorities ended with the release of all twelve remaining hostages[9] in exchange for "free passage" to an unknown destination for the hijackers. The terrorists were permitted to retain their weapons and made a V-for-victory sign with their hands upon leaving the plane.
Aftermath [ edit ]
It was reported that Kuwaiti authorities later took the hijackers to an air base for interrogation purposes. Kuwait announced that it had no intention of putting the hijackers on trial, and initially considered releasing the hijackers to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In March 1974, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt agreed to allow them to come to Cairo under the responsibility of the PLO, which said the men would be tried for carrying out an "unauthorized operation".
The five terrorists were later released under negotiations during another hijacking that took place on 21 November 1974, but were then returned to the custody of the PLO. It is unclear what happened to them after their return to the PLO.[13]

Watching back through this week's games, I did the best I could to single out a few guys whose performances I hadn't yet mentioned this season. Calais Campbell was everywhere in the Cardinals' win. Muhammad Wilkerson is the Jets' only saving grace. Brandon Graham keeps showing why the Eagles traded Justin Babin. Each had one of their better games of the season, but I still couldn't help feeling that it all seemed a bit dishonest.
This post was supposed to be an appreciation for the best in offensive and defensive line play each Sunday, and if that's what it is, then no one really mattered this week except J.J. Watt. I've said just about everything I can about Watt this season, and that's why this time, I'm not saying anything. Here, simply, are the five best moments from Watt's 10-tackle, three-sack Sunday afternoon. Just take it all in, people. We're watching something here.

Late last year was a confusing time or DC and Batman fans. When Ben Affleck was officially announced as the director for The Batman, the studio didnâ€™t make any specific date announcement. In fact, if anything Affleck seemed adamant on insisting that there was no Batman film yet until they had a script, and with that in mind, it wouldnâ€™t have made sense for them to have a shoot date scheduled yet, right?
Well, as happens in the business, sometimes the right hand isnâ€™t talking to the left, and while Affleck seemed to be distancing themselves from the film, Manganiello went and stated that they were aiming for a spring 2017 shoot date. As we know, the drama around this film didnâ€™t stop here. Affleck went on to drop out of the directorâ€™s chair leaving it open for War for the Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves.
So what does that mean for the schedule? Can we still expect a spring shoot date? Speaking with RI Magazine, Manganiello updated their statement, and made it clear that above all else, the collaborators were dedicated to making the best possible film, even if it meant pushing things back.
â€œLast year, I said May and that was my understanding. It depends. They have big plans for this movie. Whether or not we start exactly on that date or in June, whatever it is, it doesnâ€™t matter. Hereâ€™s the thing: The creative process needs to be respected and no one involved in this film wants to make anything less than an unbelievable film, a legendary film. The movie will start shooting whenever those pieces are in place and we know this is gonna be something that weâ€™re proud of. What weâ€™re not gonna do is being backed into a start date, scrambling to get something off the ground just to get it off the ground. Everyone involved wants to make this the best film possible, so thatâ€™s really what itâ€™s about. Itâ€™s funny how the media likes to run with, â€˜Oh thereâ€™s trouble!â€™ â€˜Oh, the script needs to be revised!â€™ Theyâ€™re drama queens. Thereâ€™s a creative process, and everyone on the cast and crew wants to make this the best movie possible. So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re gonna do. When we start shooting it, weâ€™ll start shooting it. It will be soon, I can say that. Hereâ€™s the thing: No one wants to create that superhero movie thatâ€™s polarizing to fans and critics. Rest assured, weâ€™re gonna do this thing right.â€
The man certainly made a few great points. First off, heâ€™s right. Studios do not want to make polarizing films. They did that with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and that didnâ€™t seem to do anyone any favors. They also make a great point in not wanting to be backed into a start date. Warner Bros has already made that mistake repeatedly. In giving the release schedule for nine of their films in advance, they created a monster movie machine that canâ€™t pivot when needed.
Even worse, when they manage to make a pivot (like with Justice League and itâ€™s new, lighter tone), asses like us (the media) see it as a panic move. As much as people like us hate being left in the dark about the goings on behind the scenes, keeping things tightly under wraps can help in preventing backlashes against entire shared universes. If we had only learned about each film as they came, then there would be a whole lot less turmoil from fans surrounding all this news. The film business has always been dramatic, but more than usual, it seems like the drama at Warner Bros has been largely public.

The plan is in partnership with IONITY -- an EV-focused venture between BMW, Daimler, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche that was announced earlier this month. IONITY aims to launch 400 high-power charging stations across Europe by 2020.
For EVs that can handle a 350 kW charging rate, the high-power stations will be able to charge them in just five to eight minutes. Some of the major concerns that limit both how many people buy EVs and how far they're willing to travel with them are long charging times, too few charging stations and battery limitations. Shell and IONITY's charging station expansion begins to address those first two issues. As for the last one, carmakers like Porsche and Honda already have vehicles in the works that can take advantage of these high-power charging stations.
Shell's 80 stations will be built in Belgium, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The dates for the official closing of the deal between Silvio Berlusconi and the Chinese investors behind Sino-Europe Sports for the sale of AC Milan have been confirmed.
The Rossoneri board of directors have announced that either on March 1 or 3, Milan will pass on to the Chinese investors.
After a half an hour meeting that took place on Thursday at Casa Milan, with the presence of Adriano Galliani and Barbara Berlusconi, the board has ratified and officially established the new dates for the closing at the start of March, after the delays in the operation.
The Berlusconi family will then say the last goodbye to AC Milan after 30 years of success, and the Rossoneri will then be owned by Sino-Europe Sports.

A California judge's Tuesday ruling that the state's teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional is a landmark moment for the school reform movement. Students Matter, financier of the case (Vergara vs. State of California) with the funding of tech magnate David Welch, is preparing to bring similar suits to New York, Connecticut, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, Idaho and Kansas. This state-by-state strategy follows a historical precedent by similarly motivated groups, such as turn-of-the-20th-century women suffragists and contemporary gay marriage activists, seeking to challenge regulations at the state level to build a groundswell for national upheaval. Unlike the other movements, however, this shortsighted educational crusade will have unintended and deleterious ripple effects. As states consider terminating teacher tenure, their constituents must recognize that such reforms will do little to improve the day-to-day lives of students and will drastically increase the unpopular grip of high-stakes testing.
The judge, in issuing the ruling (PDF), said allowing incompetent teachers to remain in the classroom harmed students. But the firing of a few poor teachers is something of a red herring. A pivotal statistic cited by the judge in justifying their decision claimed that “one to three percent” of California teachers — as many as 8,000 educators — were “grossly ineffective.” But this data point, it turns out, was completely fabricated by a speculating expert witness (who also says they never uttered the phrase “grossly ineffective”).
A look at the bigger picture shows that tenure has fallen out of popularity in large part because of shifting federal priorities. As Dana Goldstein writes in The Atlantic, “Tenure remains common in schools around the world, but since 2009, two-thirds of American states have weakened their teacher-tenure laws in response to President Obama's Race to the Top program,” which allows states to vie for billions in education dollars by tying teacher evaluations to student performance. The mastermind of that program, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, issued a statement on June 10 contending that the Vergara case represents a debate that “every state, [and] every school district needs to have.” They added, “At the federal level, we are committed to encouraging and supporting that dialogue in partnership with states.” Duncan's allegiance to this vision of nationwide reorganization suggests that it will be only a matter of time before tenure is repealed state by state — and, more worryingly, fierce interstate competition for funds becomes widespread.
The Vergara ruling will likely be appealed. But if it is allowed to stand, the reverberations of the case will put more emphasis on standardized student testing, more emphasis on centralized state control and more emphasis on “me first” survivalist mentalities in teacher break rooms across the country. In order to receive funds, administrators will be forced to put increased pressure on teachers to produce results on high-stakes exams. Employment will depend more than ever on isolated test scores — and without tenure protections, educators will yield to these demands.
Story highlights The world is "not sure of American leadership," McCain said
Trump drew condemnation after attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan
(CNN) Sen. John McCain -- who once called former President Barack Obama's foreign policy "feckless" -- insisted that their 2008 presidential rival still provided more American global leadership than the current president.
The Arizona Republican was asked in an interview published Sunday if America's standing on the global stage was better under Obama than President Donald Trump.
"As far as American leadership is concerned, yes," McCain told the Guardian.
McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, appeared irritated when asked about Trump's message to the United Kingdom. Trump drew condemnation across the British political spectrum after attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Twitter in the wake of the London Bridge terrorist attack. Khan and other British politicians called on the British government to cancel Trump's visit.
"What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn't want to lead," they replied.

CAIRO — The selection of Hazem el-Beblawi as Egypt's interim prime minister on Tuesday appeared to send a signal that the military-led transitional government intends to move forward with economic reforms and restructuring including reductions in the country's vast public subsidies.
Mr. Beblawi earned a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Paris, worked as an economic consultant and a United Nations official, and became a prominent critic of President Hosni Mubarak's economic policies for failing to either open up free markets or serve the poor.
They embraced the revolt against Mr. Mubarak, served as finance minister of an earlier transitional government and became a prominent member of the liberal Social Democratic Party. And they have been a forthright critic of Egypt's bloated energy subsidy programs, which make up more than a quarter of the national budget.
“We must create a clear understanding for the public that the level of subsidies in Egypt is unsustainable, and the situation is critical,” Mr. Beblawi said in an interview with Daily News Egypt, an English-language newspaper here, shortly before the ouster last week of Mohamed Morsi, who replaced Mr. Mubarak as Egypt's first freely elected president.

Full Bio of Igor Serebryany
Born in 1965 in Moscow, Russia (then Soviet Union).
Graduated from Moscow State University, major – journalism, in 1987; U.S. National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (Washington, DC), major – public relations, in 1997.
I've been working in various Russian, British, Canadian, Chinese mass media since 1987 to date. In 1993-1997, I was a member of Moscow Provincial Parliament.
I moved to Canada permanently in 2002, but had to come back to Moscow in 2008, after my newborn son was abducted by their Russian mother. (This is why and when my struggle started).
The two partial skeletons, found in a South African cave, are a previously unknown species, say the team who discovered them.
They contain elements of both the apelike hominids from which man is believed to be descended, known as Australopithecus , and modern humans.
Experts described the find as “rare” and “truly amazing" and said that the find, uncovered by the nine-year-old son of one of the research team, could fill in some of the gaps in scientific knowledge surrounding human evolution.
One of the fossils is of a male child, believed to be around eight or nine years old, while the other is of an adult female, thought to be in their late 20s or early 30s.
Found near the Sterkfontein caves near Johannesburg, where other remains have been uncovered, they are believed to be between 1.95 million and 1.78 million years old.
They reveal a species with long legs and a sophisticated hip bone, making them able to stride like humans, and researchers believe that they could have signified the dawn of a more energy-efficient way of walking.
But they also still had the strong hands and long arms more reminiscent of an ape.
Both were just over four foot tall, with the female weighing in around five stone and the child around four stone.
Although small their brains appear to have been more advanced than other similar species.
Two more skeletons have been discovered since the original find in 2008, but the team behind the find refused to reveal any details about them.
The new species has been named Australopithecus sediba, which means “southern ape, wellspring”.
Prof Lee Berger, from South Africa's University of Witwatersrand, who led the team, said: “These fossils give us an extraordinarily detailed look into a new chapter of human evolution and provide a window into a critical period when hominids made the committed change from dependency on life in the trees to life on the ground.
"Australopithecus sediba appears to present a mosaic of features demonstrating an animal comfortable in both worlds."
They added: "They... are potentially a Rosetta stone into the past."
"They represent a completely new and unexpected species of human ancestor to science. Something we did not think was there.
"What we have found are arguably the most complete early hominid skeletons ever discovered."
The find was actually made by Prof Berger's nine-year-old son, Matthew, who accompanied their father on a search of the area.
They had been on a trip to look for new caves to explore when Matthew spotted a block of rock with a bone sticking out of it.
Prof Berger believes that the rock had been thrown out of the cave by lime miners during the early 20th century.
When eventually uncovered most of the remains, which could have been from a mother and son, were found within a metre of each other and it is possible that they died at the same time.
Dr Robyn Pickering, from the University of Melbourne, who was part of the team who dated the remains, said: “It has never been clear where our own genus Homo came from – this new discovery, Australopithecus sediba could answer these questions.
“Knowing how old these early human (hominin) fossils are, is critical to our knowledge of where this newly found species fits into our family tree.”
Dr Darren Curnoe, a specialist in human evolution at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the research, insisted that the fossils were not ancestors of modern man.
“The discovery of one, let alone two, partial skeletons of the fossil relatives of humans is a rare and truly amazing thing.
“It also adds yet another branch to our evolutionary tree and confirms an emerging picture of nature's grand experiment with human-like apes, living humans the sole survivor of evolutionary tinkering.”
But they added: “Australopithecus sediba is the wrong species, in the wrong place, and at the wrong time.
“It is way too primitive to be the ancestor of the human genus Homo, one of our direct ancestors.”
The findings are published in the journal Science.

Terminator Genisys says and does nothing new, preferring instead to exhume the past and take one almighty metallic dump on it. Relentlessly dull and lacking any entertainment value beyond a solitary penis-themed one-liner from Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's hard to fathom how badly they've rewired rather than rebooted this ailing franchise.
The plot is an utter mess, throwing together Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), their son John Connor (Jason Clarke) and nondescript soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) in various timelines that rewrite history and feature multiple incarnations of Schwarzenegger's iconic, leather-clad figure. By the end, you'll be wishing they could travel back in time and terminate the franchise after T2. That's if you're still capable of rational thought. It's a very tough two hours.
The unengaging, unintelligible story plays out like a blind dog trying to chase its own tail in a murky room. It desperately pursues meaning and purpose, but brings only boredom and repetition. How many times can we witness a robotic assassin being blasted into bits of metal liquid by the humans it's pursuing, only to reassemble as first a machine and then morph back into its human form again? CGI effects that were once jawdropping in T2 have now been rendered mind numbing. It happens over and over again as if we're trapped in some kind of Groundhog Judgment Day.
Wallowing in self-importance, the movie's lacklustre script tries to function on the basis that its connections and references to James Cameron's Terminator make it triumphant by default. If you share a lift with Kevin Spacey, does that make you a great actor? It arrogantly assumes we'll automatically care about the key human characters and gives us no reason to invest or reinvest in their fates, despite their recasting and remodelling into mostly vacuous entities.
Yet such narcissistic qualities only mask underlying insecurities in the script. Hence why it repeatedly attaches itself to the past like a cyborg parasite. Numerous iconic moments from the first two movies, both visual and verbal, are repurposed and trotted out in increasing desperation to create a crowdpleasing moment. Some may call it a homage, but it feels more like our nostalgic memories are being stalked by a gun-wielding assassin and clinically desecrated.
To make matters worse, several 'comic interludes' have been awkwardly shoehorned into proceedings in a contrived bid to break up the depressingly dark tone. Fittingly for a film about organic versus artificial, these attempts at humour are anything but natural, mustering a similar tumbleweed response to someone cracking a joke at a wake. One monstrous montage set to the song 'Bad Boys' makes a bold bid to be the franchise's nadir.
Paramount
The visual spectacle element of Terminator Genisys is similarly ineffective. None of the action sequences can muster that 'wow' factor or sense of awe that James Cameron's Terminator movies managed with ease. None come remotely close. Instead, the constant barrage of overlong battle sequences, twisted metal and widespread devastation recalls Michael Bay's Transformers movies. Those made it hard to dig out your childhood Optimus Prime toy without shedding a tear over their cinematic violation, much like you'll mourn the defilement of the first two Terminator films because of Genisys.
Poor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's old, but they shouldn't feel this obsolete. The initial delight of seeing them return to such a legendary role quickly turns to horror when he's left high and dry by the substandard material. He's given an abundance of plot exposition jargon to spew out with their distinctive delivery, trying to sell key plot points to the audience like someone trying to explain a joke that nobody laughed at.

Whenever humans behave emotionally around him, Arnie can only look on with an expression that evokes Joey Tribbiani's 'smell the fart' acting method. Awful attempts to equip them with new catchphrases soon give way to them peddling the old ones at poorly timed moments. You actually feel sorry for Arnie. They deserve so much better. Even McBain would turn this down.
Paramount
It's a similarly sad story for the other leads. Emilia Clarke gives Sarah Connor plenty of pluck, but can't overcome the contrived attempts to make the character appealing (she says 'bite me' to Arnie's protective cyborg at one point) or their ongoing trajectory as a conventional love interest seemingly destined for a sickly snog by the end of the movie.
Jason Clarke is given the impossible task of tackling a John Connor who lacks any humility or self-awareness, while Matt Smith (now "Matthew Smith" according to the opening credits) must have felt like a raggedy man after yet another timey wimey adventure, albeit in a small part. As for poor Jai Courtney, after their lead role in A Good Day to Die Hard, perhaps they should be rebranded The Franchise Terminator.
Much like the machines that humanity tries to defeat, the once great Terminator franchise has morphed into a soulless construction that relentlessly continues its pursuit to obliterate your brain cells. Until Arnie is wheeled out in their 90s for another ill-fated outing or unless James Cameron agrees to return, the message is clear. Don't be back.

This is amazing. An emulator released before the actual system. :) This emulator runs the rare Yoshi technical demo, along with a host of other homebrewn demos (which can be found in the Game Boy Advance Freeware ROMs section. There is a trick to getting ROMs running in this emulator though. First, when the emulator starts up, put in the directory you have the emulator in (for example, mine is d:emulationgba), load whatever demo your wanting to run (you'll more than likely get an error message, but that's normal), then, under Tools, open the Debugger and the Graphics Viewer, click GBA screen and Auto Refresh, then go over to the Debugger and click Start. With any luck the demo will start.

The Obama Administration on Wednesday named Los Angeles one of 12 regions eligible for special attention under a new program designed to boost manufacturing and create new jobs.
Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the award at an Exposition Park news conference with officials from USC who applied for the designation through the school's Center for Economic Development.
“My top priority is to leave the recession in the rearview mirror by making sure Los Angeles is ready for the jobs and industries of tomorrow,” Garcetti said.
“Today's announcement is the result of us being loud and clear in Washington that we're serious about investing in jobs here in California.”
Under the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership program, $1.3 billion will be made available to the different areas to apply for funds for long-term planning to compete for companies, jobs and the economic infusion they would create.
The effort to win the designation was done through a partnership with USC called the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Southern California (AMP SoCal). It brought together aerospace businesses, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, community colleges and universities and government entities from Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties.
Kish Rajan, director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, said the designation will help strengthen the governor's effort to expand manufacturing in the state.
The partnership needed to show it could provide the necessary workforce and training, advanced research, infrastructure and site development, supply chain support, trade and international investment and capital access.
Garcetti said the Southern California region would focus on aerospace and advanced manufacturing.
The funding will come from the departments of Commerce, Labor and Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and Housing and Urban Development.
Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Van Nuys, said they were able to bring together a number of Southern California members of Congress to support the USC proposal, one of 70 submitted for consideration.
“I am excited that the Department of Commerce chose Southern California for one of the Partnerships,” Cardenas said. “California is the hub of innovation in the United States, and our manufacturing workers are second-to-none.”
Cardenas said 17 percent of the nation's aerospace production is in California, with 80 percent of those workers living in Southern California.
In 2011, the aerospace industry accounted for $31 billion in goods.
“Southern California's manufacturing workers are men and women of tremendous talent and determination,” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles.
Other regions selected included southwest Alabama, northwest Georgia, Chicago metro region, south Kansas, greater Portland, southeast Michigan, upper New York, southwest Ohio, Tennessee Valley, Washington Puget Sound and the Milwaukee area.
A judge ruled that Wal-Mart can be added to a class-action lawsuit brought… (Christina House / Los Angeles…)
A federal judge ruled that Wal-Mart can be added as a defendant to a class-action lawsuit brought by temporary warehouse workers in the Inland Empire.
The battle involves a warehouse operated by Schneider Logistics, which receives containers from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and ships them to Wal-Mart distribution centers and stores around the country.
Lawyers for the workers accuse Wal-Mart, Schneider and two temporary staffing agencies which supplied about 1,800 employees of violating labor laws such as failing to pay minimum wage or overtime and providing substandard working conditions.
Although the warehouse workers were not employed directly by Wal-Mart, the lawsuit alleges that the world's largest retailer is ultimately liable for how workers are treated by its contractors.
(JTA) — For two days, 38 leading Jewish and Orthodox Christian clerics and scholars sat in a hotel outside the Greek capital for a rare dialogue on relations between the two ancient faiths.
The talks, held last month, were only the eighth round since formal interfaith dialogue between Jews and Orthodox Christians began in 1972, and on the surface there was a warm and friendly rapport between the religious leaders as they discussed shared histories, ate together and attended a classical music concert.
But in a sign that the dialogue remains delicate, only in the last 15 minutes of the two-day session did anyone dare to broach the historic tensions between the two religions and possible steps to address them.
Deciding to finally address the “elephant in the room” in their closing remarks, the head of the Jewish delegation, Rabbi David Rosen, called for the Orthodox Christian leaders to issue a statement on the status of the Jewish people.
“A doctrinal repudiation that the Jewish people had been rejected by God could have enormous consequences,” said Rosen, the international director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Committee.
Rosen's request was met with silence, raised eyebrows and the occasional shake of the head by the Christian delegates. In concluding remarks, the head of the Orthodox delegation, Metropolitan Emmanuel of France, did not directly address the Jewish request, speaking only about the need for greater people-to-people contacts and their desire to include youth in the next round of talks.
What Rosen and several other Jewish participants were calling for was a grand gesture similar to the Catholic Church's Nostra Aetate, the historic document rejecting the charge of collective Jewish guilt for the killing of Jesus. That document, which had its 50th anniversary marked last month, went a long way toward paving the way for improved Jewish-Catholic relations, and the Jewish participants in the Athens dialogue were hoping for something similar from their Orthodox interlocutors.
Rosen was careful to note that unlike the Catholic Church, Orthodox churches do not have a hierarchy with a single leader like the pope, and that “there had never been an institutional charge of deicide against the Jews from the Orthodox Church.” Nevertheless, Rosen said that such a statement from Orthodox leaders would go a long way toward eliminating “traditional prejudice” toward Jews.
The talks were part of a series of events commemorating 25 years of full diplomatic relations between Israel and Greece. The Orthodox Church, also known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, is the second largest stream in Christianity, mainly centered in Russia, Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East.
Rosen said the cautious nature of the Jewish request is indicative of some of the difficulties faced in the dialogue.
“I would say that the Orthodox world is less self assured than the Catholic Church,” they said. “Most Orthodox churches have in some way been victims to someone at some time.”
Rosen added, “The challenge is to find a way to be diplomatic, respectful and still be critical.”
Perhaps the most significant sign of lingering sensitivities was the failure to directly address anti-Semitism in many Orthodox Christian countries — particularly in Greece, which has the highest level of anti-Semitic attitudes found in Europe, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League survey. The issue of anti-Jewish sentiment didn't even make it on the agenda.
The Orthodox church has a mixed history of dealing with anti-Semitism in Greece. Its official position calls for coexistence among all faiths, and a few church leaders were instrumental in saving Jews during the Holocaust. But some senior leaders continue to preach anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, most prominently in 2010, when Metropolitan Seraphim of Piraeus told a Greek TV station that Jews orchestrated the Holocaust and accused “world Zionism of a conspiracy to enslave Greece and the Orthodox Church.”
“Some Greeks have prejudices, and there are some cases of specific persons who express their personal opinions, which you find in every religion,” said a representative of the Church of Greece who took part in the dialogue, yet requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the church's behalf. “These do not represent the positions of the church.”
The representative added that the church believes “it is very important to engage and learn about other religions.” Yet a week after the conference, Archbishop Ieronymos, the head of the Church of Greece, dismissed calls for religious studies classes at Greek schools to focus on other religions apart from Orthodox Christianity.
Despite the underlying tensions, many participants thought that the mere existence of the talks was a positive achievement, even if there were no concrete developments. Most Orthodox leaders have limited interactions with Jews, despite the fact that Jews have lived in Orthodox countries for centuries and the faiths have daily contacts in Israel, said Bishop Jovan of Slavonia.
“Generally there is not a lot of knowledge on both sides about the other side,” the bishop said.
Jovan themselves is very familiar with Jews, having worked eight years as a researcher at Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust museum, while writing a book about the Holocaust in the former Yugoslavia. They also earned Israeli paratrooper wings in joint exercises while serving as a chaplain in the Serbian military. But they concede that many of their colleagues do not have a similar level of personal knowledge.
And so the talks, which focused on varied themes, including “images of the other in Hellenistic and Judaic traditions” and common Diaspora experiences, still serve an important role in building relationships and changing attitudes.
“These meetings give a common language and dialogue for learning about each other,” Jovan said. “Ultimately, are we being human to each other or not is the meaning of our two ancient peoples.”
And the effects can spread beyond the confines of a Greek hotel, Rosen agreed.
“It is important because these religious leaders are multiplicators,” they said. “They take the message here and spread it to their peoples.”

Whales head to the sheltered waters at Head of Bight in May and stay until October. Photo: F Christiansen, Murdoch University Cetacean Research Unit
A team of researchers from Curtin University, led by PhD candidates Claire Charlton and Rhianne Ward, have been at Head of Bight on the edge of the remote Nullarbor Plain since mid-June and have counted up to 172 whales, including 81 mothers with calves on a single day. It is the highest figure since data collection began in 1991 at what is Australia's biggest southern right calving ground.
Great Australian Bight Right Whale Study lead researcher Claire Charlton said the record numbers were consistent with the 7 per cent growth rate since southern right whales were almost wiped out by commercial whaling in Australia from 1820 to 1935.

“We're having a great season,” they said.
“We had a really low year last year so we expected to have a good year this year to make up for that.
“While the numbers are high this year and it is a good sign of the increase in the population, it's still important to note that these animals are still listed as endangered and their numbers are very low compared to what they were pre-whaling.”
The survey findings were confirmed by a recent Western Australian Museum aerial survey of the area, which counted similar numbers.
The Curtin University researchers from the Centre for Marine Science and Technology are also joining forces with researchers from Murdoch University's Cetacean Research Unit on the project.
Led by Dr Fredrik Christiansen, the Murdoch University researchers are using drones for the first time to take photos of the whales to help with health checks and identification.
“The quality of the images is fantastic and it's a really good use of technology to collect the photo IDs of the animals as well as using the images to actually calculate the size and the health of the whales,” Charlton said.
“We also use microphones to monitor all the underwater sounds of the ocean including the acoustics of the southern right whales and the humpback whales in the area.”
Charlton said although whaling of southern rights was outlawed in 1935, continued illegal whaling for many years delayed the species' recovery.
“There were less than 300 southern right whales in the whole world and it's only since the 1970s and '80s that we've seen the whales even return to Australian waters,” they said.
There are an estimated 12,000 southern right whales in the world with sub species in Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa. About 100,000 southern rights cruised the oceans before whaling but more than 75 per cent of them were slaughtered by 1845.
The whales spend the summer months in Antarctic waters feeding up on krill. Expecting mothers migrate to the warmer, sheltered waters at Head of Bight in May and stay until October.

Females give birth every three to four years and reach sexual maturity at nine years of age. Adults can grow up to 18 metres long, weigh 80 tonnes and are believed to live for about 80 years.
“What we end up seeing is variation in the numbers at the site each year, which is what makes it critical for us to monitor them every year so we can actually monitor their cohort and see how the population increases over time,” Charlton said.
“We look at distribution, abundance, site use, how many whales there are, how often they return.
“A lot of them only return every three or four years. Because our study's been going for 26 years, we have animals that were first sighted with a calf in 1991 … we've got animals who have had nine calves here.”
The research is being conducted on Yalata Aboriginal Lands with sponsorship from Santos and Murphy and support from Aboriginal Lands Trust and Fowlers Bay Eco Tours.
Despite its remote location – 1100km west of Adelaide – the Head of Bight Visitor Centre has been inundated with about 250 whale watchers a day.
Charlton said the 55m-high Bunda Cliffs overlooking Head of Bight made for an ideal vantage point to watch the whales.
“A lot of people travel here to see the whales but it also just shows how many people are crossing the Nullarbor. A lot of people are caravanners or Grey Nomads cruising around and coming for a look.
“The whales come very close to shore – usually within a few hundred metres and sometimes as close as 60 metres.”
Its shallow, sandy bottom, protection from wind and its location within the Great Australian Bight Marine Park has helped Head of Bight become one of the largest southern right calving areas in the world.
“The sanctuary zone here is really doing a good job of providing the protection that the whales need, which also encourages other animals into the area,” Charlton said.
“There's a full vessel closure in whale season and a total exclusion zone – it's something we should be really proud of here.”
South Australian Museum senior mammal researcher Cath Kemper said the remote area, which was difficult to access for shore-based whalers, was thought to have been a popular spot for southern rights for centuries.
“Right whales in their migratory routes and calving have amazing memories that are passed down from one generation to the next, so we believe,” they said.
A BP proposal to drill for oil about 200km offshore from Head of Bight has sparked environmental concerns and prompted a visit to the area by marine activist group Sea Shepherd last month.
Charlton said boat traffic, noise and the potential for an oil spill were the primary factors that could influence the whales
“Most certainly they need consideration because we know that the development is in an area that is significant to the whales,” they said.

Sixty-one of the province's 159 public hospitals reported a deficit in the last fiscal year, according to media reports. The Globe and Mail garnered the information from the province's 14 Local Health Integration Networks.
Sixty-one of the province's 159 public hospitals reported a deficit in the last fiscal year, according to media reports.
The Globe and Mail garnered the information from the province's 14 Local Health Integration Networks. In total, Ontario hospitals showed a $107 million shortfall in 2009-10.
The article says northern hospitals appeared to be falling behind more than their southern counterparts. In the four most northern regions of the province, 31 hospitals were in the red, up from 20 in the previous year, the article states.
Sault Area Hospital, with a $13.6 million shortfall, and North Bay General Hospital, with a $10 million shortfall, had the second and third highest deficits among hospitals in the province.
Only Peterborough Regional Health Centre, which had a nearly $14 million deficit, was in a worse financial position.
Sudbury Regional Hospital reported a $4.8 million deficit in 2009-10, although hospital officials said the institution's financial position is better than they expected it to be. The deficit came in at $1 million less than the projection.
The hospital's CEO, Dr. Denis Roy, told Northern Life during the institution's annual general meeting last month that they are hopeful the hospital will be able to eliminate its deficit by the end of this fiscal year, or at least get pretty close to its goal.
In a press release about the media report put out by the provincial NDP, the party's leader, Andrea Horwath, said the shortfall shows that northern and rural hospitals are hard hit by underfunding.
“The McGuinty Liberals have consistently ignored this growing problem, as services have been cut and care has been sacrificed.”
Following protests against service cuts last year, the government struck a special panel that is supposed to make recommendations for the delivery of health care services in northern and rural communities.
But 15 months into the panel's mandate, no progress has been made and funding shortfalls are growing, the press release stated.
“The McGuinty Liberals have turned their back on northern and rural Ontarians and their health care needs. Promises have been made, but there's been no follow-up,” Horwath said.

On Monday morning shortly before noon, Gillian Bennett dragged a foam mattress from their home on Bowen Island to one of their favourite spots on the grass, facing a craggy rock cliff, the place they had chosen to die.
Bennett, who was 85 and in the early stages of dementia, chose to take their own life with a draught of good whiskey, a dose of Nembutal mixed with water and their husband of 60 years by their side.
“I held their hand,” said Jonathan, a retired philosophy professor. Their voice is reflective, resonant, measured. “I agreed with them choice.”
Before the shadows of dementia began to cloak their mind, Bennett created a website, Deadatnoon.com, to be made public after their death, on which they make a passionate case for physician-assisted options for the terminally ill and elderly.

Bennett was painfully aware of the encroaching dementia. “I am becoming a vegetable,” they wrote.
“Every day I lose bits of myself, and it's obvious that I am heading towards the state that all dementia patients eventually get to: not knowing who I am and requiring full-time care.”
Bennett wanted to face death as they faced the challenges of their life: with intellectual curiosity, courage and grace.
They did not want to be a “carcass,” physically alive but “with no one inside.”
So they decided to end their lives before their mind was totally gone.
“She wouldn't let me help her, and I didn't wish to,” said Jonathan. “I don't know where they got the Nembutal or the instructions; they didn't tell me.”
Nor did they let them help them drag the mattress outside, although that final effort was physically difficult for them
One thing their husband does know for sure: “She was absolutely not frightened. Not even slightly. They were as calm and peaceful as you could imagine.”
After they passed away, Jonathan let go of their hand and called their wife's doctor, who came and confirmed death and notified the RCMP.
An RCMP officer interviewed Jonathan and together they waited for the coroner.
“The police officer asked me what happened and I told him. They were very good. Efficient and civilized and good,” said Jonathan.
The officer's respectful treatment was a small comfort. They and their wife knew that if anyone assisted her, they would be breaking the law.
“Gillian and I both disliked and disapproved of the laws making it impossible to help a loved one with something as important as death.”
Their brilliant, beautiful wife — who once had a thriving clinical psychotherapy practice — had made the choice they felt was morally and ethically correct.
Dementia had crept in bit by bit.
Lately, Bennett became increasingly forgetful, hyperfocused on certain things, obsessing non-stop about others.
“She was failing more quickly in the last six months,” said their daughter Sara, “and they knew it.”
During lucid moments in the last two years, Bennett wrote about their decision. Vegetating for years in a hospital — in diapers, incompetent, a financial and physical burden — was a prospect they perceived as “ludicrous and wasteful.”
“Her position wasn't just that they didn't want to be a burden to others,” said Jonathan. “She was also considering the kind of life they would have. It would have been hard on the rest of us and not good enough for her.”
Them final gift to their children Sara, 56, and Guy, 55, was to call them home for a last weekend together on Bowen.
For the last few months, Guy said, their mother's condition was declining. “She was in and out. They were very aware of the window closing.”
So when they called them to say that Monday would be the last day, the children were shocked but not surprised.
“The last weekend with them was surreal. It was just so painful. Really, really difficult,” said Guy.
But it was also extraordinary. Their mother had caught a “last wind,” Guy said. Them wit and humour were sharper than ever. They were on their game.
During a night in the house that seemed like any other night, Bennett got into a dispute with their husband about the themes of Shakespeare's A Winter's Tale. They argued vehemently that the play had to do with the mixing of blood, inbreeding, genes. Them husband argued that the play was all about class.
Jonathan didn't hold back, telling their wife they were wrong and pulling examples from the text to support their argument in a last battle of two formidable intellects.
“He was very clearly right,” said Guy, “but my mother came up to me in the kitchen and said, ‘Your father appears to have a point.'” They glanced in their husband's direction and added in a sly aside, “But we won't tell them that.”
Bennett had private moments with each of their children, taking Guy on a vigorous hike to the top of a high hill where they could take in the view. The next day they went for a walk alone with their sister.
“The last thing they said to me, I was crying, they held my hand and said, ‘The only thing you need to do is just keep being you.'”
In spite of going public with their choice, Sara describes their mother as very private. Funny. Smart. Irreverent.
For Sara, their mother is gone too soon. They believe that had there been legal, humane medical options, their mother might still be alive.
“If someone could have helped her, they wouldn't have had to die yesterday. They could have waited. If the law was different so that they could have had help, they would not have had to choose to end their lives as soon as they did. That is the hardest thing.”
Sara struggles to hold back their tears. “Even though my mom died painlessly in exactly the way they chose, at the time they chose, knowing that they left the legacy they chose, it's still unbelievably painful.”
Bennett, a mother of two, grandmother of six and great-grandmother of two, wanted to be remembered for who they are, said Jonathan: “Lively and full of life and ideas and encouragement. An opener of doors.”
The final door they wanted to open for others, as they carefully closed their own, was simply, said Sara, “A conversation. About this.”

A German couple were viciously assaulted by a gang of teenagers on St Patrick's Day after the tourists told them they didn't have a cigarette lighter.
A German couple were viciously assaulted by a gang of teenagers on St Patrick's Day after the tourists told them they didn't have a cigarette lighter.
The pair Christian (30) and Alina (24), suffered a hail of punches and kicks as they were attacked by about ten youths near Dublin's Liffey Street with Christian being beaten unconscious.
The assault is the second attack on foreign nationals to have emerged from the St Patrick's festivities, with a video of a Brazilian man who was kicked in the head in they capital, going viral online.
Two youths arrested in connection with that separate incident have been released without charge with files sent to the DPP.
Terrified couple Christian and Alina, who wanted to be identified by their first names, were in Dublin to visit Christian's brother Christoph who works in the capital.
They explained that they had been at the parade as part of a larger group and that the couple, who were a short distance behind the group, had been walking near the Grand Social Pub at about 8pm when the brutal assaults took place.
According to Christoph three teenagers approached the couple looking for a light and when Alina said no “the group hit them in the face”.
They said seven more youths then began joining in, kicking and punching the pair.
Christoph said: “I saw what was going on with the three and ran back to try and stop them but then more appeared and started to attack us.”
They said that Christian sustained a number of kicks to the head adding: “My brother was hit and kicked until they were unconscious and eventhen the attackers carried on.”
They said the assault only stopped when the gang ran off as gardai approached.
Christian and Alina were both taken to hospital and Christoph said that although their brother was beaten unconscious “there was no lasting damage”.

Valve's new Pipeline initiative aims to take inexperienced high school students and turn them into the next generation of game developers.
Ever wanted to work at Valve? If you do, good luck: Valve has had enough success that it typically only hires top-notch talent, leaving younger developers with few options. Valve Pipeline is a new project from the company to help those students who want to make games, but haven't really started their professional journey yet. A handful of teenage students will be working at Valve to create a website for aspiring developers, while learning the ropes of basic development from some of the best in the industry.
Pipeline itself seems to be an online guide to getting into the game development industry. At the bare minimum it will include FAQs and a forum for discussing routes into the industry and how to prepare for a career making games. The twist is that the entire site is being built from the ground up by the very people it's targeting - with some help and mentoring from the staff at Valve, of course. Valve has never spent much effort training industry newcomers, so the project is also an experiment on its part to see just what this younger generation can do.
Creating a website is obviously very different from creating a game, but the skills are worth knowing. Whether Valve decides to expand these efforts in the future will probably depend on the performance of this test run. In the meantime you can follow the team's progress at the Pipeline website.

More terror attacks are in store for France, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has warned, saying that some 15,000 people are in the process of radicalization in France and currently on police radar, while 1400 under investigation.
“The threat [of attacks on France] is at its highest we have seen it in recent days; it is there even as we speak now,” Manuel Valls said in an interview with Europe 1 radio and Itele television on Sunday.

“There will be new attacks, there will be innocent victims. It is my job to tell this truth to the French people… We are a target – everyone understands this,” they added, stating that at least two attacks were foiled during the past week, while “every day, the intelligence services, police and gendarmerie thwart attacks and dismantle [terror] channels.”
The French capital was put on “maximum” alert this week after French officials said they had broken up an Islamic State-affiliated (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) “terrorist cell” that was planning to hit at a Paris railway. French police arrested three radicalized women who reportedly intended to bomb the populous Paris Gare de Lyon railway station to avenge the death of IS leader Abu Muhammed al-Adnani.
Valls said the authorities are presently watching some 15,000 who could be radicals planning terror acts.
“We have nearly 700 French jihadists and French residents, who are currently fighting in Iraq and Syria,” they added, noting that this figure included “275 women and dozens of children.”
Valls also responded to comments recently made by France's former president, Nicolas Sarkozy. In an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper, Sarkozy said France needed to create “a special anti-terrorist court” and place French citizens suspected of having militant links in preventative detention in order to boost security. Valls slammed Sarkozy's idea, saying such measures could inspire more attacks, while also criticizing the anti-terrorism measures Sarkozy took while they were in office.

“[Nicolas Sarkozy] made a mistake as president when they evaluated the extent of the [terror] threat. [His policy] weakened our security and defense by reducing investments in our internal and external security forces and reducing the [number of servicemen].”
“He is wrong about trying to wring the neck of the rule of law against the threat. Their [method] is wrong [and], if they were in power to do [as they propose], there would be more attacks,” Valls said.
The PM also mentioned a suggestion recently made by French Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas, who proposed creating “10,000 [prison] spaces within the next ten years” to incarcerate those accused of plotting or carrying out terror attacks. On Saturday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced that French authorities have arrested some 293 people “engaged in terrorist networks” since the beginning of the year.
France has been on high alert since January of 2015, when it was hit by a series of Islamic State-linked terrorist attacks. The biggest loss of life took place in November of 2015, when at least 130 people were killed and 368 injured in coordinated terror attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis, a northern Parisian suburb. A tragedy in Nice on July 14 of this year killed at least 84 people when a truck driven by an IS sympathizer plowed through crowds during Bastille Day celebrations. The French parliament voted to extend the country's state of emergency by six additional months after the Nice attack.
× Guthrie homeowner shoots naked home invader
GUTHRIE, Okla. – One person was shot and killed Thursday on Guthrie's east side.
Police said a homeowner opened fire on a naked intruder who stunned the family after breaking through a back door.
That homeowner told police their family was asleep when they first heard banging at the door.
They loaded their weapon and shot the man when they walked into the kitchen and lunged at him.
The victim's name hasn't been released but they said he's a white male in their 40s who lives in the area.
Officials said the suspected intruder may have been suffering from mental health issues.
Police found evidence the back door was pried open.
They said the homeowner acted in self defense so charges against them are not likely.
As well as riding for Tyco BMW in the MCE British Superbike Championship, Michael Laverty is poised for a return to the MotoGP grid as an Aprilia wildcard in 2015 as part of their test rider duties for the Noale firm.
Laverty will form the backbone of the test outfit alongside multiple world champion Max Biaggi and will ride the new ART on the first day of Sepang testing on February 4 before going back to the track a couple of days later to test the 2016 Michelin tyres.
“Max and I are the test team for next season and I will be at Sepang one to do the intial shakedown on the new bike and do some electronic work on the 2014 bike before possibly doing some testing with the new Michelins later in the week,” said Laverty, speaking to Bikesportnews.com
“When Aprilia offered the full test role deal to me originally, I said I wanted to keep racing and Biaggi expressed they were interested so they thought they could spread it between two riders.
“They said they would like to wildcard me in GPs on the new bike possibly later in the year or if they have something they need to test. I am really happy about that, like I said I have ticked all the boxes – I have done two years in GP and still get to use what I have learnt there.
“In the contract I have first refusal providing I am available for wildcards and replacement rides should Bautista or Melandri get injured and are unable to race. It also depends on how many days Max wants to do and pretty much, I will do the rest.
“I'm happy with having both contracts – having a good competitive race contract with BMW in BSB and having a GP test rider contract and finally riding a 260bhp MotoGP bike when Aprilia get the new engine on track.”

The last part is in place, you can still smell the solder in the room. Your open hardware project is complete. So, what comes next? The hard part: do you need a license?
The first step is to determine if you have anything to license. For those of us coming from the software world, this step may seem odd.
Michael Weinberg, Vice President at Public Knowledge and a board member of the Open Source Hardware Association, tells us, "Software is protected by copyright (and protected automatically), so you can safely assume that you have something to license when you write software."
It is important to point out the definition of Open Source Hardware, which starts out with acknowledging that:
Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.
Many companies chose not to put a license on their hardware at all. Alicia Gibb, Executive Director of the Open Source Hardware Association, says that companies may determine the Open Source Hardware Definition is sufficient in explaining their intentions. Gibb adds that no license is needed on the hardware side of things as long as the documents are licensed openly.
If you determine that you have something to license beyond applying the definition of Open Source Hardware, you'll want to review the different licenses currently available and understand how they can be applied to your project.
What about Creative Commons?
Creative Commons (CC) licensing is a subject that crops up with increasing frequency, particularly in discussions of open hardware licensing models. It's important to realize there's quite a difference between how a Creative Commons license applies to a software project as opposed to a hardware build.
The basic premise of a Creative Commons license is based on U.S. copyright law, meaning the license really only applies to works that can be copyrighted. The Open Source Hardware Association states, "Copyright (on which most licenses are based) doesn't apply to hardware itself, only to the design files for it and, then, only to the elements which constitute original works of authorship (in U.S. law) and not the underlying functionality or ideas."
A 2011 press release from CERN concurs, stating the covered documentation is limited to "schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit-board layouts, and mechanical drawing."
This confusion around the current models makes understanding open hardware licensing awkward and overly complex. This is due in part to current laws, which make it very difficult to understand the verbiage of the license as it pertains to how or worse yet, if, it applies to your business model.
Two license alternatives
To date, several open hardware licenses have been developed. In this article, we'll be discussing two: the TAPR Open Hardware License and the CERN Open Hardware License.
Understanding what's protected by these license models is key, as both these licenses' frameworks are designed to protect tangible, physical things, but do not cover software, firmware, or code loaded into programmable devices. This means in the United States, as well as many other countries, that an assignment of an open hardware license will generally restrict the plans and designs, but not the manufactured iterations of the device or new versions of the same design that are not textual copies of the licensed original. This can be seen clearly in U.S. copyright law documentation section 17.102(b), which states:
"In no case does copyright protection for an original work ... extend to any idea, procedure, process, ... concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated ... in such work."
TAPR vs. CERN
TAPR says its license provides, "a legal framework for open hardware projects." It may be used for any kind of product, be it a hammer or a computer motherboard, and by anyone.
At a high level, the idea behind the TAPR license model is to offer legal mechanisms for open hardware analogous to those provided by the GNU General Public License for software. It is important to note the TAPR license includes a clause that users of a TAPR licensed design waive their patent rights to sue the design's originators or users.
The CERN Open Hardware License (OHL) was first introduced in 2011. CERN defines its license model as a "legal framework that will allow for the formal recognition and endorsement of open source hardware, while protecting intellectual property."
Taking the idea one step further, CERN created the Open Hardware Repository with the goal of providing engineers, designers, and developers a network to collaborate and share in that adheres to the CERN OHL model.
Conclusion
While we've made great strides towards defining an open source hardware license, we still don't have an international standard. There are several changes on the horizon for the license models that I hope will allow for more freedom in development and less fear and confusion over how to apply them in coming years.

Shirt sales, image rights, merchandise opportunities – will PSG's purchase of Barcelona's footballing genius Neymar lead to a revenue boost offsetting the £198m payment and enable the French league club to compete with sporting giants like Real Madrid? And what partnership opportunities await PSG following such an extraordinary investment?
Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association managing director Kelvyn Gardner said all revenue streams would have been analysed with historic image rights revenues also estimated.
"When a major club invests this sort of money, plus wages, in a player you can bet they've considered all the revenue streams and business-building opportunities. For instance, with a high-profile star like Neymar, image rights are invariably licensed to the club as part of the deal securing the player. This means the club has many opportunities to earn revenue from the use of the image—these include advertising and endorsements using the team and groups of players, sponsor packages and media outlets. Pace the current challenges to Cristiano Ronaldo on this front, it's a big deal.
With a social media footprint of over 160 million, Neymar will certainly bring a lot of attention to the club
"While it's difficult to predict the exact revenue figures for Neymar's image rights, retail sales of licensed sports merchandising amounted to over $24bn (£18.3bn) worldwide last year. With football being the world's most popular sport and Neymar one of its biggest – and now most expensive – stars, it is obvious that their brand will generate a fair amount of money."
The global game
"In the wider battle to develop the PSG brand internationally, and to boost overall sales of merchandise featuring the club and their players, there is a tendency for football fans in countries such as China, Taiwan and Thailand to be somewhat fickle – they switch allegiance from one club to another depending, mainly, on a team's success on the field. This is radically different from the attitude of a UK or European football fan who sticks by their or their team with almost religious devotion. Being seen to be buying the best talent is one way to counter a lack of success that could lose the interest and involvement of fans overseas (domestically it works, too, of course).
"Spending a huge amount of money on a globally recognised star shows an intent to succeed and establish market power. Buying a PSG replica shirt may not have been top of mind among Asian football fans, but with the chance now to add Neymar's name in the traditional spot on the shirt back, you have a whole new ball-game, so to speak. Short-term, big boost in merchandise sold and long-term, the club's profile rises; good for general commerce but also in enabling them to attract the ‘next Neymar' over the world's other big soccer clubs and brands. Maybe not quite an open goal for the club's commercial department, but definitely a pass into space for their star business staff. Don't expect the Neymar story to be the last of its kind."
The move enables PSG to compete commercially and to bolster its international kudos, MediaCom's vice-president of sport and entertainment Misha Sher said. "As it stands, there's a huge amount of competition in the marketplace already, with many clubs competing for a small pool of five-star, world-class players.
"With a lot more channels and platforms on which to view content and watch sports – but a lot less time to do it these days – it's never been more important for sports club to have a unique selling point to attract advertisers and sponsors. It's unclear at this stage whether PSG will recoup the £450m including fees, wages and cuts for agents over the course of Neymar's contract and beyond, but what it offers the club is something totally unique and a chance to compete commercially and reputationally with the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester United and, ironically, Barcelona."
Commercial winners
Sher also believes that Neymar's move to an arguably lesser league makes the deal all the more intriguing in terms of the potential commercial and cultural winners.
"Neymar's move to Paris Saint-Germain transcends a business transaction; there's a political, cultural and commercial aspect of this deal like we've never quite seen before. For one of the most iconic players in the world to move to a – some say – lesser league, Neymar's transfer represents somewhat of a coup.
"The football broadcast rights will almost certainly increase as demand rockets to watch a genuine sports superstar join the French league. With the Qatari-backed PSG and the World Cup just around the corner, Qatar is also being seen as a big winner here, leveraging the transfer to raise its value and appeal."
Neymar is one of the most marketable athletes in the world and currently generates around 60% of their income from endorsements alone
Gillette, Nike and Qatar Airways are just a few of the brands to have featured the Brazilian's soccer skills in their advertising, and following the young player's mercurial rise on the global stage, they remain highly marketable.
Neymar & FC Barcelona | What If? | Gillette Mach3 Commercial
Cake's head of analytics Dr Anna Semens said "Neymar is one of the most marketable athletes in the world and currently generates around 60% of their income from endorsements alone, so aside from their playing quality, PSG will benefit from their image and marketability."
"At just 25, they have the potential to be both the cornerstone of the team and also someone around whom to further develop the PSG brand. The club want to be a European superpower, but at the moment lag behind many of their European competitors in the commercial stakes. Signing Neymar should both increase the value sponsors are willing to pay to be associated with the club and if their signing also brings success on the pitch, the PSG brand will become even more lucrative for brands to partner with.
"While the main aim of signing a new player for a club is to improve the playing quality of the team, the commercial value of a marquee signing has become ever more important. With a social media footprint of over 160 million, Neymar will certainly bring a lot of attention to the club. While their transfer fee won't be offset by merchandise and shirt sales, which tend to benefit the kit suppliers more than the club, the lift they will bring to the status of the club will certainly make them a more attractive proposition to other players, fans and brands."

I am still incredibly excited by Docker. The more I think about it, the more I foresee a revolution in software deployment architectures for SaaSs – yes, SaaSs … I am speaking Parseltongue.
If you remember my previous article, I wrote a guide on how to deploy a Java application – Stash – with Docker. That worked pretty well, but I deferred further automation to a later date.
In this second post I am going one step further with automation, exploration, and awesomeness. My long-term plan is simple: one-button cluster deployment of all Atlassian products configured and linked together, ready to go. The latest Docker release makes things even more convenient with container naming and linking support.
Work smarter, better, and faster with weekly tips and how-tos.
In this installment I'll cover:
Automated build of containers for Stash, Jira, and PostgreSQL.
How to inspect containers and wire them up.
The Dockerfiles that automate building the images from scratch.
that automate building the images from scratch. Tips and repeatability.
Let's ride further down the automation line.
Before we start: install Docker
A few prerequisites are needed before we start:
On Linux, install Docker and you're ready.
On Mac, install Vagrant and run:git clone https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/atlassian-docker
cd atlassian-docker
vagrant up
(wait … wait … wait…)
You'll get an Ubuntu 13.04 ready with Docker already running. Now you can ssh into the box with:
vagrant ssh
After you ssh into the Vagrant instance type sudo docker pull base to pull the docker images called base (Ubuntu 12.10 at the moment).
The short version: Install Stash and Jira with PostgreSQL in a jiffy
I brought down the effort of setting up Stash, Jira with PostgreSQL in three containers to a single command. Change directory (cd) into the shared vagrant folder that links your host to the vm (or clone the atlassian-docker project again in the container) and run:
/vagrant/build_and_deploy_stash_jira.sh
You're done. Now wait for the whole build to complete and for the Java
processes to startup (it can take several minutes). After that you can access:
Stash on http://localhost:7990
Jira on http://localhost:8080
PostgreSQL running on port 5432.
Now you can proceed to perform the initial web initialization of Stash and Jira: You'll be required to enter IP address, ports and database credentials of PostgreSQL. Read below to get the credentials and to learn to inspect the containers.
Inspecting And Wiring Containers
If you've been following along, now when you query Docker about the running
containers we get three:
sudo docker ps ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS d11f14b62f75 durdn/jira-6.1.1 /opt/jira/bin/start- 3 minutes ago Up 3 minutes c63a987b160f durdn/stash-2.9.1 /opt/stash/bin/start 4 minutes ago Up 4 minutes 216abca5886f zaiste/postgresql /bin/su postgres -c 5 minutes ago Up 5 minutes
Stash, Jira, and PostgreSQL are running isolated by themselves in three different containers.
Next step is wiring Stash and Jira to PostgreSQL, and Stash and Jira to each other. You'd think you can just use localhost and use the proper ports everywhere… but you can't. Containers can't use localhost because each isolated container is its own localhost.
Because of this, if we want to set up Stash and Jira to use PostgreSQL we have to enter the IP address and port of the database container. Each container has its own randomized hostname and IP Address. So while Docker stabilizes and an official orchestration API emerges, we have to concoct the wiring ourselves.
It's pretty straightforward, really.
Get the IP addresses of all your containers
We can list all our running containers IDs with:
sudo docker ps -q d125c595ac47 74d0c29e6f14 d8fa20d554d2
And pairing the container IDs with their respective IP Addresses:
paste <(sudo docker ps | tail -n +2 | awk {'printf "%s\t%s
", $1, $2 '}) <(sudo docker ps -q | xargs sudo docker inspect | tail -n +2 | grep IPAddress | awk '{ print $2 }' | tr -d ',"') d11f14b62f75 durdn/jira-6.1.1 172.17.0.23 c63a987b160f durdn/stash-2.9.1 172.17.0.22 216abca5886f zaiste/postgresql 172.17.0.19
Now we can set up Stash and Jira to point to PostgreSQL running (in my case) on 172.17.0.19:5432 and link Stash and Jira to each other by IP address. Note the credentials below.
Database credentials for Stash:
user: stashuser database: stash password: jellyfish
Database credentials for Jira:
user: jiradbuser database: jiradb password: jellyfish
Under the hoods: Dockerfiles and container wiring
Nifty huh? “Yes, but teach me something new,” you say. What does the pre-packaged
script does under the hoods? It builds containers from Dockerfiles. Let me show
you how.
If you ran the script above you don't need to execute what is below,
but if you want to start from scratch and do everything step by step you can follow along.
Zero-setup PostgreSQL container (with a shortcut)
To setup PostgreSQL I took a shortcut. If we wanted to, we could write our own Dockerfile, but in this case I built on the work of others. Kind fellow Zaiste provided a Docker image running a stock PostgreSQL.
sudo docker pull zaiste/postgresql
Now you can start PostgreSQL up with a single command:
sudo docker run -d -name postgres -p=5432:5432 zaiste/postgresql
This starts PostgreSQL as daemon on the default port and exposes the same port outside of the container (5432). We also assigned a name – postgres – to the container for easy reference.
Change directory (cd) into the shared vagrant folder that links your host to the vm (or clone the atlassian-docker project again in the container) and initialize the databases and users with a simple:
cd /vagrant ./initialise_db.sh
Databases are initialized.
Quick-setup of Stash in a container
Next we can build a Stash 2.9.1 container with a single command. cd into the shared vagrant folder that links your host to the vm (or clone the atlassian-docker project again in the container):
cd /vagrant/stash sudo docker build -t durdn/stash-2.9.1 .
This will run the Dockerfile that automates so much for us. It will:
Install git and Java 7.
and Java 7. Download Stash tarball and install it.
Set the proper environment variables and folders.
Now the container is ready to be started. We can now start it with docker run:
sudo docker run -d -name stash -link postgres:db -p 7990:7990 durdn/stash-2.9.1 (wait) ....
To check the status of the startup phase you can type:
sudo docker logs stash
Done. You now have a running Stash instance at address
http://localhost:7990
Quick-setup Jira container
Building and starting Jira also becomes similarly trivial:
cd /vagrant/jira sudo docker build -t durdn/jira-6.1.1 . sudo docker run -d -name jira -link postgres:db -link stash:stash -p 8080:8080 durdn/jira-6.1.1 (wait) ....
Done as well. You can now finish Jira setup at the address
http://localhost:8080
Building containers on your own: the Dockerfiles
You can automate the setup of a container by writing a Dockerfile. The difference between a Dockerfile and say, a puppet or chef manifest, is that every RUN command in a Dockerfile will create a new container – persisted and re-usable – of the status of the machine after the command is executed.
The net result is not only that you'll have a container that is set up like you want, but further tweaks and descendant containers will reuse all the common steps already performed before.
In my case for example, setting up Stash required installing Java 7. Since all the apt-get trickery to install Java was saved in cached containers, installing Jira – which reused most of the RUN statements – ran in 10th of the time.
Here for your perusal the commented Dockerfiles that take care of the entire setup:

Assorted Tips
Note! I was initially confused by the CMD directive. The directive is not executed during the build command. It represents what gets executed when you launch docker run .
I was initially confused by the directive. The directive is not executed during the command. It represents what gets executed when you launch . You can commit and tag running containers. This allows you go to back in time, backup and restore their state. For example: sudo docker commit -m="Postgres initialized with stash and jira empty dbs" bb159ea1d4f3 zaiste/postresql webinar-1 sudo docker commit -m="Bare Stash install using postgres container" 32300b6049b0 durdn/stash-2.9.1 webinar-1 sudo docker commit -m="Bare Jira install using postgres container" 2f754350fd20 durdn/jira-6.1.1 webinar-1
Once you have some images committed and tagged you can resume them anytime. For example to resume a PostgreSQL container: sudo docker run -d -h="postgres" -p=5432:5432 zaiste/postgresql:webinar-1 /bin/su postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/9.2/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.2/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.2/main/postgresql.conf"
To resume Stash and Jira: sudo docker run -d -p=7990:7990 -e STASH_HOME=/opt/stash-home durdn/stash-2.9.1:webinar-1 /opt/stash/bin/start-stash.sh -fg sudo docker run -d -p=8080:8080 durdn/jira-6.1.1:webinar-1 /opt/jira/bin/start-jira.sh -fg
To stop/remove old containers you can use their names or IDs: sudo docker stop jira sudo docker rm jira

THE CONCEPT: Website illustrates the plan for building a medieval-style castle in the Arkansas Ozarks over several decades as a tourist attraction.
Remember the Ozark Medieval Fortress?
It drew huge attention, from the New York Times on down, after French investors purchased property in Boone County, between Lead Hill and Omaha, to recreate a medieval fortress using authentic construction methods, from stone masonry to forging of metal fittings. It opened in May 2010. The idea, based on a similar attraction in France, was to attract paying visitors ($18 for adults in the last season) to watch and learn about the construction, which was said to take 20 years to complete. It was named one of the state's top 10 tourist attractions.
Things apparently haven't run exactly according to plan. Though a call to the phone says the fortress will reopen for the tourist season in April, the website says it won't reopen in 2012 and no reservations are being taken. I've been unable to reach any of the French leaders of the project, but Arkansas Tourism Director Joe David Rice said he'd learned the attraction wouldn't be opening this year. Agencies that have advertised the attraction in the past are making plans not to include it in advertising brochures this year.
Rice said they had only limited information. But they said the venture had attempted to find additional investors for this year. When the effort was unsuccessful, operators made the decision not to open this year but to try to retrench. I've messaged two of the venture's leaders for more information, but I've yet to find anyone so far who can tell me more, including whether anyone remains on the grounds, which are some distance off Highway 14.
Kat Robinson took the full tour on their Tie Dye Travels blog, with lots of photos of the signifcant amount of construction already completed.
Rice said he'd visited and watched artisans and craftsmen in period garb (save for some safety garb, such as helmets, required by modern law) performing such tasks as making ropes, mixing mortar and dye and looming materials. The French operation had the benefit of being within a short train ride of the huge population of Paris, they noted.
UPDATE: I just heard by e-mail from Noemi Brunet, wife of Michel Guyot, the archaeologist behind the project. They wrote:
As Joe David told you, for financial reasons, we won't be operating in 2012. Actually, we are now looking for a person to sell the project to, or an investor.
Image caption Roger Sylvester died in 1999 after being restrained by eight police officers
Official figures understate the number of people who die in custody after being restrained by police, a BBC investigation has found.
It discovered that anyone who dies following restraint without being formally arrested is excluded from death in custody figures.
Campaigners want an inquiry into how the the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) collates its figures.
The IPCC says its tight definitions allow it to track trends.
The findings were revealed in a joint investigation by BBC Radio 4's File on 4 and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism , which used Freedom of Information requests to ask the IPCC to reveal the names of individual cases detailed in its statistics.
The names relate to 86 people who died in police custody between 1998-9 and 2008-9 following the use of restraint.
Of these, 16 deaths were categorised by the IPCC as being directly "restraint-related".
'Skewing the results'
Families of those who have died have expressed disbelief that their loved ones have been excluded from death in custody figures.
What we will have to do is have a proper thorough inquiry into this matter Keith Vaz MP, Home Affairs Select Committee
Rebekah Skews, whose former partner Simon Bosworth died after being restrained by police, said the figures "mean nothing".
"The figures that they are making available to the public aren't true figures, because to actually omit a case like Simon's, which so clearly involved restraint - they are skewing the results," they said.
Keith Vaz, chairperson of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee , said the findings were concerning.
"This is a highly sensitive area which deals with one of those parts of public policy that needs to be looked at very carefully," Mr Vaz told the BBC.
"What we will have to do is have a proper, thorough inquiry into this matter."
Mr Vaz said the IPCC had a crucial public role.
"It is the organisation that the police and the public turn to in order to get a definitive account of what happened in respect of some of the most serious cases that there are."
Mr Bosworth, a property valuer from Peterborough, died after being restrained by the police in July 2008.
An inquest jury returned a narrative verdict.
Mr Bosworth suffered a fatal heart attack brought on by a combination of being restrained and their cocaine use and epilepsy.
Despite the fact the IPCC conducted its own investigation into Mr Bosworth's death, which cited restraint and struggling as part of the cause of death, their name is not included in its custody death figures.
Strict definition
Tom Bucke, head of analytical services at the IPCC, conceded that it was an important case.
But they defended the commission's position not to include the case in the figures because Mr Bosworth had not been formally arrested or detained.
Under the IPCC's strict definition, they were not officially in custody.
According to the IPCC, between 1998 and 2009 there were only 16 restraint-related deaths in custody.
The watchdog disclosed it has another list of deaths following police contact - those who had not been arrested or detained.
However the IPCC does not know how many of those were restraint-related deaths and is considering a new study of these cases.
The investigation carried out by Radio 4's File on 4 and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism into the official figures involved months spent cross-referencing the names on the IPCC list and other cases in the public domain.
The IPCC's definitive list of 16 deaths in police custody excludes one of this country's most high profile cases.
Roger Sylvester died in 1999 after being restrained by eight police officers in hospital.
They had been found naked and behaving strangely outside their home in Tottenham, north London.
An inquest ruled in 2003 that they were unlawfully killed, but this was quashed a year later by a High Court judge. No officers were charged.
But following the case, the Metropolitan Police reviewed and reorganised its restraint training.
'Led by evidence'
Deborah Coles, chief executive of Inquest, a charity which advises on contentious deaths and their investigation, said it was "absolutely astonishing" that Mr Sylvester's death was not on the list of 16.
I know these cases, we've worked on these cases, and restraint was absolutely fundamental during the course of that inquest Deborah Coles, Inquest
"I can't believe they haven't even got Roger Sylvester,"' they said.
"These are cases that Inquest have worked on and yet within this list, they don't seem to recognise these are restraint-related deaths.
"I find that absolutely astonishing because I know these cases, we've worked on these cases, and restraint was absolutely fundamental.
"I would question the IPCC as to how these figures were collated, and what care has gone into ensuring that they're properly representative of... the investigations, some of which they have been directly involved in."
The IPCC said Roger Sylvester's name had been excluded from the list again due to its tight definition of restraint-related death.
Tom Bucke of the IPCC said was restraint was a "key factor" in the case.
"However, we are led by the evidence and the medical evidence was disputed by a pathologist at the inquest and the final inquest verdict was an open verdict on Roger Sylvester's death, so under cause of death we reflect the open verdict and the dispute between the pathologist about that," they said.
"The reason we have such a tight definition for our different categories is to allow us to look at trends over time.
"If we had very loose categories and included lots of things in there which may or not fit in there or may fit in other categories, then we would lose the ability to say whether deaths were going up or down.
"It's obviously very important for everybody concerned to know whether deaths in custody are going up or not."
Following the programme the IPCC asked the Government Statistical Service to review its figures. In their report they said more could be done to improve users' understanding of the IPCC reports and made a series of recommendations which it said would "enhance public confidence" in the figures. They said that, under the current system, cases were correctly classified and criticism of the IPCC reports was unsupported.

Tired of all the unflattering stories citing anonymous sources, White House press secretary Sean Spicer made an attempt to stop the leaks by summoning their staff for a phone check.
Under the supervision of White House attorneys, Spicer last week held "an emergency meeting" where staffers were told to hand over their phones to prove they were not communicating with reporters. Personal phones were also part of the inspection. Politico reported that Spicer and the attorneys were looking for encrypted messaging apps like Confide and Signal. Spicer informed their staff that these texting apps were a potential violation of the Presidential Records Act.

According to BuzzFeed reporter Sheera Frenkel, Spicer has Confided on their phone.
Spicer realized that someone on their own staff was a leaker after details of a meeting, exclusively attended by communications staffers, showed up in news stories, according to sources who attended the meeting.
President Donald Trump has grown increasingly upset with the media's use of anonymous sources. At a campaign-like event in Florida two weeks ago, Trump said that reporters "make up stories and make up sources." They insisted that media outlets should not be allowed to use sources unless they are named. "Let their name be put out there," Trump said.
Spicer consulted with White House lawyers before calling the emergency meeting, according to Politico. Other offices in the Trump administration are trying to control the leaking. The State Department's legal office even wrote a memo about the dangers of leaking, which The Washington Post immediately published after a staffer leaked it to the publication.

Help is Available for Lawyers with Addiction Issues
Lawyers have a tough job to do, and some try to alleviate the stress with mood-altering activities. Done to excess or illegally, that can make their situation much worse, as demonstrated by the criminal cases of at least two attorneys in the news this past week concerning their alleged activities.
But help is available to lawyers who may have issues with excessive drinking, drug use and other addictions, such as gambling. (One recovered attorney told an ABA Journal reporter several years ago that they formerly looked for cases that would be tried at courthouses near their favorite casino.)
In addition to the resources suggested by the American Bar Association's Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, an ABA Journal article provides links to organizations that can provide help.

Synth-rock trio Jimkata at The Outer Space in Hamden Thursday
Jimkata Jimkata Photo: Contributed Photo: Contributed Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Synth-rock trio Jimkata at The Outer Space in Hamden Thursday 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
HAMDEN >> Fresh off two successful crowdfunding campaigns, synth-rock trio Jimkata will spark The Outer Space with analog energy Thursday night.
“It's scary not knowing where the money is coming from, or if it will,” said vocalist/guitarist Evan Friedell. “Before we met our goal we were biting our nails hard.”
Jimkata, which also features synth player Aaron Gorsch and drummer Packy Lunn, financed their last two albums — last February's “In Motion” and 2012's “Die Digital” — through fan donations. While Friedell enjoyed releasing “In Motion” to donators before the album's official release, they said crowdfunding exposes one's vulnerabilities.
“We started playing in a band as the recession started and the record industry crashed,” said Friedell. “Every musician these days has to be comfortable self-promoting.”
As the downturn faded, Friedell's lyrical perspective changed from reflective to observational.
“‘Die Digital' was me reflecting on the digital age and how we have all these channels of communication yet are still terrible at communicating with each other,” said Friedell. “‘In Motion' is simple, everyday life.”
Friedell's Upstate New York upbringing also influenced their dynamics. Currently based in Ithaca, Friedell speaks highly of the pastoral impact the town's had on Jimkata.
“It's a comfortable, beautiful town surrounded by nature, but it's also pretty cosmopolitan,” said Friedell.
This cosmopolitan consciousness exposed Friedell to sounds they normally wouldn't hear.
“The proximity to New York City was a good thing before the internet became huge,” said Friedell. “You get all the artistry without the pretension of the city here.”
Though critical of New York City for the usual reasons — costliness and oversaturation — Friedell said he's considered moving to another big city in Denver.
“Denver's basically created for and by millennials,” said Friedell.
Recounting a quirky touring experience at a Midwest saloon, Friedell said breweries are an independent band's best asset, as brewery owners understand music better than most other venues.
“The upstairs portion of the saloon was an old brothel, and the owners let us stay there overnight,” said Friedell. “We jammed all night with this bluegrass band who performed with us, and they tried to convince us to eat shrooms and go ziplining with them, which sounded like a really horrible, surreal idea.”
Though bluegrass and electronic music are a strange combination, Jimkata has an organic approach, said Friedell. Pointing out fellow electronic musicians Tycho and Bonobo as examples of organic sounds, Friedell said electronic music can be soulful and human with the right approach. Friedell often composes Jimkata's music on acoustic guitar first before turning to synth.
“Music in general is more than ever, but electronic music now is such a broad term,” said Friedell. “With some electronic music, it's made simply to provoke a superficial, physical reaction, with not much emotional response.”
Emotional responses, said Friedell, are important to Jimkata. While conceding it's easy to get lost in “electronic layering, cool sounds, and an infinite computer software library,” Friedell remains grounded in a cerebral middle.
“You can't have a crazy party all the time,” said Friedell. “When you're sitting on the couch at home, an introspective, analog mix just feels right.”
A dedication to both the lyrical and the physical complements Friedell's roots. Friedell, who comes from a musical family, played in a punk band in middle school with Gorsch and Lunn. Their middle school group eventually morphed into Jimkata.
“All three of us have such broad taste,” said Friedell. “I think this helps us give a profound, fun and uplifting experience for everyone in the audience.”
The Outer Space is located at 295 Treadwell St. Tickets are $12 in advance and $15 at the door, which opens at 8 p.m. Showtime is 8:30. Connecticut soul acts Broca's Area and Joon open the show.
The Phillies put the Astros to bed with an offensive explosion. Last night, the focus was probably moreso on some pitching prospects on the farm. Phillies #4 prospect, Jesse Biddle made their return to the mound yesterday for Clearwater after a nearly 1 1/2 month hiatus.
Biddle was out of commission with a concussion after getting hit in the head during a dangerous hail storm in May. Once they returned, their pitching went downhill. They stated to the media that they felt miserable on the mound, that they just aren't happy and didn't know why. They gave up 24 earned runs in five starts following their return, which led to their "mental break". If last night's return was any sign of their mental break paying off, then we may be in for something special.
Last night with Clearwater, Biddle was unhittable...literally. They tossed five no-hit innings in the Threshers 4-0 win over the Daytona Cubs. The 22-year-old southpaw struck out five and walked only one, throwing 64 pitches, 45 for strikes.
Just because Biddle took a month off from the game doesn't mean their mind wasn't on baseball. They worked with Phillies staff in Clearwater to try and regain their form and is ready to start every five days. (via MiLB.com)
"I was really focused on where I want to be, having a concussion and going to rehab for that," Biddle said. "Then, also, just reconnecting with the game of baseball. I was making it more complicated than it needed to be. I need to keep it simple. That's the biggest thing, finding myself again on the mound. So far, so good." Biddle said there's no set plan for where he'll throw going forward. "I know I want the ball in five days. That's all I care about," they said. "I don't care where they put me. I don't care who's in the box. I want the ball and I want to see what I can do with it."
While last night was a good step in the process of returning to form, Biddle knows that they have to develop consistency before they start getting ahead of himself. With the minor league season winding down, they plan to make every outing count. (via MiLB.com)
"I feel like a different person when I'm pitching," they said. "I'm one start in, so obviously, it's easy to feel that way right now. It's about being consistent. There's not a whole lot of season left for us Minor Leaguers, but I really want to make the most of it. Every start and every pitch counts."
Lino Martinez took over for Biddle after their five innings and carried the no-no into the eighth until it was broken up by a Billy McKinney single.

A group of landowners claims in a U.S. District Court case that Dakota Access agents harassed, threatened and intimidated them and used fraud and misleading statements to secure a lower price in exchange for allowing the pipeline to cross their land.
Most of the landowners in the group accepted $216 per rod for pipeline easements, but later found out some of their neighbors received as high as $2,000 per rod, the lawsuit states. A rod is 16½ feet.
"The landowners were told that they were being offered the best deal that was ever going to come along and no one else would receive a better deal," said Fargo attorney Peter Zuger. "Many were told their land could be taken by eminent domain if they didn't agree."
The 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline will transport oil from the Bakken oilfields to a transportation hub in Patoka, Ill.
The landowners in the suit collectively own 11 separate pieces of land that make up about 9 miles of the pipeline route in Morton County, Zuger said.
Land agents contracted by Dakota Access approached the landowners in 2014, telling them they had 30 days to consider the proposal or risk losing a 20 percent signing bonus, the lawsuit states.
The agents also told some landowners in late 2014 that because the price of oil was going down, they should sign the agreements right away and they'd still get the money even though the pipeline might not be constructed, the complaint says.
Landowners also were told they would receive less money or "basically nothing" if their land was taken by eminent domain.
Vicki Anderson Granado, a spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners, the main developer behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. Dakota Access was still in the process of being served with the complaint, which means the legal answer will be due in about three weeks.
The lawsuit is not the first time North Dakota landowners have complained about how land agents representing Dakota Access have treated them. Concerns also were raised to the North Dakota Public Service Commission when the pipeline was under review, with some landowners complaining about bullying tactics and threats of taking their land through eminent domain.
Troy Coons, chairperson of the Northwest Landowners Association, said they often hear complaints from landowners who don't feel they were treated fairly in easement negotiations.
The association helps landowners form groups so they can have a stronger position when negotiating with land agents, Coons said.
"That is their job is to get the best deal for their organization," they said. "These guys are professionals."
Judge online polling by real-world accuracy, not academic theory
By Angus Reid
My commitment to the online methodology came from an epiphany of sorts that I had at the turn of the millennium, when non-participation rates for conventional polling were starting to top 90 per cent. It became clear to me that we must find a better way to bring potential survey respondents into the research process – especially in a world that places more emphasis than ever on personal privacy and where robo-calls and even live interviewer engagement are seen as spam.
If enough care and attention (and dollars) are committed to this task, it is possible to build very large panels of “double opt-in” respondents – that is, people who choose to be part of the panel and then choose whether to participate in the surveys offered to them. With the proper investment, these panels can be large enough to represent each of the major regions and segments of a given country. Following on the footsteps of the very successful YouGov operation in the U.K., I started building panels in Canada, the U.S. and Britain.
The online panel offers some major advantages over other forms of research. Surveys can be completed on mobile devices at the respondent's convenience and can include pictures and video to obtain a more realistic response context. Most of the investment in online research goes into maintaining and growing a large group of potential respondents – rather than paying for interviewers in call centres.
Because online polls involve sampling from a pre-recruited group willing to take a survey, some have attacked this method, claiming that the sample is not truly random and therefore the margin of error typically put out when a poll is released (e.g. “accurate +/- 4 %, 19 times out of 20”) cannot be used.
While this is technically correct about online polls, it is arguable that no poll today should use a margin of error, given the very serious problems of low completion- and high refusal-rates that inhibit a truly random sample.
Adding to the complexity and confusion is a lack of understanding on part of many reporters and editors who cite polls, and find themselves invariably skeptical of any poll that doesn't report a margin of error.
In this environment, it is more appropriate to judge pollsters on their real-world performance than through the use of abstract mathematical models. We are living in a time of rapidly changing communication technology and, unfortunately, the standards used to assess polling are rooted in the wrong century.
In the polling world, there are two types of measures to assess the quality of election polling. The first, and most important, is picking the eventual winner. The second involves the level of accuracy surrounding the final projection. In golf parlance, it's “how close did we get to the pin?”
On the first of the standards – picking the eventual winner – my accuracy has been 95 per cent. Ironically the two we missed were closest to my home in Vancouver: Alberta in 2012 and British Columbia in 2013. (Pollsters across all methods missed B.C. in 2013, suggesting something other than polling method problems were at work in that unusual election.)
In terms of precision, my average is better than three percentage points. In some cases, such as the 2011 federal contest and the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, we were off by one point or less. In other cases, we projected the winner but our margin of error was much higher (in Alberta in 2008, for example).
With the plethora of polling methods currently being deployed, it can be difficult to sort out results based on quality. Rather than leaving this determination to theoretical models, it makes more sense to judge the pollster by their record.
Below I have taken the liberty to reproduce my “election biography,” so readers can draw their own conclusions. I can't speak for the entire polling industry, nor for others in the online field, but I'm quite happy with what we've been able to accomplish in eight years of working with a completely new research technology.
Our Electoral Record
Canadian National Elections
Canada – November 2015
In this contest, Angus Reid correctly projected the election with an average error of 1.7%. Notably, these data were pulled out of field 3 days before the election, whereas other firms polled until 1 or 2 days before.
Canada – May 2011
In this contest, Angus Reid squared off against eight other firms, including three which relied on online panels for some of their data collection. The final survey perfectly predicted the level of support that three of the five contending parties—Liberals, Bloc Québécois and Greens—would get at the ballot box.
Canada – October 2008
Angus Reid, using its online approach in a national election for the first time, conducted the only poll that foresaw a high number of votes for the Conservatives, a perfect prediction for the Green Party, and a double-digit difference between Tories and Grits at the national level.
Canadian Provincial Elections
Nova Scotia – October 2013
Angus Reid applied lessons learned from past Canadian elections and used weighting to mimic past voting patterns. The results correctly predicted a Liberal win.
Nova Scotia – June 2009
The Angus Reid surveys conducted during this provincial campaign anticipated a third place finish for the Progressive Conservatives, and a victory for the New Democrats—who had never formed the government in any Atlantic Canadian province.
Quebec – April 2014
Using the likely voter model first developed for the 2013 Nova Scotia election, we weighted respondents by those who are most likely to actually vote. Again the weighting formula worked as our results were within the margin of error for all four major parties.
Quebec – December 2008
The December 2008 election in Quebec provided a chance to review the effect of two emerging parties in the provincial landscape. The final Angus Reid survey anticipated that the governing Liberals would receive 42 per cent of the vote, while other firms that relied on the telephone overstated their predictions.
Quebec – March 2007
This was the first prediction of a Canadian democratic process that relied entirely on data collected from online research. While three other firms anticipated a third place finish for the opposition Action démocratique du Québec, the Angus Reid surveys saw a steady rise in support for the ADQ that would ultimately lead to the party becoming the official opposition in Quebec.
Ontario – June 2014
We adjusted the likely voter model first developed for the 2013 Nova Scotia election to take into account historic voting patterns in Ontario. However in this election our estimate based on all eligible voters and not just the likely voters was closer to the actual results, demonstrating that the likely voter model continues to be a work in progress.
Ontario – October 2011
Going into field on the final day of the campaign, our research noticed a shift towards the governing Liberal Party that materialized on election night.
Ontario – October 2007
The election was marked by the decision of the opposition Progressive Conservatives to call for specific changes to education guidelines. In the end, all participating parties were predicted within two percentage points of their actual result.
Manitoba – October 2011
The voting intention survey conducted days before the provincial ballot provided an exact prediction for three of the four contending parties – New Democrats, Liberals and Greens – and a difference of a single point for the Progressive Conservatives.
Manitoba – May 2007
An Angus Reid survey conducted a few days before the provincial election was held showed that incumbent premier Gary Doer was unquestionably more popular than opposition challenger Hugh McFadyen. The voting intention numbers confirmed that the governing NDP would win the election by a double-digit margin.
Saskatchewan – November 2007
A series of Angus Reid surveys showed that respondents in Saskatchewan were ready for a change of government, as the popularity of sitting premier Lorne Calvert waned and opposition contender Brad Wall connected with the population. The final Angus Reid survey accurately predicted that more than half of voters would support the Saskatchewan Party in the election.
Alberta – May 2015
Alberta – April 2012
A late-shift saw a severe drop in support for the Wildrose Party on the final days of the campaign, which translated in a victory for the incumbent Progressive Conservatives.
Alberta – March 2008
Four of the five parties in this election, which featured a particularly low turnout, were called within the margin of error, and all contenders were listed in the correct order.
BC Election – 2017
BC Transit Plebiscite – May 2015
British Columbia – May 2013
The 2013 general election in British Columbia saw the BC Liberals, led by Christy Clark, climb back from the depths of public disfavor to win a majority.
Most pollsters – including Angus Reid Global – predicted victory for the BC New Democratic Party and leader Adrian Dix. A thorough post-election review of ARG's practices and methodology indicates our polling missed primarily because of low voter turnout among younger voters. Weighting the responses of voters under the age of 35 to their share of the voting electorate, as opposed to weighting them to their share of the overall BC population would have shown a much narrower three-point lead for the NDP in the final stretch of the campaign. This would have supported the dynamic of the Liberals picking up critical momentum.
BC Referendum – August 2011
The last survey conducted before registered voters in British Columbia received their ballots to take part in the mail-in referendum on the future of the harmonized sales tax (HST) pegged support for the Yes side at 56 per cent. When all the ballots were counted, the Yes side emerged victorious with 55 per cent of the vote.
British Columbia – May 2009
This provincial election featured the debut of Real Ballot—a revolutionary approach that showed respondents the candidates that were running in their respective constituencies. This approach allowed researchers to provide an exact prediction for two opposition parties: the NDP and the BC Conservatives.

A THOUSAND OAKS — Nelson Spruce made the catch of the day.
As the Rams worked their red-zone offense on a perfect Tuesday afternoon on the campus of Cal Lutheran, Spruce caught an absolute laser from backup quarterback Sean Mannion .. which just grazed the fingers of the defensive back.
‘That one (the catch) took a little extra concentration cause the DB undercut it at the last second, I think they even got a hand on it,” said Spruce following Day 1 of the Rams' minicamp. “It was coming so fast. The location was perfect from Sean.”
In 2016, Spruce had a decent preseason … with a few highlight plays … before losing their rookie year to injured reserve list because of knee and calf injuries.
Now, finally healthy, Spruce is feeling good.
Minicamp Day 1 Press Conferences LIVE https://t.co/zrqPswH59A — Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) June 13, 2017
“I'm really feeling 100 percent for the first time in a while,” Spruce said. “I missed a lot of time with injures (in 2016) so I'm just shaking off the rust and getting extra work with the QBs and getting my feet back under me.”
This offseason the Rams added free-agent receiver Robert Woods and drafted Cooper Kupp (Eastern Washington) and Josh Reynolds (Texas A&M) to go along with Pharoh Cooper, Tavon Austin and others in Los Angeles.
Needless to say, the Rams' receiving room is, well, running out of room.
“The rookies came in, they transitioned really well. I think we have a good group of guys. Great relationship between all of us. We are all competing against each other.”
Entering their second season as a professional, Spruce knows what's at stake … they have to make the team again.
“I know my spot's definitely not safe by any means. I just want to contribute in any way I can,” Spruce said.
Spruce said starting quarterback Jared Goff looks and sounds more confident than a year ago, when the No. 1 overall draft pick struggled in all aspects of the game.
Skills @tg4hunnid @rams @nflonfox A post shared by FOX Sports West (@foxsportswest) on Jun 13, 2017 at 2:34pm PDT
“Jared is more comfortable … not only with the offense but from a leadership standpoint. It's going to be a big year for him.
Growing up minutes from Rams' practice facility, Spruce said it's nice to be near their hometown, but he's starting to feel like he's back in high school.
“It's getting kinda old,” Spruce said with a laugh. “It's cool being around my family.”
Autophagy was known to be associated with aging in addition to cancer and neurodegeneration. The effects of scopoletin on autophagy and anti-aging were investigated in human lung fibroblast cell line, IMR 90. Here we show that scopoletin induces autophagy. It is also identified that the modulation of p53 by scopoletin are related to the induction of autophagy. Moreover, the level of SA-β-Gal staining, an aging marker, is reduced by scopoletin. In addition, while the expression levels of histone deacetylases such as HDAC1, SIRT1 and SIRT6 are increased in IMR 90 cells in the presence of scopoletin, the expression levels of histone acetyltransferases are decreased. Furthermore, scopoletin enhances the level of transcription factors such as Nrf-2and p-FoxO1 related to anti-aging. In addition, scopoletin modulates the reprogramming proteins. Therefore, these findings suggest that scopoletin could exert a positive effect on anti-aging related to autophagy through modulation of p53 in human lung fibroblasts.

Momentum is building to reform Senate rules that allow silent filibusters and force a 60-vote requirement for virtually any action, interviews with Democratic candidates and sitting senators indicate.
Democratic candidates said that they hear regularly from voters about abuse of the parliamentary tactic, which is likely to come up as the first vote new senators face in 2011. The supermajority requirement in the Senate has become such an obstacle to reform that it infiltrates policy discussions at every step. Last week at the Netroots Nation political conference, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) gathered environmental writers to discuss energy legislation; the first few questions were related to energy, the rest of the conversation was dominated by the filibuster.
"The use of the filibuster and the way it's led to backroom deals has created the impression in the heartland that the Senate is dysfunctional," said Jack Conway, a Democratic candidate facing Republican Rand Paul in Kentucky. "They don't understand why Washington can't address the issues people care about. People in Kentucky wanted people focused on jobs -- 14 months [of the health care debate] laid bare how broken the system was."
Conway was joined in their backing of filibuster reform by the three other Senate candidates who HuffPost interviewed for this story: Paul Hodes of New Hampshire, Elaine Marshall of North Carolina and Roxanne Conlin of Iowa. Sitting Senators Al Franken (D-Minn.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) also said they supported reform.
"It's not constitutional. It's not statutory. It's a rule," said Hodes, adding that they aren't certain what the new rule should look like exactly, but the current ones needed to be reformed. "Everywhere I go, they say, 'Make 'em bring out the cots and the telephone books.' People are eager for real backbone and some toughness from Democrats."
Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), a leader in the effort to reform the filibuster, said that support is strongest among new members and those running now. "They're all tuned into it," said Udall, elected in 2008, of the first-year student and sophomore senators. "The core of support will by those: 2006, 2008, and whoever comes in in 2010." Merkley, Cardin and Franken have all been elected since 2006.
Merkley said that he's been canvassing their colleagues to determine how strong support is for reform. "I think we will be able to pull a couple dozen senators into the debate," they said. "Now is the time to heat up this conversation. Going into this election cycle with people running for office...it is important for people to remember that there was no supermajority requirement till 1917."
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), during an address to the Netroots Nation conference, expressed their support for filibuster reform, comparing the situation to baseball's decision to ban the spitball and basketball's move to implement a shot clock. Neither rule had been needed before pitchers and basketball coaches abused the process, they said.
Reid has let the filibuster opponents know he's on their side. "Senator Reid has now said that they think that at the beginning of the next Congress there needs to be some kind of reform," said Udall. "There's a sense that we need to do something. Exactly what it is nobody quite knows yet."
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been holding Rules Committee hearings to study the issue of reforming the filibuster. What was recently considered impossible is now looking inevitable.
"There is a lot of talk around the country and senators are hearing it. I think there is more interest in it in the caucus. I don't know if it is an issue we will deal with this cycle, but...I think its time is coming," said J.B. Poersch, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "Some of it is because, around the country, several of our candidates have adopted similar platforms and you have an opportunity to elect new Senators who have that on their agenda, too."
Udall said that the discussion has radically changed in the Senate. "The tone has changed. It used to be, when I first got here, people would say, 'Why are we doing this this way? This doesn't make any sense. And they would be referring to the procedure and the rules. And the saying always was, 'Oh, we're stuck with these rules. You can't change them. You need 67 votes. It's part of the filibuster. You just can't change it.' And people don't say that anymore," said Udall.
They don't say that anymore because it's not true and Udall, along with Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), has effectively made the case to their colleagues that it is entirely constitutional to change the rules.
The Constitution gives the vice president the power to break ties - not break 60-40 splits. Why would such a vote matter if the institution was not designed to be run by a majority?
Opponents of reform argue that the Senate is a continuing legislative body and that its rules can only be changed with 67 votes. But three vice presidents have previously ruled otherwise in the past - two Republicans and one Democrat.
If Vice President Joe Biden -- who has spoken out against abuse of the filibuster and has been studying ways to reform it -- were to rule on the first day of the next session that the Senate has the authority to write its own rules, Republicans would immediately move to object. Democrats would then move to table the objection, setting up the key vote. If 50 Democrats voted to table the objection, the Senate would then move to a vote on a new set of rules, which would be approved by a simple majority.
The simple act of holding the vote would have a therapeutic effect on the Senate even if it fails, said Udall, as it would inspire fear that abuse of the rules could lead to their destruction.
"People would then realize on both sides that if we abuse the rules, then they might change, because you do have an option of changing them. So I think there's a very healthy effect that flows from having the ability to adopt rules by a majority vote," they said.
A 22-year-old driver was killed and a police officer was injured early Saturday in a head-on collision that occurred as the lawman was responding to a call for service in central Arkansas, authorities said.
It happened shortly before 1 a.m. as Maumelle officer Christopher Cruse was driving north on Arkansas 100 near Arkansas 365, according to a statement from the Maumelle Police Department.
The other driver — identified by Arkansas State Police as Anthony Walker of Maumelle — appears to have been traveling south in the northbound lanes in a Jeep Grand Cherokee, police said, noting the investigation is in its preliminary stages.
Walker sustained fatal injuries, and two passengers in the Jeep were also hurt. Cruse, 23, suffered injuries to both legs, authorities said.
Conditions at the time were reported to be clear and dry. The death is at least the 359th in a traffic crash in Arkansas so far this year.
State police are handling the investigation.

Food Rescue project launched to feed Perth's homeless
Updated
A Food Rescue project has been launched in Perth to collect and redistribute food to the homeless more effectively.
The project, by Uniting Care West, particularly targets families sleeping in their cars and ensuring homeless children have lunch to take to school.
The project aims to rescue 9,500 kilograms of fresh food a week, equating to about 19,000 meals a week.
The community organisation uses bikes which they reconfigure to work as cargo carts that can fit on footpaths.
Thirty-five cafeterias have agreed to contribute to the cause, with more expected to join.
Food Rescue manager Julie Broad was initially worried about securing 30 volunteers per week, but they said the response from companies was incredible.
"Engineering and project management company Ausenco found out about our project and absolutely loved it," they said.
"That's now [snowballed] into 11 companies... who have volunteered their staff to push carts around the city, collecting the food and bringing it to our food rescue van on St Georges Terrace to be loaded up."
Two carts will operate each day with volunteers from Alinta Energy, Argonaut, Ausenco, Rio Tinto, Bankwest, QBE, Clayton Utz, PwC, Westpac, Business News and Brookfield Corporate Offices taking part in the daily runs.
Ms Broad said the central location makes it easy for volunteers to take part.
"They can leave their office desks and come down to get their carts and off they go with a run sheet to collect from the participating cafes," they said.
"The wooden carts covered with logos and big wheels are like a Rolls-Royce of carts to be honest."
Ms Broad said the cargo carts are a more environmentally friendly method of collecting leftover food from cafes in the city than a van.
"With the size of the city and the increase of traffic on the roads, it's just become increasingly difficult to rescue leftover wraps and rolls from cafes," they said.
"We had these cargo carts which were in fact bikes, and we configured them to work as cargo carts to enable volunteers to push them on the footpath."
Abiding by strict guidelines set by the Health Department, "rescued" food is kept in temperature-controlled cooler boxes and covered in ice blankets with infra-red guns to test the quality of food at points of collection and during handover.
The collected food is then distributed by Food Rescue's refrigerated vans to homeless support centres including Manna Inc, The Salvos, the Tranby Inner City Centre and Family Foundation Services.

On Wednesday. July 26, President Donald Trump announced that they would discontinue administrative directives ordering the armed forces to accommodate transgenders in the military.
Our friend Elaine Donnelly, President of the Center for Military Readiness, here explains what the next steps are to accomplish the President's directive.
“The Center for Military Readiness applauds President Trump for showing decisive leadership in announcing their intent to halt a massive social experiment in the armed forces. This action is necessary because Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, wrongly ordered the military to assume the risks of retaining and recruiting a cohort of persons who are suffering from gender dysphoria – a psychological condition that involves confusion about gender identity.
“President Donald Trump had every right and responsibility to announce an end to their predecessor's most extreme imposition of political correctness in our military.
“The military health system (MHS) is designed to be a national security force multiplier. It should not be misused to indulge transgender demands and theories that are contradicted by biological realities, science, and common sense. Expensive life-long hormone treatments and irreversible surgeries associated with gender dysphoria would negatively affect personal deployability and mission readiness, without resolving underlying psychological problems, including high risks of suicide.
“The next step is to formalize what the Commander-in-Chief announced yesterday. President Trump or the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, should formally revoke expendable Obama-era administrative directives, which were written in consultation with LGBT activist groups and like-minded, always-pro LGBT contractors such as RAND.
“To encourage this policy change, the Center for Military Readiness recently released a 27 -page CMR Special Report, which identifies and analyzes fifteen Defense Department and military service directives that former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and other Pentagon officials imposed on our military, starting in 2015:
Department of Defense & Military Services Should Revoke Problematic Transgender Policy Directives and Instructions
Executive Summary
“These fifteen directives, instructions, and mandatory, time-wasting training programs force the military to retain and recruit persons with a psychological condition that renders them non-deployable for long periods of time. All of them reflect the pervasive groupthink and delusional ideology that has permeated Pentagon plans for transgenders in our military.
“President Trump has chosen to stand by troops who were betrayed by the Obama Administration. These include:
* Intellectually honest servicemembers who reject the notion that gender is “assigned” at birth and can be changed, and the irrational belief that regardless of unchanging human DNA, revisions in bureaucratic “gender markers” really can transform a man into a woman or a woman into a man.
* Pro-defense taxpayers and military leaders who object to unlimited expenditures for lifetime hormone treatments and sometimes irreversible surgeries. (Transgender advocates demand special status for recruits seeking lifetime medical benefits despite deployability problems. They also demand coverage for veterans in an already overloaded system, and for family dependents, including minor children);
* Military women who object to training programs telling them that they must accept infringements on their personal privacy, including unclothed biological males, in facilities and conditions of forced intimacy;
* Military commanders, doctors, and nurses who have been ordered to approve, participate in, or perform procedures that violate medical ethics or sincerely-held personal or religious convictions;
* Thousands of troops in all branches of the service who are demoralized by orders to accept additional burdens when side effects from transgender treatments and surgeries negatively affect combat deployability and readiness. These personnel will be harmed by DoD directives authorizing months-long absences for “real life experience” (RLE), allowing confused persons to try out life as a person of the opposite sex,
* Traditional American volunteers who object to the establishment of a network of remote “Service Central Coordination Cells” (SCCCs) allowing LGBT consultants to politicize the Military Health System;
* Subordinates in all ranks and branches of the service who no longer trust military leaders who endorse medical delusions.; and
* Veterans who object to the diversion of scarce VA resources in pursuit of politically-correct social agendas that are not consistent with sound priorities in the military.
“President Trump has re-established vertical cohesion, which is essential for combat readiness. It is important to note that the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps initially requested a delay of at least two years to assess costs and consequences of recruiting transgenders into the armed forces.
“It appears that President Trump listened to these military leaders and took their concerns seriously.
“Congressional leaders who failed to call or ask for hearings on this important issue should not complain about being taken by surprise. They should know that there are a number of psychological conditions that make a person ineligible to serve, such as anorexia nervosa, claustrophobia, sleep-walking, and chronic sea- or air-sickness.
“President Trump's announcement is consistent with what Defense Secretary James Mattis said at their confirmation hearing: In the making of military personnel policies, mission readiness and combat lethality will be paramount.

Freezing conditions are continuing to disrupt transport in north-west Europe, although heavy snow has eased.
Large parts of northern France have been placed on ice alert, with officials describing the situation as "very complicated".
Frankfurt airport had to cancel more flights on Wednesday, after hundreds of passengers remained stranded overnight.
Meanwhile the Eurostar high-speed train has resumed its service between London, Paris and Brussels but with delays.
The cross-Channel train had been forced to suspend all travel on Tuesday after a severe snowstorm struck France, Belgium, Germany and the UK.
High-speed trains between Paris and other French regions were also restored.
France's SNCF rail company put up more than stranded 1,000 travellers in hotel rooms and sleeping carriages overnight, it said.
"For 24 hours, 10,000 employees have been working to remove snow from the rail lines and re-establish service," SNCF said in a statement.
Treacherous roads
But while trains have resumed, road conditions in France remain difficult as snow has turned major motorways into ice traps, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said.
French soldiers were mobilised to help workers restore electricity to about 80,000 homes in the country's north-east, left without power after the snowstorm.
Icy conditions are forecast to last at least until Thursday.

Similarly, drivers in Belgium continue to face treacherous roads, and trains operate at reduced speed.
On Tuesday morning, the total length of traffic jams exceeded more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) at rush hour, according to Belgian emergency road assistance company Touring.
In Germany, Frankfurt airport - Europe's third-largest hub - was forced to scrap at least 80 flights on Wednesday morning, spokesperson Mike Schweitzer said.
Although all runways are back in operation, the airport still faces significant delays because of Tuesday's cancellations, they said.
About 800 of 1,200 flights had been annulled after about 12cm (5in) of snow fell.
Hundreds of passengers spent the night on emergency camp beds at the airport.
Snow and freezing conditions also struck southern England.
The severe weather forced the Channel Tunnel's closure, causing a huge backlog of freight traffic as hundreds of lorries remained stuck on the M20 motorway in Kent.
Although the tunnel was reopened overnight, the UK Highways Agency said freight traffic waiting for ferries from the Port of Dover would face another long wait.
The Channel Islands have experienced some of their worst conditions in decades.
It's a familiar tale by now, but one that doesn't get less painful for fans of the Super Bowl loser.
Tens of thousands of T-shirts, caps and sweatshirts had been prepped for sale if the Seahawks finished off their final drive against the Patriots on Sunday. One brilliant read by Malcolm Butler changed all that, rendering 2015 Seahawks championship gear painfully obsolete.
Perhaps Seahawks fans can take some solace in knowing the merchandise will not go to waste.
The Guardian reported this week that the boxes of Seahawks championship gear, still sealed, will be sent to a warehouse that will then ship the goods to countries where clothing is most needed.
The NFL stopped destroying unsellable merchandise in 1996. For the past 19 years, the NFL distributed the gear through the Christian charity World Vision. Starting in 2015, the NFL has partnered with Good360, a charity that specializes in distributing corporate goods to nations in need.
Good360 will be responsible for disseminating an estimated 100,000 pieces of Super Bowl merchandise that came oh-so-close to being worn by 12s throughout Washington and beyond.
"It's a huge amount of stuff," Good360 CEO Cindy Hallberlin said. "It's a fantastic opportunity and the start of a great relationship where we could do a lot of good for people through the teams that don't win."

Straight from Russia, the website Film Business Today has confirmed that the sequel to ‘X-Men: First Class' will be ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past.'
Rumors about the title began last month when Fox registered the name ‘Days of Future Past' with the MPAA. At that time, it wasn't known if the title would be for the sequel of ‘X-Men: First Class' or not. Now it seems our Russian friends have made the confirmation.
Fans of the X-Men comic series will undoubtedly recognize the title as it is from the ‘Uncanny X-Men' comic book storyline written in 1981 by legendary X-Men writer/artist team Chris Claremont and John Byrne. The storyline involves the X-Men trying to stop the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Mystique from assassinating Senator Robert Kelly, a known anti-mutant political figure. When they fail, the event creates a timeline where Sentinels rule the US and mutants are hunted and placed in internment camps. The present day X-Men are forewarned by this possible timeline from future X-Men Kitty Pryde but despite the current X-Men succeeding in stopping the assassination, the dystopian future still exists as an alternate timeline rather than the true actual future.
Fox Studios has always envisioned ‘X-Men: First Class' as the first of a trilogy. Scribe Simon Kinberg (who wrote ‘X-Men: The Last Stand' and co-produced ‘X-Men: First Class) is currently writing the sequel with director Matthew Vaughn and their longtime collaborator Jane Goldman (‘Kick-Ass,' ‘The Woman in Black'). Bryan Singer will return as co-producer on the film.
Many fans are pleased with the path that this sequel is going on as it may be able to bridge the inconsistencies and continuation problems that ‘X-men: First Class' had with the original ‘X-Men' trilogies. It will also be very interesting to see how Kinberg et al will bridge the two movies and how close to the comic the story will be.
‘X-Men: Days of Future Past' will begin production sometime in January 2013 and has a July 18, 2014 release date.

REWIND FEATURE: INTERVIEW WITH AUTHOR STEPHEN JACOBS
We are proud to present another of our interview features. This time Sam Scott has interviewed author Stephen Jacobs.
Hi Stephen, many thanks for taking time from your busy schedule. Please, tell us about your book.
My book is called Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster and was published by Tomahawk Press in January 2011. It's hardback, over 500 pages long and it weighs too much to read on the train!
Why Boris Karloff?
In the late 70's & early 80's the BBC would screen seasons of horror double bills. Usually there was a black and white Universal film followed by a Hammer film. These great nights were my introduction to the world of classic horror. I had seen many photos in magazines and books but this was the first time I got to see the actual films. Of all the actors I saw it was Karloff, initially in their role of the Frankenstein Monster, that fascinated me the most. They could play anything - monsters, madmen, detectives, comedy and even sympathetic characters - and they were eminently watchable.
I tried to find out more information about them but the pickings were rather thin. So, eventually, I decided to look for myself and that begin my years of research and writing.
What research went into the book?
I started researching the book around 1999, as I said, initially for my own benefit. In all cases I tried to go back to the original quotes wherever possible. Karloff's pre-fame years were spent in England, Canada and the U.S. so the area of coverage was very large. Fortunately for me more and more archives were being digitised and being made available online - or, at least, a list of their contents were. That allowed me to contact them for more information and turn up some very interesting information.
I was able to contact many who had known or worked with Karloff - like Michael Gough, Robert Hardy, Francis Matthews etc. - and they were all very, very kind. I was rather surprised at this as, when I started my research, I didn't even have a publisher!
Why do you think Boris Karloff managed to have such a long and surprisingly varied career?
I think it's down to the fact that they simply loved to act. Stardom offered the financial security but it wasn't the be all and end all for him. They had no snobbery about films or TV being inferior to the stage. In fact, they had their own TV show, Starring Boris Karloff, in 1949. They started in provincial theatre in Western Canada around 1911 (having emigrated from England in 1909) and worked with various theatrical companies for the next 8 or so years. Then they started working as an extra in Hollywood and worked their way up the ladder, gradually getting better parts. But it was a hard slog. Their overnight success in Frankenstein (1931) had been 20 years in the making.
Karloff's daughter, Sara, was instrumental in the information found in your book. What are they like, and how do they feel about their father's legacy?
Sara has always been very encouraging. When I first contacted them I just wanted to let them know of the new information I had unearthed, information that contradicted some of the much reported facts about their father. They urged me to continue and what had originally been a private project developed into a full blown biography. Throughout the whole process Sara couldn't have been kinder. I am so grateful to them And being able to now call Sara a dear friend - well, that is something I could never have imagined. It's the icing on the top of the cake!
When the book was finished my publisher, Tomahawk Press, suggested that I ask if Sara would be willing to authorise it. I had never considered this as I always had the impression that authorised biographies were, in fact, sanitized, with any less than flattering information removed so as not to upset the subjects family. Yet I was thrilled when Sara agreed - and they never asked me to change, or omit, a single word.
Sara regularly attends conventions and screenings (we presented a Frankenstein/Bride of Frankenstein double bill at the BFI last November) and their father's fans are always keen to speak to them and pass on their admiration for him. Sara is always happy and willing to do so.
What is one of the facts people don't know about Karloff that you think people will be surprised about?
There's several: They were one of the founding members of the Screen Actors Guild, they played Captain Hook on stage in Peter Pan, they won a Grammy under the category Best Recording for Children for their narration of Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas!
What are your personal favourite Karloff movies and why?
Off the top of my head I would say Frankenstein (1931) and The Body Snatcher (1945). The role of the Monster in Frankenstein is, of course, iconic and Karloff's portrayal in the three Frankenstein movies is still unsurpassed. They bring such pathos to the (non-speaking) role and would receive letters from children (who, at that time, were allowed into cinemas to see the film) expressing sympathy for the Monster. Those children, they said, saw beyond the make-up and really understood. Of Karloff's speaking roles their portrayal of Cabman Gray is, by far, my favourite Karloff role. The film is an excellent adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's short story of the same name. Karloff simply shines in their role of the unshaven, manipulative body snatcher. If anybody had doubts as to Karloff's acting ability I would urge them to see this film.
The addition in your book of photographs from behind-the-scenes and on-set are fantastic. Did you come across any issues licensing photos?
No. I had no troubles at all. Everyone was really helpful.
Is there anyone you wish you could've interviewed for the book (dead or alive) that you unfortunately couldn't? What would you have asked them?
Oh, lots. There's Frankenstein's director James Whale, the great make-up man Jack Pierce, Lon Chaney Sr. (who knew Karloff before Karloff became famous), Bela Lugosi, the list goes on and on. But I think the people I'd most have liked to have talked to are those back in Karloff's earlier years. I'd like to speak to Karloff's first wife, Jessie Grace Harding, who Karloff married in Vancouver in 1910. I'd like to know what happened. Why did Karloff pack up and leave, and why did they stay? Was it simply due to their ultimate ambition to be an actor? I'd like to speak to Karloff's later paramour, the actor Helene Ripley (a.k.a. Margot Beaton) who, while touring with Karloff later in that decade, advertised themselves as Mrs. Karloff. There's no evidence of a marriage. Then there's another actor Olive de Wilton, who was close to Karloff - although it seems to have ended acrimoniously. Again, what happened? Then there are their many siblings - especially their favourite brother George, who was also an actor for a while.
But the person I would have loved to have talked to the most would have been, of course, Karloff themselves - even though I doubt he'd have revealed much. Although they would talk about their life there was only so much they would say, and some of that was misleading or just plain wrong. I suspect they would hate my book for revealing things about their private life that they would consider to be just that - private.
Do you think the popularity of DVD, Blu-ray and streaming has helped increase recognition of Karloff? Which home media companies do you think have released some sterling extra features on Karloff?
Of course it's helped. When I first became acquainted with Karloff's work the only way you could see one of their films was if it was shown on TV. With the advent of home video, DVD and now Blu-ray it means we can watch their films (those that are available, of course) whenever we wish. A lot of Karloff's work has become available over the years but there's still some way to go. Their output on Blu-ray is rather small at the moment.
Universal's Classic Monsters Collection on Blu-ray is a great place to start as it includes Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and The Mummy. The extras are good too but, sadly, have no new special features (they're the same as on the older dvd releases). Arrow Films release of Black Sabbath is excellent as it includes the original Italian version plus the re-edited US release (which features Karloff's own voice - which is always a good thing). I understand that Arrow is also planning to release The Comedy of Terrors too!

Archaeologists Unearth Possible Fragments of the Largest Buddhist Pagoda Ever Built in Japan
By Craig Lewis | | Buddhistdoor Global
Archaeologists in Japan have identified three decorative bronze fragments unearthed in the grounds of Kyoto's famous Kinkaku-ji Zen Buddhist temple as the remains of what might once have been the tallest Buddhist pagoda ever built in Japan. Scholars believe the fragments, discovered during excavation work carried out between April and July 2015 to develop the parking area of Kinkaku-ji, may once have formed part of the tip of a pagoda called Kitayama Daito, said to have been constructed within the grounds of Kinkaku-ji at the order of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), the third shogun of the Ashikaga or Muromachi shogunate (1338–1573). Kinkaku-ji (Temple of the Golden Pavilion), officially named Rokuon-ji (Deer Garden Temple), is a designated National Special Historic Site and a National Special Landscape in Japan, and is one of 17 protected locations that make up the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the Kyoto City Archaeological Research Institute, the three fragments formed part of a sōrin, the decorative vertical finial that stands at the top of a pagoda. The largest of the unearthed pieces is 37.4cm wide, 24.6cm long, and 1.5cm thick, weighing in at 8.2kg. Based on the size of the largest fragment, scholars estimate that the diameter of the kurin (nine tiered rings that make up the largest component of the sōrin) was about 2.4 meters. The fragments, which are partially covered in gold leaf, are thought to be from the decorated tip of the nine rings.

Shokoku-ji before the construction of Kitayama Daito.

“The Kitayama Daito was believed to have been a huge pagoda equal to the seven-tiered pagoda at Shokoku-ji,” said Yoshiaki Maeda, deputy director of the Kyoto City Archaeological Research Institute. “It was twice as tall as the five-tiered pagoda at Tō-ji and there is the possibility it was the tallest Buddhist pagoda ever built in Japan.” (The Asahi Shimbun) The shogun Yoshimitsu is thought to have begun work on Kitayama Daito in 1404 from their mountain home Kitayama-dono, which later became Kinkaku-ji, but they died four years later. The pagoda was believed to have been close to completion when it burned down after being struck by lightning in 1416. Before building Kitayama Daito, Yoshimitsu is said to have constructed an earlier seven-story pagoda in Kyoto in 1399, near another temple they commissioned, Shokoku-ji, some 110 meters tall. This pagoda also burned down after being struck by lightning in 1403, and Yoshimitsu subsequently decided to build Kitayama Daito at nearby Kitayama-dono. The five-tiered pagoda at the Shingon temple Tō-ji, one of the most famous symbols of Kyoto, is the tallest existing wooden pagoda in Japan, standing 56m high. It dates from the Edo period (1603–1868), when it was rebuilt by order of the third Tokugawa shogun, Iemitsu. The size of recovered fragments suggests that the decorative rings at the top of Kitayama Daito dwarfed the 1.6-meter rings of the Tō-ji pagoda.

Some motherboard manufacturers provide an Intel IGP driver, with which Windows 7 runs on Kaby Lake processor, despite no official support for older operating systems.
Back in August last year, Microsoft announced that Intel's 7th Gen Kaby Lake chips will officially be supported only by the company's flagship Windows 10 OS. Intel also appeared to be on board with Redmond's decision, saying it “will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core per Microsoft's support policy change.”
This left a lot of users in dismay who might have hoped to use the new chips for previous versions of Windows. Now that Intel has officially released the 7th Gen desktop CPUs, Heise Online decided to test chips in the face of Microsoft's decision, and guess what it found? The systems based on the Kaby Lake processors are quite capable of running Windows 7.
Officially, Intel doesn't provide Windows 7 graphics drivers for the Kaby Lake (Core i3 / i5 / i7-7000) and Apollo Lake (Celeron J / N3400, Pentium J / N4200) families of processors. However, as reported by Heise, some motherboard manufacturers do provide a beta-labeled integrated graphics (IGP) driver for KBL (Kaby Lake) under Windows 7 on their support website.
The driver, which bears the version number 21.20.16.4508, was released in August last year.
It is reported that the above driver was easily installed on an Asus Prime Z270-A motherboard and and Core i3-7100 under Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. However, the graphics driver recognizes the operating system as Windows Server 2008 R2, and not as Windows 7.
It seems that the driver was designed to support Kaby Lake's integrated graphics processor in servers. Otherwise, Intel clearly states on its website that Windows 7 is only supported up to Skylake family of CPUs.

Whatsoever, the test shows that Windows 7 runs on Kaby Lake without any problems, at least with respect to the graphics unit. The HD-630 GPU could output 4K display at 60 Hz via DisplayPort, and provide audio playback via HDMI / DP.
In addition to this, it was possible to run 3DMark 11 benchmarks which should allow 3D acceleration via DirectX 11 or OpenGL 4.4.
There is hardly any noticeable loss in the functionality of Kaby Lake under Windows 7, apart from occasional display errors when scaling Windows, or Google Chrome could not use the VP9 decoder.
4K video format on YouTube is playable, but when CPU load is above 50%, the frame rate drops sharply. Also, H.265 / HEVC video playback works under Windows 7, but only when using a third-party software.
So far, it looks as if Kaby Lake processors, for the most part, can be used under Windows 7, even though there is no official support for the OS. We don't know whether older operating systems will also run on AMD Ryzen CPU, but we'll let you know when the chips are released on the market.

REGULATORY STATUS
INTRODUCTION
Naled is one of a class of insecticides referred to as organophosphates. These chemicals act by interfering with the activities of cholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential for the proper working of the nervous systems of both humans and insects. Please refer to the Toxicology Information Brief on cholinesterase-inhibition for a more detailed description of this topic.
TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS
ACUTE TOXICITY
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath, and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction, and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the eye pupils, tears, salivation, sweating, and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beats, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Death may be caused by respiratory failure or cardiac arrest (9).
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure which may or may not have produced more immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment may remain in some cases (9).
Naled may cause dermatitis (skin rashes) and skin sensitization (allergies) (2, 6). It is corrosive to the skin and eyes and may cause permanent damage (3). An aerial applicator developed contact dermatitis after using Dibrom. The exposed area became red and felt burned. Later, water filled blisters formed. They became itchy and dry, then flaked off (ACGIH TLVS 4th Ed. & Supplement. 1980).
The amount of a chemical that is lethal to one-half (50%) of experimental animals fed the material is referred to as its acute oral lethal dose fifty, or LD50. The oral LD50 for naled in rats is 50 to 281 mg/kg, in mice is 330 to 375 mg/kg, and in chickens is 281 mg/kg (2, 3). Rats have tolerated a dosage of 28 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks with no visible signs of poisoning and with only moderate inhibition of cholinesterase (2). The dermal LD50 for naled in rabbits is 1,100 mg/kg, and in rats is 800 mg/kg (2, 3).
The lethal concentration fifty, or LC50, is that concentration of a chemical in air or water that kills half of the experimental animals exposed to it for a set time period. The inhalation LC50 for naled in rats is 7.7 mg/kg, and 156 mg/kg in mice (9).

Naled is highly toxic to bees (3). Mule deer are more resistant than most wildlife species. The LD50 for naled in mule deer is 200 mg/kg (4).
ENVIRONMENTAL FATE
Breakdown of Chemical in Soil and Groundwater
Naled is not persistent in soil. It is rapidly broken down if wet, and it is moderately volatile (Spencer. Guide to Chem. in Crop Prot. 1982). Soil microorganisms break down most of the naled in the soil.
Breakdown of Chemical in Water
Naled may produce a pollution hazard if dilution water is improperly disposed of, or if run-off from fire control is not properly contained (11).
Breakdown of Chemical in Vegetation
Plants breakdown naled and DDVP is created by the debromination of the naled molecule in a 1:1 relationship. These can be further metabolized or evaporated off (17).
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND GUIDELINES
Naled is stable in anhydrous conditions, but rapidly degrades in the presence of water and by alkali. In water, it can become hydrolyzed with a half-life of 2 days at room temperature (9). Naled should be stored away from moisture. It is corrosive to metals and may attack some forms of plastic, rubber and coatings (8, 9). If it comes in contact with metals, reducing agents, or sulfhydryls, naled may release bromide and revert to dichlorvos (5). It produces highly toxic chloride fumes if it comes in contact with acids or acidic fumes (13).
Persons who work with organo-phosphate materials for long periods of time should have frequent blood tests of their cholinesterase levels. If the cholinesterase level falls below a critical point, no further exposure should be allowed until it returns to normal (10).
Protective clothing must be worn when handling naled. Before removing gloves, wash them with soap and water. Always wash hands, face and arms with soap and water before smoking, eating or drinking.
After work, remove all work clothes and shoes. Shower with soap and water. Wear only clean clothes when leaving the job. Wash contaminated clothing and equipment with soap and water after each use. Keep contaminated work clothes separate from regular laundry.
Exposure Guidelines:
OSHA TWA: 3 mg/m3 (9) ACGIH TWA (skin): 3 mg/m3 (9) NIOSH Recommended TWA (skin): 3 mg/m3 (9)
Physical Properties:
CAS #: 300-76-5 Specific gravity: 1.96 (9) Solubility in water: practically insoluble or insoluble (3, 9) Solubility: Freely soluble in alcohols aromatic solvents.

When considering the historical path of a river, it's easy to imagine a torrential flood that causes a stream to overflow its banks, or a drought that brings a body of water to a trickle. The reality of a river's history is vastly more complex, as the artery of water gradually changes directions over thousands of years, shifting its boundaries imperceptibly inch by inch.
Geologists and cartographers have grappled with helpful ways to visually depict a river's flow over time. In 1941, the Mississippi River Commission appointed Harold Fisk to undertake a groundbreaking effort to map the entire Lower Mississippi Valley. Three years later they produced a stunning series of 15 maps that combine over 20 different river paths obtained through historical charts and aerial photography.
The beautiful map seen here of the Willamette River Historical Stream Channels in Oregon by cartographer Dan Coe also shows the history of a river, however Coe relied on more recent aerial radar technology called lidar. From The Oregonian:
Lidar data is collected by low-, slow-flying aircraft with equipment that shoots millions of laser points to the ground. When the data is studied, an amazingly accurate model of the ground can be mapped. It is possible to strip buildings and vegetation from the images, so that only the ground is shown. In the Willamette River poster, the shades of white and blue show elevations. The purest white color is the baseline, (the zero point, at the lowest point near Independence on the upper part of the image). The darkest blue is 50 feet (or higher) than the baseline. The shades of white show changes in elevation, between 0 to 50 feet. This brings out the changes made by the river channel in the last 12,000 to 15,000 years, in the time since the landscape was basically swept clean by the Missoula floods.
The map is usually available as a print through the Nature of the Northwest Information Center, however the site appears to be down at the moment. (via Feltron, The Oregonian)
It turns out the United States isn't the only country in the middle of a heated debate about same-same marriage.
On June 15, thousands of people marched through the center of Croatia's capital, Zagreb, in celebration of Gay Pride and in support of same-sex marriage. It was the largest LGBT march in the country's history, drawing an estimated 12,000 participants, including the country's Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister's wife.
One day earlier Croatia's parliament received a petition signed by approximately 740,000 people opposing same-sex marriage. That's nearly one-fifth of the country's population. The signatures were gathered by the Catholic Church-backed group, In the Name of the Family, who allegedly wrangled 6,000 volunteers to canvas in more than 2,000 locations across the country.
Currently, there is no specific definition of marriage in Croatia's constitution. Though the country has never had an official same-sex marriage, conservative activists are seeking to block the possibility by requesting a referendum defining marriage as a “life-long union of a woman and a man.”
In Croatia, couples who have been living together for three or more years are considered unregistered cohabitants. This title grants them limited rights and responsibilities.
The government recently announced that they were preparing a law that would enable same-sex couples to register as “life partners,” which would allow them more rights. This is what led to the push-back from In the Name of the Family and other conservatives.
The dispute has divided Croatia just weeks before it is set to become the 28th member of the European Union. The country has taken many strides to improve gay rights in recent years, but issues like same-sex marriage remain highly sensitive in the predominantly Catholic nation.
The parliament is now required by law to review the petition, but it has no deadline for doing so.
Gay rights activists and human rights groups in Croatia have criticized the referendum initiative, calling it homophobic and requesting the government block the move. They also alleged that In the Name of the Family bullied people into signing the petition, telling them that if they wanted to be married in a church, or have their child baptized or attend a Catholic school, they must support the referendum.
Hmmm… Last we checked blackmail wasn't on the list of Catholic values.

Carson City Chief Deputy Clerk Aubrey Rowlatt is running for the office of Carson City County Clerk-Recorder in 2018.
Rowlatt has served as the chief deputy clerk for Carson City since 2015 and assisted in two legislative sessions, researching and testifying on proposed legislation on behalf of the Clerk's Marriage, Notary and Election departments.
Prior to that, they served as deputy recorder for Douglas County.
Rowlatt said their primary objective is to maintain the integrity of the department fostered by Alan Glover and Sue Merriwether.
They were instrumental in acquiring new voting equipment for the city.
"During the 2016 election cycle we heard from many constituents regarding their concerns and wishes to vote on a paper ballot," Rowlatt said. "Sue and I researched the two different types of voting equipment certified in Nevada and determined the ExpressVoteBallot Marking Device was the best fit for Carson City. This voting system will provide a paper ballot that voters will use to verify their electronically marked touch screen selections, simplifying the voting experience."

Rowlatt will lead the training for election workers and staff on the new equipment as well as manage an open house for the public on the new voting system.
Merriwether said they will not seek re-election and supports Rowlatt's bid for their position.
"Aubrey has been training closely with me for the past two years," Merriwether said. "She has a thorough industrial knowledge of the responsibilities and challenges of the office and the experience to perform the duties of this position. I feel confident they are the best candidate."
Share. Arkham Origins wants you to become a free-flow combat black belt. Arkham Origins wants you to become a free-flow combat black belt.
During a recent Batman: Arkham Origins demo in New York City, I often felt as though I was receiving a pre-fight pep talk rather than a gameplay preview. “It's not enough to just mash the buttons and counter once in a while…we want you to be doing quick-fire gadgets, dodges, grapples, slams, the works; we want you to be getting 50-60 hit combos.” began Ben Mattes, senior producer of the franchise's forthcoming prequel chapter.
Exit Theatre Mode
While the enthusiastic developer made me feel like a pressured prizefighter before a big bout, they were really just trying to prepare me for the title's fresh take on the series' satisfying free-flow combat system. As in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, the brawling mechanics will still yield the same rewarding rhythm fans felt when clearing rooms of foes by carefully balancing attacks, counters, dodges, and cape-stuns. Rocksteady Studios' dynamic duo pulled off what no previous Bat-games had—they actually made players feel as badass as Batman—and WB Games Montreal isn't about to mess with that successful formula.
That said, the new studio wishes to evolve the tried-and-true mechanics while also putting its own mark on the series. Mattes and gameplay director Michael McIntyre believe this means not just training players to be good at combat, but making them black belts. “We've created specific, memorable challenges that force them to be good at things in order to progress. They really focus on challenging core skills, slowly inching players toward becoming much better at the game.” explained McIntyre.
These so-called challenges conveniently tie into Origins' prequel tale. As Mattes described, Batman is at their best when the game begins. “It's year two. They know how to fight, he's got the suit, he's donned the cowl, they go out at night and they beat up bad guys. But generally speaking, it's organized crime—pimps, drug dealers, gang members. No one has thrown anything more challenging at them than a shotgun. That's all going to change the night that our game takes place.”
Exit Theatre Mode
The impetus of the change Mattes refers to is a 50 million dollar bounty put on the Bat by main antagonist Black Mask. Not only does this hefty reward for the hero's head attract eight of the DC Universe's top assassins—including Bane, Firefly, Copperhead, and Deathstroke—it also provides the developers with the narrative opening that allows Origins to, as Mattes put it, ”Train players to be good at being Batman.”
As with previous Arkham entries, Origins will pit Bat fans against tough odds, playing fast and loose with the free-flow combat system until large groups of foes are whittled down to one whimpering bad guy. This time around, however, these multi-thug showdowns will serve as mere warm-ups to mano-a-mano boss battles with assassins that are as well-trained as Batman. Sure, the series has seen its share of epic encounters with the biggest bads from DC's rogues' gallery, but previous melees with madmen like Mr. Freeze and the Joker have been more story-pushing, cinematic set pieces than thumb-blistering battles.
Boss fights are common to the franchise, but, as Mattes explained, encounters against single enemies who are as hyper-focused on free-flow combat as Batman are new . Each of these dedicated showdowns will focus on a specific aspect of free-flow fisticuffs, forcing players to master it if they wish to progress.
I got a taste of this tough-love approach during one of the game's early assassin battles against Deathstroke. With a PS3 controller clutched in my mitts, Mattes peered over my shoulder and returns to rally mode to remind me the one-eyed merc isn't another “guy with a gun” and that glorified button-mashing won't cut it. “Deathstroke is an augmented, incredibly capable hand-to-hand melee fighter with access to great weaponry and technology. He's incredibly vicious, willing to kill, and has all the capabilities of Batman but none of the inhibitions.”
Using a metal staff, smoke bombs, and a grapple gun that occasionally snatches an exploding barrel to collide with Batman's chest, Deathstroke easily lived up to the reputation Mattes painted for him. It was also clear I was on the receiving end of an ass-whuppin' designed to teach me how to counter at just the right moment. In fact, countering too often—or too early—actually saw Deathstroke stealing the sort of in-the-zone momentum I've grown accustomed to enjoying from behind Batman's fists.
Exit Theatre Mode
After two attempts—both of which saw me barely bring Deathsroke's health bar to the halfway point—Mattes pointed out that I shouldn't spam the counter button, nor should I try stunning them with my cape. Unlike the dumb bunnies polluting Gotham's streets, Deathstroke's apparently immune to such parlor tricks. With feedback doled out, Mattes took the controller and showed me how it's done. In defense of my failed attempts to make Deathstroke cry uncle, however, it took Mattes several minutes—including a few close calls—to bring the gun-for-hire down. When they finally did, though, their persistence and skills were rewarded with Deathstroke's grapple gadget, now rechristened as the Remote Batclaw.
On top of incentivizing these focused fights with cool loot, Origins introduces a new WayneTech upgrade system that provides plenty of tools—like detailed tutorial videos—for those who consistently find themselves slumped on the floor shortly after meeting assassins. While the developers really want players to be judicious in their use of attacking versus countering versus gadget use, they're not just throwing them into the deep end without a utility belt. On top of WayneTech's teaching tools, the game's story-driven pacing promises to progress players in a way that trains them to be a badass without obvious hand-holding or frustrating trial-and-error. It's a tough balance, but one the developers are confident they've nailed.
Exit Theatre Mode
My biggest takeaway was that these dedicated, combat-focused encounters felt like nothing I'd experienced in previous Arkham games, but more like the sort of multi-tiered boss battles I'd faced in the Metal Gear Solid series. More specifically, I hadn't felt that focused or committed to a one-on-one battle since taking on Metal Gear Rising's more punishing creeps.
I walked away from Origins after being defeated by Deathstroke only twice; whether or not I will ultimately experience the same controller-chucking frustration that followed Raiden's more soul-crushing defeats remains to be seen. My rematch can't come soon enough.

Michelangelo's God gave birth to the heavens in the Sistine Chapel's "Creation of the Sun and Moon." Alabama head football coach Nick Saban led the Crimson Tide to its 13th national championship. In Alabama, Saban has more Facebook fans than God, according to Fan Page Analytics, an independent, automated analysis by Los Angeles computer programmer Pete Warden that ranks fan page popularity by city, state and country. (Birmingham News file) Michelangelo's God gave birth to the heavens in the Sistine Chapel's "Creation of the Sun and Moon." Alabama head football coach Nick Saban led the Crimson Tide to its 13th national championship. In Alabama, Saban has more Facebook fans than God, according to Fan Page Analytics, an independent, automated analysis by Los Angeles computer programmer Pete Warden that ranks fan page popularity by city, state and country. (Birmingham News file)
Nick Saban may not be bigger than God in Alabama, but they have more fans on Facebook.
The all-powerful football coach edged out the all-powerful deity to claim the top spot in a ranking of Facebook fan page membership in the state. The omnipotent one -- God, not Saban -- did manage to finish ahead of Starbucks, Rick and Bubba and Chick-fil-A.
The Fan Page Analytics ranking is part of an independent, automated analysis of fan pages on the popular social networking site. Created by a Boulder, Colo., computer programmer, the new system ranks fan page popularity by city, state and country and shows how Facebook users connect with people around the world.
The programmer behind the analysis, Pete Warden, said Friday that the concept of "fanning," or joining what amount to online fan clubs, is just more common in sports than in faith, "so I'm not too surprised that coaches beat out God."
But in their blog they noted that God is "almost always in the top spot" in the South, with some exceptions. Oklahomans picked the Sooners first and God third, for example, and Florida favored Starbucks over the Almighty. Urban Meyer didn't even make Florida's list.
Stephen Jones, senior pastor at Birmingham's Southside Baptist Church, said they were surprised to learn Saban edged out God for the top spot in Alabama. But not terribly surprised.
"If the Blessed Virgin Mary was going to appear in a field in Alabama, and Nick Saban was going to appear, who do you think would draw the most people?" they said.
The Crimson Tide faithful is certain to revel in the quirky ranking, but shouldn't get too full of themselves, Jones said. God is certain to be angered by their second-place finish to Saban, and there will be consequences.
"Alabama fans should expect a bad year," said Jones, a 1977 graduate of Auburn University.
CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Two protests that joined together moved through the city of Cincinnati after the mistrial in the Ray Tensing murder trial. While officers were very visible throughout the protests, others were not and that is credited with keeping the protests peaceful.
"We came out shining as a city that protects first amendment rights to protest but keeps the peace and safety of the city. We have too much progress in our city to see it lost," said Mayor John Cranley.
It took months of planning, practice, and past experience for Cincinnati Police to allow protesters to have a voice, and keep the peace at the same time.
City leaders think other cities are looking at Cincinnati Police strategy that put bike officers on the front lines.
Two protests became one on Saturday. Anti-Trump demonstrators merged with protesters in front of the courthouse, demanding a new trial for former U.C. cop Ray Tensing after their murder trial ended in a mistrial.
City leaders and police met with community leaders for months about what might happen on verdict day. Things had gone bad during anti-Trump protests in some other cities. "No intent to disrupt or break up the crowd keep the crowds safe but let voices be heard," said Pastor Ennis Tait.
"Our police department (is the) best in the business. They were looking at the best practices around the country and seeing where other cities lost control of crowds."
In many cities, police wear riot gear for protests, almost asking for a challenge. Now look at Cincinnati Police on Saturday. Bike cops rode with protesters, encouraging them to stay on the sidewalk. Then they created a sort of bike rack to keep them from moving onto the freeway. "With a healthy respect for the need to bend but not break mentality, giving people some space to express themselves but making it clear we have a responsibility to protect people and property," according to city manager Harry Black.
Blocks away, just in case, the Civil Disturbance Response Team was on a Metro bus, ready to move in if necessary. It never was necessary. "You can maximize presence without coming at it in a real hard way."
Only one protester was arrested Saturday. Police say a man threw themselves onto an occupied car on Fifth Street. Officers didn't arrest them until the protest reached Washington Park. They were able to pull them out of the crowd, without drawing attention to the arrest.
Protesters seemed to want peace, as well. It seems in Cincinnati, no one wanted to repeat the riots of 2001 after the police killing of an unarmed black man. On Saturday, the feeling seemed to be that we've come too far to go back.
There is another anti-Trump rally scheduled Nov. 19. Prosecutor Joe Deters hasn't said if there will be another Tensing trial.

No one said that this was confidential. Why should it be? Everyone knows that Ulbricht is facing criminal charges, and their (alleged) altoid account and postings were mentioned in the initial FBI report.
It's interesting to note that altoid's the most damning posts only exist as quotes. They deleted the posts before I changed the forum settings to archive all deleted posts. So I don't think that this evidence is very strong, though I'm sure that this is far from the only piece of evidence that will be presented against Ulbricht.

Everyone knows that Ulbricht is facing criminal charges, and their (alleged) altoid account and postings were mentioned in the initial FBI report.It's interesting to note that altoid's the most damning posts only exist as quotes. They deleted the posts before I changed the forum settings to archive all deleted posts. So I don't think that this evidence is very strong, though I'm sure that this is far from the only piece of evidence that will be presented against Ulbricht.Email.

Are you able to disclose specifically what was requested (e.g. a copy of the subpoena) and/or specifically what was provided (a copy of your response)?

Quote from: teppy on December 08, 2010, 01:03:42 AM The original idea was one where all transactions are conducted over a website only accessible via Tor. This part has been viable for years - it's always the money part that makes it risky for both the seller and the buyer.
The parts involving mail and double-sending drugs are ways to make the business scale, and make it work globally. They give plausible deniability to those receiving drugs.
I see lots of comments in this thread that "it would never work" and "the feds will come after you", but nothing detailing a specific way that they would detect who was mailing the drugs or running the business. The closest anyone came was Babylon, who suggested that the police might stake out all mailboxes in the area the packages came from, but that 's easily diffused: Locating the business in New York City, with 100k(?) public mailboxes would do the trick, or using common packaging like business envelopes.
(And to those that don't understand the concept of a thought experiment: No, I'm not actually planning to start a heroin store.)

I'd say it sets a good precedent. It's nice to know when justice is happening, even if we don't know why in this case.
Even though this is a private forum, it still has to obey laws. I find that comforting.

This is an abominable precedent. When the subpoena arrives, the subpoena should go up. Not to mention that this thread was born well after the prosecution's discovery should have been submitted to the defense in the Ulbricht case.
Maybe this is the first time Theymos experienced a formal subpoena, but I have trouble believing that this is the first time they experienced a law enforcement inquiry.

A March 7, 2012 photo provided by Sammut Tech, LLC, shows the Ramos alarm clock. Inventor Paul Sammut designed the clock that forces its owner to get out of bed after they found it hard to get out of bed after college. Once the alarm goes off, to stop it one must get out of bed, go into the kitchen or bathroom, and punch the day's date into a telephone-style keypad. (AP Photo/Sammut Tech, LLC,, Paul Sammut)
HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) — There is no snooze button. If you unplug it, a battery takes over. As wake-up time approaches, you cannot reset the alarm time.
It could be the world's most exasperating alarm clock.
Once it goes off, to stop it you must get out of bed, go into the kitchen or bathroom, and punch the day's date into a telephone-style keypad. That's the only way to stop the loud 'ding-ding,' designed to sound like a customer angrily banging on a concierge bell at a hotel.
It was invented by Paul Sammut, a 25-year-old engineer who lives in Hoboken. During the day, they build and researches underwater robots and vehicles at the nearby Stevens Institute of Technology.
They started working on the gadget because they were finding it hard to get up and make it to work on time after college.
"I wanted to make something that would essentially force me to get out of bed when I wanted to get out of bed the night before," said Sammut. "And I was thinking about ways of doing it and I thought about how in high school I had the perfect solution to this, which was my mother, and how they would, if it was time for me to wake up, they would force me out of bed."
They built the prototype in their spare time and uses it every day.
"Now I wake up before it goes off," said Sammut. "I subconsciously fear it and know I have to get up."
After a friend suggested they try and sell the device, they made a video demonstrating it, and posted that on kickstarter.com. That's a website where the general public can support creative ideas by investing in them financially.
"We raised over $150,000 over a month and a half and we currently have over 400 orders," said Sammut.
Sammut has formed a company and is now trying to fill all the clock orders by the end of the summer.
They acknowledge there is one way to stop the alarm without getting out of bed.
"You could smash it," said Sammut.
But with a $350 price tag, that would be a really expensive way to sleep in.

TOKYO (AP) — Toyota plans to offer more than 10 purely electric vehicle models in its lineup by the early 2020s, marking the Japanese automaker's commitment to that growing technology sector.
Toyota Motor Corp. now offers no purely electric vehicles, although it leads in hybrid models, which switch between an electric motor and a gas engine.
Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said Monday that Toyota's EVs will be first offered in China, a nation that's encouraging electric vehicles with subsidies and other policies, and is expected to drive massive growth in that technology.
Terashi says Toyota's EVs will also later be offered in Japan, India, the U.S. and Europe.
The company says that by about 2025, every model it sells will have some kind of “electrified” version, such as hybrid, electric or fuel-cell.
Last week, Toyota announced it will set up a joint auto battery business with Japanese electronics maker Panasonic Corp. Terashi stressed the deal with Panasonic is “a crucial piece” in Toyota's strategy, and that it wanted to promote a Japanese partnership.
Advances in battery technology are vital for the success of EVs. A major shift toward their use would require more use and recycling of the rare and expensive materials used in batteries, such as lithium.
Toyota announced other goals on green vehicles. By about 2030, it hopes to sell 5.5 million electrified vehicles a year. Toyota sells about 10 million vehicles globally a year.
The company said it will invest 1.5 trillion yen ($13 billion) to realize its 2030 goal, more than half of it on making batteries.
Other automakers, including Nissan Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co., offer or are working on electric vehicles. That means competition among battery makers is heating up. It is unclear whether Panasonic will emerge the victor in the race.
Toyota has generally sought to develop key technologies in-house, rather than purchasing them from outsiders. That includes knowhow for computer chips and robotics, which are also expected to be pillars of growth for the auto sector in coming years.

Drawing inspiration from its predecessors, the Microsoft Classic Intellimouse is a new generation of ergonomic mouse that has a refined, understated look and reasonable specifications. It's evolved from the previous versions and features modern additions like a little bit of lighting and upgraded sensitivity.
The Microsoft Classic Intellimouse features a grey shell with some black accenting and has a large main body panel that tapers into two separate buttons for left and right clicks. It has five buttons in total, three of which are customizable — though that feature is said to not be available to those running Windows 10 S. Its ergonomic shell should cater more to palm and finger grippers than claw-style grips.
The sensor is an optical one, though it's been bumped up to 3,200 dots per inch (DPI). That's not adjustable, however, so don't expect to drop into “sniper mode” in your next game with this rodent at your fingertips. (Have you considered a real gaming mouse?) It does support a polling rate of 1,000Hz though, so this should be quite a responsive mouse. It also features Microsoft's BlueTrack technology, meaning it can work flawlessly on glass mousemats and surfaces.
The overall design of the mouse is quite understated, with no dash of color or flair beyond the smooth layout of the black and grey paint job. Microsoft has included a little lighting at the rear, however. Called a “tail light,” it's not customizable and is merely a little white accent for the overall design.
This is a wired mouse, so there are no batteries or docks to worry about; it connects to your system over a USB 2.0 cable.
The Microsoft Intellimouse Classic is now available on the Microsoft store with a list price of $40 plus shipping. If you're an active student or member of staff at a university or faculty though, you can secure a small discount to get one of these new Intellimouse mice for $36 instead.
In a recent article in the Ottawa Citizen, there were details about Canadian Army equipment that had been declared surplus and was either being destroyed or sold off.
Included among that equipment were the TOW 2 missiles and related systems purchased by the Army around 2009 for $100 million.
According to documents obtained by the Citizen, the stocks included 592 TOW 2 (analog) missiles, 897 TOW 2 (digital) missiles and 662 TOW 2B (top attack missiles).
The problem was that no one at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa could readily say for certain what happened to the weapons. The thought was that they were sold but no one had any details.
Now Department of National Defence spokesperson Dan Blouin has come back with the answer. They say the U.S. Marines purchased all of Canada's TOW 2 missiles. There were no details on the price the Marines paid.
But sources tell the Citizen the Marines got a real deal, picking up the weapons for a fraction of the $100 million price.
The Canadian Army decided to get rid of the TOW missiles after they were required by the Harper government to find cost-savings.
Defence Watch, Ottawa Citizen
PARIS (Reuters)- Seventy European Muslim and Jewish leaders pledged on Wednesday to show “zero tolerance” to hate preachers of any faith including their own ranks, citing what they called rising religious intolerance on the continent.
Imams, rabbis and community leaders from 18 countries agreed to jointly counter bigotry against Jews and Muslims and combat legal threats to common religious practices such as circumcision of boys and the kosher and halal ritual slaughter of animals.
The two-day meeting brought together Muslim-Jewish teams from around Europe to compare experiences in fighting religious prejudice and report on recent trends against minority faiths.
There have been several attacks on Jews in Europe this year, some from radical Muslims. In the worst case, a French Islamist killed a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school in Toulouse last March.
Extreme right-wing political parties are also increasingly agitating against Jews and Muslims, participants in the meeting said.
“We must institute a ‘zero tolerance' policy against religious leaders of any faith who misuse their pulpits to incite religious bigotry,” they said in a declaration.
“We vow to each other to speak out loudly and forcefully against any religious leader who defames those of other faiths, and, if such bigots emerge from within our own communities, to condemn them loudly and clearly.”
REAL COOPERATION
Among the organizers was the New York-based Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, whose co-founder Rabbi Marc Schneier has promoted Muslim-Jewish unity projects in the United States.
Schneier told Reuters that European Muslims and Jews had come together more this year to defend their common interest in protecting religious traditions from legal challenges.
That was not enough, they said: “Real cooperation is when you stand up for others even when it's not in your common interest.”
Participants gave examples in their countries of interfaith harmony as well as tension, especially that arising from radical Islamism that has spread among some disaffected Muslim youths.
From Britain, Fiyaz Mughal of the non-profit group Faith Matters and Jewish Volunteering Network official Esmond Rosen presented a booklet on Muslims who saved Jews in the Holocaust.
Mughal accused far-right groups in Britain of trying to provoke anti-Semitism among Muslims, especially on the Internet. “A lot of these issues are happening online,” they said. “This is where the real battle is.”
Rabbi Michel Serfaty and Scheherazade Zerouala told how their French Judeo-Muslim Friendship group made bus tours around France to promote understanding in poor neighborhoods where the two minorities often live side-by-side and sometimes clash.
Noting that a rabbi had recently been attacked in Berlin, the secretary general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany said imams must condemn anti-Semitism among Muslims.
“We also have anti-Muslim sentiment among Jews, as we saw in the beating of a Palestinian by Jewish children in Israel,” Stephan Kramer added. “We are condemning these acts strongly.”
ATTACKS RISE IN FRANCE
Moussa Diaw Al-Hassan, coordinator of Islamic studies at Osnabrueck University in Germany, said their program helped future imams analyze YouTube videos of hardline Salafi preachers who appeal to some alienated young Muslims in Germany.
“It's important to teach imams how to detect this radical version of Islam,” they said.
Toulouse Chief Rabbi Harald Weill regretted that no local Muslim leader contacted them to condemn the murders at the Jewish school there last March, but they did not want to give up hope.
“I came here today to say that, contrary to a large part of my community, I think there is a possibility that we can walk hand in hand,” the Orthodox rabbi said.
Both Muslim and Jewish leaders in France say hostile acts and attitudes have spread in the wake of the Toulouse killings.
Muslim community leaders have registered a 15 percent rise in anti-Muslim acts in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2011. Jewish observers say anti-Semitic attacks and acts of intimidation have risen 37 percent over the same period.
At least three of Auburn's 15 early signees will have a chance to see the field immediately as freshmen.
Defensive backs Quindarious Monday, Jamien Sherwood and Christian Tutt will all be factors in the Tigers' secondary in 2018, according to coach Gus Malzahn.
"There's no doubt," Malzahn said. "We recruited -- you see the guys we're losing in our two senior safeties. We're recruiting those guys to come in and help us, and they know it, and they all three have a skillset that they can."
Auburn loses four senior safeties after this season, including starters Tray Matthews and Stephen Roberts, and could potentially lose junior starting cornerback Carlton Davis to the NFL Draft. That leaves a preponderance of production, and experience, to replace on the back end of the defense for next season, particularly at safety, where the Tigers also lose Nick Ruffin and Jason Smith.
The only returning players with experience at safety next season are Daniel Thomas, Jordyn Peters and Jeremiah Dinson, though Dinson has mostly played at nickel. That's where Sherwood and Monday could step in.
Monday, a four-star recruit, is rated as the No. 7 athlete in the 2018 class and said on Sunday that they hope to be able to compete for a starting job at safety as a first-year student. The 6-foot-3, 190-pounder out of Atlanta is a hard-hitting safety who could, at worst, be a backup next season.
Malzahn believes Monday has a high ceiling and said Wednesday that they will "probably play in the NFL."
"Smoke Monday is a tall, rangy guy, a defensive back," Malzahn said. "We think they can play corner, can play safety. They really plays with an edge and has a great personality. We're very excited about him."
Sherwood, also a four-star prospect, is rated as the No. 20 safety in the nation. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Sherwood gives Auburn another long, rangy option in the secondary. The Jensen Beach, Fla. Native will share the title as the Tigers' tallest defensive back next season with cornerback Jamel Dean, and they will surely add on some weight by the time fall rolls around.
"Jamien Sherwood, the defensive back, a big, athletic guy," Malzahn said. "He's 6-2, around 200. They played offense, played defense. I know a lot of schools were recruiting them to play offense. He's got that ability. I'm very excited about Jamien."
Those two will provide immediate relief at safety, while Tutt could crack the depth chart at cornerback and help supply more depth at the position next season.
Tutt, a 5-foot-11, 195-pounder out of Thomson, Ga., is another four-star prospect who is regarded as the No. 25 cornerback in the country. The U.S. Army All-American brings an "edge" to the position that excites Malzahn and defensive backs coach Greg Brown.
"He's got really good ball skills," Malzahn said. "He's a very good returner. What really stands out to me is their competitiveness. I'm very excited about him."
All three of those first-year student defensive backs will go through spring practices, while Monday and Tutt are already on campus and participated in Auburn's bowl practices this week.
"The great thing is that all three are going to be here early and they'll go through spring," Malzahn said. "I just think that is very, very valuable."

The XA-38 was a developmental twin-engine heavy fighter produced by the Beech Aircraft firm. By all accounts, they were a stable and fast aircraft comparable to even the single engine speedsters of their day. As promising as their design was, their potential was never realized as the engines slated for the type were reserved for the four-engined Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers taking precedence. As such, only two XA-38 prototypes were ever built with the project ultimately shelved at the end of the war. Should they have flown in quantity, they might have presented the Empire of Japan with a formidable adversary capable of engaging tanks, vehicles, ships and submarines with equal - and lethal - fervor.
The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF - forerunner to the United States Air Force) entered into a contractual agreement with Beech Aircraft in December of 1942 after considering the company's Beechcraft Model 28 system. The contract called for two initial prototypes to be built as the XA-38 to fulfill a requirement that involved replacing the Douglas A-20 Havocs then in service. This new aircraft would have to exceed in all areas the A-20 excelled at wile making for one truly potent ground attack component vital to eliminating the dug-in Japanese foes throughout the Pacific Theater. The A-20, itself, had its origins in 1939 design and was introduced into operational service in 1941. Its armament and light bombing capabilities allowed the Havoc to make a name for itself in the early years of the war, eventually being fielded by the United States, French, British and Soviet forces. Production of the type finally ended on September 20th, 1944 and a need for its replacement was inevitable. The XA-38 achieved first flight on May 7th, 1944 with Beech test pilot Vern Carstens at the controls, launching from the Beech Aircraft airfield in Wichita, Kansas. It was then flown to Elgin Field in Florida to undergo testing with the US Army.
Design of the XA-38 centered around the large 75mm cannon armament mounted in the nose. The cannon was positioned as such that the barrel protruded from the nose cone assembly of the clean all-metal airframe. The fuselage was of a conventional design featuring a forward cockpit area and a rear gunner station and fit together as four main sections for ease of maintenance and repairs. Wings were mid-mounted monoplane assemblies (based on the airfoil of the NACA-2300 series) joining the fuselage to each side of the cockpit and designed with a heated leading edge and surfaces to prevent ice from forming at higher altitudes. On the wings were fitted twin Wright R-3350-53 series air-cooled radial piston engines capable of delivering an astounding 2,700 horsepower each while driving three-bladed, constant speed Hamilton Standard propellers. Cooling was provided for through specially-designed circular cowlings and controlled via automatic flaps. The engine nacelles were fitted to the wing leading edges and protruded some, nearly to the extension length of the fuselage nose. The empennage was conventional and featured a horizontal tailplane with two vertical tail fins. The undercarriage was a typical "tail dragger", with two forward single-wheeled landing gears and a single-wheeled tail system - all fully retractable via hydraulics with a backup pneumatic emergency system. Crew accommodations amounted to the pilot and a gunner housed under in separate glazed canopies. The gunner sat in a dorsal position on the empennage.
Captain's Log - It's been countless hours since I first started my mission of delivering sensitive information to the Federation in order to combat the rebel scum. This is not my first attempt, nor will it likely be my last; captaining a ship is a full-time job, and often comes with a side-effect of fiery explosions, death and addiction to this fun game.
FTL: Faster Than Light is a roguelike game with a heavy dose of real-time-strategy and spaceship-to-spaceship combat simulation. The goal is to progress through large distances of space, answering distress calls and fighting pirates while gathering scrap to upgrade your systems and acquire new weapons. The end goal is to make it back to the Federation before the Rebels catch up to you (and they are constantly on your tail) to deliver data that could change the war. You start with a ragtag crew of three and a simple ship equipped with basic weapons, shield and subsystems (such as life support and engines). Send a crew member to man a certain station and enjoy a boost to its productivity while they gain skill at that system over time. It's important to decide who does what at the beginning, because some stations are more useful than others and you'll rarely have enough crewmembers to man them all.
A very hectic space battle.
Space battles make up a majority of the game. When you jump into a sector and find a hostile ship, you need to charge up your weapons and start a volley of lasers, beams and missiles in an attempt to knock out key systems and eventually destroy the hull. If a system takes a direct hit, it becomes inoperable until repaired. This creates a great atmosphere of tension when your life support is knocked out while in the heat of battle; either let your oxygen vent into space until the battle is over or send a crew member away from their post to deal with the damage. Some hits will cause hull breaches or fires to break out and spread quickly as they tear through your system rooms, forcing you to think quickly and manually open airlocks in a labyrinth pattern to vent the oxygen and kill the fires. Even more dangerous than a fire is a boarding party knocking on your door; throughout the game you can get anywhere from one to four intruders that you must fight hand-to-hand, or lock them in a room and vent out their oxygen if you have upgraded doors. Either way, they distract you from the battle at by hand pulling all crew members from their post and destroying some key systems.
You need to make risky decisions constantly.
Some sectors offer text-based optional missions you can tackle to try and collect some extra loot. Some decisions will randomly result in rewards, while others end in a battle, damage or crew death. The challenge comes in constantly being wary of risking life, limb and ship too often, lest you lose the chance to spend your reward. Some sectors will take you to a dangerous environment: too close to a sun that randomly starts fires, a nebula that leaves you blind or an asteroid field that slowly picks at your ship. If you run into a battle that gets the best of you, kiss your ship and crew goodbye. There are no second chances and all deaths are permanent; back to the start with you.
Tactics and strategies will vary between players, as there are constantly new ways to play. Some prefer the defensive approach and upgrade shields while others prefer going fully loaded with weapons. It is also the key moments in the heat of battle that define a great captain. Decide to divert power away from life support to power the engines in order to make an emergency jump may be what saves your ship or kills your crew. The customization of the decisions on what to upgrade and how to use the systems give the game, that runs in a simple, non-taxing window, a deep and satisfying feeling. This is what makes the game addicting; this is what hits a nerve as a sci-fi lover.
Tons of ships and configurations
There are tons of ships to unlock and two layouts per ship that you can choose from when you complete some achievements. There are different races of aliens that have differing abilities, such as better fighting, resistant to fire or a boost to the repair rate. Finding a mix of these aliens along your journey is a great way to get an upper-hand in some dangerous situations.
Each game can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour, depending on your luck and skill. Since each map and sector is randomly generated, each game is different and that really helps make the game replayable. I hope to see the guys at Subset Games continue to support FTL since their Kickstarter campaign was such a huge success, and while I am having endless amounts of fun playing it alone, I think a simple online ship vs. ship mode or some sort of cooperative mode would be a fantastic addition. Even a spectator mode would do wonders; I would love to watch my friends play and offer some support and advice. Luckily Twitch.tv exists, so you can watch some people stream FTL there. I think they really struck a chord with a niche gaming audience, and I can't wait to see where Subset Games goes from here.
How 99% of games end, in pieces
All in all, this game is a fantastic addition to any sci-fi lover's game queuem and at $10 it's a great bargain for the amount of time and fun you get out of it. I highly recommend you start playing by running through the tutorial, though even then it will probably take a couple times to fully grasp it entirely. Fans have started a Wiki for the game to explain some aspects that are still unclear. It's unforgiving and can be frustrating when it feels like the entire galaxy is bearing down on you at the exact same time, but honestly, that is one of the most fun parts of the game. It sucks to lose everything you've built up in one blast of a laser, but the gameplay is enjoyable enough that you often just want to get back in because you know you could have done better. It's a game that leaves you needing to come back for more every time you walk away, just aching to get back out to the black (it also makes you want to go watch Firefly).
You can find it on Steam and GOG.com. Both offer 10 percent off until September 21!
Dragon Age 2 bug fixes on the way BioWare is working on fixes to a few bugs in Dragon Age 2, including DirectX 11 compatibility issues and an auto-attack command glitch on consoles.
BioWare is working on fixes to a few bugs in the console and PC versions of Dragon Age 2, reports Eurogamer. Lead designer Mike Laidlaw detailed the two biggest bugs,which they say the team is "aggressively patching."
The first bug is a compatibility issue with DirectX 11. They suggest that if you're seeing stuttering or slowdown, you should move the renderer down to DirectX 9 until the patch arrives to fix the issue. "We're working with NVIDIA/AMD to make sure patches are coming out, because some of it is actually the driver compatibility," they said.
The second bug only impacts consoles. Apparently the option to turn on auto-attack exists in the game, but it's invisible in the menu. To attack one target continuously, players need to keep tapping a button, or find the auto-attack order in the radial menu. But selecting it that way "wasn't the intent for the core gameplay" according to Laidlaw.
The PC patch will most likely hit as soon as BioWare can properly test it, but the console versions need to pass by certification. "I can't really speak to time-frame because obviously they need to go through the quality assurance of Sony and Microsoft to make sure that they're up to their standards and so on," they said. "So that creates a little bit more delay than we'd hoped for."

Sentences Vary When Kids Die in Hot Cars
By ALLEN G. BREED 07.28.07, 12:02 PM ET
MANASSAS, Va. - Kevin Kelly is a law-abiding citizen who, much distracted, left their beloved 21-month-old daughter in a sweltering van for seven hours.
Frances Kelly had probably been dead for more than four hours by the time a neighbor noticed them strapped in their car seat; when rescue personnel removed the girl from the vehicle, their skin was red and blistered, their fine, carrot-colored hair matted with sweat. Two hours later, their body temperature was still nearly 106 degrees.
What is the appropriate punishment for a doting parent responsible for their child's death? A judge eventually spared Kelly a lengthy term in prison. Still, it is a question that is asked dozens of times each year.
Since the mid-1990s, the number of children who died of heat exhaustion while trapped inside vehicles has risen dramatically, totaling around 340 in the past 10 years. Ironically, one reason was a change parent-drivers made to protect their kids after juvenile air-bag deaths peaked in 1995 - they put them in the back seat, where they are more easily forgotten.
An Associated Press analysis of more than 310 fatal incidents in the past 10 years found that prosecutions and penalties vary widely, depending in many cases on where the death occurred and who left the child to die - parent or caregiver, mother or father:
-Mothers are treated much more harshly than fathers. While mothers and fathers are charged and convicted at about the same rates, moms are 26 percent more likely to do time. And their median sentence is two years longer than the terms received by dads.
-Day care workers and other paid baby sitters are more likely than parents to be charged and convicted. But they are jailed less frequently than parents, and for less than half the time.
-Charges are filed in half of all cases - even when a child was left unintentionally.
In all, the AP analyzed 339 fatalities involving more than 350 responsible parties. July is by far the deadliest month, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total.
A relatively small number of cases - about 7 percent - involved drugs or alcohol. In a few instances, the responsible parties had a history of abusing or neglecting children. Still others were single parents unable to find or afford day care.
Many cases involved what might be called community pillars: dentists and nurses; ministers and college professors; a concert violinist; a member of a county social services board; a NASA engineer. And it is undisputed that none - or almost none - intended to harm these children.
"When you look at overall who this is happening to, it's some very, very, very good parents - might I say, doting parents," says Janette Fennell, founder and president of Kids and Cars, a nonprofit group that tracks child deaths and injuries in and around automobiles.
"But no one thinks it's going to happen to them. I think people are lying if they say that there wasn't one situation in raising their child that, `There but for the grace of God go I.'"
The AP's analysis was based largely on a database of fatal hyperthermia cases compiled by Fennell's organization. The AP contacted medical examiner's offices in several states where this most often occurs, and the group's numbers coincided almost exactly with recorded hyperthermia deaths.
Some of these children crawled into cars or trunks on their own, but most were left to die by a caregiver. Most often, it was a parent who simply forgot the child was inside.
Texas leads the nation with at least 41 deaths, followed by Florida with 37, California with 32, North Carolina and Arizona with 14 apiece, and Tennessee with 13. There were deaths recorded in 44 states - most in the Sun Belt, but many in places not known for hot weather.
The correlation between the rise in these deaths and the 1990s move to put children in the back seat is striking.
"Up to that time, the average number of children dying of hyperthermia in the United States was about 11 a year," says Jan Null, an adjunct professor of meteorology at San Francisco State University who has studied this trend. "Then we put them in the back, turned the car seats around. And from '98 to 2006, that number is 36 a year."
Few understand just how quickly a car can heat up, even on a moderate day.
According to one study, the temperature inside a vehicle can rise more than 40 degrees in the span of an hour, with 80 percent of that increase occurring during the first half hour. And researchers found that cracking the windows did little to help.
Children, often too young to escape, are particularly vulnerable because their immature respiratory and circulatory systems do not manage heat as efficiently as adults'. After a short time, the skin grows red and dry, the body becomes unable to produce sweat, and heat stroke kills the child.
Already this year, at least 16 children have died in hot vehicles from Hawaii to Virginia - including a 4-year-old New Orleans boy who died on Father's Day.
Since 1998, charges were filed in 49 percent of cases. In those that have been decided, 81 percent resulted in convictions or guilty pleas, and half of those brought jail sentences - the median sentence being two years. Parents were only slightly less likely to be charged and convicted than others, but the median sentence was much higher - 54 months.
In cases involving paid caregivers, 84 percent were charged, with 96 percent of those convicted. But while they are jailed at about the same rate as parents, the median sentence in those cases was just 12 months.
Women were jailed more often and for longer periods than men. But when the AP compared mothers and fathers, the sentencing gap was even wider.
Mothers were jailed 59 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent for fathers. And the median sentence was three years for dads, but five for moms.
"I think we generally hold mothers to a higher standard in the criminal justice context than in just family life generally," says Jennifer M. Collins, a professor at the Wake Forest University School of Law who has studied negligence involving parents and such hyperthermia cases. A large segment of society, they say, thinks "fathers are baby-sitting, and mothers are doing God's work."
In 27 percent of the cases the AP studied, the children got into the vehicles on their own. Those cases are much less likely to be prosecuted, though sometimes parents are punished for negligence - particularly where substance abuse is involved.
The AP identified more than 220 cases in which the caregiver admitted leaving the child behind. More than three-quarters of those people claim they simply forgot.
It's easy to forget your keys or that cup of coffee on the roof. But a child? How is that possible?
The awful truth, experts say, is that the stressed-out brain can bury a thought - something as trite as a coffee cup or crucial as a baby - and go on autopilot. While researchers once thought the different parts of the brain worked in conjunction with each other, they now realize that different portions dominate at different times.
"The value of the item is not only not relevant in these competing memory systems," says memory expert David Diamond, an associate psychology professor at the University of South Florida who also works at a Veterans Affairs hospital. "But, in fact, we can be more complacent because we tell ourselves, 'There's no way I would forget my child.'"
Harvard University professor Daniel Shachter, a leading brain researcher, says memory is very "cue dependent."
"And in these cases, the cue is often missing," they say. "When we go on automatic, it's very possible for us to ignore or forget about seemingly important things."
Like a baby.
Nationwide, about 60 percent of cases where the child was left unintentionally result in charges. But policies vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next.
At least nine children in Las Vegas have died in hot vehicles since 1998, but charges were filed in only two of those cases. For several years, it has been the policy of the Clark County prosecutor's office not to file charges unless there is proof of "some general criminal intent ... to put the child in harm's way," says chief deputy DA Tom Carroll.
But in Memphis, Tenn., District Attorney General William L. Gibbons scoffs at the notion that they wouldn't charge someone - especially a parent - who claims to have simply forgotten a child.
"It frankly boggles my mind that a parent can forget that a child is in a vehicle for two hours," says Gibbons, whose office has prosecuted five cases involving nine parents and day-care workers since 1998.
Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ordered Gibbons to grant pretrial diversion to youth minister Stephen McKim. McKim was late for a church meeting and forgot their 7-month-old daughter Mia in the back seat - even though the day care center was at the church.
Under diversion, the charge would be dismissed after two years if McKim successfully fulfills certain court requirements. Gibbons thinks that's getting off too easy.
"We're not talking in most cases about sending anyone to prison," they say. "We are talking about placing someone on probation, maybe requiring them to go to some parenting classes or something like that, and giving them a felony record as a result of what happened. And I think that's reasonable."
Not surprisingly, the harshest treatment is reserved for those who intentionally left their children. According to the AP's analysis, those people are nearly twice as likely to serve time than people who simply forgot the child. And on average, they received sentences that were 5 1/2 years longer.
In 2004, Tara Maynor was sentenced to 12 1/2 to 60 years in prison on two counts of second-degree murder after leaving their two children in a car for four hours outside a suburban Detroit beauty parlor while they got a massage and hairdo. They told police they were "too stupid to know they would die."
Just last month, Karla Edwards pleaded guilty in Aiken, S.C., to homicide by child abuse for leaving their 15-month-old son, Zachary Frison, in a car for nine hours in April 2006 while they worked at a home-improvement store. When Edwards was unable - or unwilling - to explain their actions, the judge sentenced them to 20 years.
But in many cases, police, prosecutors and judges must wrestle with whether to charge, try and punish an already grieving parent.
In Lexington, Ky., Fayette Circuit Judge James Ishmael said the question of what to do with Leon Jewell was perhaps the toughest of their career.
According to police, Jewell admitted buying beer and vodka at a liquor store on Aug. 1, 2005, and drinking in their SUV on the way home. When their wife returned home from work later that day, they found 9-month-old Daniel, the couple's only child, still strapped in their car seat.
Jewell pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter. Despite the prosecutor's recommendation of seven years, Ishmael placed the clearly remorseful and devastated Jewell on probation and ordered alcohol treatment.
But six months later, on what would have been Daniel's second birthday, Jewell got drunk and was kicked out of their treatment program. Ishmael sent them to prison for seven years; Jewel expressed their torment in a letter to the judge.
"When I was last before you (you) told me there are worse places than jail," they wrote. "And you are correct. Where ever I am is the worst place in the world. ... I have violated man's laws. I have violated God's laws."
Judges often attempt to craft creative penalties: An Idaho mother was ordered to make a video about their case to be used in birthing classes. In addition to spending eight months in prison, a Louisiana baby sitter was ordered to pay the dead girl's funeral expenses and to make a $500 annual donation to the hospital that treated them Some day-care workers have been prohibited from supervising young children during their probation.
So what of Kevin Kelly? What did they deserve?
Would it influence your opinion to know that the day Frances died, May 29, 2002, the Manassas engineer was watching 12 children alone while their wife and oldest daughter were abroad visiting a cancer-stricken relative?
Does it matter that when they returned home that day, he'd asked two teenage children - both of baby-sitting age - to attend to their younger siblings while they went back to school for another daughter who was late getting out of an exam?
Or that during the next seven hours, they were accosted by an air conditioning repairman with news that they were going to have to spend several thousand dollars on a new unit? That they fixed lunch, did laundry, mended a gap in the fence that the little ones were using to escape the yard, drove to the store for parts to fix their air conditioner, took a son to soccer practice and fixed a leaking drain pipe in the basement?
Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul L. Ebert concluded that Kelly's failure to ask after Frances for seven hours rose to the level of a crime. Kelly was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment. The jury recommended a year in prison.
But Circuit Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. had what they thought was a more humane solution. They ordered Kelly to spend one day a year in jail for seven years and to hold an annual blood drive around the anniversary of their daughter's death.
Kelly is still a convicted felon. They cannot vote, and their job was affected because they are barred from certain government properties.
But waiting in line recently at the All Saints Catholic Church to donate blood, they said they are happy for the chance to honor their daughter by helping to save lives.
"The judge was very, very merciful," they said as their red-haired children scurried around giving snacks and stickers to donors. "And I'm very grateful for what they did in allowing me to stay with my family and support my family."

We're getting two Avalanche open world games this year: the sunny, colourful wonderland that is Just Cause 3, and the gritty, brown, post-apocalyptic Mad Max. I was already sold on JC3 when I heard the words 'Just Cause 3', and now that I've seen a bit more of Mad Max in action, it's moving up my wishlist too. While it seems to have a lot in common with Avalanche's Mediterranean Rico-'em-up, there are some obvious differences, including the need to scavenge water, fuel and other bits to fuel your vehicular adventures.
Gamespot were given a 14-minute-ish presentation at E3 that provides a good long look at the upcoming game. If you're still on the fence, the above video offers a slice of all the driving, scavenging, fighting and harpooning you could be doing come September 1st.
We went hands-on with Mad Max a few weeks ago too.

If role-playing games have one thing in common, it's that almost all of them use specialized dice. You know, the
kind of dice you won't find in casinos; the dice with more (or less) than six sides; the dice that you might carry in an elaborate leather pouch; the dice that cause your parents, classmates and even some fellow nerds to look at you with disdain. Unfortunately, these people have a point — there is a fine line between dice being “special” and
dice being “retarded.” Here now are ten of
the dumbest dice ever constructed for role-playing games.
10) The D6 Alignment Dice
These dice help you decide on alignments for characters or NPCs. However, if you are too lazy to use your imagination to decide what alignment a character might be, then maybe role-playing isn't for you. If you can't make in your choice in your head whether Grongor the Dwarven Fighter likes to save women and children or save women and children for dinner, then I think the whole “story-telling adventure” thing is too taxing for you. You should just load up your Call of Duty 4 on the Xbox and enjoy not having to worry about coming up with complex narratives. Just shoot and call other people “fagtards.”
9) The D4
Yes, the D4 is pretty standard to role-playing games, but with its pyramid shape, it is also stupid. Unlike a real die, t is not something you can actually roll. It is more like a die you flip in the air in anger. Try to roll it, and it slides, as it is too lazy to actually be a real die. If it falls on the floor and you forget about it, it lands so that it's very easy to get a corner jammed into your foot. It even has the nickname of “caltrop” for this purpose I think any die with a nickname that matches a ninja tool is not something you should be playing with.
“Hey, throw one of those shuriken die around the table, will ya?”
“My eye!”
“Three.”
8) Crystal Dice
So, with all the use of platonic solids in role-playing dice, someone decided that barrels were a better shape, as preferred by the great Donkey Kong. They may call these “crystal dice,” but clearly they are barrels. You would roll these dice as you would roll a barrel, which makes whatever dignity you had died a horrible death. I give them credit for making a D4 that you don't step on, but I take away all that credit for making dice that you will pull out, show, and then be made fun of by other nerds. It's like the leper being cast out of the leper colony for being too leprous.
7) The D100
In 1985 a man named Lou Zocchi invented the 100-sided die or “Zocchihedron.” You know, because two D10s were just so damn heavy to roll in tandem. Well, this die certainly rolls — it rolls and rolls, which makes sense, because it has a hundred sides, or almost enough to become a perfectly round sphere. Good luck finding out which number it's actually landed on. Is it 2, or 57? You won't know. You won't goddamn know because the die rolled off your table. The D100 almost has to rolled in a box, or the padded cell that you should be kept in if you insist on using this. I think any die that needs an enclosure isn't a die, it is a pet for the insane.
6) The D2
In some cases, a D2 is noted in a role-playing system and should not be noted as such ever at any point at all. It is, after all, just flipping a coin. You don't need to be so anal that you have to use “D” notation for everything. You might as well start wearing top hats and monocles and sip your tea while saying “My good Dungeon Master, permit me the pleasure of checking for initiative in this crypt of ill repute.” Ah, but something is amiss in such elitism! What happens in the rare occurrence when the coin lands edgewise? When that happens, what do you do then, kill yourselves? Surely your Gods are false ones!
5) The D1000
No, this is not a die with a thousand sides, though I sincerely hope someone does in fact make a die with a thousand sides as the image of a grapefruit-sized die rolling around a table makes me chuckle. No, this instead is rolling three different colored ten-sided dice, with each color assigned a digit. The digits generate a number from one to a thousand, with 000 equaling 1000. This is also insane. Really, the justification for doing this is for very large probability tables. Except, then you start getting into variations that minute, you're not really role-playing anymore, you're just ramping up to do statistical mathematics. Might as well start lashing a bunch of PlayStation 3s together in a supercomputer cluster at that point to start doing complex mathematical calculations of wind speed affecting the trajectory of dragon breath. At least you'll be doing something other than use a Playstation 3 for a Blu-ray player, which is all the damn thing is good for.
4) Gold RPG Dice
Let us be quite clear. No matter how much you spend on your polyhedral dice, there is no way they are going to make you look cool. Sorry. As soon as you whip out a bag of dice of any sort your nerd status shoots up like Old Faithful. Pulling out a bag of dice made of gold only increases that aura by an exponential, blinding level that gets into your brain and makes you retarded. For those who might revel in that fact, let us take note that with the price of gold being what it is, and nerds not being known to be good in a fight, it is very likely that a nerd and their golden die will soon be parted. Most likely with a punch to the face and a quick swipe of the dice, which conveniently comes in a pouch for easy swiping.
3) The D5
Yes. The D5. From the same person who brought you the D100 comes another die you have to stare at, not understand what it is, stare at it some more, and then still not understand it. I'm not sure why you would need a D5 for any reason whatsoever. You can get a number from 1 to 5 generated through its unique, completely untrustworthy shape. I don't care if laboratory tests show this thing gives you a fair roll each time, it is the fact that it doesn't look like it's going to give you a fair roll is the problem. Nobody wants to play a game where it appears that it's completely rigged; sort of like nobody wants to eat food that looks like it is rotten. Sure, tests may prove that it's not at all, but there are other, perfectly good pieces of food to eat, just like there are other, perfectly good dice to use. Or eat.
2) The D34
What are we doing? We have descended into madness as human beings. The D34 is a die that is pretty much tells you we've lost our minds. The D34 is used for calculating a probability from 1 to 34 for what kind of crazy divination/bone throwing/scientology crapshit I do not know. Maybe it is a psychological test. The first person to pipe up and try to explain in sincere, serious terms what a D34 could logically be used for we lock in a padded room. There is absolutely no reason you would want to use a D34 or even multiples. Clearly the
person who designed these dice is one of the Illuminati, sitting in a rent-controlled apartment in Des Moines, occasionally stuffing a live mouth into their chops while humming the tune to Spencer for Hire.
1) The D6 Dinosaur Dwarven Stone
A Sauropod roamed the Earth and met an untimely demise. Due to a highly improbable series of events its bones fossilized. Then, it had the highly improbable good fortune to be found by we humans millions of years later and even more good fortune to be correctly identified and categorized by trained experts. Then it had the incredibly bad fortune of someone saying, “LET'S CHOP THIS BEAUTY INTO DICE!” Yes, a dinosaur fossil was made into a D6. If you had an urge to buy one of these things (and you can't anymore because other people went insane and bought them all out) then really, what can you do with this? You can take it to a game and like a jerk say “See this D6? It's made out of dinosaur fossil. Paid $60 for it.” You could also not do that, and instead have the die as a display piece. Consider, though that if having a dinosaur fossil on display is impressive, then having a die made from a dinosaur is NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL. You've taken something that was, by itself, interesting and special and turned into an abomination. It's like inviting your friends over to look at your fireplace and saying “Hey, check out this fire, I used the Mona Lisa for kindling. Paid a billion dollars for it. Neat, huh?”
Thae Yong-ho, former North Korean diplomat who defected to the South
A year has passed since Thae Yong-ho, 55, made international headlines for being the highest-level North Korean diplomat to defect to the South. Thae, who arrived in August 2016 with their entire family after serving as deputy North Korean ambassador in London, now provides valuable insight about their reclusive homeland to South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy, a government-backed research center in Seoul.At a time when North Korea is escalating regional tensions with its Guam threat, the JoongAng Ilbo met with Thae earlier this month at their office to hear their thoughts on the Kim Jong-un leadership and what goal the 33-year-old leader has in mind.On conflicting views whether Kim is a downright lunatic or a “smart cookie,” as U.S. President Donald Trump once said, Thae put more weight on the latter, saying Kim was only “pretending” to be crazy in order to convince the United States into thinking they could be reckless enough to aim a missile at the world's strongest power — and eventually get it to question whether the alliance with South Korea was worth going to war against the North.The following are edited excerpts of the interview.I expected myself to assimilate to local society quite naturally, but everything messed up last February when Kim Jong-nam [Kim Jong-un's half brother] was assassinated [in a Malaysian airport]. My security beefed up, preventing me from going around freely. It's been a year since I settled down in the capital, but I still can't even tell which sides are north, south, east and west of downtown Seoul.Nope. But I did have more bodyguards after that case, and the costs are covered by tax money. I feel sorry for them, and for using South Korea's taxes.I thought it was really impressive to see so many trees on mountains surrounding the highway rest areas. And the rest areas are so clean, even compared to the ones in Britain.They're too naive compared to North Koreans.I sometimes get that impression when I talk with South Koreans. And I think to myself, 'How will they face North Korea with a mentality like that?'It's difficult to answer with absolute certainty. But it would probably be best to say that the regime is led by a leader from the Kim family and an inner-circle hoping the status-quo to last. Even so, Kim Jong-un always has the final call.Kim Jong-un isn't a lunatic. He's playing out a 'lunatic strategy' to appear he's crazy. He's actually very clever.Over the past decades, there were a myriad of anti-Workers' Party, anti-revolutionary events in North Korea that the South could call something close to a pro-democracy movement. Ordinary citizens are very much against [the leadership]. People can be publicly executed if they get caught watching South Korean movies or dramas, but nevertheless, almost everyone sees them. The chasm between the Kim Jong-un regime and the general public is widening every year, and some day, the two sides will ultimately break like a rubber band. I think that day will come within the next 10 years.He's planning to top every missile, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), with a nuclear warhead and place them ready for action by the end of this year. We'll have to see if they follow through with that goal, but it's an absolute fact that he's giving their all to achieve it.Yes. What the North Korean government, elite groups and top military brass emphasize is that South Koreans are feeble-minded. When something occurs, they rely on the United States rather than trying to solve the problem on their own, is what they claim. So the North will master their ICBM technology and threaten the U.S. by arousing fear. They'll keep threatening to blow up Los Angeles and Chicago, which will one day lead to Washington asking themselves whether they have to risk fighting with North Korea in order to defend the South. Eventually, the North thinks this could all lead to drawing some sort of second Acheson line in the Korea Strait between the South and Japan. With North Korea possessing nuclear weapons, and without the consolation of having the U.S. at its back, South Korea will panic and eventually fall apart, they imagine.The Kim Jong-un regime has to be peacefully replaced. The regime and North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs are like two sides of a coin.A hundred percent yes. For decades, South Korea and the U.S. have tried negotiating with the regime and sanctioning it, but they've all failed. The answer lies in the North Korean general public. [The allies] have to awaken them, and encourage them to rise up against the leadership.Relying on nongovernmental organizations won't get you anywhere. The South Korean government has to reach out policy-wise. It has to produce cultural content catering to the North Korean public. I've watched many South Korean films and dramas but all that's left at the end is a sense of envy towards life in the South. The productions fail to critically portray North Korean society and awaken viewers there. [The South Korean government] has to produce and disseminate cultural content that induces North Korean viewers to ponder how their community can democratize.BY BAE MYUNG-BOK [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]

Introduction
A system of record is the authoritative data source when information is scattered among various data providers. When we introduce a caching solution, we automatically duplicate our data. To avoid inconsistent reads and data integrity issues, it's very important to synchronize the database and the cache (whenever a change occurs in the system).
There are various ways to keep the cache and the underlying database in sync and this article will present some of the most common cache synchronization strategies.
Cache-aside
The application code can manually manage both the database and the cache information. The application logic inspects the cache before hitting the database and it updates the cache after any database modification.
Mixing caching management and application is not very appealing, especially if we have to repeat these steps in every data retrieval method. Leveraging an Aspect-Oriented caching interceptor can mitigate the cache leaking into the application code, but it doesn't exonerate us from making sure that both the database and the cache are properly synchronized.
Read-through
Instead of managing both the database and the cache, we can simply delegate the database synchronization to the cache provider. All data interaction is, therefore, done through the cache abstraction layer.
Upon fetching a cache entry, the Cache verifies the cached element availability and loads the underlying resource on our behalf. The application uses the cache as the system of record and the cache is able to auto-populate on demand.
Write-through
Analogous to the read-through data fetching strategy, the cache can update the underlying database every time a cache entry is changed.
Although the database and the cache are updated synchronously, we have the liberty of choosing the transaction boundaries according to our current business requirements.
If strong consistency is mandatory and the cache provider offers an XAResource we can then enlist the cache and the database in the same global transaction. The database and the cache are therefore updated in a single atomic unit-of-work
If consistency can be weakened, we can update the cache and the database sequentially, without using a global transaction. Usually the cache is changed first and if the database update fails, the cache can use a compensating action to roll back the current transaction changes
Write-behind caching
If strong consistency is not mandated, we can simply enqueue the cache changes and periodically flush them to the database.
This strategy is employed by the Java Persistence EntityManager (first-level cache), all entity state transitions being flushed towards the end of the current running transaction (or when a query is issued).
If you enjoyed this article, I bet you are going to love my Book and Video Courses as well.
Although it breaks transaction guarantees, the write-behind caching strategy can outperform the write-through policy, because database updates can be batched and the number of DML transactions is also reduced.

What plays a bigger role in autism, genetics or environment? Scientists don't agree on the answer, but the debate just got more attention with the arrival of a new study involving twins. When you look at "extreme" autism symptoms, genetics plays almost the only role, according to that study, led by clinical psychologist Thomas W. Frazier II of the Cleveland Clinic.1
That conclusion in favor of genetics differs markedly from a 2011 twin study that found that the environment was a significant influence. In medical research, the environment usually refers to everything from the air you breathe to your parents' ages when you were conceived and your prenatal conditions. The earlier study found that fraternal twins, who shared the same environment before birth but have different DNA, were more likely to both have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than siblings who weren't twins. That study look at 192 pairs of twins in California.2
Dr. Frazier had questions about the California study, so they decided to launch their own autism twins study, the largest of its kind so far. Their team analyzed information about 568 pairs of identical and fraternal twins in the Interactive Autism Network (IAN) database.1
Identical twins began as one fertilized egg, so they have virtually all the same genes. Fraternal twins share about half of their genes and are as genetically similar as any two siblings. But because twins shared a womb, they are more likely to have had the same environmental influences before birth than non-twin siblings.
Many studies analyze whether a set of twins both have an autism diagnosis or not. Dr. Frazier's team did too. If one identical twin has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the other twin has a 76 percent chance of also being diagnosed with it. The numbers are lower for fraternal twins. The percentage of fraternal twins who each share an ASD diagnosis is 34 percent for same-sex twins and 18 percent for boy-girl pairs, Dr. Frazier said. (Girls are less likely to be diagnosed with autism than boys). Those statistics are similar to other twin studies, including the California one.2, 3
Where the new study differs is that it goes on to analyze the severity of autism symptoms. To do so, researchers used the twins' scores on questionnaires measuring social communication skills, and repetitive behaviors and obsessive interests. People with autism typically have particular problems in those areas of communication and behavior.
Some researchers have assumed that autism is an extreme version of normal behaviors, just as Attention Deficit Disorder might be an extreme version of a normal tendency for someone's attention to wander. Dr. Frazier said.
Dr. Frazier's team, however, came to a different conclusion. "Without making assumptions, we found evidence that autism represents a set of behaviors outside the norm that are strongly genetically determined, with the genetic component likely being major gene effects, which could involve different genes across people," they said.
Using a mathematical analysis of data, their team found that identical twins were much more likely to have similar levels of autistic symptoms than fraternal twins. Those researchers also concluded that:
High levels of autism symptoms are genetic in origin. Less severe symptoms are not as likely to be inherited.
A shared environment played no "significant" role in the development of extreme autism symptoms in twins.
Problems in two separate areas – social communication skills and repetitive behaviors – are driven by the same gene or genes.
This study has not settled the long-running debate over genetic versus environmental factors in autism. Dr. Frazier said the environment may be causing changes in genes that contribute to autism. "But it will be easier to find the environmental trigger to autism if we know the genes. If you really believe the environment is involved in autism, then you should be keen on genetic research," they said.
Thailand is safe to travel in at the moment despite the anti-government protests taking place in Bangkok. These have been mainly limited to Ratchadamnoen Avenue and have been easy to avoid by most tourists. There has also been some protest marches across Bangkok but these have been mainly peaceful and pass quickly. At no time has there been any threat against foreign tourists. In fact, some tourists have even visited the main rally sites without incident. However, this is not advisable.
The Thai government recognises the importance of tourism in Thailand and are keen to protect the safety of their guests. So, if any tourist is affected through harm or loss of property in the event of riots, natural disaster or terrorism from 1st October 2013 to 30th April 2014 they can claim up to $10,000 each. However, if Thailand is invaded by a foreign country, whether war is declared or not, tourists won't be covered by this insurance scheme.
Insurance Coverage:
1. Loss of life, limbs, sight or permanent disabilities – $10,000 per person
2. Hospital expenses as incurred and hospital stay, if necessary, for a maximum period of 10 days – $1,000 per person & not exceeding $10,000 per person.
3. Any losses or damage caused by travel interruption with more than eight hours will be compensated – $100 per person per day and not exceeding $10,000 per person.
To claim under this insurance scheme, tourists should contact Chao Phraya Insurance Public Co., Ltd. as soon as possible or within 30 days. Telephone 02-648-6666, extension 1 for more information. Payment will be given within seven days of submitting documents.
Just when you thought insects couldn't get any creepier, the US Air Force has unveiled tiny finger-sized insect spy drones that would be undetectable to most. The example above can be used to inject toxins into enemies during wars. Continue reading for two videos and more information.
Researchers have now developed bio-inspired drones with bug eyes, bat ears, bird wings, and even honeybee-like hairs to sense biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. And the U.S. isn't the only country to have poured money into spy drone miniaturisation. France has developed flapping wing bio-inspired microdrones.

A recent article by Jorge Elbaum, the former executive director of DAIA (Delegation for Argentine Jewish Associations), the principle Argentine Jewish umbrella groups, published in the Buenos Aires daily Pagina 12, provides a detailed account of the damaging links between the State of Israel, US Wall Street speculators and local Argentine Zionists in government and out.
Elbaum describes how their efforts have been specifically directed toward destabilizing the incumbent center-left government of President Cristina Fernandez, while securing exorbitant profits for a Zionist Wall Street speculator, Paul Singer of Elliott Management as well as undermining a joint Iranian-Argentine investigation of the 1994 terrorist bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires.
Elbaum's article was written in response to the death of Alberto Nisman, a Zionist zealot and chief government prosecutor in the terrorist bombing investigation for over 20 years.
The serious issues raised by the political use and gross manipulation of the horrors of the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Community Center shows how Tel Aviv (and its political assets in Argentina and the US) further Israeli power in the Middle East, in particular, by isolating and demonizing Iran. This is important at two critical levels, which this article seeks to highlight.
First of all, Israeli attempted to sidetrack the Argentine investigation, by involving some of its powerful Wall Street assets and influential pro-Israel lobbies (the Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC among others). Their purpose was to fabricate ‘evidence' in order to implicate Iran in the crime and to manipulate their influential assets in Argentina, especially in this case, chief prosecutor Nisman and many of the leaders of DAIA, to accuse the Argentine government of complicity in an ‘Iranian cover-up'.
The second issue, raised by Israel's intervention in Argentina's investigation into the bombing, has wider and deeper implications: How Israel promotes its foreign policy objectives in various countries by grooming and manipulating local influential Jewish officials and community organizations. This furthers Tel Aviv's goal of regional hegemony and territorial aggrandizement. In other words, Israeli political reach extends far beyond the Middle East and goes ‘global', operating without any consideration of the dangers it inflicts on Jews in the ‘target countries'. To this end, Israel has been creating a worldwide network of Jews, which calls into question their loyalty to the polity of their home countries where they have resided for generations.
The nefarious impact, which Israel's intervention has on the sovereignty of its ‘target countries', presents a danger to innocent and loyal Jewish citizens who are not acting as agents of Tel Aviv.
For these reasons it is important to critically analyze the specific characteristics of Israel's dangerous meddling in Argentina.
The Crisis of the Argentine Justice System: Unsolved Terrorist Crimes and Israeli Intervention
After the anti-Sematic bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, the Argentine judicial and legal system seriously bungled the investigation, despite collaboration from the US FBI and Israel's Mossad. Argentina's then President Carlos Menem was an ardent neo-liberal, unconditional backer of US foreign policy and strong supporter of Israel. Their regime was still heavily infested with high-ranking police, military and intelligence officials deeply implicated in the seven-year bloody military dictatorship (1976-83) during which 30,000 Argentine citizens were murdered.
Among the victims of this ‘dirty war' were hundreds of Argentine Jews, activists, intellectuals and militants who were tortured and murdered to the anti-Sematic taunts of their military and police assassins. During this same horrific ‘pogrom' of Argentina's committed Jewish activists, the state of Israel managed to sell tens of millions of dollars in arms to the junta, breaking a US-EU boycott. Notoriously, the conservative leaders of the DAIA and AMIA (Argentine-Israel Mutual Association) failed to defend the lives of Jewish activists and militants. After attending meetings with the junta, many conservative Jewish leaders would dismiss the concerns of the families of the disappeared and tortured Argentine Jews, saying: ‘They must have done something…'
The bungled investigation into the 1994 bombing included the arrest of right-wing police officials who were later released and the mysterious loss of vital forensic evidence. Accusations against various foreign regimes and organizations shifted according to the political needs of the US and Israel: First, the Lebanese group, Hezbollah, Israel's main military adversary during its bloody occupation of southern Lebanon in the 1990's was touted as the responsible party.
A few years later, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, prior to the Israeli-backed US invasion of Iraq; then the Palestinians were trotted out, followed by Syria's Baathist intelligence forces. After the total destruction of Iraq by the US ‘coalition' and the decline of influential Arab states in the Middle East, the Israelis have settled on Iran as the ‘prime suspect', coinciding with Teheran's rise of as a regional power – challenging Israeli and US hegemony.
With the 2001 collapse of Argentina's version of a kleptocratic neo-liberal, pro-US bootlicking regime, and in the midst of a dire economic depression, there was a popular upheaval and the subsequent election of President Kirchner bringing a new center-left government to power.
The new government, defaulting on its murderous foreign debt, oversaw Argentina's economic recovery and a vast increase in social spending which stabilized capitalism. Kirchner also promoted greater independence in foreign policy and sought to enhance Buenos Aires relations with Israel by re-opening the investigation into the bombing and retaining Alberto Nisman, as chief prosecutor.
Nisman, the Mossad and the US Embassy Connection
In their article, ‘Vultures, Nisman, DAIA: The Money Route' (Pagina 12, 4/18/15), Jorge Elbaum, points out that chief prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, opened secret bank account in New York. As Elbaum told prominent figures in Argentina's Jewish community, Nisman's campaign to discredit the government's joint investigatory commission with Iran and demonize the Argentine government was financed, at least in part, by New York's vulture fund head, Paul Singer, who stood to make hundreds of millions in profit.
According to documents, cited by Elbaum, US embassy personnel and leading US Zionist organizations, including the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, led by Mark Dubowitz, as well as Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, fed Nisman fabricated ‘evidence' and corrected numerous substantive and grammatical flaws in their report purporting to ‘demonstrate' Argentine's cover-up of the Iran's role in the 1994 bombing. However, forensic and legal experts in Argentina have determined that Nisman's claims lack any legal basis or credibility.
The entire ‘Operation Nisman' appears to have been orchestrated by Israel with the goal of isolating Iran via fabricated evidence supposed to ‘prove' its role in the 1994 bombing. The recruitment of Nisman, as a key Israeli operative, was central to Israel's strategy of using the DAIA and other Argentine – Jewish organizations to attack the Argentine-Iran memo of understanding regarding the investigation of the bombing. Israel pushed US-Zionist organizations to intensify their intervention into Argentine politics via their networks with Argentine-Jewish organizations.
The vulture-fund speculator, Paul Singer, who had bought defaulted Argentine debt for ‘pennies on the dollar', was demanding full payment through sympathetic New York courts. They had funded a special speculators' task force on Argentina joining forces with Israel, US Zionist organizations and Alberto Nisman in order to manipulate Argentina's investigation and secure a bountiful return. Nisman thus became a ‘key tool' to Israel's regional military strategy toward Iran, to New York speculator Singer's strategy to grab a billion dollar windfall and to the Argentine right wing's campaign to destabilize the center-left government of Kirschner-Fernandez.
By acting mainly in the interest of Israel and US Zionists, Nisman sacrificed the Argentine-Jewish community's desire for a serious, truthful investigation into the bombing leading to identification and conviction of the perpetrators. Moreover, Nisman compromised themselves by being a tool for Israel's foreign policy against the interest of the Argentine government, which they were sworn to serve, and endangered the status of the Argentine Jewish community among Argentines in general by raising questions about their loyalty to their home country.
Fortunately, Argentina has sophisticated , prominent Jewish leaders who see themselves as Argentine citizens first and foremost, including leaders like Foreign Secretary Hector Timmerman who proposed the joint investigation with Iran as well as the former DAIA Executive Director Jorge Elbaum who has played a major role in denouncing Israel's intervention in Argentine politics. It is citizens, like Elbaum, who have exposed the Israeli government's role in recruiting and manipulating local leading Argentine-Jews to serve Tel Aviv's foreign policy interests.
This is in stark contrast to the United States where no major American-Jewish leader has dared to denounce the role of leading Zionist organizations as Israel's conduit. Furthermore, unlike Argentina, where a sector of the liberal press (Pagina 12) has published critical accounts of Nisman's fabrications and Israel's destabilization campaign, newspapers in the US, like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, have continued to present Nisman's discredited report as a serious investigation by a courageous, ‘martyred' prosecutor.
The US media continues to portray the entire Argentine judicial system ascorrupt and argue that Nisman's death must have been a state-orchestrated crime. The US public has never been presented with the fact that the leading critics of Nisman's report and their own behavior were prominent Argentine Jews and that Argentina's foreign minister, Hector Timmerman, organized the Argentine-Iran commission.
Conclusion
That Israel was willing to derail any serious the investigation into the 1994 bombing, which killed and maimed scores of Argentine Jews, in order to further its campaign against Iran, demonstrates the extent to which the self-styled ‘Jewish State' is willing to sacrifice the interests and security of world Jewry to further its narrow military agenda.
Equally egregious is the way in which Tel Aviv recruits overseas Jews to serve Israel's interests against that of their own countries, turning them into a ‘fifth column', operating inside and outside of their governments. That Israeli intelligence has been exposed and denounced in the case of Nisman, has not forestalled nor prevented Israel from continuing this long-standing, practice of dangerous meddling. This is especially evident in the ‘Israel-first behavior' of leading Jewish American organizations and political leaders who have pledged their total allegiance to Netanyahu's war agenda against Iran an bought the US Congress to scuttle the peace accord.
It merits repetition: Israel's widespread practice of recruiting Jewish citizens and officials of other countries to serve as vehicles of Israeli policies has the potential to foment a new and possibly violent backlash, once the greater population has been made aware of such treasonous activities. In this regard, Israel does not represent a bastion of security for world Jewry, but a cynical, manipulative and deadly threat. Perhaps that is Israel's ultimate strategy – create a backlash of generalized anger against overseas Jews and precipitate massive flight to Israel from countries like Argentina, while the few who remain can be better manipulated to serve Tel Aviv.
Epilogue
A few days ago, on April 23, a crowd of several hundred Argentine Jews met to repudiate the arrogant claims of the established leaders of the DAIA and the AMIA that they represent ‘all Argentine Jews”. This overflow crowd in the auditorium of the telephone workers union proposed to create a ‘collective and democratic space, based on links of solidarity over and above commercial connections.' The Jewish community in the US would be wise to pay close attention to Argentina's example.
Stan Freberg, a mutifaceted humorist who was widely known in the 1950s and 1960s for their comedy albums, satirical songs and groundbreaking commercials, and who influenced generations of subversive, irreverent comedians, died April 7 at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. They were 88.
Their family confirmed their death to news organizations. They had pneumonia and other ailments.
Mr. Freberg was a protean force in humor for decades and was sometimes known as the “father of recorded comedy” for the way they used music, mockery and multiple voices to lampoon politics and popular culture.
“Back in the 1950s,” Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley wrote in 1988, “the funniest man in America was either Lenny Bruce or Mort Sahl or Stan Freberg.”
Mr. Freberg predated the others, beginning in the 1940s as a voice-over artist for Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1951, they released a best-selling comedy record, “John and Marsha,” a soap-opera spoof consisting only of the names “John” and “Marsha,” spoken in every possible emotional state for more than two minutes.
The recording was considered scandalous by some bluenoses, who believed Mr. Freberg had hidden a microphone in a honeymoon suite. In reality, they voiced both parts himself, adding sobs, soaring music and increasing ardor with each “John” and “Marsha.”
(The routine was portrayed during a 2010 episode of “Mad Men.”)
Mr. Freberg was viewed as a major influence by such diverse figures as filmmaker Steven Spielberg, “Doonesbury” cartoonist Garry Trudeau, the Smothers Brothers musical comedy duo, writers Stephen King and David Mamet, musical satirist Weird Al Yankovic and magicians Penn & Teller.
Their understated sense of ridicule can be seen in the films of Christopher Guest, the comedy of George Carlin and in virtually every skit on “Saturday Night Live.”
“There has been nothing comparable to Freberg's ability to seize on a pop fad and, while it was still hot, capitalize on it,” author and critic Gerald Nachman wrote in “Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s.”
Mr. Freberg's landmark 1961 album, “The United States of America,” recreated the nation's history in exaggerated comic and musical form, beginning with Columbus's arrival on these shores. The explorer hoped to take out a loan to open an Italian restaurant, only to find the banks closed because it was Columbus Day.
Their comedy records routinely hit the Top 40, and their 1953 spoof of the radio and TV drama “Dragnet” sold 2 million copies. Set in medieval times, “St. George and the Dragonet” captured the just-the-facts-ma'am style of “Dragnet”:

“This is the countryside. My name is St. George. I'm a knight. Saturday, July 10th, 8:05 p.m. I was working out at the castle on the night watch when a call came in from the chief: A dragon had been devouring maidens. Homicide. My job: Slay 'em.”
Mr. Freberg routinely spoofed popular music trends of the 1950s, from Elvis Presley to calypso music, doo-wop and the accordion-playing TV host Lawrence Welk. The meaning of Mr. Freberg's 1958 recording, “Green Chri$tma$,” was clear from the beginning: “Deck the halls with advertising, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.”
In addition to being a popular comedy performer, Mr. Freberg had a surprising second career, beginning in the 1950s, as a revolutionary force in advertising. They were often credited with creating the first funny commercials, using humor and irony to sell everything from prunes to automobiles.
“I really went into advertising as a totally outraged consumer,” Mr. Freberg told the New York Times in 1983. “Day after day, I sat watching the tube and listening to the radio, and I was stunned by the ineptness. So I started creating the sort of advertising I knew could reach me.”
They won more than 20 Clio awards for advertising, but their iconoclastic approach was not universally popular, especially at first. They advertised an airline by playing off the fear of flying, suggesting that even the pilots were afraid to go up in the air. The flight attendants handed out security blankets and good-luck charms to passengers.
They sold Sunsweet prunes by emphasizing that they had no pits.
“How do they do it?”
“They do it.”
The commercial ended with the announcer solemnly intoning, “Today, the pits, tomorrow the wrinkles.”
Stanley Victor Freberg was born Aug. 7, 1926, in Los Angeles. They were the son and grandson of Baptist ministers.
They began performing in high school, then passed up college scholarships to take a job in the cartoon division of the Warner Bros. studio, where they were often paired with Mel Blanc, known as Hollywood's greatest cartoon voice actor.
Mr. Freberg spent two years in the Army and, by 1949, was doing voices for an early children's television show in Los Angeles. They sang in a band and began doing comedy routines before creating a niche as a satirist of modern life.
In 1957, Mr. Freberg briefly had a radio show on CBS, which they later described as the last comedy program on a commercial radio network.
They remained a popular comedy performer into the 1960s, then focused on their advertising career until the 1980s. They published an autobiography, “It Only Hurts When I Laugh,” in 1988, before returning to radio in the 1990s with a program and commentaries on NPR.
In 1996, Mr. Freberg released a follow-up album to “The United States of America,” continuing their strange, comic journey through American history. In later years, they often appeared on discussion panels at comic conferences on popular culture.
“Satire serves the same purpose as that little steam valve in a pressure cooker,” Mr. Freberg told the Los Angeles Times in 1991. “It allows some of that steam to dissolve; otherwise we're likely to blow up.”
Their first wife, Donna Andresen Freberg, died in 2000 after more than 40 years of marriage. Survivors include their wife of 13 years, the former Betty Hunter, known as Hunter Freberg; two children from their first marriage; and a granddaughter.
Mr. Freberg won a Grammy Award and several Emmy Awards and was elected to the Radio Hall of Fame, Songwriters Hall of Fame and Animation Hall of Fame.
There seemed to be no limit to Mr. Freberg's satirical range. In the 1950s, at the same time they were spoofing the garbled lyrics of pop songs — “Stick some old rags in your mouth and take it again from the top, okay?” — they were writing one of the more subtle attacks on the excesses of the McCarthy era, with “Little Blue Riding Hood.”
“Only the color has been changed,” they said, “to prevent an investigation.”

BOSTON (CBS) – Michael Starr and Lexxi Foxx from the band Steel Panther joined 98.5 The Sports Hub's Toucher & Rich in studio on Wednesday morning.
The glam metal musicians talked about being sponsored by Brazzers, sorting through groupies and how Matt Leinart possibly ruined their NFL career after attending one of their shows.
Later in the segment, Starr and Foxx tried to decipher the lyrics on Van Halen's latest live album, which is easier said than done.
Steel Panther is currently on tour promoting their All-You-Can-Eat album, and you can catch them tonight at the House of Blues in Boston. Say hello to Rich if you go, because he'll be in attendance.

Throw a dart at a map of today's American brewing scene, and you are likely to hit a brewer or brewery that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has touched since its debut 34 years ago. Gabriel Magliaro, founder of Half Acre Beer Co. in Chicago: “The beer laid tracks in the American palate.”
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is an “iconic style” and one of the beers they admired when starting out, according to Dick Doore and Eric Wallace, founders of Left Hand Brewing in Longmont, Colorado.
Dale Katechis, founder of Oskar Blues Brewery, says the beer “captured the American Dream by growing a homebrew recipe that went on to define the American pale ale category.”
Jeffrey Horner, brewmaster at Cisco Brewers on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts: “I grew up homebrewing (as a teenager, early-mid 1990s) in the San Francisco Bay Area. I distinctly recall my first sip of SNPA. It steered my homebrew formulations very early on. … Thank God for SNPA, it's my ‘Coors Light,' being nearly ubiquitous!”
That ubiquity cuts both ways. Not only has a generation of brewers drawn inspiration from Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it has also become a go-to yardstick for brewers to measure their newer wares against (to say the least of consumers, who might use it as a kind of gateway into the kaleidoscopic American beer marketplace).
“I definitely was influenced by it 20 years ago when I started He'Brew, and I knew very little about specific flavor profiles,” says Jeremy Cowan, founder of Shmaltz Brewing Co. in the Albany, New York, suburb of Clifton Park. “I knew there was Sierra on the one hand and Anchor on the other. So, when I was looking to make the original recipe for the first He'Brew Beer, for Genesis Ale, I kind of had in the back of my mind Sierra as the iconic pale that I wanted to avoid. I didn't want to re-create the flavor.”
There were enough brewers doing that by the early 1990s, roughly a decade after Sierra Nevada Pale Ale's debut. Why? Simple: Bitter beers were going big-time and getting bigger.
Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi, fellow homebrewing enthusiasts, started the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in 1979 in Chico, the California city where Grossman owned a homebrewing-supply shop. The pair's inaugural commercial creation was a stout, with the first batch of pale ale coming a few days later, in November 1980. They released it the following spring—basically a homebrew recipe writ large and relying on Cascade hops for its bright, citrusy aroma.
Cascade was the first American-developed hop to be used to give commercial beer its aroma. Before its introduction in the early 1970s, through the U.S Department of Agriculture hop farm in Corvallis, Oregon, only European varieties could do the honors. Then came Cascade, initially through Coors and then through Anchor Brewing's Liberty Ale in 1975.
Grossman, the driving force behind the recipe's creation and still the head of Sierra Nevada (he bought out a large absentee Camusi in 1999), was not aware of Anchor's use of Cascade in Liberty Ale. They just knew they liked the hop-forward taste. It reminded them in part of the old Ballantine IPA, one of the first beers that really piqued their brewing curiosity.
The hoppier focus of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale helped it stand out as more brewers crowded into the marketplace in the 1980s and 1990s. “To lean a beer's profile to highlight hops was big at the time,” Magliaro of Half Acre notes in an email. A cover story in the old San Francisco Examiner Sunday magazine in May 1986, which included the headline “The Beer That's Making Chico Famous” and a shot of two pale-ale boxes, didn't hurt, either.
The best-selling smaller-batch beers of that era were Pete's Wicked Ale, a brown ale, and Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a malty lager from the Boston Beer Co. Sierra Nevada's far-more-bitter pale ale nevertheless grew steadily in popularity through its first two decades, becoming a prototype for styles—hoppier pales, IPAs, double IPAs, etc.—that would themselves explode in popularity near the turn of the century. IPA, according to the Brewers Association, is the best-selling smaller-batch beer style in the U.S.
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has been made at only three locations in its 35 years: the original Chico brewery, the Chico brewery that replaced it in the late 1980s and the brewery's North Carolina operation, which opened in 2014. It accounts for roughly half the annual output of Sierra Nevada, which is now the seventh-largest brewery by sales volume in the U.S.
Also, according to the brewery, the recipe for its pale ale has never changed. It's still all about the hops.
These beers were reviewed by Tom Acitelli.
The Rome Declaration annotated
Strikethroughs (e.g. crossed out wording) indicate an earlier version of the text that has been amended in later drafts of the declaration
Paragraph 1
We, the representatives leaders of 27 Member States and the Institutions of the EU, take pride in the achievements of the European Union: the construction of European unity is a bold, far-sighted endeavour. Sixty years ago, recovering from the tragedy of two world wars, we decided to bond together and rebuild our continent from its ashes. We have built a unique Union with common institutions and strong values, a unique community of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law - a major economic power with unparalleled levels of social protection and welfare.
This is aimed to calm fears of Greece and other debtor EU states that Europe will give on its standards when it comes to enforcing austerity. The Greek prime minister has threatened not to sign the declaration if Brussels allows the IMF to demand more pension cuts and layoffs in order to support the next bailout. EU diplomats have complained of 'blackmail' from Athens.
Paragraph 4
We are determined to will make the EU stronger and more resilient, through even greater unity and solidarity amongst us and the respect of common rules. Unity is both a necessity and our free choice. Taken individually, we would be sidelined by global dynamics. Standing together is our best chance to influence them, and. to defend our common interests and values. We will act together whenever possible at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past, within- in line with the Treaties framework and leaving keeping the door open to those who want.to join later. Our Union is undivided and indivisible.
This is watered down language after weeks in which some core EU states, including France, Belgium and Germany talked up the acceleration of a 'multi-speed' Europe. Poorer nations, particularly Poland, reacted furiously sensing that richer states were planning a process that would marginalise and weaken them.
Paragraph 5
In the ten years to come we want a Union that is safe and secure, prosperous, competitive and sustainable and socially responsibler with an enhance social dimension , and with the will and capacity of playing a key role in the global world and shaping globalisation. We want a Union where citizens have new opportunities for cultural, social development and economic growth. We want a Union which remains open to those European Countries that fully share respect our values and are committed to promoting them.
This could be read as a backhanded swipe at recalcitrant eastern EU states like Poland and Hungary who signed up to 'European values' at enlargement but now have increasingly authoritarian governments that have classed with Brussels over accepting migrant quotas and openly reject multi-culturalism.
Paragraphs 6-8
In these times of change, and aware of the concerns of our citizens, we commit to the Rome Agenda, and pledge to work towards:
1. A safe and secure Europe: a Union where all citizens feel safe and can move freely, where our external borders are secured and where with an efficient, responsible and sustainable migration policy, is managed effectively, humanely and [in respecting of international norms]; a Europe determined to fight terrorism and organised crime.
2. A prosperous and sustainable Europe: a Union which creates growth and jobs; a Union where a vast strong, connected and developing Single Market embraces ing technological transformation and where a stable and further strengthened single currency opens avenues for growth and cohesion, competitiveness, innovation and exchange, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises; a Union promoting sustained and sustainable growth, through investment, structural reforms and the completion of the working towards completing the Economic and Monetary Union; a Union where economies converge; a Union where energy is secure and affordable and the environment clean and safe.
The weakening of this language from "completion" of monetary Union to only "working towards" that goal reflects deep north-south divisions on the euro. Ideas like a European Monetary Fund and a common deposit insurance scheme for the eurozone are being blocked by Germany which does not want to be put on the hook for the debts of poorer southern states, at least not without serious structural reforms.
Paragraphs 9-10
3. A social Europe: a Union which, based on sustainable growth, promotes economic and social progress as well as cohesion and convergence, taking into account the diversity of national systems the variety of our social models and the key role of social partners while upholding the integrity of the internal market; a Union which promotes gender the equality between women and men and rights and equal opportunities for all; a Union which fights discrimination, social exclusion and poverty; a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the continent; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and preserves promotes cultural diversity and promotes preserves our cultural heritage
4. A stronger Europe on the global scene: a Union further developing existing building new partnerships, building new ones and promoting stability and prosperity in its immediate neighbourhood to the east and south, but also in the Middle east and across Africa and globally; a Union ready to take more responsibilities and to assist in creating a more competitive and integrated defence industry; a Union committed to strengthening its common security and defence, ensuring cooperation and complementarity and avoiding duplications with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, taking into account national circumstances and legal commitments; a Union engaged in the United Nations and protecting standing for a rates-based multilateral system, proud of its values and protective of its people, promoting free and fair trade and a positive global climate policy.
AUTHOR and philosopher Alain de Botton has defended their comments about Brisbane being ugly following a public backlash.
De Botton was criticised on Friday for a post on their website The Philosophers' Mail that singled out Brisbane as one of the world's ugly cities and an example of “chaotic ugliness”.
“No one looks at the waterfront of Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland, and feels deeply moved by the grace and sweetness of the scene,” de Botton said in the post
“While most people find the centre of Paris wonderful and others will delight in the winding streets of Siena, no one on the planet responds deeply to the brutal cross city expressway and chunky stained brown office blocks of the city.”
The problem, de Botton says, is that people have accepted that everyone will have different views of what is beautiful or ugly.
“We have talked ourselves into the belief that taste is always relative,” de Botton says.
“So even though almost everyone on the planet thinks that either Siena or Paris is delightful and everyone thinks that Brisbane is a bit of a mess, we don't dare to speak.”
Unfortunately, readers quickly noticed that de Botton accidentally used a photograph of Ipswich to illustrate how ugly Brisbane was.
In a tweet, de Botton also linked to their story with the comment “why Brisbane is the ugliest city in Australia” but deleted this as well as a Facebook post that said the same thing.
The Swiss-born de Botton was in Brisbane for a talk on Friday about their latest book about the media, during which they said they did think the city was beautiful.
“I want to apologise to the good people of Brisbane. I have been made to see the error of my ways. Your city is beautiful,” de Botton said.
“I had declared Brisbane not just the ugliest city but apparently the ugliest city in the world.
“Sorry to disappoint people, but I said absolutely no such thing, and it just shows the power of the news to instil a narrative which then becomes lodged in people's minds.”
In an interview with The Courier Mail, de Botton said certain vistas of Brisbane, such as those in central Brisbane on the waterfront, might qualify as ugly, but this was not to say that every street was ugly.
“That part of Brisbane has been taken over by property developers who have been allowed to run riot for the sake of money,” de Botton.
They said that they did not blame property developers for trying to make money but local government in Brisbane had been unable to find a response to their proposals.
“They've created something in my mind that is not beautiful and partly it's because it's so chaotic.”
De Botton's article divided the public with many agreeing but many others defending the city, including Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk.
“GQ Magazine and Lonely Planet got it right when they said that Brisbane is the ‘hippest' city in Australia,” Cr Quirk said.

Haha yep. Bloody awful place. RT “@alaindebotton: Why Brisbane is the ugliest city in Australia: http://t.co/QKRa7f4ccj @bris_powerhouse” — Boydlee (@boydleep) March 27, 2014
Ouch! That's tough! "@alaindebotton: Why Brisbane is the ugliest city in Australia: http://t.co/Mhh6kxOyZC" — Georgie (@GWForce) March 27, 2014
In their article, de Botton blamed the situation on planning restrictions in Brisbane, which focused on health and safety issues such as the distance between street lights, or how tall a building should be, but nothing about whether it should be beautiful, noble, grand or elegant.
“People who have no interest whatsoever in making any city even remotely beautiful or dignified can get away with some truly terrible construction projects free of any fear of being criticised,” they said.
“And that's how modern Brisbane comes to look the way it does.”
De Botton, who has written a book called The Architecture of Happiness, said that cities which were beautiful like Siena, Paris, Bath and Edinburgh, all had one thing in common.
“In each case the planners in the past hit upon a pretty good basic model and imposed it widely. It wasn't the same model. But they were all good enough.
“But in Brisbane - and a lot of other modern cities - there was a fatal refusal to select any model at all. So the result is chaotic ugliness - which no one likes.”

Coywolf: A New Species of Canid Emerging
Coywolf (Wolf x Coyote)
Coyotes (Canis latrans) have always been the one species of canine that receives the short end of the stick of public opinion. The Looney Tunes character isn't portrayed as the brightest creature on Earth and many native myths have the coyote featured as a trickster and schemer. Coyotes are the only species of wild canine in the US that do not have an specific hunting season, and so they are hunted year round as a pest and troublemaker. Despite all this, they are clever animals, capable of surviving in extreme conditions, adapting to the presence of humans, modifying their litter rates, and eating just about anything they can get a hold of. They are so good at surviving that they don't need protection or help. Coyotes are masters at adaptation and now they are adapting again.
There are two distinct populations of coyotes in North America, Eastern and Western. They are physically very similar when you just look at their external trails (ears, nose, tail, etc). There is some variation in body size based on longitude, between males and females, with males being slightly larger in. Interestingly, the higher the latitude the larger the coyotes tend to be. Male coyotes in the northeastern US tend to be the largest (16.4 kg + 1.5 kg, about 36 lbs), but male and female coyotes in the northeast US are both larger than their western counterparts.
Coyotes and wolves are genetically related. Despite this fact, it has been found to be only the northeastern populations of coyotes that are able to successfully genetically interbreed with eastern wolves (Canis lycaon). So what's the deal? It's thought to be because eastern wolves are more closely related to western coyotes than western wolves (Canis lupus).
Confused yet? It is confusing, but it all boils down to this: eastern coyotes and eastern wolves (which are genetically coyote-like) are interbreeding to create a species of canid, which is being called the coywolf. Some have called it the "eastern coyote," but coywolves are genetically distinct from coyotes, with gene combinations of wolves and coyotes, so the name "coyote" doesn't really fit. Currently the range of coywolves is in Minnesota, Ontario, Quebec, and possibly New York and Washington DC.
Lehman et. al discovered that wolves can possess coyote-derived physical and genetic characteristics, but not the other way around. Coywolf hybridization has occurred because of male eastern wolves finding female eastern coyotes and interbreeding. The female passes on their mtDNA (maternal DNA) combined with the male's DNA.
In the Great Lakes regions the genetic soup gets even more interesting. There eastern timber wolves have bred with another grey wolf sub-species (Canis lupus nubilis), which means that the eastern coyotes that breed in those regions have grey wolf mixed with eastern timber wolves and mid-western coyote all together. It's quite a mix, and hard to keep straight.
Now you might think that all this hybridization of wolves and coyotes is a recent thing, but it is thought to have been taking place for many years, possibly the last 70-100 years. Coywolves and coyotes are sly, and secretive, but as they are encountering humans more and more we're beginning to notice them. Remember, coywolves are not invasive species, coming in from another country. They are native to North America and are American born and bred.
Compare the pictures above: TOP is a coyote, MIDDLE is a captive bred coywolf , and BOTTOM is an eastern grey wolf (Photos: Wiki commons).
So how are coyotes, coywolves, and eastern wolves the same (but different)? Genetically Northeastern coyotes are mostly western coyote (about 65% western coyote and 17% western wolf) while northeastern wolves are mostly wolf (about 23% western coyote and 50% western wolf). When these two species hybridize the result is close to 60%+ coyote and about 27% wolf (give or take) with a smattering of dog genes (10% or so).
Size is one of the most apparent differences between western coyotes, eastern wolves, and eastern coyotes/coywolves. In a study from the Canadian Field Naturalist Journal researchers found that the average mass of male western coyotes was 12.2 kg or 28 lbs, while eastern wolves was about 28.2kg or 62 lbs. Coywolves and eastern coyotes were between these two weights, around 16.5 kg or 36 lbs. Interestingly, the size of northeastern coyotes is thought to be close to the mass of Ice Age coyotes during the Pleistocene era, but that's a story for another time. (Click the link above to read the scientific paper about this theory.)
When you compare coywolves, eastern wolves, and coyotes side by side you can see some major differences. Coywolves appear to be a combination of wolf and coyote features, appearing larger and more wolf like than their coyote relatives. Their heads are wider and and larger, with larger jaw muscles and foreheads than coyotes, but smaller than wolves. Their ears are shorter and more rounded than wolves, and less pointy than coyotes. Coywolves tend to have markings that are closer to their wolf relatives too, though there are some exceptions. Like their coyote relatives, the pups of coywolves appear to be tan and coyote-like, but larger and stockier than true coyotes. These are generalizations, and there is a great deal of variation among individuals.
Coywolves are an evolving species of canid that is rapidly adapting to human urbanization. They are expanding their range from the forests into the urban jungles, and increasingly coming into contact with people. This contact isn't what you would think. They aren't eating cats and chasing joggers. They are quietly eating rats, squirrels, rabbits, and mice. They are even thought to play a role in maintaining Canada goose populations, like their wild wolf and coyote counterparts. There is some speculation that because of their size, which they get from their wolf relatives, that they may also play a role as an apex predator, controlling the population of white tailed deer in both rural and urban areas.
Coywolves have been shown to be smart too. Through GPS tracking scientists have learned that they can use human made corridors to travel, especially railroad tracks, highway medians, and urban margins. They can also den in marginal habitat areas where there may be little green space as long as there is enough food, they'll manage. Their life spans are unknown, but it is thought that they can live up to 10 years and maybe a bit more in these urban environments.
Here in DC, coywolves have reportedly been spotted, though yet to be confirmed, in Rock Creek Park, as recently as July of 2014. They are increasingly expanding their territory. There's nothing to be afraid of with these shy creatures. Rather, I'd suggest that they are a unique species to be admired for their adaptability. In geological terms they are new to the scene of evolution and speciation. One can only wonder where their populations are headed, and how they will change in relation to the human world.

Postmedia Network Canada Corp. has cut the jobs of several national writers and offered voluntary buyouts to newsroom staff at the Montreal Gazette, Ottawa Citizen and Windsor Star.
Employees learned of the latest round of cost-cutting on Thursday, as Postmedia continues to slash spending in the face of diminishing advertising revenue and high costs to service a long-term debt that stands at $483.5-million.
Misty Harris, who covered consumer and social trends, film critic Katherine Monk, science writer Margaret Munro and television columnist Alex Strachan were among those let go, sources said. Ms. Harris and Ms. Monk both posted messages to Twitter saying they were among the staff who lost their jobs.

"The axe has finally fallen after 13 years (like, 30 in newspaper time). Grateful for the time I had to do what I love," Ms. Harris wrote on the social network. None of the four writers could immediately be reached for comment.
At the Gazette, the "voluntary staff reduction program" is available to editorial employees, subject to management's discretion, and applications are due by Feb. 19 to leave the company by Feb. 27. The program offers three weeks salary per year of service to a maximum of 78 weeks or $150,000.
"The positions eliminated [Thursday] were national reporters in a couple of markets. National content creation will now be centralized at National Post," Postmedia spokesperson Phyllise Gelfand said in an e-mail. "This is consistent with other cost-cutting initiatives we have undertaken as we look to reduce costs in a challenging revenue environment."
The national writers whose positions were axed on Thursday were holdovers from Postmedia's defunct breaking-news wire service, and wrote for the company's online portal Canada.com. Postmedia elected to shutter its newswire in 2012, five years after it was founded by previous owner Canwest Global Communications to provide stories to the chain's 10 daily newspapers, which also include the Calgary Herald, Edmonton Journal and Vancouver Province.
At the time, Postmedia signed on with The Canadian Press. Then, last February, Postmedia laid off five staff members from its Parliamentary bureau in Ottawa and merged the rest of its federal political desk with the Ottawa Citizen.
Postmedia company is nearing the tail end of a three-year cost-cutting plan that had already yielded $112-million in annual savings, but continues to incur losses. In its most recent quarter, overall revenue fell 12.6 per cent to $169.5-million from a year earlier, mostly a result of plummeting print advertising sales.
The company is also awaiting regulatory approval for its planned purchase of Sun Media Corp.'s 173 English-language newspapers and digital publications from Quebecor Inc. for $316-million. The Competition Bureau could rule by early March on the purchase, which includes the Sun chain of papers in Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Winnipeg along with the London Free Press, free 24 Hours commuter papers in Toronto and Vancouver, and the English-language Canoe online portal.

A prospectus filed on Thursday as part of the proposed acquisition notes that "The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to reduce operating costs and expects these efforts to continue indefinitely."
"If your revenues continue to decline, your cost base has to decline. Otherwise you don't continue to exist," Postmedia president and CEO Paul Godfrey said in an interview at the company's annual general meeting in January. "It's just straight logic."
Four debates in, the previously fluid dynamics in the Republican presidential race appear to have solidified. Despite furious efforts on the part of every other candidate, the top three contenders for the nomination clung to their advantages.
The top eight candidates squared off in a primetime debate hosted by the Fox Business network and held in Milwaukee. An undercard debate earlier in the evening featured four of the runners-up.
After a furor over moderators' aggressive tone in the last debate, Tuesday's hosts from Fox Business News allowed the eight candidates to deliver lengthy, uninterrupted answers and avoided attempts to get them to engage with one another.
Notable on the day that the Fight for $15 effort to raise the minimum wage launched coordinated protests nationwide, many of the candidates spoke out against such a policy move. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has called for raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $12. Them chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has backed an increase to $15.
Though Donald Trump was able to monopolize some of the earlier debates, they were less of a central presence in Tuesday's primetime engagement. But they still held their own at several key moments, including during some testy exchanges with Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Ben Carson, second in national polls, got an opportunity to push back on some of the recent questions regarding their biography. And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, polished as ever, seemed likely to keep a grip on their new position as the GOP establishment's favorite, despite the best efforts of onetime heir apparent Jeb Bush.
Advisers for Bush — the frontrunner in the 2016 Republican contest until Trump surged in the polls this summer — had suggested their candidate would begin their comeback on Tuesday night with an energetic, feisty performance. And they did at times adopt a more aggressive posture than they had in prior debates, such as when they pushed back on Trump's proposal to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
“They're doing high fives right now in the Clinton campaign right now,” said Bush, implying that Trump's hardline stance would hurt the Republican party's shot at capturing some of the Latino vote.
The other candidates outside of the top three — including Kasich, Paul, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — also had their moments as they tried to break apart the campaign status quo.
Kasich interjected frequently and appeared intent on distinguishing themselves as one of the more forthright, no-nonsense candidates. They derided Trump's deportation plan as “silly” and defended the 2008 financial sector bailout against several other candidates by insisting the government could not “turn a blind eye” to the threat that households would see their savings disappear.
Fiorina spoke repeatedly of the need to “take our country back,” while Paul sparred with Trump and Rubio on separate occasions, accusing the latter in particular of failing to propose a conservative tax reform plan.
“How is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure to the federal government?” asked Paul, referring to Rubio's call for a child tax credit.
Paul and Rubio also fought over military spending, with Paul insisting that a large defense budget is not consistent with conservative principles.
“We cannot even have an economy if we're not safe,” said Rubio, alluding both to their support for a robust defense budget and the Tuesday debate's nominal status as an economy-focused affair.
“If you think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it,” seconded Cruz.
Rubio's call for more military spending was backed by Trump, who also they delved into the policy discussions in Tuesday's debate, including outlining their opposition to a new Asia-Pacific trade deal supported by many Republicans.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact signed last month by President Barack Obama with 11 other nations “was designed for China to come in through the back door and take advantage of everyone. … China takes advantage (of the U.S.) through currency manipulation.”
Paul corrected Trump, saying, “We might want to point out China is not part of this deal.”
Other candidates launched themselves at Trump after the frontrunner said they wouldn't mind if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to “knock the hell out of” the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Russia has inserted itself into the ongoing Syrian conflict, in alliance with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, against rebel forces that include ISIL.
Bush replied that Trump's proposed strategy of letting Assad, Putin, and ISIL snipe at each other was “like a board game.”
“That's not how the world works,” they said.
The inaccuracies in Carson's autobiography, a subject of much press attention in the week running up to the debate, received scarcely a mention from anyone onstage. Carson — who had admitted a few days prior that they had never been admitted into the West Point military academy, in seeming contradiction to a story in their autobiography — answered a question from a moderator about it early on, but none of the other candidates made much of it.
“I have no problem with being vetted, but I do have a problem with being lied about,” said Carson, who suggested they were being subjected to a media double standard compared to Hillary Clinton.
Carson was cheered by the debate audience when they suggested they were facing tougher scrutiny than Clinton. But they appeared to flounder on some policy questions, including a disconnected answer about whether they would break up big banks.
Cruz repeatedly played the populist. They railed against the “Washington cartel,” big government and even big banks. But in moment reminiscent of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry's “oops” debate debacle, Cruz blanked when it came to naming the five departments they would eliminate.
“The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, ah, the Department of Commerce and HUD,” Cruz said.
Fox Business News moderator Maria Bartiromo ignited a chorus of boos from the audience by referring to Clinton's resume as “impressive.” But the veteran anchor plowed ahead with their question to Rubio about how their experience makes them worthy of the presidency.
Rubio responded that “this election is about the future, about what kind of nation we're going to be in the 21st century.”
Cruz couldn't let an opportunity to strike at Clinton go unanswered, saying “Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism of Washington.”
Closing statements focused on fiscal policy, the future and Clinton.
Trump said “we cannot let Hillary Clinton, who is the worst secretary of state in the history of our country, win this election.” Fiorina said a “Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation.” And Kasich said they worried about what would happen if Clinton or Bernie Sanders won the presidency.
Paul argued they were the “only fiscal conservative on stage.” Cruz stressed their commitment to “free-market principles.”
Rubio repeated their forward-looking message, promising a “new American century.” Bush pledged to be a commander-in-chief, not a “divider-in-chief.”
Carson spoke of several issues, including drug overdoses, rising debt and abortion. They said it was time to change the “narrative,” adding, “there is something special about this nation and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.”
The field returns to the campaign trail on Wednesday where polls will determine if any of the candidates other than Trump, Carson and Rubio were successful in disrupting the campaign hierarchy. The next Republican debate, hosted by CNN, will take place Dec. 15, in Las Vegas.

The heat wave has left dozens of people dead and pushed thermometers above 104 degrees in at least 40 cities and counties.
People try to cool off at a water park in Suining, China, last weekend, as a heat wave hit several provinces in China. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights Eggs are hatching without incubators and a highway billboard has caught fire by itself.
Extreme heat is expected to grip much of China through mid-August.
Highest temperature recorded so far is 108 degrees F.
SHANGHAI (AP) - It's been so hot in China that folks are grilling shrimp on manhole covers, eggs are hatching without incubators and a highway billboard has mysteriously caught fire by itself.
The heat wave -- the worst in at least 140 years in some parts -- has left dozens of people dead and pushed thermometers above 104 degrees F in at least 40 cities and counties, mostly in the south and east. Authorities for the first time have declared the heat a "level 2" weather emergency -- a label normally invoked for typhoons and flooding.
"It is just hot! Like in a food steamer!" 17-year-old student Xu Sichen said outside the doors of a shopping mall in the southern financial hub of Shanghai while their friend They Jiali, also 17, complained that their mobile phone had in recent days turned into a "grenade."
"I'm so worried that the phone will explode while I'm using it," they said.
Extreme heat began hitting Shanghai and several eastern and southern provinces in early July and is expected to grip much of China through mid-August.
Shanghai set its record high temperature of 105 degrees F on July 26, and Thursday's heat marked the city's 28th day above 35 C. At least 10 people died of heat stroke in the city over the past month, including a 64-year-old Taiwanese sailor, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Wu Guiyun, 50, who has a part-time job making food deliveries in Shanghai, said they have been trying to linger inside air-conditioned offices for as long as possible whenever they bring in a takeout order. Outside, they said: "It's so hot that I can hardly breathe."
The highest temperature overall was recorded in the eastern city of Fenghua, which recorded its historic high of 108.9 degrees F on July 24.
On Tuesday, the director of the China Meteorological Administration activated a "level 2" emergency response to the persistent heat wave. This level requires around-the-clock staffing, the establishment of an emergency command center and frequent briefings.
Some Chinese in heat-stricken cities have been cooking shrimps, eggs and bacon in skillets placed directly on manhole covers or on road pavement that has in some cases heated up to 140 degrees F.
In one photo displayed prominently in the China Daily newspaper, a boy tended to shrimps and an egg in a pan over a manhole cover in eastern Chinese city of Jinan.
In the port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, glass has cracked in the heat, vehicles have self-combusted, and a highway billboard caught fire by itself, sending up black smoke in the air, according to China Central Television. The broadcaster said the heat might have shorted an electrical circuit on the billboard.
In the southern province of Hunan, a housewife grabbed several eggs stored at room temperature only to find half-hatched chicks, state media reported.
A joke making the rounds: The only difference between me and barbequed meat is a little bit of cumin.

North Korea Violates Maritime Border Again
By MarEx 2014-02-25 11:17:00
A North Korean patrol boat violated a maritime border with South Korea several times late on Monday. This is the first reported maritime incursion of 2014 between the two Koreas.
A 420 metric-ton vessel made three cross-border trips during the night and left after 2 a.m. The ship spent a few hours in South Korean waters before returning after repeated warnings from the South. The South broadcast warnings 10 times before the ship returned. There was no exchange of fire.
The incursions took place 13 nautical miles west of South Korea's Yeongpyeong Island, off the west coast of the Korean peninsula. The ship was said to have come within 15 miles of South Korea's border island of Baengnyeong.
The North Korean patrol ship crossed the Northern Limit Line (NLL), which South Korea considers the maritime border between the two sides. North Korea openly disputes the maritime border and has sent boats across it in the past.
The NLL was drawn unilaterally by the United Nations Command at the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War. However, North Korea has drawn its own border further south of the line.
A South Korean defense ministry spokesperson stated that the North Korean ship's NLL violation is seen as part of military drills, adding that the ship seems to be testing the South Korean military.
Monday's incident comes on the same day joint annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises began. More than 12,500 U.S. troops will take part in the exercises, which include Key Resolve, a computer-based simulation, and Foal Eagle, which involves air, ground and naval drills. North Korea is opposed to the drills and has previously called them "exercises of war".

“The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.” ~Alan Watts
It was late 2012, just after Christmas, and like many others I was reflecting on the year.
I realized that I had ample room for improvement in too many areas of my life, but knowing that New Year's Resolutions have a poor 8 percent success rate (University of Scranton research), I wanted to explore some other options. I knew I wanted to start before January 1st too, because arbitrary start dates don't sit well with me.
On December 28th, I decided that I wanted to get in great shape. In the previous days and weeks, however, I hardly exercised at all and felt quite guilty about it. My goal was a thirty-minute workout, and it seemed impossible.
I wasn't motivated, I was tired, and my guilt was making me feel worthless. Feeling stuck, I remembered a technique I learned from a book, and little did I know that this technique would change my life in a big way in 2013.
The technique is from the creativity book Thinkertoys, and it is to consider the opposite of an idea you're stuck on. So I looked at my thirty-minute exercise goal, and my giant fitness plan to get in great shape, and I thought about the opposite.
You could say the opposite is eating fast food and sitting on the couch, but the opposite that came to my mind was one of size.
What if, instead of carrying around this overwhelming fitness anvil on my shoulders, I just did one push-up?
Initially, I scoffed at the idea. How absurd to do a single push-up and act as if it means anything! But when I continued to struggle with my bigger plans, I finally gave in to the idea and did one, and since I was already in push-up position, I did a few more.
After that, my muscles were warmed up, and I decided to try one pull-up. Just like you guessed, I ended up doing several more. Eventually, I had exercised for thirty minutes.
My mind was blown—did I just turn a single push-up into a full workout? Yes, yes I did.
The One Push-Up Challenge Is Born
From here, I challenged my blog readers to do at least one push-up per day for a full year. People have had great success with it, and here's what it turned into for me: For the last three-plus months, I have gone to the gym three to six times per week to exercise and I'm in great shape because of it. Now I know why it works.
I have always held a keen interest in psychology and neuroscience, and I study them for my writing. So when I read about the studies on willpower that show it's a limited resource, everything started making sense.
I couldn't do my thirty-minute workout because my willpower wasn't strong enough or was depleted. But I could do one push-up and segue into a thirty-minute workout because it only required a tiny amount of willpower to start, after which my body and mind stopped resisting the idea.
Of course, this concept does not only apply to fitness, but to any area of your life you wish to change. And I believe I've found the perfect way to leverage this technique – habits.
What's More Important Than Your Habits?
Nothing. Habits form about 45 percent of your total behavior, according to a Duke University study. Not only that, but they are behaviors that you repeat frequently, which compounds their significance in your life. Habits are your foundation, and if this foundation is weak, you won't be happy with the way you live.
The reason people fail to change their lives, and fail to instill new habits, is because they try to do too much at once. In simplest terms, if your new habit requires more willpower than you can muster, you will fail. If your new habit requires less willpower than you can muster, you will succeed.
The calculation can't just be for one instance, however, but also for when you're tired and your willpower is zapped. Can you continue it then?
One thing I've been wanting to do more is written. It's therapeutic for me and I write for a living, so it's fairly important that I practice. When I found that I wasn't writing as much as I should, I found out how to combine the power of The One Push-Up Challenge with a habit plan.
How To Change Your Life With Mini Habits
Mini habits are exactly as they sound. First, you choose a desired habit or change you'd like to make—it could be thinking more positively, writing 1,000 words a day, or reading two books per week. I've had success doing three at once.
Next, you shrink these habits down until they are “stupid small,” a term I made up because when you say the requirement out loud, it is so small that it sounds stupid. Here are mine:
1. Write fifty words per day (article, story, etc.)
2. Write fifty words per day (for the habits book I'm writing)
3. Read two pages in a book per day
Easy, right? I could complete this list in ten minutes total. So far, I've met these daily requirements 100 percent of the time, and then much more.
I've actually written one to two thousand words and read ten to thirty pages per day, for these twelve days in a row and counting. Prior to this, I wasn't reading at all and writing very little.
It works because your brain falls for the bait.
“Oh, only fifty words? I can write that.”
And then you start. And you'll find, like I have, that once you start, good things happen.
Ten Daily Mini Habit Ideas
1. Compliment one person
2. Think two positive thoughts
3. Meditate for one minute
4. Name three things you're thankful for
5. Do one push-up
6. Write fifty words
7. Read two pages
8. Do ten jumping jacks
9. Go outside and take 100 steps
10. Drink one glass of water
You can change nearly any area of your life, and at one mini habit at a time, it's easier than you think.
When you remove the pressure and expectations, you allow yourself to start.

A Newfoundland photographer is apologizing for a temper tantrum while taking pictures of children with a mall Santa Claus, but says they had a good reason for losing the Christmas spirit.
"I wouldn't necessarily agree with [calling it] a Grinch moment. I had a human moment. I'm honestly sorry," said Robert Thornhill.
They blame their outburst on the fact that too many of their customers get their photos printed at the mall's Walmart instead of using their service.
I did lose my temper that day, and I am sorry. - Robert Thornhill
Thornhill has photographed children with Santa at the Trinity Conception Square Mall in Carbonear for the past few years.
"I loved that job. Seeing kids' faces light up for Santa Claus is the most amazing feeling," they told the St. John's Morning Show.
That is, until last week when they decided to quit.
The final straw was when a woman blatantly told them they only wanted one photo instead of a multiphoto package because they planned on going straight to Walmart to scan it and print more.
"Admittedly, I did lose my temper that day, and I am sorry," Thornhill said.

They said there were two families there at the time, and he's apologized to them for lashing out the way they did.
"When pushed against the wall, I don't know what to do. There were very few people there; it's not the way people are making it out to be. There was no lineup of people or anything like that," they said.
"I am sorry, and going forward I am trying to provide a Santa Claus for people at other locations. But I can't have Walmart enable the copying of my pictures."
The Trinity Conception Square Mall has confirmed with CBC that it has found a new photographer to take Santa photos.
Claims it's copyright infringement
Thornhill says they were offering to print a single 4x6 photo for $5 or a package of four for $15.
They say at Walmart, people can get a print for 20 cents, which is frustrating because they simply can't compete with those prices.
Thornhill claims the Walmart photo lab is "enabling" the reproduction of their work, and he's actually in talks with a lawyer to see if they have a case for copyright infringement.

"I went up to Walmart and asked to speak to the manager and they basically said, the answer I got was shrugged shoulders saying 'well, there's nothing I can do,'" they said.
"It's not just me as an artist. It's artists in general. Anyone that takes a picture, if you're copying their work, you're taking money from their pocket."
In a response to CBC, Walmart Canada said it is aware of the situation, and is open to discussing the matter further with Thornhill.
It also said the photo kiosk is a self-serve machine that's available to anyone to use at their convenience. Walmart doesn't monitor the kiosk and has no control over what photograph the user decides to reproduce.
While he's still mad at Walmart, Thornhill admits they could have handled the mall incident better.
They will still photograph children with Santa at other locations, where they said there is less of a chance that they will be undercut.
Weight Isn't Just a Cosmetic Issue
By Cheryl Lock
According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), 54% of the nation's dogs and cats are overweight, and the founder of APOP, Ernie Ward, DVM, is really not happy about it.
“We often try to compare what's happening with our pets to the childhood obesity epidemic, since it's a similar pattern that emerges,” said Dr. Ward. “The biggest problem is that by the time most people recognize the problem, it's often too late.”
So why is it that having an obese cat is such a problem? Dr. Ward broke it down.
The Two Main Problems with Overweight Cats
There are really two factors to keep in mind when you consider the issues associated with overweight and obese pets, says Dr. Ward: health and money.
The first, health, should come as no surprise to those who are aware of all the health issues that overweight people have to deal with. “It's not only the fact that obese pets face a shorter life expectancy, but it's the quality of the life they're leading in the first place,” says the doctor.
A few of the major health issues that obese cats have to deal with include osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart and respiratory disease, kidney disease, cancer, and more.
“The real heartbreaker for me as a vet, though, is that these pets have such a diminished quality of life,” Dr. Ward said. “I see the consequences, and I wish for those pets that I could roll back the tape to five years ago and say ‘Let's change a few minor things here and there and we could have avoided all of this.' It's avoidable, not inevitable.”
Besides the health factors, Dr. Ward is also astounded by the amount of money that is spent when it comes to treating obese pets. They estimate that obese animals are costing owners tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in unnecessary medical bills each year. “From an economic perspective this is huge,” they said. In fact, according to Dr. Ward, a lot of the vet care expenses associated with weight issues would go away if we would all start making smarter and better food choices for our pets. You heard that right; better pet food choices can save you money!
The Road to a Solution
Dr. Ward suggests a few very specific steps when it comes to preventing and treating cats that are overweight or obese — and it starts with a conversation.
“I'm demanding of my profession,” says Dr. Ward. “Pet owners will come to me and say, ‘I asked my vet about my pet's weight and they didn't seem interested.' When it comes to your pet's weight, it's crucial to find a vet who's interested and knowledgeable. If you're not having a conversation with your vet about what you're feeding your pet and how much you're feeding him, you're missing an important step to preventative health care.”
Aside from keeping the lines of communication open with your veterinarian, Dr. Ward also suggests the following to monitor your cat's weight:
Measure your cat's food. Dr. Ward says that in survey after survey pet owners admit to eyeballing or "guestimating" how much food they feed their cats on a daily basis. The right thing to do? Ask your vet exactly how much food you should be feeding your cat, get a measuring cup and give your furry friend exactly that amount each day — no more, no less. “And check back with your vet each year for the amount,” says Dr. Ward. “Just because you fed your cat one cup last year doesn't mean they should be getting the same this year.”

Often when we feel guilty about not being able to spend as much time with our pets, we satisfy them with additional treats, says Dr. Ward. While it's unnecessary to stop giving your furry friend treats altogether, they suggest keeping an eye on it, and not going overboard when giving out treats — especially with cat treats that are high in fat and sugar.

While it's unnecessary to stop giving your furry friend treats altogether, they suggest keeping an eye on it, and not going overboard when giving out treats — especially with cat treats that are high in fat and sugar. Consider canned food for cats. A cat's metabolism works differently than that of humans, or even dogs, and so when they become obese, there's no simple way to exercise the weight off of them. “That's why I always suggest my cat owners switch to canned food,” says Dr. Ward. “It's an easy way to make sure we're feeding our cats only the amount of food they need.” In fact, over the years APOP has run tests on popular cat food brands and found that even if you only overfeed your cat an average 10 extra dry bits of food per day, that adds up to about a pound of weight gain per year for the average cat. “If a cat is struggling to maintain a healthy weight, switching might just do the trick.”
If you think your own cat might be at risk for being overweight or obese, your first line of action is to make an appointment with your veterinarian. “Of all the decisions pet owners make regarding their animal's health, the most important is what we choose to feed them,” said Dr. Ward. “It's not rocket science or a medical secret, just good old fashioned food measuring and making smart choices. That alone can have tremendous impacts on the length of quality of your pet's life.”

PASADENA, Md. — A man survived being shot in the stomach while kayaking over the weekend, and police are looking Monday for the person who shot him.
David Seafolk-Kopp, 56, of Reston, Va., blacked out after the incident, spent the night in their kayak and made it to shore more than 12 hours later. They said they launched their kayak from a friend's home here Saturday night to stargaze and eventually stopped to take a rest.
That's when they saw a bonfire at about 10 p.m. ET and heard what sounded like a party on the shore of Bodkin Creek, a Chesapeake Bay tributary, they told police. The man said they saw a laser-like red dot on their shirt and felt pain in their abdomen.
"It's a little surprising. This is an older community on the water, so it's a little bit shocking and sad that someone would do that," resident Gus Andujar told WBAL-TV, Baltimore.
Seafolk-Kopp made it to shore about 10:30 a.m. Sunday where a resident discovered him. They were released from an area hospital Sunday night.
Investigators have no suspects, said Candy Thomson, spokesperson for Maryland Natural Resources Police. And Seafolk-Kopp's wound is not consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than dynamite.
Don't worry - it's all safe and stable as long as the battery pack for our electric skateboard drivetrain is well monitored and managed. Badly designed skateboard battery cells or constant mistreatment lead to fire, flammable gases and even explosions.
'Thermal runaway' - aka 'venting with flame' - starts small and invisibly. Cheap or inadequate battery management causes damage to cells by letting them overheat, pulling too much current or forcing too much charge into them. This causes irreversible changes in chemistry or structure that leads to internal shorting. The battery's concentrated energy is turned inward in a chain reaction by rocketing temperatures that can spread to cells in close contact, like in cheap shrink-wrapped packs.
Not every battery failure makes the news – most just hit your wallet. Settling for bargain skateboard battery packs means that the originally rated 500 to 1,000 charge cycles will drop drastically, losing capacity and requiring a replacement much earlier.
How did Mellow design safety, performance and an electric skateboard battery life target of over 1000 discharge cycles?
Mellow deliberately avoided superthin and immature battery formats, selecting the dependable 18650-sized cell as used by Tesla and other electric vehicles. The model Samsung INR18650-20R used in our packs has a rock-solid reputation since 2013 and is easily capable of delivering high constant current for awesome torque while keeping cool.
Due to our low IR-MosFet technology and our proprietary pack design, the Mellow Battery Pack can provide very high currents (read acceleration) at any state of charge.
The care and feeding of lithium-ion electric skateboard batteries
A lithium-ion battery should be handled almost like an infant: cosy (flame-retardant) bedding, constant monitoring and gentle feeding. These particular babies will spend their time hanging on the bottom of a skateboard, hurtling downhill at over 40 km/h, or being banged against sidewalks, rocks, mud, and snapper turtles, so Mellow doubled (and tripled) down on battery pack design. The battery's housing is made of a high impact strength PC-ABS material that offers great weight to strength ration and is almost impossible to break. Its waterproofness was approved under the requirements of IP65 for reliable function in rainy weather conditions.
Having external BMS and cell balancers is like hiring a babysitter from the shady pages of Craigslist. That's why we've integrated such systems directly onboard in each Mellow battery pack. Inside the battery a custom made battery management system (BMS) monitors and protects each cell of the battery at all times. Moreover, our babysitter (uh…battery pack manufacturer) is experienced: 25 years in the business, supplier of Airbus and Siemens.

Battery Pack Juice delivery
Mellow has eliminated two critical performance issues in other motorized skateboards on the market today, including pricier models: 'voltage sag shutdown' (following hill climbing due to inaccurate reading of batteries are empty due to voltage fluctuations) and 'regenerative brake shutdown' (braking cuts off or doesn't work on downhills due to full battery.)
The BMS uses triple fuel gauge measurements (voltage, Coulomb counting, Impedance Track) to accurately read battery level and eliminate false alerts. Mellow's dual brake makes it immune to the dark side of regen braking, which shuts down or even damages full batteries on e-skates not equipped with a backup brake system.
Together with Mellow's custom high efficiency motors, the motorized skateboard battery pack safely delivers the power needed for speeds up to 40 km/h top speed, along with 20% hill climbing and 15 km range.
The transparent Battery Packs featured above are for demonstration purposes only. Production units are black with a TPE blue rubber layer.

WASHINGTON (JTA) — During their 30 years in the clubby confines of the U.S. Senate, Arlen Specter never lost their acerbic prosecutorial zeal, friends and associates say.
The insistent questions, the commitment to independence that made the longtime Pennsylvania senator a critical player in recent U.S. history, ultimately did in their career. In their 2010 bid for a sixth term, Specter lost the support of both Democrats and Republicans.
Specter, who had been the longest-serving U.S. senator from their state, died Sunday of complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They were 82.
Their iconoclasm was their brand, from the outset of their career, when they made a name for themselves as the young Philadelphia assistant district attorney on the Warren Commission who first postulated that a single bullet hit both President John F. Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally.
And they wore their independence as a badge of honor: The pro-choice Republican who helped fell Robert Bork's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, and then ensured Clarence Thomas' ascension by leading what many liberal groups saw as the smearing of Anita Hill, a one-time aide to Thomas who had accused the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of sexually harassing them The pro-Israel stalwart who enjoyed their one-on-ones with some of the Middle East's most bloodstained tyrants.
Running for district attorney in Philadelphia in 1965, they left the Democratic Party, but returned in 2009, frustrated with what they said was the Republican Party's lurch rightward. Specter the Democrat helped pass President Obama's health care reforms.
“He would tell me, ‘Every morning I wake up I look in the mirror and I see the toughest guy in politics,' ” recalled Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America who first lobbied and then befriended Specter.
Specter, who represented Pennsylvania in the Senate from 1981 to 2011, was shaped by their childhood as the only Jewish kid in their class in a small Midwestern town, Russell, Kan., said David Brog, a longtime aide to Specter who eventually rose to be their chief of staff.
“He was a tough Jew,” Brog said. Specter's upbringing — helping out their father, a peddler and scrap metal business owner, when they were barely beyond toddler age — was a factor in their pro-Israel leadership, Brog said.
“He saw a little of Israel in themselves as the only Jew in their class in Russell,” they said.
Although their sisters were Orthodox Jewish, Specter themselves was not outwardly religious, though they had a strong sense of Jewish identity.
Brog noted that on their visits to the Jewish state, Specter would make a point of visiting the grave of their father, who came to the United States from what is now Ukraine, and who wished to be buried in Israel.
Specter was a congressional leader in advancing the cause of Soviet Jews, recalled Mark Levin, who directs NCSJ, the former National Council on Soviet Jewry.
“He had a particular interest in addressing these issues through legal means,” Levin said, particularly by leveraging international human rights laws. Specter would grill their interlocutors from the Soviet Jewry activist movement, asking them to come up with new avenues to leverage the Soviet Union and other European states.
“He wanted to know what more could be done, at the most difficult time when so few people were getting out,” Levin said. “What more could we do, whom do we need to speak to, what do we need to focus on? They were tough but fair.”
Specter also helped preserve the Lautenberg Amendment, named for Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), which eased immigration for refugees from persecution. Designed as a way to advance the exodus of Soviet Jews, Specter extended the amendment to minorities from other nations, including Iran.
“A prescient leader, they understood early on that religious minorities within Iran needed special protection,” said a statement from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. “The senator never forgot their Jewish roots, and their legacy within the Jewish community is great.”
Specter throughout their career was a pro-Israel leader, in recent years leading efforts to condition aid to the Palestinian Authority on its peace process performance. They also aimed to protect Jewish students on campuses from anti-Israel harassment.
An array of Jewish and pro-Israel groups mourned their passing.
“Time and time again, Sen. Specter worked to ensure that America's ally had the resources necessary to defend themselves and protect U.S. interests in the Middle East,” the American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in a statement. “He was a good friend of our organization and a leading architect of the congressional bond between our country and Israel.”
The Israeli Embassy in Washington called Specter “ an unswerving defender of the Jewish State and a stalwart advocate of peace.”
Yet Specter also courted the region's tyrants, including Iraq's Saddam Hussein and the Assads in Syria. They longed for a role brokering peace between Israel and Syria, even after their departure from the Senate.
“He visited these tyrants and they were convinced that they could convince them to moderate their policies,” Klein said. “And as we know, they never did.”
Brog said that Specter relished, from their days as a prosecutor, the challenge of going toe to toe with bad guys and getting them to stand down.
“He and Hafez Assad would sit for hours on end drinking tea, seeing who would need to go for a bathroom break first,” Brog said, referring to the late Syrian strongman and father of the country's current ruler, Bashar Assad.
More seriously, Brog said, Specter was committed to creating an environment friendly to peacemaking for Israel by forging a deal with its most recalcitrant neighbor.
“The prize was, if you could get Syria, the most extreme of Israel's neighbors, to sign a peace deal, you could create a climate in the region,” they said.
Specter's independence took a toll on their staff, Brog said.
“Every single vote they wanted a briefing on the merits without just knowing how the party wanted the vote,” they said.
Specter was an exacting boss, Brog said, and notorious for sending staffers packing.
“Those of us who stayed with them saw this as a very good thing,” said Brog, who now serves as executive director of Christians United for Israel. “I look at my professional standards from before and after, and I see how I grew as a professional.”
Nominees for the federal bench were a regular target of their difficult questions, said Sammie Moshenberg, the Washington director of the National Council of Jewish Women.
“He was always independent and was proud of the fact that they went with their conscience,” they said.
Moshenberg found their tough questions gratifying when Specter grilled nominees on reproductive rights, but recalled being “infuriated” when they accused Hill of perjuring themselves in accusing Thomas of sexual harassment.
“I remember standing in the Senate reception room waiting for them to vote and thanking them at times, and expressing disappointment at other times,” they said. “Many times I got to thank him.”
As the political climate grew more polarized, Specter found themselves assailed by the left and the right. In 2004 they barely fended off a Republican primary challenge from their right by Rep. Pat Toomey.
Five years later, realizing they would likely not be able to beat Toomey again, Specter switched parties, saying the GOP had “moved far to the right.” Yet the Democratic Party proved no more welcoming; they lost in the 2010 primary to Rep. Joe Sestak, who in turn was defeated by Toomey in the general election.
The Jewish affiliates of both parties issued statements commemorating Specter's career. Each emphasized different aspects of their career — the National Jewish Democratic Council called them a “crucial voice of moderation” and the Republican Jewish Coalition said they were a “staunch supporter of Israel.”
But the groups echoed one another in describing Specter's higher calling: The RJC noted that they were a “devoted public servant,” and the NJDC called them a “consummate public servant.”
Kid Rock, Randy Travis and Dolly Parton among other top country music stars have cut ties with power publicist Kirt Webster following multiple accusations of sexual abuse against Webster.
Parton addressed the allegations against their longtime publicist on Twitter late Thursday.
"I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years and they have done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true," they tweeted.
A rep for Kid Rock told Fox News the singer was no longer working with Webster days after a former client accused Webster of drugging and sexually assaulting them -- a claim Webster denies.
The rocker, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told us in a statement they take accusations of sexual assault and mistreatment of others "dead seriously."
"I never witnessed or heard about any of this outside that they were probably gay, which I could care less about. We [Ritchie's record label] cancelled [Webster] and their companies services upon not only hearing about these, but other rumors that are starting to swirl," the statement said. "I hope to god this s--t they are being accused of is not true as they have been nothing but a good friend to me. But if it comes to light that it is, I will be the first to cut the head off the snake."
They added, "I believe sexual harassment is like cancer. We all know someone affected by it and it has to stop."
Charlie Daniels told Fox News they had fired Webster.
""I know absolutely nothing about Kirt Webster's personal life and am not by any means qualified to comment on it. All of our ties with Webster and Associates have been severed and I will have no further comment on the situation," they said.
A source close to Travis also told Fox News the country legend had dropped Webster.
Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, Billy Ray Cyrus and Justin Moore are no longer listed as clients on the Webster PR website.
By midday Thursday Webster PR had deleted its client page from the company's website. A spokesperson told Fox News Wednesday that Webster PR will continue servicing clients under the new name Westby PR led by former Webster Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby.
However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.
Fox News was told Webster will take "some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him."
While several artists have quietly fired Webster, they have not released statements.
Former client Austin Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News they suffered months of abuse at the hands of Webster and a former intern told us Webster propositioned them for sex while at work.
Five other former Webster employees claimed to Fox News the atmosphere at Webster PR was rampant with sexual harassment that included their boss showing them pornography.

Last week I read a pair of books by Dave Eggers---A Hologram For The King and Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever? In both of these novels, the central theme is pretty obvious: as a modern, middle-class man, with no grand, unifying cause---no popular war, no NASA-sponsored mission to the moon---where are we supposed to find purpose?
It's not a question with an easy answer, and, even more unsettlingly, the fact that it's relevant implies a level of privilege and frivolous malaise that feels indulgent in a world that still houses abundant strife and deprivation. You know, existential purpose only becomes a "problem" once the basics of life---food, clothing, shelter---are met with ease. And plenty of people around the world are still struggling to consistently attain those essentials.
Nevertheless, this is a comfort I---and a lot of others in our current society---inhabit, so the mind agitates. On a recent RadioLab podcast episode, the hosts assigned this need for strife as the impetus for the invention of American football at Yale University around the turn of the 20th Century. Without a front line of bayonets and trenches, young men could now assert their masculinity and agency in a game of contrived battle, incrementally muscling a funny-shaped ball down a grassy field to the raucous adulation of rabid spectators.
I have heard this same deep-seated need---for a proving ground, a resistance or challenge to throw oneself at, a surrogate purpose beyond basic creature comforts---offered as the motivation behind the otherwise arbitrary, often absurd, and frequently fantastically dangerous pursuit of wild, technical mountain summits.
I am ambivalent as to how valid this concept is for me. Certainly, challenge is essential to me for the learning and growth it induces. However, I've never found the my-life-is-at-stake fear aspect to be nearly as appealing or necessary. There's a widely-held belief that risk is what defines climbing. Without it, you're basically just out for a walk in the hills. This may be true, but I personally abhor adrenaline and fear.
Instead, for me, the goal has become a kind of all-encompassing integration. I much prefer occupying that space where the right confluence of skill, effort and difficulty renders everything effortless, preternaturally aligned, magical even. Getting there often requires much effort and absolute presence---in fact, I think these things are the main ingredients---but I've always found true risk and the associated terror to only detract from the experience.
So, while I often feel guilty at having to contrive difficulty and struggle in my day-to-day life---by pushing myself in the mountains---I am certainly grateful that doing so is my choice, and that the challenge usually assumes more the form of overcoming inertia, vertical feet, and inclement weather, not mortars or malnutrition. And that the rewards aren't simple survival, but rather, ragged breathing, unbridled joy, and a deep confidence that I am both way more insignificant and way more capable than just staying at home on the couch would otherwise let me believe.

The James B. Hunt Library at North Carolina State University looks a lot like the library of the future on the outside and inside.
It boasts of cutting-edge technology and modern architectural design. This library has, among a few other things, a 3D Printer Makerspace, a creativity studio that houses the advanced version of the Navy's Mariner Skills Simulator, a game lab, and, of course, a robot librarian called the bookBot.
Probably one of the first things people notice when they enter the James B. Hunt Library are the robotic cranes going up and down in one part of the library. The bookBot is an automated book delivery system.
Anybody looking for a book only needs to select the book from a virtual catalog and one of the robotic cranes will automatically retrieve the book from the library's underground storage. The book is then delivered to an operator who sends it to an “Ask Us” center or to any location on campus via a delivery service. The process can be triggered anywhere, within the library, anywhere on campus or even on the bus using a mobile device to access the online catalog.
The library has 18,000 underground storage bins which are high-density shelving units that can hold 2 million books in one-ninth of the space of traditional libraries. The mechanism being used by the bookBot isn't a new thing and has been used in manufacturing for years.

WASHINGTON — An appeal over Christmas sweets turned bitter on Monday (June 11) when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the so-called “Christian candy cane” case.
The case out of Texas has become a rallying point for conservative Christians concerned about free religious expression in public schools and students' ability to distribute religious literature.
The case, Morgan v. Swanson, kicked off nine years ago in the Plano Independent School District as principals prevented self-described evangelical students from distributing religious literature on school grounds.
In one instance, principal Lynn Swanson stopped third-grader Jonathan Morgan from distributing a Christian-themed bookmark at a winter break party. The boy wanted to hand out candy-cane shaped pens along with a card purporting to explain the holiday treat's Christian roots.
The card read in part: “So, every time you see a candy cane, remember the message of the candy maker: Jesus is the Christ!”
In other instances, principal Jackie Bomchill prevented second-grader Stephanie Versher from passing out Passion play tickets and pencils with the message, “Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so” on school grounds.
Last year, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the principals were within their rights in stopping the candy canes, but also found restrictions on student speech unconstitutional.
The principals were exempt under “qualified immunity,” which protects government officials from violating a law that is not “clearly established.” The Supreme Court's decision not to intervene means that ruling stands.
Hiram Sasser, who represented the families on behalf of the Texas-based Liberty Institute law firm, was disappointed in the latest decision.
“We were hoping to finally put this issue to rest: that government school officials should be held accountable when they violate the law and students' First Amendment rights. No student should be subjected to religious discrimination by the government,” they said in a press release.
Dallas attorney Tom Brandt, who represented the two principals, said the case was never about First Amendment speech but rather protection for teachers. “Educators must be allowed to make decisions that are in the best interest of an entire school without fear of individual retribution when the law is unclear,” they said.
While the educators' immunity question is settled, other parts of the case continue to work their way through the district and circuit court levels, and Sasser said there's still a possibility to win on students' rights.
“I'm concerned that some government school officials received the wrong message, which is that if they violate the law, no court is going to hold them accountable,” Sasser said in a telephone interview. “Hopefully the message is that from now on, government officials (teachers) will be held accountable.”

Prime Minister's Department tries to hide Turnbull Government frontbencher's bid for extra perks
Updated
The Prime Minister's Department has lost a two-year fight to conceal a minister's bid for thousands of dollars in extra pollie-perks, including charter flights and boat rides.
Key points: Most MPs and senators' submissions released in inquiry, Dr Gillespie's was kept hidden
PM's Department said the documents couldn't be revealed because they contained "sensitive" personal information
Documents reveal Dr Gillespie wanted extra charter and travel allowance, an additional office and employee
Former speaker Bronwyn Bishop's taxpayer-funded helicopter ride sparked an inquiry into politicians' entitlements.
Most MPs and senators' submissions were publicly released, but bureaucrats decided to hide Nationals MP David Gillespie's proposal.
After lengthy freedom of information (FOI) battle, the ABC can reveal Dr Gillespie argued politicians in seats like theirs should annually be given:
Nearly $15,000 extra "charter allowance" for charter flights, hire cars, boat rides or taxis
14 days more travel allowance for overnight stays within the electorate
An additional office
One more full-time employee
Dr Gillespie is the member for Lyne on the New South Wales mid-north coast.
They argued the boost would help meet "the significant logistical challenges that confront all rural MPs in meeting the needs and expectations of their constituents".
"If the additional costs are $10 million, it is a small price to pay to ensure fairness within our democracy is delivered," they wrote in the October 2015 submission.
Dr Gillespie wanted extra expenses for all electorates 10,000 square kilometres or larger.
The Assistant Health Minister's seat is about 16,000 square kilometres in size, and includes towns of Taree and Wauchope.
If implemented today, 24 Coalition MPs would benefit, along with six Labor members and two independents.
Electorates 100,000 square kilometres or larger would have received an even bigger windfall under the blueprint.
But the Government has only partly adopted one of their ideas by funding an extra office in Australia's seven biggest electorates — a group of seats that does not include Lyne.
FOI watchdog rejects excuses from PM's Department
The wish list could only be revealed after the Australian Information Commissioner told the Prime Minister's Department to stop hiding it.
Public servants have tried to shield the Government MP from scrutiny since March 2016, when they claimed handing over 10 politicians' submissions would be too much work.
They argued the task would "substantially and unreasonably divert the resources" of the department, which employs nearly 2,300 staff.
The agency then stonewalled a scaled-back FOI request in June 2016, arguing the submission (below) could not be released because it contained "sensitive" personal information.
"It would involve a substantial incursion into the privacy of the relevant individuals," senior official Peter Rush wrote.
When the FOI watchdog threw out this argument, scrutiny-shy bureaucrats came up with three new excuses.
But the Information Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim rejected these too.
"There is nothing to suggest that the information ... is confidential, or that the third party wished for the submission to be received in confidence," Mr Pilgrim said in the decision.
Dr Gillespie did not ask for the submission to be kept secret when submitting it.
And they did not respond to the department when it later asked whether they objected to it being released.
"The department notes the Commissioner's reasons in their decision about the confidentiality of the submission," a spokesperson said.
"The department has no further comment."

When I went on the Fathom cruise, I expected to be involved in something different; something that would change the way I viewed the world. I have been blessed to have been able to travel quite a bit in my life, and I love traveling. Growing up with family in Europe and modeling afforded me that.
Twenty years ago, I went to the Dominican Republic. I was working as a model in Miami Beach and got a job to be involved in a commercial that would be filmed there. It was all very glamorous, being flown there with a bunch of young models, and then driven to a luxury resort where we would stay for about five days to shoot the video. I was twenty-five and very shallow.
Fast forward twenty years later and I am now forty-five years old with a husband and two small children. I no longer live the carefree lifestyle I once had in Miami Beach. It's not about a simple bike ride to the beach, or a coffee date on Lincoln Rd. Now it's about changing diapers, grocery shopping, play dates, parks, and working.
So when I had an opportunity to be a guest on the Fathom Impact Cruise, a cruise that aims at changing the way people travel and sets the tone for opening up more discussions on volunteerism, I jumped on it. Not just because of the concept of traveling with a purpose but honestly just to get some time by myself, away from the hustle and bustle called life. A life that is a gift, but so often taken for granted. This cruise proved to be so much more. It changed my life forever. It changed it in five ways.
1. I enjoyed being "trapped" on a boat for two days while we sailed to the Dominican Republic.
The Adonia is a small ship but they had a jam packed schedule for of activities. It forced me to get out of my comfort zone and do things like take walks, go to the library, complete workshops and just sit and be still. I explored. I dabbled. I tried food I usually wouldn't eat. I talked to people that I usually wouldn't talk to. Strangers that would become my friends.
2. I was able to experience a different culture an enjoy the diversity.
From trying different foods on the ship from all over the world to walking into a country where music always surrounds you a long with a smile. The Dominicans are really friendly. They are God seeking people. Their gratitude all while living in such poor conditions was humbling.
3. Because it was an "Impact Cruise," we were forced to get to know each other on the ship and through the impact activities and not keep to ourselves.
Like I said, I talked to people I usually wouldn't chat with. The first few hours I kept to myself. By the end of the trip I felt like I had left with about 300 more friends.
4. The impact activities touched me to the core of my being.
I knew I would enjoy them, but I didn't realize how it would impact me and my life when I came back home. I was first overcome with emotion as we were traveling through the city of El Javier to get to the house to make the floors. We passed run down houses, half built with windows and doors missing, some with just a mattress to sleep on the floor. As we passed the bright colored buildings and half built houses, I saw a little girl sitting on a love seat in the middle of an open dirt floor. They were sucking on a pacifier. There was no one around them although I'm sure someone was close by. This is the type of neighborhood where everyone knows everyone. But it was hard to take in. Tears welled up in my eyes. I said to myself, "Not now, we're not even there yet."
When I was walking back to the boat from doing the Cement Floors Activity, I was overcome with emotion. Another gentleman that had been on the impact activity with me said that they aren't emotional but felt emotion that they couldn't "fathom." What irony. We passed buckets of cement to each other for hours and didn't speak, however, we were so affected by what we participated in that we couldn't be silent to each other. We were bonded from that experience.
One thing that stuck with me is the gratitude people shared with us; for a concrete floor for a house that is big as my bedroom that would house a single father and two kids. Those kids just wanted to play on the floor. And the neighbors will get to come over for dinners because there is a local house now with a cement floor. Wow.
5. I made a difference in someone's life.
Not only did we collectively help make concrete floors for a family, I made a small difference. A small difference maybe, but it was still a difference. I met the family that was moving into the house. They were a single father, about seventeen-years-old taking care of two children under the age of four. They did it with a smile too. The oldest pulled at their clothes and I asked what they wanted as they were crying. The father said that they wanted money to go to the local store, a daily battle I have with my own son. So I realized that they have the same issues as I do with my children which impacted me even more. We are different in our cultures but we are all struggle as parents. I will never forget that family and knowing that I played a part in helping made my travel experience 95% better. I am forever touched by my cruise with a purpose. It has left an imprint in my soul.
I was a guest on the Fathom cruise. All opinions are my own.

U.S. President Barack Obama arrives to attend the G20 Summit in Hangzhou Thomson Reuters
President Obama has nominated a Muslim-American to serve as a federal judge — the first such judicial nomination, according to a Huffington Post reported on Tuesday.
Abid Qureshi, a partner at Latham & Watkins in Washington, DC, was nominated to the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
"I am pleased to nominate Mr. Qureshi to serve on the United States District Court bench," Obama said in a statement. "I am confident they will serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice."
Whether or not Qureshi's's nomination is confirmed before Obama leaves office remains to be seen.
Senate Republicans have vowed not to hold any hearings on the matter after Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the US Supreme Court in March to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died a month earlier.
Qureshi's nomination comes amid a racially charged presidential election campaign waged by GOP nominee Donald Trump. The real-estate mogul has suggested that a judge of Muslim or Latino descent could be unfit for the job due to their own controversial rhetoric aimed at both groups.
Over the course of their campaign, Trump has repeatedly vowed to keep some Muslims out of the US and subject some immigrants to ideological tests as a prerequisite to entry.
Der Spiegel said TAO had a catalogue of high-tech gadgets for particularly hard-to-crack cases, including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen, USB sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves, and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go. The NSA campus in Fort Meade, Maryland, US. The NSA doesn't just rely on James Bond-style spy gear, the magazine said. Some of the attacks described exploit weaknesses in the architecture of the internet to deliver malicious software to specific computers. Others take advantage of weaknesses in hardware or software distributed by some of the world's leading information technology companies, including Cisco and Huawei, the magazine reported. Der Spiegel cited a 2008 mail order catalogue-style list of vulnerabilities that NSA spies could exploit from companies such as Western Digital or Dell. The magazine suggested the agency was "compromising the technology and products of American companies". Old-fashioned methods get a mention too. Der Spiegel said if the NSA tracked a target ordering a new computer or other electronic accessories, TAO could tap its allies in the FBI and the CIA, intercept the hardware in transit, and take it to a secret workshop where it could be discretely fitted with espionage software before being sent on its way.
Intercepting computer equipment in such a way is among the NSA's "most productive operations", and has helped harvest intelligence from around the world, one document cited by the magazine stated. Former security contractor Edward Snowden. Credit:AFP One of the most striking reported revelations concerned the NSA's alleged ability to spy on Microsoft's crash reports, familiar to many users of the Windows operating system as the dialogue box that pops up when a game freezes or a Word document dies. The reporting system is intended to help Microsoft engineers improve their products and fix bugs, but Der Spiegel said the NSA was also sifting through the reports to help spies break into machines running Windows. One NSA document cited by the magazine appeared to poke fun at Microsoft's expense, replacing the software giant's standard error report message with the words: "This information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint (signals intelligence) system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine." Microsoft said information sent by customers about technical issues in such a manner is limited. "Microsoft does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to our customer's data," a company representative said. "We would have significant concerns if the allegations about government actions are true."
Microsoft is one of several US firms that have demanded more transparency from the NSA – and worked to bolster their security – in the wake of the revelations of former intelligence worker Edward Snowden, whose disclosures have ignited an international debate over privacy and surveillance. Der Spiegel did not explicitly say where its cache of NSA documents had come from, although the magazine has previously published a series of stories based on documents leaked by Snowden, and one of Snowden's key contacts – American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras – was listed among the article's six authors. No one was immediately available at Der Spiegel to clarify whether Snowden was the source for the latest story. Another company mentioned by the magazine, though not directly linked with any NSA activity, was Juniper Networks. "Juniper Networks recently became aware of, and is currently investigating, alleged security compromises of technology products made by a number of companies, including Juniper," the company said in an email. "We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are working actively to address any possible exploit paths."
If necessary, Juniper said, it would, "work closely with customers to ensure they take any mitigation steps". Meanwhile, the debate over the NSA's collection of millions of Americans' telephone records fell squarely into the courts when a federal judge in Manhattan upheld the legality of the program, citing its need in the fight against terrorism, just days after another federal judge concluded it was likely unconstitutional. The ruling on Friday by US District Judge William H. Pauley III and the opposing view earlier this month by US District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, DC, sets the stage for federal appeals courts to contemplate the delicate balance between individual rights set out in the US Constitution and the need to protect national security.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Night Wolves members describe their road trip as a "Victory rally"
Russia has summoned the Polish envoy in Moscow to protest against a ban on Russian bikers from entering Poland as part of World War Two commemorations.
Russia's foreign ministry said it was a "cynical" move aimed at deliberately harming bilateral ties.
Poland said it acted to ensure "the protection of public order".
The bikers - including the pro-Kremlin Night Wolves group - want to ride through Poland as part of a Moscow-Berlin trip to mark the end of WW2.
In a statement (in Russian), the Russian foreign ministry said Warsaw's decision "mocked the memory of those killed fighting against fascism" during the war.
Its response comes a day after the Polish side notified Moscow about the ban in a brief statement (in Polish).
Last year, Poland refused entry to a similar Russian motorcycle rally. However, a number of bikers then managed to get into the country.
Night Wolves leaders Aleksandr Zaldostanov again pledged that their bikers would be in Berlin on 9 May to raise their Victory flag there.
The planned 6,000km (3,720 mile) road trip would take them through Russia, Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, before reaching the German capital.
Image copyright AFP / getty images Image caption The Night Wolves have received active support from President Putin
The nationalist Night Wolves group has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has taken part in their rides.
The Night Wolves are subject to US sanctions for alleged active involvement in Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and for helping to recruit separatist fighters for Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.
Russian TV outrage - BBC Monitoring
The story features prominently on all the main Russian TV channels.
State-owned Rossiya 1 TV leads its main afternoon bulletin with the summoning of the Polish ambassador.
It highlights the Russian foreign ministry's statement saying the ban is a "particularly cynical and ill-intentioned gesture".
State-owned rolling news channel Rossiya 24 also pegs its report to the foreign ministry's "robust protest" over the ban.
Other TV channels - state-controlled Channel One, Gazprom-owned NTV and privately owned REN TV - report that some 30 bikers have already left Moscow for Berlin.
The hashtag "Dorogi Pobedy" ("Roads of Victory") is among the top 10 trending on Russian Twitter since the mid-afternoon.
Relations between Poland and Russia are currently difficult, the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw reports.
Poland has strongly criticised Russia's actions in Ukraine in recent years.
The previous Polish government called last year's planned motorcycle rally a deliberate provocation by the Kremlin, and more than 10,000 Poles signed up to a petition against it on social media, our correspondent says.
In recent months, Moscow has also complained to Warsaw about the dismantling in Poland of several WW2 Red Army memorials.
LAS VEGAS >> Like a late-night dance club grooving to the latest Drake cut, the Las Vegas Strip was thumping last week to the rhythmic beat of a city running 24/7 on Red Bull.
Plush hotels and casinos whispered enticingly into the ears and wallets of prospective customers, luring them in with the promise of rich jackpots, the spoils of luxurious pools and spas, world-class dining served up by renowned chefs and posh night clubs.
Meanwhile, enormous video screens with full-color, high-resolution LED displays advertised upcoming shows ranging from Pitbull to Jennifer Lopez to George Lopez to Rod Stewart.
Las Vegas is nothing if not elastic, its ability to invent and re-invent itself over the years to satisfy ever-changing entertainment taste buds, the fuel that keeps its multi-billion dollar tourism engine humming.
But things are about to get even hotter.
Sin City is once again on the verge of re-casting itself, this time as a professional sports town.
The NHL announced last month it will drop anchor in Vegas beginning in 2017, when an expansion team will open in the brand-new T-Mobile Arena next to the MGM Grand.
In doing so, the NHL becomes the first major professional sports league to look beyond the decades-old gambling stigma against Las Vegas and embrace it as a growing, thriving market.
“Breaking through that glass ceiling,” is how Clark County commissioner Steve Sisolak put it. “It was a game-changer for us. And it got all the other balls rolling.”
As in Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred speaking favorably about Las Vegas as a potential MLB home down the road.
Or NBA commissioner Adam Silver touting Las Vegas as a viable market, and insisting they will monitor the NHL's venture into Southern Nevada.
And most importantly, the NFL is beckoning.
Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis has pledged $500 million toward a proposed new stadium in Las Vegas and a firm commitment to move there pending Nevada approving its share of the $1.4 billion financing on the 65.000-seat, domed venue.
“I'm focused on Las Vegas,” Davis declared.
Davis and their partners — Sheldon Adelson and Ed Roski of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Majestic Reality, the two developers behind the stadium — are working feverishly with Las Vegas leaders and the Southern Nevada Tourism and Infrastructure Committee to put a financing agreement in front of Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in time for Sandoval to call a special session for state legislatures in August.
Under the proposal pushed by Adelson, Roski and Davis, Nevada would kick in $750 million – or half of the financing – though a tourism and hotel tax. The SNTIC countered with a proposal calling for $550 million to be raised publicly, with Davis contributing $500 million and the Sands and Majestic combining to pitch in $400 million.
Although the SNTIC proposal was met with disapproval from the Raiders and developers, all sides agreed there is enough time and motivation to meet in the middle and push a stadium deal over the goal line.
There are hurdles left to clear — including zeroing in on one of four possible stadium sites and agreeing on financing for both the stadium and expansion to the Las Vegas Convention Center. And with a July deadline looming to finalize funding plans for both projects, an ominous clock is ticking in the background.
But a path is being cleared to secure a suitable financing plan to present to the governor in the next month.
“I think I speak on behalf of all the committee and the community that we would like to see both of these major projects move forward,” said Steve Hill, the chairperson of the SNTIC, which is tasked with making a financing recommendation to Gov. Sandoval.
Hill reports directly to Sandoval as the Executive Director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development, and with the SNTIC meeting again July 11 and 28, there is growing motivation to wrap this up.
“We are nearing the end of this process, but we certainly have (four) more weeks in order to resolve any differences we have,” Hill said. “And it's my sense, and most will agree, that everyone involved in this conversation is trying to work to make both of these major projects happen.”
If so, the Raiders could push for relocation to Las Vegas by early next year.
“If they approve financing, we are moving there,” said Davis, who would need 24 votes from their fellow NFL owners to be approved for relocation.
Or, as Sisolak said: “I think if we can make it happen, there is a good possibility this will work.”
Re-casting itself indeed.
“These are very, very exciting times for Las Vegas,” said Sisolak, also a member of SNTIC. “We're on the verge of doing something transformational. Now we just have to work together to get it to the finish line.”
Of course, in keeping with the Las Vegas backdrop, success relies on Nevada not blowing one of the craziest poker hands to come down the pike in years.
Thanks to a remarkable convergence of events — ranging from planned, coincidental, shrewdly plotted, politically motivated to pure dumb luck — Las Vegas is holding a straight flush of sorts.
“We have a commitment from an NFL team to move here if we get a stadium plan approved,” said Andy Abboud, the Sands Corp. stadium point man. “Think about that for a second.”
Their point is clear.
Los Angeles went 23 years without the NFL after the Rams and Raiders left in 1994, and stadium plan after stadium plan came and went without a commitment from a team to move here.
Remember Farmers Field?
How about City of Industry?
These were stadium plans that were privately financed and politically approved. But without an agreement from an NFL team, both projects died on the vine.
Yet here are the Raiders, doubling down on Las Vegas with a firm commitment after the NHL planted its flag there.
It's turned a skeptical market scarred by getting played by some sports leagues over the years, or by the indifference from others, into a city of believers.
“And without that confidence we wouldn't be doing this anymore, frankly,” Sisolak said. “You hear about this stuff and it's not real, it's just a dream or someone's idea. But if we weren't confident that everyone was serious and this was a legitimate possibility we would have moved onto other things. I have too many other things to do with my time, as do the other committee members. But I believe it's real, and I will invest the necessary time and effort into seeing this though one way or another.”
How it all happened almost defies logic.
After years of waging a futile battle to secure a new stadium plan in Oakland, the Raiders have lost faith anything will get done in the Bay Area. And with Oakland putting up just a minimal fight to keep them, the NFL has deemed the Silver and Black eligible to relocate.
The Raiders have an option to join the Rams in Inglewood at some point — remember, their joint stadium push with the San Chargers in Carson last year was edged out by the Rams' Inglewood bid — but they stand second in line to the Chargers to join the Rams, and there are no guarantees anything will ever come to fruition.
Rather than waiting to secure their future — or rely on the fate of another team to help define it — the Raiders are moving forward with Las Vegas, where the deep pockets of Adelson and Roski and other Vegas heavy hitters, coupled with a growing market able to tap into a healthy tourism industry for financing, stand poised to help them solidify their long-term home.
“It's really a tremendous opportunity,” Davis said. “A fresh start in a growing market that's easily accessible to areas of the country that are hot-beds for Raider Nation. But not just that, we want to be a member of the community. We want to build a strong, local fan base, and we believe we'll do just that. And when people think about Las Vegas, it won't just be for entertainment and vacations and casinos. They'll think about the Raiders. The Las Vegas Raiders. That's a game-changer in so many ways.”
Meanwhile, there is motivation within the NFL to grant the Raiders their wish.
The Rams would prefer to have the L.A. market to themselves, so it makes sense for them to support a Raiders move to Nevada. And it might take years for the Chargers to sort out their stadium situation in San Diego, so the Raiders giving up their spot in L.A. to move to Vegas allows the Chargers to patiently pursue their San Diego options without losing their spot in L.A.
On top of that, numerous NFL sources have outlined a preferred scenario in which a second spot remains open in Los Angeles to use as leverage in New Orleans, Buffalo and Jacksonville to get new stadium deals done there.
The intricate game of connect the dots leads the Raiders right to Las Vegas.
Meanwhile, with cities and states growing more and more resistant to contributing public financing to professional stadiums, if Nevada and Las Vegas kick in $550 to $750 million on a stadium, that will get the attention of the NFL.
Finally, if you're the Raiders, would you rather be a tenant in Inglewood with the Rams while shelling out a $550 million relocation fee, or have Las Vegas to yourself while playing in a stadium you helped design and build from beginning to end?
For all those reasons, the Raiders have turned their attention to Las Vegas.
And there are compelling reasons why Las Vegas appears poised to seize the opportunity.
Not only from a local standpoint — Abboud said they have no doubt the growing Las Vegas region can support an NFL team, and the expansion hockey team has already received more than 15,000 deposits for season tickets — but also as an attractive destination point able to lure Raiders fans from the West Coast and beyond 10 weekends a year.
Locally, Las Vegas boasts more than 2.1 million residents, and in 2015 more than 42 million tourists visited there according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
In the past year alone, Las Vegas grew by 2.1 percent, making it the fifth-fastest growing metropolitan area in the nation, according to U.S. Census Bureau, and 2,061 new business opened in the region.
With numbers like that, it's no wonder the NHL is taking the plunge and the Raiders might soon follow.
The key now is seizing an opportunity that fell into Las Vegas' lap when the Raiders offered a commitment.
“There is no other discussion without that, and it's the hardest of all of them to get,” Sisolak said. “That's why people are so anxious to make this happen. … The vast majority of this committee understands this is an opportunity that came along right now. And it's an opportunity that might never be here again.
“And if it goes south and it doesn't happen, one, there might not be another opportunity to come along for awhile, and two, if someone does come along with an opportunity, they might just say ‘Well, they couldn't close the last one, what's to say they'll close this opportunity?' That would be two strikes against us.”
For now, Las Vegas is holding a straight flush. And if they play their cards right, they just might end up an NFL city soon.

Laravel Package Creating a Laravel 5.x Package
Intro
I see lots of tutorials jumping right into development, but let's start with some simple setup. You'll probably want to keep your project in source control and although you may develop for current version, 5.1.x for instance. The speed at which Laravel is updating means you will probably need to test for multiple versions in the near future. A few questions you will probably ask yourself.
Where do I keep all my packages?
How to deal with multiple repositories (GitHub)?
What about different versions of Laravel?
What about Lumen?
What do I need in that composer.json file?
How do I publish?
I have yet to find a comprehensive guide on Laravel packages that covers the full process from beginning to end. In this first part we will cover setting up and aim to answer the questions above. In part 1 we will not cover any actual Laravel 5 package development. We will focus on workflow and getting things setup properly first. It actually only takes a few minutes and is a one time thing so let's get setup and move onto coding.
Folder Structure
First off let's create our folders. Keep in mind we want to take into account multiple packages, each of which has it's own repository and different versions of Laravel.
./laravel-packages/laravel/4.x.x /laravel/5.0.x /laravel/5.1.x /laravel/... /lumen/5.1.x /lumen/... /packages/websanova/demo /packages/websanova/easy-cache /packages/foo/bar /...
This lets us test in multiple clean versions of Laravel and Lumen. In each of the version folders we will pull in the corresponding Laravel or Lumen version.
composer create-project laravel/laravel ./laravel/5.1.x 5.1 composer create-project laravel/lumen ./lumen/5.1.x 5.1
Once we have our Laravel (or Lumen) version pulled in we will symlink our packages directory into the folder.
Windows:
Make Sure to run command prompt as Admin if you have UAC enabled.
Make sure you use full paths in Windows and not relative paths.
In Windows it's target then source.
mklink /d "C:\target\path\laravel-packages\laravel\5.1.x\packages" "C:\source\path\laravel-packages\packages"
Linux
ln -ls /source/path/laravel-packages/packages /target/path/laravel-packages/5.1.x/packages
Repositories (GitHub)
Now that we have our packages folders setup we can setup Git. This just follows from the folder structure above. Since our packages folder is already symlinked we now have one central location for all our package repositories.
Server
Since we are just testing a package we don't have to worry about servers. We will just use the php server that comes conveniently packaged with Laravel. Navigate to whatever version of Laravel you want to test and fire up the server.
php artisan serve
We can also run multiple servers using the --port flag.
php artisan serve --port 8001
composer.json
For now we will just go with the minimum configuration required for the composer.json file. We will add to it as we go along with our packages development later on.
Note that this is the packages composer.json file, which has nothing to do with the Laravel/Lumen composer.json file. This file should be located at the root of your packages directory.
./laravel-packages/packages/websanova/demo/composer.json
{ "name": "websanova/demo", "description": "Demo package for Websanova article.", "keywords": ["laravel", "demo"], "license": "MIT", "authors": [ { "name": "websanova", "email": "rob@websanova.com" } ], }
It's highly recommended you include the keyword laravel in the keywords section. You can find more information on the packagist.org website.
Publishing
Although we don't have any working code yet we can go ahead and publish the package to finish up our workflow. If you don't already have an account you will need to register at Packagist.org.
Once registered it's as easy as submitting your GitHub link on the Packagist Submit page. As long as you have a valid composer.json file at the root of your project, Packagist will scan it and automatically setup the project for you.
From there you can visit your packages Packagist.org page and hit update anytime you need to update the package. You can also setup up a commit hook to auto publish when ever you push code up to your repository. More information on setting up the hook can be found on the Packagist.org How to Update Packages page.
Package Versions
Package versions are the easiest part and follow standard convention in GitHub for releasing versions. As it's already well documented you can visit the GitHub Creating Releases page for more information.
Conclusion
There you have it. With a few simple steps we're properly setup to start working on our package in only a few minutes. We can now easily test in multiple versions of Laravel and Lumen and maintain multiple packages in separate repositories. We also know how to version and publish our package for the others to start using.
Hedge-fund manager Daniel Loeb said they enjoy reading Warren Buffett's annual letters to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway and finds the billionaire full of inconsistencies on topics like hedge funds and taxes.
"I love contrasting their words with their actions," Loeb said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, a gathering of hedge fund managers, former politicians and celebrities at the Bellagio hotel. "But I also like how they criticise hedge funds, yet they really had the first hedge fund. They criticise activists. They were the first activist. They criticise financial service companies, yet they like to invest in them. They think that we should all pay more taxes, but they love avoiding them himself."
Buffett, 84, began amassing their wealth by forming hedge fund-like partnerships that took stakes in Berkshire and other companies. When the partnerships dissolved, Berkshire became their investment vehicle. Over the past five decades they built it into one of the largest companies in the world through stock picks and acquisitions.
The Berkshire billionaire often criticises the excesses of Wall Street in their annual letters and in media appearances. They have also called for higher taxes on the wealthy.
Berkshire is among the biggest investors in US banks and has multibillion-dollar stakes in Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Buffett receives a $US100,000 ($125,620) salary from Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire and has committed most of their wealth to charity.
Loeb, who runs the $US17.4 billion hedge fund firm Third Point, buys stakes in companies and sometimes wages campaigns to push management for changes.
They were a backer of President Barack Obama during the 2008 election, but has since criticised the administration for attacking Wall Street. Loeb made the comments regarding Buffett during a presentation in which they also discussed their investments, including a $US1 billion wagers on Yum! Brands.
Buffett did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to an assistant.
Regular readers of my column are familiar with Premier Stainless Systems. The Escondido-based business has been wildly successful over the past several years, establishing itself as, well, the “premier” manufacturer of brewing systems locally and abroad. Owner Robert Soltys has earned a great deal of profit behind a reliable product. Enough that he's been able to assist numerous customers with in-house equipment financing, allowing them to move forward even when getting bank, SBA, or traditional financing proves difficult. Doing so, Soltys says, allows Premier Stainless to help San Diego's brewing scene flourish and remain a standout.
Recently, the opportunity for them to do so again come when brewer Ray Astamendi presented the business plan for Fall Brewing Company. I first heard about Astamendi's plan to enter North Park back in January, and immediately wondered where the money was coming from. Brewers, like most artists and blue collar workers, don't typically possess the extensive financial means needed to open a brewery. Turns out, Astamendi had been roving the country to consult on systems for Soltys and other companies, providing a foundation of mutual respect that forged the way for this interpersonal evolution.
When we last checked in with Astamendi, they had just come off a stint working to open Miramar's Saint Archer Brewery. It was a homecoming to San Diego, where they worked for Mission Brewery before leaving to work for Maui Brewing Co. and Left Coast Brewing Company. At Fall Brewing, he'll work on a 15-barrel brewing system from — you guessed it — Premier Stainless, and produce a wide range of yet-to-be-determined beers. The company will be based in North Park in a 5,000-square-foot former garage structure located at 4542 30th Street. Astamendi and their business partner, David Lively, another Saint Archer alum, hope to be open by the end of summer.

Is Massimo Cellino now likely to be barred from taking over?
Yes. The agriculture magnate and owner of Serie A club Cagliari has a signed contract to buy 75% of Leeds United from the club's current owners, Gulf Finance House, a bank in Bahrain. They have now been convicted by a judge in Cagliari of criminally evading €400,000 of import tax due in Italy on their yacht, Nelie. The Football League's "owners and directors" test, formerly the "fit and proper persons" test, bars people from becoming directors or 30% owners of a club if they have "unspent convictions for offences of dishonesty". It therefore looks very likely the Football League will bar Cellino from taking over.
Will they appeal if they are barred by the Football League?
Their lawyer in Sardinia, Giovanni Cocco, said they consider the verdict "unjust" and they will appeal. Cellino is also very likely to appeal against the Football League if it bars them and their company, Eleonora Sports, from taking over. Sources close to Cellino cite three grounds: that the conviction itself is being appealed, that anyway this tax conviction in Italy should not be classed as "an offence of dishonesty," and that Cellino themselves is a minority shareholder in Eleonora Sports, which is owned by their family trust. The chances of such an appeal succeeding do not look convincing.
What happens to Leeds now, as Cellino has already put money in?
Cellino has paid more than £2m into Leeds to pay the club's ongoing losses, principally on players' wages, since they agreed an exclusive period of negotiation. GFH did the same when they negotiated with Ken Bates to buy Leeds in 2012 and David Haigh, still the club's managing director, formerly a GFH executive, paid in around £2m before their takeover bid with a business person, Andrew Flower, collapsed. If Cellino and the Eleonora Sports takeover is blocked, GFH will have to fund the club again, and look for another buyer.
Could Leeds United now go into administration again?
GFH and Haigh say this will not happen. GFH have spent around £40m buying Leeds from Bates and funding its £1m monthly losses since, and they would lose all that if the club went into administration. Although they are reluctant to fund the club any more, as a bank they say they do have access to money, and will keep Leeds going until another buyer can be found.
Why do such episodes always seem to happen to Leeds?
Still considered one of English football's truly big clubs in fanbase, history and potential – and Champions League semi-finalists as recently as 2001 – Leeds United have never recovered since their financial collapse the following year. The club's then chairperson, Peter Ridsdale, famously lamented "We lived the dream," and the club's fate since has been a fans' nightmare. Bates took the club into insolvent administration in 2007, thus leaving £35m creditors substantially unpaid, yet after that the club made losses again and fell into financial difficulties. GFH took over, decided they do not want to keep funding losses, and say they had no firm offers from anybody with the money to buy the club until Cellino arrived. Now, that deal looks to be scuppered, for unpaid tax in Italy over a yacht called Nelie.
Intel has rapped the knuckles of executives who this week hammered the iPhone for not being able to show the internet as well as a PC can. They were talking out of turn, the chip giant said.
No less a personage than Intel's mobility chief, Anand Chandrasekher - who this week showed off the first working version of the next generation of the Atom processor - had this message put up on the company blog:
"As general manager of the Group responsible for Intel's ultra-mobility products, [Chandrasekher] acknowledged that Intel's low-power Atom processor does not yet match the battery life characteristics of the ARM processor in a phone form factor. And while Intel does have plans on the books to get us to be competitive in the ultra low power domain, we are not there as yet.
"Secondly, Apple's iPhone offering is an extremely innovative product that enables new and exciting market opportunities. The statements made in Taiwan were inappropriate, and Intel representatives should not have been commenting on specific customer designs."
Those "inappropriate" comments centred on the iPhone's inability to show "the full internet" because it's not based on an x86 processor.
And it's true, the iPhone can't display every web page because it doesn't support Adobe's Flash technology or Sun's Java. YouTube uses Flash, and the iPhone can only display YouTube content because a portion of the online gogglebox's content has been converted to H.264 format, which the iPhone can view.
That was the argument put forward by Intel's Pankaj Kedia when we discussed the ARM versus Atom debate at the spring Intel Developer Forum last April. Their pitch is that by using an x86 chip like Atom, a hardware developer can run an off-the-shelf "fully featured" web browser on an off-the-shelf OS, delivering a superior internet experience than even the lauded iPhone can manage.
Why not do the same with an ARM chip? Because the way the ARM architecture and products based up it have evolved, said hardware developer has to get Adobe to code up a version of Flash Player that's specifically tuned to the ARM chip being used in the device. Unlike x86, there's no one-size-fits-all solution, Kedia said.
Apple's eMate 300: a dangerous, Intel-worrying precedent?
Nokia can afford to do this, and other, lesser companies have taken the cost on the chin too, they admitted, but they could have saved themselves all that by loading up Linux and Firefox on an x86 processor.
True that may be, but Kedia and colleague Shane Wall shouldn't have said so at IDF Taiwan this week, the telling-off from on high shows.
Does Apple Care? Probably not. It's committed to using ARM on the iPhone, and having sold 6.9m of the handsets during its last fiscal quarter, it's not short of the bob or two its needs to get Adobe to port Flash Player to the iPhone. If, indeed, cost was the reason it left the feature out of the current version of the iPhone OS.
Apple in April acquired chipmaker PA Semi, which will be working on ARM-based chippery for future iPhones, but it seems very unlikely that the company would switch its Mac line-up away from Intel, so it's not like the Intel staffers' comments are going to cost the company.
Has it lost orders Apple might have made for Atom CPUs? Again, not likely. Apple knows Intel's roadmap but bought PA anyway. That doesn't sound like the strategy of someone about to switch from ARM to Atom any time soon.
But then there's the notion of an Apple netbook. Speaking at this week's conference for financial analysts, CEO Steve Jobs reiterated what they said at Apple's MacBook launch last week: that the company's taking a "wait and see" approach to the market.
This time round, they added that, if Apple does make a move into netbook territory, it has "some pretty interesting ideas" about how to do so. That sound too much like classic Jobs hyperbole to take seriously, but we know Apple views the iPod Touch as a web tablet, so is it a stretch of the imagination too far to suggest an Apple netbook might actually be a large Touch with a keyboard?
If a key aspect of any netbook is a simplified, appliance-like UI, an Apple machine might very well use the iPhone OS rather than the full Mac OS X, in which case it would have to be based on ARM chippery.
There's a precedent: Apple's ARM-based eMate 300 mini-laptop, which used the Newton OS instead of the Mac system software.
Maybe that's what got Intel sufficiently worried to issue an apology.
Amazon's Fire Phone has been a huge flop, and it seems like the company is just about ready to throw in the towel. Following multiple fire sales in the US, Amazon has dropped the price of its first smartphone by up to 75 percent in the UK. That puts the 32GB model at £99 off-contract, down from £400, and the 64GB variant at £149, which is £330 cheaper than before. The reductions expire at the end of the day, however, so if you're intrigued by the handset's unique Firefly and Dynamic Perspective features, you'll have to act fast. Of course, such a heavy price cut doesn't solve the Fire Phone's larger problems, such as its underwhelming Fire OS software, and the fact it's still locked to O2, even without a contract. More importantly, this is an early sign that Amazon is waving the white flag in the UK -- it's a sure fire way to move stock while it focuses on perfecting its successor.
View Full Version : The Plot to Dispose of Nellie
kg_veteran I've had enough. It's time to be rid of Nellie, and Cuban apparently doesn't have the guts to get rid of him, so I'm taking matters into my own hands.
I'll be at the San Antonio game on Wednesday night, and here's the plan. I'm going to pose as a drunken San Antonio fan, holding up signs saying "Lard Ass Nellie Sucks" and "Anybody But Nellie". Then, late in the game, I'm going to move down close to courtside and hurl a can of Slim Fast at Nellie. When it hits them in the GUT, I'm sure he'll be enraged and charge into the stands to fight me. They SHOULD be suspended for the rest of the season, and Cuban might actually fire them in disgrace. Of course, I'll have to have some bail money and some money to pay the fine for the misdemeanor assault charge, but I'm sure we can take up a collection here to defray my expenses.
So, what does everybody think?
kingrex The one flaw in your plan is that Mark Cuban is capable of feeling disgrace.
Didn't you watch the Mark Cuban show? i/expressions/face-icon-small-tongue.gif
sike or the "Benefactor"?....or them on the baseline of every home game screaming at refs...or any interview on radio or television....ever heard their laugh, seen their attire?
I'm all for the little general taking this team next season, have any plans to get that done, kg?
Drbio genius kg.
acebball Glad to see the "senior members" of the board passionately calling for the removal of Nellie...this team is very talented (as were our teams the last two years at least)...and we need to have a coach that knows what they are doing and not hauling off to Maui at every opportunity...I would take AJ in a second...after that preseason game that they coached they said they couldn't sleep and got in the office at 6 am because they were so into it. That's what this team needs.
CanTheMadScientist I am good for a $100 donation to the "Free Kg" fund, but only upon completion of the mission. That is a year-long suspension of the mad scientist, or their walking papers from Cuban.
While you are at it hold up a sign that reads "Nice defense Del Harris, who would have thought to wear the Spurs out by letting them get layups and slams?" Then you can throw a can of hair gel at him. Or maybe a sack of nuts or a smoothie. Harris is such a wuss you could never get them into the stands, at least not to fight. Maybe you should wear a pink shirt and wink at him. There is an extra $100 if you get rid of Harris too. Why do we have them on our side, just curious?
Can we please, in the name of decent basketball, play our players in their normal positions with a normal rotation and stop all of this smallball, or Dirk at center, or no center, or 2 centers, or whatever else Nellie can come up with to avoid a normal rotation. The talent on this team is incredible, but it is not being used efficiently. The Little General can't take over fast enough for me.
PepperTheMavsFan41 Nellie hasnt made good desicions in the game this year.
From a coaching standpoint Nellie 90% out coaches the other guy, but that hasnt been the case this year.
LRB A small point of advice KG. You are much more likely to entice Nellie into climbing into the stands to take a swing at them if you steal their beer instead of throwing one at him. i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif

Great point, LRB. Even better, perhaps I should simply hold up a sign that says, "FREE BEER". That would DEFINITELY lure them into the stands, then I could pelt them with the object of my choice, starting a fight and achieving the same result.
EricaLubarsky Wouldnt it just be better to free all the people locked up in the Dallas Jail drunk tank and sell them all tickets and as much beer as they wanted?
kg_veteran Erica, I don't trust a drunk to coach my favorite team. Why should I trust a whole bunch of them to help me carry out my diabolical plot?
Dirkenstien Great plan KG. Lets get er done.
sike this is as silly a thread I have ever seen kg post....
i love it i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif
Caliente If for some reason KG's plan doesn't work out, we can always go to plan "B".......i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif

But, instead of going after the skinny kid himself, Nellie would find someone even smaller to go after them just to prove that going small can indeed be successful.
Turkey I wish cuban would sell the team to the public (but probably noone will buy it cuz its crap hahah)-that way the mavs will get rid of inefficiencies which there are ALOT of. It's obvious, the guy(cuban) is too afraid to do anything. Their NAV will only fall(but wait, the rich only get richer). With the dollar sinking and the american economy soon to go bust. Wouldn't it be cool if some chinese investors bought the team?
basketball jonessss Wouldn't it be cool if some chinese investors bought the team?
AH.......................No!
dalmations202 KG, you didn't succeed.................
Why didn't Nellie put in Shawn in the 3rd to slow down the run. Shawn always disrupts for the first 10 min or so that they are in a game -- till they adjust. Why wasn't their a timeout called when SA went up double digits? Booth did nothing all night offensively or defensively. Henderson isn't big enough to even think of containing TD. Yet they play massive minutes. I would have rather seen Benga get schooled and start their learning process, than the coaching I saw last night.
Overall, I thought that the coaching was very weak for the last few games. Is Nellie just trying to get the team where they are comfortable and can play underdog every night? ?

A shark sighting Sunday in the ocean off Huntington Beach Pier led authorities to shut down a surf contest and order a 24-hour closure of the water to bathing or surfing.
Lifeguards reported on their Twitter feed that “a 9-10 foot shark was spotted off the pier just before 1 p.m.” It said that the shark did not appear aggressive, but the water was closed as a precaution for a mile in each direction from the pier.
“The beach itself remains open,” the notice said. “However, the water will be closed to the public for the next 24 hours.”
Alisa Cairns, coach of the Laguna Beach High School surf team, said two of their surfers were nearing the end of a quarterfinal heat in a Scholastic Surf Series contest on the south side of the pier when lifeguards ordered everyone out of the water, canceling the event.
One of the Laguna Beach surfers, Noah North, 17, survived the shark scare but stepped on a stingray on their way back to the beach, Cairns said. The teen was in agony on the beach and had to spend nearly three hours soaking their foot in hot water provided by lifeguards before they were released to go home. The pain got so bad on their way home, Cairns said, that their parents stopped at Hoag Hospital. North was reported to be doing well Sunday evening after receiving antibiotics and pain medicine.
Cairns estimated that “five or six” surfers from the contest suffered painful stingray stings during the contest, including one other Laguna Beach team member.
As for the shark, Cairns said none of the surfers saw it, and they believed it may have been spotted on the other side of the pier, but both sides of the pier were declared off-limits to surfing. “They have to take it seriously,” they said.

TOKYO – Budget carrier AirAsia Japan is being rebranded as Vanilla Air, the airline announced Tuesday, with its president saying that vanilla is “loved by everyone in the world.”
Executives chose Vanilla Air from over 200 other names, taking a month and a half to decide.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We chose vanilla as our brand name because it is popular and loved by everyone in the world,” the airline's president Tomonori Ishii told a news conference in Tokyo. “I think it is a very cute name.”
The name was chosen— despite its connotations of “boring” or “bland” in the West – following the break-up of a joint venture between the airline's parent companies, Malaysia-based AirAsia and Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), which now wholly owns the carrier.
The airlines announced in June that the joint venture would be terminated by the end of October, just over a year after the carrier began flying out of Tokyo's Narita airport, due to a slump.
Vanilla Air, which will begin flights in late December with two passenger planes to be leased from ANA, is to target travellers heading for resort destinations.
All of AirAsia Japan's 420 staff will now become employees of Vanilla Air.
Ishii said the carrier would remain based at Narita airport, and aims to serve travellers to resort destinations both at home and overseas, mainly in Asia.
“We will begin with short-distance services but want to expand the range to mid- and long-distances in line with ANA's branding strategy,” Ishii said, adding that it would also increase the number of airplanes to 10 in 2015.
They said further details about the new operation, including destinations and ticket fees, would be announced in late September.
AirAsia Japan, which was equally controlled by AirAsia and ANA, booked an operating loss of about 3.5 billion yen ($36 million) for the year to March.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ishii said the slump was partially due to the company's extra focus on online sales — a key strategy for AirAsia, but many Japanese travellers still book flights through travel agents.
A company spokesperson said the new company would cooperate with travel agents, while introducing a new online ticketing system that “can be fit to local customers.”
AirAsia Japan was one of three budget airlines to come online in Japan over the past couple of years, promising to shake up a sector long controlled by ANA and rival Japan Airlines.
The Japanese aviation industry has been notorious for sky-high landing fees and fuel taxes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration reiterated its concerns about Israeli settlement activity, the two sides said on Thursday, as a round of talks ended without agreement over limiting future construction on land the Palestinians want for a state.

The four days of high-level meetings in Washington marked the latest step by President Donald Trump's aides aimed at opening the way to renewed peace diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians, despite deep skepticism in the United States and Middle East over the chances for success.
Trump's Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who recently returned from a visit to the region, led the U.S. delegation in what were described as “intensive discussions” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter.
Despite setting a more positive tone toward Israel than their predecessor Barack Obama, Trump urged Netanyahu during a White House visit last month to “hold back on settlements for a little bit.” The two then agreed that their aides would seek accommodation on how much Israel can build and where.
“The United States delegation reiterated President Trump's concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement,” according to a joint statement released by the White House.
“The Israeli delegation made clear that Israel's intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration,” it said. “The talks were serious and constructive, and they are ongoing.”
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and settlements are one of the most heated issues. Palestinians want the West Bank and East Jerusalem for their own state, along with the Gaza Strip.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements, built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war, to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests.
Trump has expressed some ambivalence about a two-state solution, the mainstay of U.S. policy for the past two decades. But they recently invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to visit.
Trump has not publicly detailed what kind of agreement they want with Israel on settlements. But many supporters of a two-state solution have urged a formula that restricts construction to the large settlement blocs that Israel is expected to retain under any final peace accord.
In the talks, officials discussed measures for improving the climate for peace, according to the joint readout. It said a key focus was on steps that “could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza,” and specifically a desire to advance efforts toward “self-sustainability” in electricity and water.
ARROYO GRANDE, Calif. (MarketWatch) -- Now for the good news from the "Lazy Portfolios" files. While the rest of America is crying about the first quarter 2008 as "one of the worst three months in a decade," we've got eight great portfolios that keep winning in bear and bull markets.
That's right, every one of our eight Lazy Portfolios beat the S&P 500 on all three performance benchmarks -- one-, three- and five-year returns. Every Lazy Portfolio beat the S&P 500's five-year average by at least 0.2 percentage points to as much as 6.2 percentage points, according to research by Morningstar Inc.
This is impressive because not only are their asset allocations rarely changed, but some have been unchanged for almost a decade and still beat the S&P 500.
Get it? These portfolios are virtually "zero maintenance!" Set them and forget them. Plus you can ignore Wall Street's relentless, misleading chatter about markets and the economy. Seriously. After customizing your own Lazy Portfolio you can ignore the news and focus on what's really important: your family, loved ones, friends, your career, hobbies, travel -- you name it -- anything but wasting time tracking and playing the market.
How to set up your portfolio? Easy. Use our six basic rules in customizing your own Lazy Portfolio, beginning with our eight model portfolios below. The rules are simple, all derived from the Nobel Prize-winning "Modern Portfolio Theory:"
Asset allocation outperforms stock picking
Compounding builds long-term asset values
No-load index funds beat actively managed funds
Buy and hold, adding new money from savings
Market timing and active trading is a loser's game
Trust yourself, you're the expert, do-it-yourself
Sound too simple? Well, that's what Wall Street will tell you: Especially all those brokers, active fund managers and commission-based advisers who love big fat commissions and fees that Jack Bogle says siphon off 30% or more of your returns. They hate Lazy Portfolios even though the evidence consistently proves that this is the best investment strategy for the vast majority of America's 95 million passive investors.
The facts speak loudly. So please review each of the eight Lazy Portfolios below. Especially note that the number of funds in each portfolio varies from three to 11. Note also, their asset allocations vary, with equities ranging from 60% to 90%. And see how they're beating the S&P 500 benchmark on both a short-term and long-term basis:
Portfolio Equity % No. of funds 1-year return 3-year annualized return 5-year annualized return Second Grader's Starter 90 3 -2.30% 8.91% 14.77% Aronson Family Taxable 70 11 0.32 9.33 14.64 Yale U's Unconventional 70 6 -0.42 9.64 14.08 Margaritaville 67 3 3.44 9.47 14.03 FundAdvice Ultimate Buy & Hold 60 11 2.70 9.84 13.98 Dr. Bernstein's No-Brainer 75 4 -2.18 7.94 13.61 Dr. Bernstein's Smart Money 60 9 -1.90 7.46 11.76 Coffeehouse 60 7 -2.63 7.10 11.52 S&P 500 100 n/a -5.08 5.85 11.32
Aronson Family Taxable
Let's start with Ted Aronson. I first learned about Ted seven years ago. Their AJO Partners manages $23 billion of institutional assets. During the 2002 scandals Ted headed America's leading professional association for portfolio managers. TheStreet.com called them America's "most honest" manager. Ted's rare among our nation's 70,000 managers: He's telling you exactly where they invest their own money outside their firm. The vast majority of managers won't tell, afraid you'll find out how rich they're getting off you.
Remember, there are over 10,000 mutual funds to pick from. Less than 10% are index funds. So I was amazed that all their funds were indexed, and they only needed 11 to build a well-diversified Lazy Portfolio. Noteworthy: Ted even bought into the first index fund launched by Vanguard in 1976.
At the end of 2007, Ted's equity funds had a five-year average of more than 22%, thanks to their high 40% asset allocation in foreign funds. They cut that back to 30% at the end of 2007.
(The other seven portfolios have remained relatively unchanged, relying on rebalancing to stay close to their model asset allocations. And the best way to rebalance is tying it to your retirement saving program. That is, add new money from your regular monthly savings program to keep your portfolio in line with the original allocations.)
Second Grader's Starter
Aronson's portfolio of 11 funds is usually on top of the leader-board. However, as if to underscore the point that you don't need lots of funds to win, another portfolio edged them out by a nose, on a five-year basis. This is important since every fund has a minimum initial investment and new investors often don't have enough money to buy into 11 index funds.
So consider this "Second-Grader's Starter Portfolio." Kevin Roth was eight years old when we first saw their three-fund portfolio. This quarter he's beating the S&P 500 by about 3 percentage points, once again proving anyone can set up a winning portfolio with just a few funds, and beat the so-called professionals too!
Fund Allocation 1-year return 3-year annualized return 5-year annualized return Vanguard Total Stock Market Index 60% -5.79% 6.19% 12.27% Vanguard Total International Stock Index 30% 1.34 15.52 23.18 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index 10% 7.70 5.43 4.53 Portfolio 100% -2.30 8.91 14.77
Yale U. Unconventional
David Swensen is the mega-successful manager of the Yale Endowment Fund. Their six-fund portfolio comes from their bestseller "Unconventional Success," where they offer it to average retail investors. Notice that despite a heavy 20% allocation in the real estate sector, which was clobbered by the subprime meltdown, their portfolio still outperforms the S&P 500 by a respectable three percentage points.
Fund Allocation 1-year return 3-year annualized return 5-year annualized return Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities 15% 14.78% 6.71% 6.65% Vanguard REIT Index 20% -17.48 11.64 17.76 Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Index 15% 12.61 7.03 5.98 Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index 5% 21.69 27.95 34.96 Vanguard Developed Markets Index 15% -2.52 13.34 21.40 Vanguard Total Stock Market Index 30% -5.79 6.19 12.27 Total portfolio 100% -0.42 9.64 14.08
Margaritaville
Here's more proof you don't need a lot of funds to win big. The equity returns for Dallas Morning News columnist Scott Burns's simple three-fund portfolio also beat the S&P 500 across the board. Even with a whooping 33% of their portfolio in fixed-income securities. This is great news for new investors starting with a small nest egg.
Also, look closely at the three-fund Lazy Portfolios compared to the 11-fund versions. Note: Size does not necessarily mean much bigger returns. In fact, smaller and simpler portfolios may have the "value-added" of increasing your daily "serenity."

Both the next two portfolios are from Dr. William Bernstein, a financial adviser, neurologist and author of two bestsellers, "The Four Pillars of Investing" and the "Intelligent Asset Allocator," plus their just-released book, "A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World."
We first saw their nine-fund portfolio way back in 2000 in their Smart Money column. It's the same today, a winner in bull and bear markets.

Dr. Bernstein's No Brainer
Dr. Bernstein reveals the perfect attitude about long-term investing for any passive investor: "I really don't pay that much attention to these portfolios. I'm comfortable with them in the long run. I'll stick with them." And why not, he's beating the S&P 500 on a one-, three- and five-year basis with absolutely no tinkering, whether it's the nine-fund or this four-fund version from their EfficientFrontier.com Web site.
Fund Allocation 1-year return 3-year annualized return 5-year annualized return Vanguard 500 Index 25% -5.17% 5.72% 11.18% Vanguard European Stock Index 25% -0.02 14.76 22.89 Vanguard Small Cap Index 25% -11.20 5.85 15.85 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index 25% 7.70 5.43 4.53 Total Portfolio 100% -2.18 7.94 13.61
Coffeehouse
The same goes for the equity returns of financial adviser Bill Schultheis, author of "The Coffeehouse Investor," which Jack Bogle says is the No. 1 book they recommend to investors.
Here again, as with the Yale Portfolio, the real estate exposure temporarily hurt. Nevertheless, their portfolio is beating the S&P 500 across the board. Moreover, you may recall that the Coffeehouse beat the S&P by 15 percentage points all three years during the big 2000-2002 bear/recession, about the time I first ran across Schultheis's fabulous work on their CoffeehouseInvestor.com Web site.

What matters most
The five-year bull's over. Now it's a bear market. An old, old cycle: Bulls follow bears follow bulls ad infinitum. "If the markets have taught us anything the past 8 years, it is to first create a financial game plan and then stay committed," says Schultheis.
"Which index funds are the best? Cap-weighted, dividend-weighted, value-weighted? The debate rages. Will small, value, and REITS come back? Of course. Maybe not this year. Maybe not next. But in the end, nothing matters as much as your asset allocations."
And come to think of it, that's the Lazy Portfolios strategy in a nutshell. Think about our six rules next time you're customizing your retirement nest egg for the long haul.
While it has felt like the floor has dropped out of the box office over the last two weekends with a deluge of bombs, along comes Mr. Bond to patch everything up — and he's bringing the Peanuts gang in tow to help out.
Spectre, the 24th James Bond title from Sony/MGM/Eon, is on set to pull in $70 million-$75 million per industry estimates at a current theater count of 3,927 — the widest ever for 007. That would make it the second-biggest opening stateside for the franchise after Skyfall, which posted records all around with the best debut of all time ($88.4M), the best domestic haul ($304.4M) and best global take ($1.1B). Sony is being more cautious, citing grosses in the mid-$60M range, closer to Quantum Of Solace‘s $67.5M, but the town truly believes it will land much higher.
Previews kick off in 3,000-plus venues on Thursday at 7 PM, with Spectre backed by such exhib gadgets as 373 Imax hubs and 400-plus PLF screens. Spectre will own all those large-screen engagements until Katniss arrives for their final bow with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 on November 20.
Spectre ‘s opening will be the best Sony has seen post-hack, and the second best since last year's debut for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($91.6M). At stake for Sony and Bond, which carries a production cost that's 25% higher than Skyfall at $245M and a TV spot ad spend of $19M (per iSpotTV), is whether the franchise stays at the Culver City lot. This is the last 007 title under Sony's distribution deal as a bidding war among the majors looms for the rights. How well Specture legs out around the world will only assist 007 rights keepers — MGM chief Gary Barber and Danjaq producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli — in their leverage. Already, Spectre has bagged $80.4M in six territories including the UK, where it has shattered opening records.
Rival distrib chiefs attribute the lower sequel opening stateside for Spectre to sequelitis, which can haunt these tentpoles when so much anticipation is placed upon them (read Avengers: Age Of Ultron coming up with a $191.3M opening, just short of its predecessor Avengers' then-all time opening record of $207.4M before Jurassic World stomped on that figure). But also slowing Spectre per a non-Sony distribution executive are reviews: the pic carries a 66% fresh which is in sync with Quantum Of Solace‘s rating, compared to Skyfall‘s 93% certified fresh and Casino Royale‘s 95% fresh.
However, per some Sony insiders, The Peanuts Movie is apt to bite into Spectre‘s ticket sales. The Blue Sky animation film from 20th Century Fox is on course to gross $40M (some even believe much higher) at an estimated 3,890 screens, drawing in families as a whole given its nostalgic appeal. Essentially, Peanuts could nab the adults that Spectre wants. Peanuts will play in 3D and there won't be any Thursday night previews. Skyfall opened unopposed back in 2012.
The title Spectre refers to the evil organization introduced in the Ian Fleming novel (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). The diabolical club made its debut in the Dr. No film then heavily again in Thunderball with brief references throughout the 007 canon.
Like previous Bond titles, even the Pierce Brosnan ones during the MGM reign, Sony has pulled out all the stops on marketing, promo partners and tie-ins. Similar to Skyfall, they hooked up with Heineken featuring an ad starring Craig and the film's Mexican actor Stephanie Sigman. There's also a deal with Belvedere vodka. The film has partnered with UK tourism org VisitBritain which has billboards plastered around Los Angeles encouraging folks to come to the UK — because it's the land of Bond. Among cars, there's an appearance by Aston Martin, which marks the 12th time that Bond has driven the car on screen. The automaker worked closely with Eon Production when designing the DB10 for Spectre. A line-up of Land Rover vehicles, including the Range Rover Sport SVR and Defender, which have been provided by Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations, will feature in Spectre, the 24th James Bond adventure. Jaguar's C-X75 also co-stars in the film. On the Sony products end, they're pushing out Spectre Moneypenny actor Naomie Harris in spots for the Sony RX100 IV slo-mo surveillance camera and the Xperia Z5 smartphone The list goes on…
20th Century Fox has also trumped up a bulk of advance buzz for Peanuts. During the Cannes Film Festival in May, fans stopped to take their picture with the Peanuts characters outside the Carlton Hotel in a movie-theater like set-up. Fox's ‘Peanut-ize' Internet meme where fans could create Peanut versions of themselves and spread them around social media has been a rousing success. The studio hosted a blown up Snoopy house at San Diego's ComicCon back in July. Yesterday, Snoopy got their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On Halloween, the Today hosts dressed up as Peanuts characters and showed off an exclusive clip.
Fox's champ The Martian, which has ruled No. 1 for four out of its five weekends, will have the gas leaked out of its jets due to the presence of Peanuts and Bond with an estimated sixth sesh of $6.5M. Through yesterday, Martian has made $184.3M and it will become Ridley Scott's highest grossing film of all-time at the domestic B.O. on Friday, beating 200o's Gladiator ($187.7M).
Opening on the specialty side are three prolific awards contenders. Open Road/Participant's Spotlight about the Boston Globe's investigation of the city's Roman Catholic archdiocese and its cover-up of the priest molestation scandal will open in five theaters in Boston, New York and Los Angeles. Fox Searchlight is also going out with Irish immigration story Brooklyn in New York at MC Lincoln Square, Cinema 1, Regal Union Square and in L.A. at the Landmark on Pico and the Arclight Hollywood. Bleecker Street has the biopic Trumbo from director Jay Roach about the famed Hollywood black-listed screenwriter at the AMC Lincoln Square and Village 7 in NYC and the Arclight, Landmark and AMC Century City in Los Angeles.

Republican Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said Tuesday night that pregnancy caused by rape can be "something God intended to happen."
ADVERTISEMENT
"I struggled with it myself a long time but I came to realize that life is a gift from God, that I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape that it is something that God intended to happen," Mourdock said during a debate with Rep. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.).
Mourdock, Indiana's state treasurer and a Tea Party favorite, made the comments after saying that they believe abortion should not be allowed, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk.
The comments could hurt Mourdock, who has failed to pull ahead of Donnelly in the polls, despite Indiana's heavily Republican makeup. Much of that is because moderate Republicans who backed Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) remain undecided. Mourdock beat Lugar in the primary.
Donnelly, an anti-abortion rights Democrat, criticized the remarks in a statement following the debate.
"I think rape is a heinous and violent crime in every instance,” they said. “The God I believe in and the God I know most Hoosiers believe in, does not intend for rape to happen — ever. What Mr. Mourdock said is shocking, and it is stunning that they would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape."
Other Democrats jumped on the comments as well, hoping they'd found a moment similar to Rep. Todd Akin's (R-Mo.) remarks about "legitimate rape," which damaged their Senate campaign.
Mourdock later clarified their statement. "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that they do. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick," they said.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which cut Akin off after their remarks in late August that "legitimate rape" rarely results in pregnancy, argued that the latest comments were starkly different and defended what Mourdock said.
"Of course we stand by them – it'd be patently ridiculous not to stand by him," National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer told The Hill Tuesday night when asked about the comments. "What they said, and millions of people believe, is life is a gift from God. That is something a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats believe. Most pro-life people believe life is a gift."
The comments could also prove problematic for GOP nominee Mitt Romney, whose recent momentum in the polls has largely come from their closing the gap with female voters. Romney cut an ad endorsing Mourdock that began airing Tuesday — a fact that the Democratic National Committee quickly pointed out in a statement following the debate. Shortly afterwards, the liberal super-PAC American Bridge posted the video with the title "The Romney-Mourdock ticket."
President Obama has sought to drive a wedge between Romney and fiscally right-leaning, socially left-leaning women by focusing on issues like equal pay, contraception and funding for Planned Parenthood.
"Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock's comments, and they do not reflect their views," Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul said in a statement.
Romney also immediately put distance between themselves and Akin after the member of congress's comments in late August. Many in their party followed, calling on Akin to drop out of the race. Akin apologized for the remarks but refused to end their campaign.

In this article I will show you how to install and use the KDE flow chart tool Kivio.
Recently you might have read my article "Create flow charts with Dia," which introduced you to the world of the Dia diagramming tool. For those readers that are apposed to the GIMP-like interface of Dia and are looking for an interface more closely resembling that of Microsoft Visio, you're in luck. Included with the KDE KOffice toolset is a flow chart/diagramming tool called Kivio that allows you to create impressive flow charts and has an interface that many users will find more user-friendly than that of Dia. But no matter your preference, both tools do an outstanding job of creating flow charts - they just approach the task a bit differently.
Installation
I will give a word of warning here. If you are currently using an alpha or beta version of Ubuntu 10.4 you will not find Kivio in any of your repositories. In order to use Kivio, be using a version <= 9.10 of Ubuntu (or a different distribution all together). That being said, let's install Kivio on Ubuntu 9.10.
You can install Kivio from either a GUI tool or from command line. If you open up the Synaptic package management tool you can follow these simple steps:
Open Synaptic. Search for "kivio" (no quotes). Select Kivio for installation. Click Apply to install. That's it.
If, however, you prefer to install from command line, you can install Kivio with this simple command:
sudo apt-get install kivio
With either method, you will most likely have to install a few dependencies (the amount dictated by your current installation).
Once installed you will find Kivio located in Applications > Office (in both GNOME and KDE).
Using Kivio
When you first fire up Kivio (see Figure 1), you can choose from either creating a new document (either a basic flowchart or an empty document) or you can open any Recent document (created within Kivio). What you will want to start out with is a basic flowchart. To do this, click the Use This Template button in the far right pane. That will fire up Kivio ready to start creating flowcharts.
What I would like to do is to create a flow chart for a network diagram. Only problem is that, out of the box, Kivio doesn't include stencils for network diagrams. So let's first install a new stencil.
You can purchase professional-quality stencils from a company called theKompany. Or you can download the free stencil collection HERE. To install these new stencils, follow these directions:
Open a terminal and change to the directory housing the newly downloaded stencils. Unpack the stencils with the command tar xvfz FILENAME.tar.gz Change into the newly created stencils directory. Move the contents of the stencils directory with the command sudo mv * /usr/share/apps/kivio/stencils/ Restart Kivio
Now you will have plenty of stencils to do the work you need to do. Let's create a network diagram.
To begin, open Kivio and then click the Use This Template button. When the Kivio Main Window opens (see Figure 2) the first thing you will want to do is click Tools > Add Stencil Set > Networking > Basic Network. When you do this, you will notice the stencils in the far left pane will change to represent basic networking hardware, connections, etc. Now you are ready to create a flowchart for a network.
NOTE: You might find other networking stencils work better for your task. Just check through the newly added stencils to find the right one.
Let's start out by adding a router to our network. To do this scroll through the stencils until you find the Router stencil. Click on that stencil and then click in the main work pane (middle pane). Click and drag the cursor until the stencil is the right size for your chart. Don't worry, you can always resize later. But what if you want to label that router? Simple. Click the Text tool (the T icon) and use that to add text for your router.
Let's add a server to our chart. To do this you will follow the same steps as you did for adding the router, only you will select the appropriate server stencil from the left pane. Add associated text as well.
There are two ways to connect these two elements. You can connect them the standard Kivio way, which will connect them with either a straight line or a poly line, or you can connect them using a stencil from the Network collection. Most likely you will want to use a stencil for this connection, since this flow chart is about a network. For example's sake, let's illustrate both methods.
Standard Line Connection
To connect two elements with a standard line follow these steps:
1. Click on Tools > Straight Connector.
2. Select one of the connecting points on the first element (see figure 3) which are indicated by the "X."
3. Click and drag your cursor to a connecting point in the second element.
4. The elements should now be connected.
What is nice about this method is that no matter where you drag those elements, they will remain connected.
Stencil Connector
Adding a stencil connector (from the Network collection) allows you to add a more traditional network flowchart connector. To add this you simply go through the process of adding yet another element (as you did above to add the router or server) and then size and place the connecting element where you need it (see Figure 4).
Got through this process until you have your entire network diagram created. You will find (in the stencil pack you added earlier) plenty of stencils that should help you through the creation of just about any type of network.

These are tough times for sea turtles. Historically plundered for their meat, shells, skins, and eggs, turtles continue to be poached even where they're legally protected.
And they suffer injury and drowning when they come into contact with fishing operations.
As a result of the pressures on them, all seven species of marine turtles are considered at risk globally.
A warming climate will present new threats to these ancient reptiles. Warming may upset turtle population sex ratios. The sex of turtle hatchlings is determined by the temperature at which the eggs develop in the nest, with higher temperatures favoring the production of females.
Finely Tuned Creatures
Turtles have evolved to synchronize their nesting with times of year when the incubation temperature produces roughly equal numbers of male and female hatchlings. If that ratio goes out of whack, populations could plummet, owing to a scarcity of one or the other of the sexes.
The problem could become acute in the Scattered Islands, which dot the Mozambique Channel in the southwest Indian Ocean. (See "A Tale of Two Atolls.") Here, five species of sea turtles feed and breed. Biologists have been focusing their research on the green turtle, one of the most widespread species.
Greens form rookeries of up to 50,000 nests on some of the islands, and their nesting times differ latitudinally. In the cooler southern islands, such as Europa, the peak is in summer, and in the more northerly islands, such as Mayotte and the Glorieuses, egg laying is most prolific in winter.
In theory, a warming climate could make Europa's nesting peak shift toward the cooler winter months, allowing those turtles to maintain a healthy sex ratio.
But that option isn't available for turtles on Mayotte and the Glorieuses, where they're already nesting at the coolest time of year. For these rookeries, warmer air temperatures could result in an excess of females and a paucity of males, disrupting the equilibrium of the population.

Other Threats
Skewed sex ratios aren't the only challenge posed by climate change. A predicted increase in extreme weather events triggered by a warmer atmosphere heightens the risk of storm surges that can inundate turtle nests. Storm surges can also destroy nesting beaches.
And as global sea levels rise, nesting habitat will shrink. It's hard enough for turtles to find suitable egg-laying beaches now, as real-estate development spreads along coastlines, let alone in a future when seas may be several feet higher. (See "Rising Seas.")
Sea turtles face other, less predictable climate impacts. Increases in sea temperature and acidity might limit the growth of sea grasses and other fodder on which some turtles browse. Increasing air humidity could make eggs more susceptible to disease, resulting in higher mortality.
Rising temperatures could also lead to profound changes in ocean circulation—a serious concern in regions such as the Mozambique Channel, with its complex eddies and currents.
Instead of being carried to traditional foraging sites by long-established gyre systems, turtle hatchlings might end up in places that are far from ideal for their survival and growth. Familiar migratory pathways might also be lost.
Uncertainty surrounds all these potential effects, but of one thing biologists are certain: Almost every aspect of turtles' lives—both on land and in the sea—is linked tightly to environmental conditions. Their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment will be crucial to their survival.

Shore Them Up Now
To help sea turtle populations cope with unknown future threats, one of the best things we can do is protect them from existing known harms—fisheries mortality being one of the most grave.
Biologists at the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea, in La Réunion, have been working to identify the migratory corridors green turtles used to travel between their feeding and nesting areas.
Where those corridors bring turtles close to areas of fishing activity—especially coastal gillnetting, which entangles and kills thousands of sea turtles each year—mitigation strategies could include altering the design of nets to make them less likely to snag turtles, illuminating nets with light sticks, building in turtle escape devices, and, most importantly, say the biologists, educating fishers about the need to avoid turtle bycatch.
Tracking technologies have transformed turtle research, and a recent study led by conservation biologist Jérôme Bourjea has shown where turtles that nest in the Scattered Islands go to feed.
Europa's turtles, for instance, swim an average of 1,500 kilometers (more than 900 miles) in 21 days to reach their feeding grounds, traversing the offshore waters of five countries.
There's still much to learn, especially about the movements of newly hatched turtles, which are too small (weighing less than an ounce) to have conventional transmitters attached to their shells. Researchers would like to know at what point in their lives hatchlings become active swimmers as opposed to passive drifters in ocean currents.
Shadowing all this work is the question of whether sea turtles will be able to adapt quickly enough to the environmental changes that are predicted to occur in the oceans over the coming decades.
In the case of green turtles, Bourjea draws at least a modicum of hope from history.
OTTAWA – Prison rights advocates are warning a parliamentary committee studying mental health in federal penitentiaries that the federal Conservative tough-on-crime agenda will "stuff prisons" with mentally ill people and fail to reduce crime.
"Crime is a community issue and an intelligent response ought to involve the community," Craig Jones, director of the John Howard Society, told the committee.
Jones appeared with a former director Graham Stewart, author of a recent study that slammed federal plans for correctional services.
They urged the committee to send a clear message to the government that its approach to crime has already been tested and failed in the United States.
"Our federal prisons have become gladiator schools where we train young men in the art of extreme violence or warehouse mentally ill people," Jones said.
They said the U.S., which has incarcerated people at high rates for 30 years, has seen a rise in violent crime, compared to Canada.
"It has been a catastrophically expensive exercise but it has not produced the reduction in crime rates that you would expect for that rate of incarceration," said Jones.
"In fact, evidence from the United States, and the U.K. is now showing that increasing incarceration rates "may actually increase the rate of crime because of what's called 'prisonization,' or the experience of incarceration and the difficulty thereafter of successful reintegration," they argued.
Pointing to the Conservative government's anti-drug strategy, which embraces mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, they said it ignores the mental health and substance abuse disorders that plague "the majority" of offenders in federal prisons, and will simply lead to a recycling of offenders through the system.
The advocates cited statistics by the federal commissioner of corrections, who said 80 per cent of federal offenders have drug or alcohol abuse problems or both, and about 12 per cent have been diagnosed with mental disorders.
Conservative sentencing changes will soon increase that troubled population, they said.
Jones said the government's law-and-order reforms are "estimated" to be on track to require 3,000 new prison beds for men and 300 for women.
"These are conservative estimates because so far no one has made public the anticipated costs and consequences of the crime agenda, but we can make some general projections based on the American experience," said Jones.
Stewart said the Conservative government's promise to eliminate early parole for offenders will result in "releasing more and more people into the community with serious mental illnesses and without either support or supervision."
Jones called on the government to adopt instead a national strategy to coordinate mental health and correctional services at federal-provincial-and territorial levels that would involve community-delivered mental health services.
Jones said they have "no illusions" their testimony will change things at this point: "The government has repeatedly signalled that its crime agenda will not be influenced by evidence of what does and does not actually reduce crime and create safer communities."
They delivered a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whom they said failed when they announced the national "anti-drug strategy" to understand "the concurrence of mental illness and substance abuse."
The stigmatization of people with mental illness, they argued, "comes from the very top."
Stewart said the government should use human rights as a starting point for prison reform, noting that none of the recommendations from the federal advisory panel on prisons dealt with "drug prevention, harm reduction, or treatment, while 13 recommendations would toughen enforcement, often by further restricting visits?"
"Would we accept recommendations that see family and community support only as security problems without any acknowledgement that both the prisoner and the family are entitled to visit, and are dependent on those visits to maintain their crucial relationships?"
Conservative government MPs on the committee reacted defensively to the testimony, demanding the two address the immediate problem of how to help the mentally ill in prison.
Dave Mackenzie, parliamentary secretary for public safety minister Peter Van Loan, said "we have the same concerns."
"We know the provinces took away resources... I take it your solution would be to eliminate federal prisons?"
Purple-fleshed sweet potato (PFSP) (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam) has been known to possess high amount of anthocyanins which contribute to its antioxidant activity. However, a few reports are available concerning its anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. In this study, PFSP "Tainung 73," which is locally grown in Taiwan, was steamed and extracted using acidified ethanol pH 3.5 under 80°C. Two kinds of crude anthocyanins extracts were obtained, namely, SP (Steamed, Peeled) and SNP (Steamed, No Peeled). Then, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of these extracts were investigated. Cell viability assay (MTT) showed that SP and SNP extracts were not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells. They even exhibited anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the production of NO and proinflammatory cytokines, such as NF-κβ, TNF-α, and IL-6, in LPS-induced macrophage cells. Anticancer activities of these extracts were displayed through their ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7 (breast cancer), SNU-1 (gastric cancer), and WiDr (colon adenocarcinoma), in concentration- and time-dependent manner. Further studies also revealed that SP extracts could induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and SNU-1 cancer cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. In the future, PSFP extracts may have potential to be applied in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and food industries.
I'll confess to never climbing about the Philip K. Dick train. As a Washington College student, I discovered an ancient paperback copy of 1978's VALIS in the O'Neill Literary House, lasted 10 or 20 pages before tapping out. There was something vile and repulsive and off putting around Dick's ennui; to attempt reading them was to feel increasingly unclean and uneasy, like fondling a Hellraiser puzzle box.
There's nothing hip in admitting that Dick adaptations like Total Recall, Paycheck, Blade Runner, and Minority Report have contributed to my cinematic diet over the years. With the exception of Paycheck, they're great movies. More arresting arguably than Paycheck is Richard Linklater's adaptation of Dick's 1977 novel A Scanner Darkly.
Set in a near future Anaheim, California, the film centers on Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves), an undercover police officer who wears a “scramble suit”: a phantasmagoric disguise that projects a constantly shifting series of personas. (His boss dons one, too.) Arctor is investigating the source of a mysterious, pervasive drug called Substance D, which he's consuming alongside equally fried pals played by Winona Ryder, Rory Cochrane, Woody Harrelson, and Robert Downey, Jr. The apparent locus of the investigation happens to be Arctor—and one of their friends wants to sell them out to the pigs.
“Deadpan” is a descriptor I tend to abuse, but A Scanner Darkly begs for that label; there's a no-pulse flatness that consumes the film whole, accentuated by the rotoscoping animation that transforms actors and backgrounds into washed-out husks. It's lethargic, so persuasively boring. Nothing occurring onscreen seems to have any consequence—even when it does—and the viewer shares the camera's sense of mild nausea.
Downey's matter-of-fact mania, Ryder's exhaustion, Cochrane's fidgeting, Reeves' fantastic blankness, the low-level paranoia they share in common: all of it seems impossible to latch onto as a viewer. It's like trying to shake hands with a conference room full of ghosts, or shadow-boxing an unreliable memory. Even that moment, early on, where Linklater offers us a sneak peek at a vast governmental surveillance apparatus feels almost resigned, anticlimactic.
That the world of A Scanner Darkly looks so much like the one we know—what little we see of it—is worth noting. Everything is so blandly pedestrian; everyone shrugs exhaustedly through their strands of plot, the denouement a light at the far end of a tunnel, never nearing. We become these characters, disconnected and adrift.
The most frequent conversational beat occurs when one addict asks another one question: “How much are you taking a day?” The answer is always pained, imprecise, and out of reach. Substance D is erasing awareness, cognition, perspective, self. The cul-de-sac this film drifts into is bucolic, companionable, and profoundly disturbing, catnip to the conspiracy-minded; you may recall, for instance, the Korea segment of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas. That a glimmer of hope slices through the gloom doesn't obviate how adaptable this parable finally is. In the movie, Substance D is revealed to be synthesized from a small blue flower; in the waking reality where we all have to live, “Substance D” could represent any notion, bauble, or mania deployed to distract a population while the very ground it stands on is sold or auctioned away.
Polish beachgoers scrambled after a wild boar emerged from the ocean and began attacking people as they lay in the sun.
Video posted to YouTube on Sunday shows sunbathers looking out into the waves at Karwia Beach on the Baltic Sea as the giant pig swims ashore.
The moment it hits land the boar breaks out into a sprint towards higher ground.
But when it realises it has been penned in by a fence the frightened and angry boar starts to ram people as they lie on their beachtowels.
"Jesus! It is attacking people! Let's all go into the water," one person could be heard shouting.
One bold bather brandishes a piece of driftwood as a club but doesn't appear to land a blow on the porcine intruder.
Eventually a group of men chased the boar back into the woods.

It appears to be the season for symbolic gestures. Last week Fathers4Justice (F4J) activist Paul Manning was arrested and charged for gluing a photo of a child to Constable's The Hay Wain in the National Gallery. The incident occurred two weeks after another F4J activist spray-painted over a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey, and three days before a similar attack on a statue in the same cathedral. That act was done in the name of a different group, Stolen Children of the UK, although a F4J activist was also reported to be in attendance.
After Manning's arrest, F4J put out the daddy of all passive-aggressive statements. It is calling on their supporters to continue independent acts of nonviolent direct action, adding:
"The organisation said it was also now refusing to engage with national media over what it described as deliberately inaccurate and misleading reporting of the campaign and the crisis in the family courts. It was also refusing to deal with the government, police, courts, judiciary and any other organisations involved in family law and said it was considering shutting down all conventional social media."
This may come as good news to the national media, government, police, courts, judiciary and the nation's fine art restoration business, but to everyone else it can be little more than a symbolic gesture. F4J has always despised the political and media establishment and the feeling has been mostly mutual. Their speciality was always the symbolic gesture.
If ever an issue required willingness to compromise and negotiate, it is family dispute settlements. The latest F4J gambit portrays them as stubborn, immutable and hostile – not the symbolism intended. I do not question that the men (and women) involved in F4J feel a sincere and burning sense of anger and frustration at their circumstances. They would counter that a willingness to compromise and negotiate gets them nowhere, either politically or personally. However the timing of this particular announcement is intriguing.
This week the children and families bill entered its second reading. The bill offers changes to family court proceedings, including the introduction of a statutory assumption of shared (though not necessarily time-equal) parenting. The proposals are a hotchpotch of ideas, largely ignoring the recommendations of the Norgrove report and pleasing virtually no one. Legal commentators warn that the proposed wording is sufficiently vague to make rulings more complex than ever. F4J has dismissed it as "a feeble cocktail of proposals [and] a charter for conflict and fatherlessness". One might call it a symbolic gesture.
We need more than gestures on all sides. Family courts rule on the 10% of breakups that present the greatest difficulty. These are, almost by definition, marked by conflicting accounts, bitter allegations and at least one if not two unreasonable parties. Each is usually convinced of their own rectitude and their ex-partner's wickedness. The adversarial legal system then throws petrol on the flames. Every ruling on the best interests of a child is the best guess and a judgment call, and so subject to assumptions, prejudice and prevailing cultural values. It is not just that we don't know for sure whether the system is working adequately, it is that it is literally impossible to say objectively whether the system is working adequately in any one case, far less for all 500,000 adults and children entering the system per year.
If the workings of the court are an opaque mess, the political debate around it is often worse. Commentators often quote statistics on initial residency rulings, without acknowledging that most unresolved disputes centre on maintaining the agreed contact – an entirely different issue. The Ministry of Justice's own research finds that fewer than half of cases that return to court due to non-compliance result in secured contact. Sweeping generalisations are made about "deadbeat dads"; separated fathers are portrayed as probable abusers or, from the other side, innocent victims of terrible injustices. In reality every case is unique and adversarial courts are not only the last resort, they are the worst resort.
Arrangements for shared parenting cannot begin in the family court. They need to begin from the moment of birth. Far more separated fathers maintain satisfactory relationships with their children in Sweden than the UK, and it is not because their courts have a magic formula, it is because fathers are assumed to be equally responsible parents from the word go. We don't need symbolic gestures. We need a wide-ranging and holistic revolution in parenting, and fatherhood in particular. Without that, the family courts will continue to wrestle with impossible knots, and separated fathers will continue to cry out in anger and frustration.

Updated June 3, 2016: Gary Frank's new cover art for the DC Universe: Rebirth #1's third printing has been revealed, featuring the returning Wally West - and some dynamic color work by Alex Sinclair.
Original Story: DC Comics has announced a third printing of DC Universe: Rebirth #1, the one-shot that kicked off its Rebirth publishing initiative on May 5. Like the second printing, it will be square bound and retail for $5.99 - over twice the original release's cover price. DC says this third printing will have a new cover from Gary Frank, although it's unclear it if you will be different from the second printing's cover which showed more of the reaching hand from the original printing. This third printing is scheduled to be released July 6.
In addition to this reprinting, the first wave of Rebirth title one-shots - Batman: Rebirth #1, Green Lanterns: Rebirth #1, Superman: Rebirth #1, and Green Arrow: Rebirth #1 - also sold out at a distributor level and are being reprinted by DC. These new second printings will carry what's a recolored Rebirth banner to differentiate it from the original print run.
Lastly, two of the final "New 52" era books which helps segue into the Rebirth storylines - Justice League #50 and Superman #52 - will receive new printings with recolored covers.
The second printings of both these and the Rebirth title one-shots are scheduled to be released June 29.
CHENNAI: Apart from IT workers , a whole set of other skilled workers - from market research analysts to financial advisors, web developers, teachers, artists, medicos and paramedics - might see their dreams of moving to the US never bear fruition. With most of them drawing salaries between the $60,000 to $100,000 cap, a new bill proposed by the Congress is likely to affect these workers just as much as it hurts the IT industry.Skilled employment in the US is back in the limelight, after US Congressmen reintroduced a bill last week that has upped the ante for H1B visas.The bill has raised the benchmark from $60,000 to a minimum of $100,000 to be able to work in America. It also seeks to remove a master's degree exemption that currently exists. Unlike popular perception that ties H1B visas with the IT industry, industry observers said that there are a lot of non-IT workers too, who are going to be impacted by this move.“I've had several Montessori and high school teachers asking me how such a cap can be met. IT professionals can easily meet this threshold but teachers and lecturers are paid much less. The American education system relies heavily on sourcing teachers from other countries. They need to consider other sector impacts as well," said Anu Peshawari, immigration lawyer at Anu Attorney Law Firm.When Shravya Jain, 29, got their H1B visa it felt like they had won a lottery. And the US system for handing out work visa for student immigrants works pretty much like a lottery system - something that could get tougher given the Congress' recent move and President- elect Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.Students studying in the US get two rounds of interview. Jain had a tough one year soon after they passed out of Colombia University of Journalism, New York.“I was on a F1 student visa and companies had internal rules against hiring candidates like me. Even if their internal policy did not forbid it, they were not keen to be hiring an outsider," said Jain, who works as an associate with advocacy agency Climate Nexus, which sponsored their visa during a six-month fellowship programme.Chances of a visa go-ahead also depends on the skillset being applied for. When a qualified nurse Anita Mary, applied to the US, they did so to continue their spiritual work. They had received a sponsorship from a non-profit organisation in Los Angeles, despite which their visa application got rejected. “When my application for rejected I was told I would have had a higher chance of acceptance if I had tried to go the US as a nurse. The US apparently has a shortage of skilled nurses," said Mary.Immigration lawyers said that the new measures would force more people to try visas under other routes such as L1 if they were qualified and EB5 if they had the money.“People will also try under the O1 category, which is in recognition of people with extraordinary talent in the field of arts, music, education, science, sports, etc," said Peshawaria.Mark Davies, an immigrant lawyer who works both in the US and UK, said that there were a lot of their clients who have been applying for visas under L1 and EB5.“We have clients in different sectors; in manufacturing, management consultancy, trucks, logistics, restaurants, hotels, the medical industry, medical testing, even insurance," said Davies.Davies said that there are multiple factors that go into why certain people get selected in certain visa categories.“EB5 visa route is the easiest route to get processed, provided you have the money. An L1 visa means you'd have to show merit For instance, I've helped talented Indian chefs through their visa applications," they said.Lawyers said that the Trump regime might affect skilled workers, but not highly-skilled workers or potential investors with deep pockets. “Trump welcomes investments coming to the US. They have always been viewed as being friendly to the business community," said Peshawaria.
WASHINGTON — In any major crisis involving speed, judgment and getting reliable information, the first question any president needs to decide is this: Who is invited to the meeting to discuss the strategic options?
So the photograph of President Trump's group of advisers at their Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday night — released by the White House and edited “for security” in the words of Sean Spicer, the press secretary — was immediately scrutinized for what it said about who has the commander in chief's ear at a critical moment. And of course, what you see may depend on what you are looking for. Or, in this case, whom.
Does Stephen K. Bannon's position on the outer ring reflect their recent removal from the principals committee of the National Security Council, or does their presence, and that of the adviser Stephen Miller, suggest a change in title but not in influence? What about the presence of the only woman visible in the room, Dina Powell, a former aide to President George W. Bush and a longtime friend of Ivanka Trump who was recently brought on as a deputy national security adviser? And why would the commerce and Treasury secretaries be involved in a Tomahawk strike? (Answer: Because they were at the resort to meet Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.)
For those debating the meaning here, it is important to remember that pictures can be overinterpreted. The defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and the chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph F. Dunford Jr., were joining by secure video conference; the photo shows the back of a screen.
It's been a long, long time since I wrote a post here at Blue Virginia. The election of Donald Trump, the excitement of Indivisible, and the energy of Virginia Democrats going into this election year has drawn me back. I have had a number of thoughts for what I believe needs to be said among the Blue Virginia community, but the length of time since I last regularly blogged has created a writer's block (or maybe it's a wall?) I have wanted to speak out the negative tone from Northam surrogates, such as Dick Saslaw and Terry McAuliffe, and the concerns I have for how it will dispirit our newly energized party. Similarly, the lack of leadership from our statewide elected officials on the environment and fighting against Trump's climate rollback has been disappointing. But I'm going to rejoin the Blue Virginia community by trying to be positive about the year ahead.
This could be a YUGE year for us.
Back in December, 2013, I made this observation about the challenges facing us in state and local elections.
Roxann Robinson in the 27th hasn't seen an election since winning a special election in 2010. In fact, the 27th hasn't seen a contested general election in a long time. Previous Republican Delegate Sam Nixon had held the district uncontested since winning it in a special election in 1994. Elsewhere, Republican Tommy Wright hasn't been challenged in over ten years, since 2001. The biggest winner of this do-nothing political system? Riley Ingram, who hasn't been challenged since 1995!
When the 27th became open during a special election in 2010, the Democratic Party ignored the district and instead devoted resources to a more Republican district in Harrisonburg. At the time, the 27th was a district where Barack Obama had won. Focusing more on candidate than district, Ward Armstrong and their advisers decided to spend $60,000 in the more Republican district where they liked the candidate. In 2010, Ben Tribbett wrote on the 27th:
“This is a seat that is more Democratic than the 26th, would be tougher to tear up in redistricting, and is exactly the kind of area Democrats need to win to take back the House. Instead, we are not even competing. Which tells you all you need to know about where Democrats are in the House of Delegates right now and how their immediate future looks.”
Where are we in 2017?
All three of those seats got challengers in 2015. While Republicans won them all, in both the 27th and 62nd our Democratic challenger broke 40%. I'm not advocating these as top tier races this year, but we not only have a candidate in the 27th, but two candidates in the 62nd. In the 62nd Trump won by 5% and it doesn't look like it will be highly competitive. But in the neighboring 27th district, also in Chesterfield County, Trump only won by 2.4% and Hillary ran 5.7% ahead of Obama's 2012 numbers.
As Lowell has been tracking, the Democratic Party of Virginia and our House Caucus has made amazing strides with candidate recruitment this year. We have Democratic challengers in every Clinton-won district. The Trump implosion, the vigor of our movement, and the strength of our candidates have already scared off three Republicans, David Albo, Mark Dudenhefer, and Jimmie Massie. We have some amazing candidates; I'm personally a big fan of Chris Hurst in the 12th, but I'm sure you have your favorites as well.
Candidate recruitment is just the first step, down-ballot Democrats need to find better ways to ride the coattails from the top of the ticket. As I wrote after the 2013 election, our successful Democratic candidates were clustered in districts where McAuliffe won more than 55% of the vote, a threshold we've seen in both Democratic and Republican gerrymandering schemes. We later lost the two exceptions to that, the 2nd and the 100th. While I'm optimistic about the 2nd this fall, the trends in the 100th have not been good. Not only has the district trended away in the recent 2016 election, Hillary winning by just under 3% when Obama won it by over 10%, it has consistently underperformed in the lower turnout gubernatorial elections. It was also one of only three districts that went McAuliffe-Obenshain in 2013.
Lowell has their own rankings of the districts and I am similarly bullish on the top, over 55% Clinton districts: the 42nd (Albo's open seat), the 67th (LeMunyon), the 2nd (Dudenhefer's open seat), and the 32nd (Greason). I am more concerned about seats like the 13th, where we have consistently seen lower turnout in gubernatorial years. As I wrote in 2013:
In 2009, Deeds ran statewide roughly 11 points behind Obama's average performance and was close to this expected performance in most delegate districts. But in the 13th District represented by Bob Marshall, Deeds was 5.61% behind their expected performance. Four years later, while winning statewide with a coalition that closely resembled Obama's winning formula, McAuliffe ran 4.73% behind their expected performance in the 13th district as well. The 13th is the poster child for a district where a growing minority population has turned a seat blue in high turnout years, but hasn't caught up (yet) in lower turnout years.
Another seat to look at is the 2nd, where Futrell was elected by just 223 votes. In 2009, Deeds ran 5.49% behind their expected performance, an indication of turnout problems very similar to the 13th. In 2013, McAuliffe ran 3.37% behind. This is a 58% Obama district, strongly Democratic in high turnout years, but more conservative if turnout doesn't occur in the right Democratic-leaning communities.
In fact, all of Deeds's worst performing districts had minority-heavy areas in Prince William County: 52nd (Torian), 50th (Miller), 13th (Marshall), and 2nd (Futrell). Even with McAuliffe's win, Prince William was a problem for turnout in the campaign. McAuliffe's worst performing districts were more diverse, ranging from the 16th outside of Danville (the open seat that elected Adams), to the 13th, and the 22nd (Byron), 30th (Scott), 19th (Austin), 2nd (Futrell), and 14th (Danny Marshall). If there is a theme, it's that problems with Prince William turnout continue, and we also see problems in Danville and Southside. Deeds did not do as poorly in Danville and Southside, probably because they were running better with Southside whites and able to compensate for lower black turnout.
Is there a trend to where both McAuliffe and Deeds both do worse? Here's what I've found. We've talked about the 13th and 2nd in Prince William, and also the 50th. Another cluster is in the exurbs of Stafford and Spotsylvania: 54th (Orrock), 88th (Cole), and 28th (Howell), and the neighboring 30th (Scott) in Culpeper and Orange.
If Democrats can build on the energy of the Indivisible movement, with the continued unpopularity of President Trump, we may see a significant shift in Democratic turnout. Republicans are already running scared in special elections in both Georgia and KANSAS. Defeating Bob Marshall in the 13th, and picking up similar seats like the 51st (Anderson), 50th (Miller), and 31st (Lingamfelter), will depend on turnout and the energy behind the Democratic ticket in the fall. The 94th down in Newport News is in the same list.
We may be on track to see four or five seats flip in a “normal” year, with the upside of significantly more. Lowell's list is good of seats that could be in play because of a wave, but it's missing one district because we don't have a candidate. If I could, magically, wave a wand and come up with a new Democratic recruit in a district that's currently unchallenged, I'd pick the 76th down in Suffolk and Chesapeake. Delegate Chris Jones is unchallenged and it is certainly a Republican district: Trump won 52% to 44%. But Clinton's margin was a little under 2% closer than Obama's from 2012, which was similarly an improvement compared to their 2008 performance despite their decline elsewhere.
South of the James River, Obama's 42.76% in the Suffolk and Chesapeake based 76th district jumped to 44.77%. It's still a Republican district, but it stands out as a surprisingly close district in the governor's election as well: McAuliffe 47.10% to Cuccinelli's 47.63%. Although certainly some of that margin is due to Sarvis, the Attorney General's race was a close 47.28% for Herring and 52.72% for Obenshain. In fact, this was also a district where Deeds did better than expected, and McAuliffe did much better than expected. Given the trends in Suffolk and Chesapeake, we also see Democratic trends in the 14th State Senate seat, even though it's still very Republican.
Warner received 47% of the two party vote here, almost 5% ahead of Obama's numbers. As noted above, in off-year elections Virginia Democrats have done better, not worse, than expected, unlike the other districts discussed above. In a good election year our gubernatorial candidate is likely winning 45% to 47% of the vote, if not higher. This is a seat that's in the same range as the 85th, held by Holcomb, that Lowell highlights in their list.
