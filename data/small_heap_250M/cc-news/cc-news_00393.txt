Rev up your engines because this campaign is heading into the home stretch and things are getting very interesting.
So far, this campaign has been frustrating for Ontario Liberals. On the one hand, most Ontarians have had a visceral negative reaction to Doug Ford and his vision for this province. But on the other hand, many voters seem to have an underlying desire for change that has driven them into the arms of the NDP, at least for now.

I have written previously in this space about the myriad of economic risks associated with an NDP victory, so I won't rehash those again.
In the days ahead, Liberals need to keep reminding Ontarians what's at stake. While a growing number have decided that they shouldn't vote for Ford and the PCs, they need to be convinced that they ought to vote Liberal. As we have seen before in this province, change for its own sake can be dangerous.
ELECTION PANEL: Ontario election political panel debates who won final debate
That's the point Kathleen Wynne tried to make during last Sunday's leaders debate. She did precisely what she needed to do, delivering a performance that might be able to put her back into this race as we head into the final week.
Wynne demonstrated why Ontarians elected her to a majority government in 2014 — her honesty, depth, and understanding of the complexity of government. As she defended her record, she was a stark contrast to the canned political speak coming from Ford and Andrea Horwath. Wynne stuck to that tone for the rest of the night — speaking directly to voters in an honest, unfiltered way about her values and her plan. It was passionate, intelligent and deeply personal. And that's important because neither Horwath nor Ford appeared ready for prime time.
COMMENTARY: Tom Parkin says NDP's momentum comes as voters reject Doug Ford's ‘man of the people' act
Ford was barely present. Sticking to pre-programmed slogans, he had no explanation for why he hasn't released a costed platform and time and again he advertised the fact that he simply isn't suitable to serve as premier of this province. Ford looked and sounded like a kid who hadn't prepared for a book report and came to class with his Coles notes. Premiers don't have the luxury of Coles notes.
WATCH: Kathleen Wynne to Doug Ford “Have you been to a daycare?”
Horwath wasn't much better. While her grasp of key issues is stronger than that of Ford, she suffers from the fact that her party is beholden to a rigid ideology based in the 1970s left-wing activism.
This was made clear in the signature exchange of the debate when Wynne took Horwath to task for her unwillingness to stand up for the public interest and say no to public-sector unions. Horwath simply couldn't explain why she would take away the vital tool of back-to-work legislation to deal with strikes that carry on too long and hurt too many people.
WATCH: Wynne, Horwath spar over collective bargaining in final leaders debate
After the exchange, Horwath looked shaken, unsure of herself and ultimately appeared unprepared to govern. Worse, she confirmed that when push comes to shove, she'll follow public-sector union leaders first and the people of this province second. For those thinking about voting NDP, that exchange should cause them to think again.
With a week to go in an election that has already been filled with volatility and surprises, Wynne's debate night was the kind of event that might just kickstart a comeback, and at the very least provide some much-needed momentum to local Liberal candidates fighting tight battles across the province.

For example, this week's Ipsos poll shows the Ontario Liberals have regained the lead in the city of Toronto. If this trend continues and Liberals keep a laser-like focus on ground game, including voter contact, Wynne may just be able to pull a rabbit out of a hat.
Don't get me wrong. This campaign has not been great for Liberals thus far, despite a top-notch war room and election tour. Now is definitely not the time to slack off.
COMMENTARY: Deb Hutton says Doug Ford offers stark contrast to big government visions of the NDP and Liberals
As Winston Churchill said, “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”
Wynne has been a fighter her whole life. She is now in the final stages of the biggest fight of her life. I, for one, would never count her out until all of the ballots have been counted.

Cold Lake city council is asking the Government of Alberta, via a letter, for some clarity on why little progress seems to have been made on a major oilsands development in the region.
“There has been no movement on Imperial's Cold Lake expansion project in the last year and a half,” said Mayor Craig Copeland in a Nov. 29 statement.
According to Lisa Schmidt, a public and government affairs advisor with Imperial, the company is still waiting for approval from the Alberta Energy Regulator.
“This project is vital to our region, which has been hard hit by the lingering economic downturn. We are asking for the status of the project and what our government can do to help this file along.”
Imperial's Cold Lake expansion project completed its environmental impact assessment in 2015 and has been awaiting regulatory approval since March, 2016.
For more than a year and a half, about 18 statements of concern have been sitting with AER.
“We've heard that no statements of concern have been handled since early 2016,” said Copeland. “With new, high-paying jobs at stake, we find it hard that so little progress could be made.”
He said, by writing a letter to Minister of Energy Margaret McCuaig-Boyd, city council is seeking a deeper understanding of why Cold Lake hasn't heard about any positive progress on the project.
The expansion project is expected to produce about 50,000 barrels of additional bitumen per day and would create approximately 100 full-time positions for the duration of its operation. About 500 jobs would be created during the two- to three-year construction phase.
Imperial currently produces about 160,000 barrels of bitumen a day at its Cold Lake operation, which is a major employer in the region.
Cold Lake officials expected an announcement on the project this summer.
Copeland said there is a fear in the community that if the project is stalled, investment will leave Cold Lake.
“This expansion project would be a massive boost to our economy in northeastern Alberta,” said Copeland. “We need to hear something about this project because, in our area, a lot of hopes are resting on finally hearing some good news.”
Imperial's proposed expansion will use solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage technology (SA-SAGD) to access bitumen in the Grand Rapids formation.
If their application is successful, this would be Imperial's first commercial application of SA-SAGD technology, and the company's first production in the Grand Rapids Formation.
Current production in the area uses cyclic steam stimulation to extract bitumen from the Clearwater Formation, located directly below the Grand Rapids Formation.
The $2-billion project, if approved, will be built on the company's existing oil leases about 20 km northwest of Cold Lake, between Bourque Lake and Marie Lake.
The company says the solvent-assisted method will result in a reduction of about 25 per cent in greenhouse gas intensity compared with existing steam-assisted gravity drainage technology.
If developed, the estimated $2-billion project is expected to produce about 50,000 barrels per day of bitumen.
Last August, Imperial held a private meeting with the residents from the Marie Lake area.
Nearly 50 residents attended to strongly protest against the proposed development that would be built a few hundred metres away from Marie Drive.

The Joe E. Brown All-Stars, Bank of America and Universal Pictures don't find their way onto UCLA's schedule anymore.
It may sound like the stuff of Hollywood, but those were actual opponents of the Bruins in the 1930s and 1940s. Equally surreal was what was happening in the rivalry between UCLA and USC.
The Bruins lost 42 consecutive games to that other team across town. It's true. The team that leads its rival, 11-0, in national championships could not win a game in the series between February 1932 and January 1943.
No. 6 UCLA's current four-game losing streak against USC is tied for the longest skid in the series since then, adding some potential historic intrigue to their next matchup, Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion.
“Even losing one is uncomfortable, let alone four in a row,” UCLA center Thomas Welsh said Tuesday. “This is a big game for sure. We want to keep our win steak going and end that losing streak against USC.”
USC's longest winning streak in the series since the Trojans played home games at the Shrine Auditorium and signaled the end of each half with gun blasts have been four-game pockets of success from 2003 to 2004, 2009 to 2011, and the current run that started in January 2016. USC beat UCLA, 84-76, last month by using a four-guard lineup and a zone defense that helped generate 17 turnovers.
The Bruins (23-3, 10-3 Pac-12 Conference) are 4-0 since that defeat, largely by tightening their defense in the wake of a lengthy players-only meeting after the game at the Galen Center.
“That meeting definitely helped,” said freshman point guard Lonzo Ball, who pinned the loss on himself after committing a season-worst seven turnovers. “The USC game kind of woke us up, put us back in [our] place and we've been playing better basketball ever since.”
The Trojans (21-5, 8-5) have also continued to thrive, winning three of their last four games to all but clinch a second consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. UCLA Coach Steve Alford said he thought USC should be nationally ranked but noted that a victory over the Trojans would give the Bruins a three-game advantage over their rival in the conference standings.
It would also end one of UCLA's more aggravating streaks in the series between the teams.
“We're not going to live in the past,” Ball said. “Even though we dropped one up there, we've got to get one here.”
Give it a rest
Alford described his players as “a tired team” in the first meeting against USC after having been one of the first Pac-12 teams to open conference play and one of the last to enjoy the “bye week” in which it played only one game.
UCLA should be fully rested for the rematch. The Bruins will have gone nearly a week without a game after beating Oregon State on Sunday.
Alford said he intended to “maximize some rest time” for the Bruins with the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments only a few weeks away. Practices have already been reduced, with players spending no more than about 75 minutes on the court each day.
“This is such a big basketball IQ group, you just want to make sure we're very fresh down the stretch,” Alford said. “Right now I think we are, we've just got to stay that way.”
Etc.
UCLA's average home attendance of 10,652 is its highest since it averaged 10,739 during the 1997-98 season. Alford said the energy his players derived from fans during the second half of the Bruins' victory over Oregon last week “was the difference in the game.” UCLA's game against USC on Saturday is being billed as a blue-out, meaning fans are encouraged to wear that color. … Guard Bryce Alford has 1,776 points, leaving him nine away from surpassing Charles O'Bannon (1,784) for 10th place on the school's all-time scoring list. … Guard Isaac Hamilton was not feeling well Tuesday and did not practice.

The judiciary in Pakistan has always been afflicted with flawed and discriminatory judgments, more than often denying justice to the lot seeking redressal for justice. In particular, the courts in Pakistan, even the high courts, earned infamy for passing verdicts on blasphemy laws hitting hapless members of the minority community — already reeling under highhandedness in a country where institutions are largely biased and fanatical — hard.
Having said this, it's equally significant to state that in a recent judgment, one Justice Asif Khosa made most apt observations in a case where one Mushtaq, a Christian scavenger (what would be called a sweeper in India) facing charges of blasphemy, was given a fair hearing. The case dates back to October 2006. Mushtaq was charged for burning the Quran. Presiding over a three-member bench, Khosa held that the prosecution failed to prove the occurrence of blasphemy beyond a reasonable doubt and the police investigation was faulty and flawed .
The judges further observed, for instance, that the matchbox produced in the lower courts was stated to be different from the one in the police records. Also, the burnt piece of holy scriptures from the Quran, used as evidence against Mushtaq, was not recovered by the Investigation Officer (IO) from the crime scene, but was rather provided by the complainant. This created suspicion over the authenticity, thus making it inadmissible in the court of law.
Such observations, valid at face value, serve to underline the common practice of instigating and bribing the police in Pakistan to file frivolous and baseless charges for which complaints themselves provide concocted evidence. To worsen matters, the prosecution based its arguments solely on the police investigation report and usually ignored any legal loopholes or discrepancies. The lower judiciary, in the meanwhile, due to its heavy backlogs of cases, does not spend time sifting through the evidence. The result, therefore, is a travesty of justice .
Khosa further expressed his shock at the lack of credible witnesses to the crime for which Mushtaq was convicted in the lower court. It's also worth underlining that given the legal and social constraints, no sane man will ever indulge in such a crime. According to the bench, mob justice and lynching is closely associated with the religious fervour that conveniently clouds any logic or reasoning.
One cannot ignore the fact that religious fundamentalists in Pakistan consider it their religious right to kill anyone accused of blasphemy and ordinarily, no one is allowed to defend the poor. And it's more a mockery of the judicial system .
Against this backdrop, it merits to be put on record that more than a dozen cases of mob lynching have taken place in Pakistan since the start of the year. Increasing blasphemy allegations and misuse of the law are symptoms of failed governance, and are exacerbated by Pakistan's law and order situation. Pakistan's criminal justice system ranks very low in the global context. Legal experts and human rights watchers feel there is an urgent need for drastic improvement and re-engineering. It is therefore incumbent upon more judicial officers to partake their duties with full honesty and integrity as in the case of Mushtaq discussed above. Khosa's verdict and findings were an exception. Delving deep into the evidence was not ordinary. Otherwise, trials and judgments are routinely one-sided and driven by fanaticism .
Unless the Pakistan judiciary takes recourse to fair play and real justice, it cannot match international standards let alone contest the Kulbhushan Jadhav case in the International Court of Justice. The whole world knows how Pakistani lawyers were exposed for their triviality when arguing in The Hague not so long ago .

Two 17-year-old boys were stopped and arrested in Peterborough at the weekend on suspicion of theft, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and numerous other driving offences.
A 17-year-old boy, of no known address, was arrested in South Street, Stanground, on Sunday afternoon (April 16) on suspicion of theft, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, driving without insurance and driving without a licence.
He has been charged with driving while disqualified, driving without insurance, and driving without a licence. He has been bailed to return to Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on May 3.
His passenger, a 17-year-old boy, of Deerleap in Bretton, Peterborough, was also arrested. He received a simple caution for making off without payment from a petrol station.
He offered the business to his children. They too had grown up here, and they knew the business. "So I told them, 'Give me a quarter and it's yours.' But they said, 'No, we can't do what you do. You've got the mustache, you've got the attitude, you've got the experience.'"
Ryan Donaldson is thrilled his career has gone “full circle” and brought him back to Hartlepool United.
The attacking midfielder got his first taste of professional football with a dozen games on loan for Pools up front when he was a teenage Newcastle United prospect in 2011.
You want to play in the Football League but this is a Football League club in everything but name, RYAN DONALDSON
Donaldson, now 26, is thrilled to have joined Pools on a permanent basis – but this is no move about sentiment.
The Geordie is here to win games – a lot of games with Pools and get the club back into the Football League.
“I can't wait to get started,” explained Donaldson, who said the deal was concluded quickly.
“It's been a bit of a whirlwind, to be honest.
“I have good memories from my time here – I played my first game of professional football here.
“I'm on 200-plus now, so I have come full circle and hopefully I can help the club move in the right direction again.
“I only heard about it last week, but it ticked all the right boxes and it's something I wanted to be a part of and I can't wait to get started.”
Donaldson told www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk that there was interest from other areas, including EFL clubs, but added that he had no qualms about stepping down into the fifth tier.
“You want to play in the Football League, but this is a Football League club in everything but name,” he said.
“To be in the league is good, but this was just perfect for me.
“To be back in the North East and playing for this club again is something I couldn't turn down.”
Donaldson was unable to fulfil his Magpies promise in his first instalment at the Vic.
He never made it either at his boyhood club, but once he crossed the Tyne to Gateshead in the National League, he was a young man transformed.
He was superb for Heed, earning him a move to league rivals Cambridge United.
Donaldson was excellent for the U's, firing them to promotion, much to his former club's chagrin – he scored against them in the play-off final at Wembley.
That victory was his second dose of Wembley glory, having earlier scored two of the goals when Cambridge won the FA Trophy, beating Gosport Borough 4-0.
Donaldson spent a further two seasons in the Football League with Cambridge before joining League Two rivals Plymouth last summer.
He made 33 appearances for the Pilgrims, scoring twice, only to fall out of favour for the final two months of the campaign.
Professors and support staff at the Nova Scotia Community College have agreed to new six-year collective agreements.
The Nova Scotia Teachers Union, which represents the two bargaining units, says a vote on management's final offer was held Tuesday.

Faculty members voted 55 per cent in favour of the offer, while 64 per cent of voters with the professional support bargaining unit were in favour.
The union says the agreements, which run from Sept. 1, 2014 to Aug. 31, 2020, were ratified following the vote and include a seven-per-cent wage increase over the six-year terms.

Under legislation, the employer is required to freeze the years of service used to calculate an employee's retirement service award as of March 31, 2015.
However, the union says under both agreements employees can either choose to collect their service award based on their salary at retirement, or collect it immediately based on their salary as of March 31, 2018
The "Door and Knocker" exhibition, prepared by the Kenan Yavuz Cultural House, recently opened to visitors in Bayburt province. Greeting art lovers at Kenan Yavuz Cultural House in Beşpınar village in Demirözü district, the exhibition features 20 old doors and knockers that were brought from various cities in Turkey.
Attending the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Bayburt Governor Ali Hamza Pehlivan said that Kenan Yavuz, the founder of the cultural house, turns important topics in the context of Turkish culture and humanity into concrete works.
Noting the "Door and Knocker" exhibition is one of these works, Pehlivan said, "Harmony is a notion that is desired in life. It is a part of our belief and culture as well."
Pehlivan explained that monotony can make the colors of life fade. "Unfortunately, our world and life in the world face the risk of evolving to monotony with globalization," he added.
Explaining that life has great variety, he reported, "If we disengage our roots which are the values supporting us, our life will be separated from its color and beauty. Therefore, a monotonous life will appear. However, this "Door and Knocker" exhibition creates a story with our roots. Doors have authentic messages with abstract concepts in both architectural and spiritual context. There is a message in Anatolian doors. Even the knockers of them are various. They give messages to those inside."
Kenan Yavuz also stressed that they want to create a story with the exhibition. Yavuz continued, "We conduct works to introduce the materials that have an important place in people's lives and to draw attention to the traditional life. We tried to collect memorial goods of people and other material that we did not appreciate here. Unfortunately, all of the village houses become concrete ones. People live in metropolitan areas and they build the same city houses when they are back in their villages."
Nick Scandalios, the executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization, will receive the Isabelle Stevenson Award at this year's Tony Awards ceremony.
Scandalios — a longtime exec at Nederlander, the producing organization and Broadway landlord — will take home the honor for his dedication and contribution to the work of the Family Equality Council, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ families around the country. He joined the council's board of directors in 2008 and became the board chair in 2014, along the way contributing to the organization's push for marriage equality.
The Nederlander Org owns nine Broadway venues (where shows including “Hamilton,” “Wicked,” and “The Lion King” are currently playing) as well as theaters in other U.S. markets and in London. Scandalios, who's worked at Nederlander for 31 years, is also on the board for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and the former chair of the board of governors at the Broadway League.
Past recipients of the Stevenson Award, named after the woman who served 30 years as the president of the American Theatre Wing, have included David Hyde Pierce, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Larry Kramer, and Rosie O'Donnell.
The award for Scandalios is one of a handful of special trophies that will be handed out during the 2018 Tony ceremony in June, including lifetime achievement honors for Chita Rivera and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Nominations in the competitive categories will be announced May 1 ahead of the June 10 ceremony.
On the surface, the “Despicable Me” cartoons appear to be sendups of the James Bond franchise, but beneath that slick, spoofy exterior, they're really marshmallow-centered affirmations of good old-fashioned family values. In the original, reformed super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) agrees to reprioritize his life around his three newly adopted daughters. Then, in the sequel, Gru met soul mate Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) and got hitched. And now, in what might have been titled “Predictable Me 3,” Gru discovers his long-lost twin brother, Dru, giving the superficially surly character even more reasons for group hugs — and there's no sign of stopping.
The fact that Gru has lost his job with the Anti-Villain League and that Dru desperately wants to get into the villainy racket is mostly just incidental in a series that's starting to feel less like 007 and more like “The Brady Bunch” with every outing. And lest you assume that “Despicable Me 3” somehow marks the poignant finale of a predetermined trilogy, think again: The movie wraps in the most open-ended way possible, paving the way for a seemingly infinite number of sequels — which could actually be the way in which this series most resembles the Bond movies.
But here's a word of advice for the talented folks at Illumination that might have come in handy before they undertook this outing: As happened with “Shrek” and various other cartoon franchises before it, Gru's ensemble is starting to feel a bit bloated, and before moving forward, the studio might want to shed a few characters, starting — blasphemy of blasphemies! — with the Minions, who now officially have Nothing To Do. (Nota bene: Whether out of wisdom or contract considerations, Russell Brand's Dr. Nefario spends the movie frozen in carbonite, which is a step in the right direction.)
In theory, the Minions are the reason these movies make millions, and it should tell you something that the little yellow guys succeed in delivering two fart jokes before the Illumination logo has even cleared the screen. They're the irreverent comic relief in a series that's robustly funny in its own right. And yet, like the acorn-obsessed Scrat in the “Ice Age” movies, the Minions' scenes have broken off from the main storyline, their antics now unfolding as little added-value vignettes in parallel to the plot at hand.
Meanwhile, the central narrative concerns Gru's discovery of Dru (both voiced by Steve Carell, though the latter's accent is slightly different, suggesting a Tommy Wiseau-like lilt). It should be noted that the surprise-twin thing is the kind of device that surely makes even soap-opera writers blush — but then, that's half the joke in a franchise that's self-aware enough to realize that it's taking tired clichés and turning them upside-down and inside-out. Where the first “Despicable Me” movie seemed to be winking at the audience in open acknowledgement of what it was stealing from other sources, this third installment is all but rolling its eyes at us (as in a lame bit where Gru and Dru pretend to be one another, à la “Parent Trap,” knowing full well that they're the only ones who find it funny).
Along the same lines, the running gag about the movie's new villain — a disgruntled former child star named Balthazar Bratt (voiced by “South Park” co-creator Trey Parker) — is how out-of-touch he is with the audience. A relic of the '80s, when everyone knew him from his “Evil Bratt” TV series, Balthazar wears shoulder pads and pump sneakers, tossing bubble-gum bombs and break-dancing his way through heists. But when he runs the tape of an old episode for ideas, the joke is meant to be how hopelessly corny it all was, right down to his “I've been a bad boy!” tagline.
This ever-so-slight change in tone may be too discreet for “Despicable Me” fans to pick up on, but analyzed carefully, it represents a dangerous shift toward ironic detachment. While these movies are allowed to be as silly as they like, what made them so delightful was the fact the filmmakers took the material seriously, treating even those warm-fuzzy family moments with sincerity. Here, we're allowed to “Awwww” when littlest-daughter Agnes tells step-mother Lucy, “I love you, Mom,” but when Gru makes the same admission to his brother, it's the Minions who “Awwww,” throwing up a buffer of comic detachment. We haven't gotten there yet, but the instant these movies stop caring about their characters, we'll stop caring as well.
For the moment, both the filmmakers and audience remain invested, which allows writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (who've been with the series since the beginning) to splinter the story into half a dozen strands. While Balthazar manages to steal the world's largest diamond — wearing a fat suit modeled after France's biggest movie star, in a joke clearly concocted by the movie's Paris-based Mac Guff team — Gru and Lucy set out to thwart him and earn back the respect of new boss Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate). While Gru and Dru make up for lost time, Lucy attempts to bond with the three little girls, who each have subplots of their own, the funniest being Agnes' obsession with locating a real, live unicorn.
And then there are the Minions, who have grown disgruntled with all of Gru's do-goodery. Following the lead of Mel (their Braveheart?), they agree to go on strike, making it clear they miss the days when they assisted in evil heists. What the Minions really want is another villain to serve, which means the movie has to keep cutting back to them as they seek out mischief en masse — whether crashing a “Sing”-style talent competition or making trouble in prison.
Yes, “Despicable Me 3” is unwieldy, but it mostly works, as directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin (who also voices the Minions) never lose sight of the film's emotional center, packing the rest with as much humor as they can manage. The jokes come so fast and furious, the movie can hardly find room for Heitor Pereira's funky score, and though Pharrell Williams has contributed five new songs to sell soundtracks (including the sweet “There's Something Special”), the movie hardly needs them, making better use of classic tracks from Michael Jackson and Madonna.
If you're looking for light, all-around protection for your new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, you might consider a sleeve while you wait for other options.
For its first-generation iPad Pros, Apple provided a number of accessories, including a silicone case that attached to the back and had a cutout for a Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard. Unfortunately for fans of that case, it appears that Apple has elected not to produce a version for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and has even discontinued the 12.9-inch version.
Third-party options in this area for a thin and light case that protects the back of your iPad are still few and far between for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. In the meantime, while manufacturers gear up and prepare new products, we recommend using a sleeve. While not as convenient as a case that supports Apple's Smart Keyboard, sleeves, available from Apple and a number of other manufacturers, offer light, portable protection for every side of your iPad.
Here are some sleeves that you might want to consider while you wait on third parties to create Smart Keyboard-compatible back cases for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro.
Apple Leather Sleeve for 10.5-inch iPad Pro
Apple offers its own sleeve for the iPad Pro line. The sleeve is made of leather, with a microfiber lining on the interior to protect your iPad's screen from scratches. In addition to your iPad, the sleeve also features an integrated storage space for your Apple Pencil, though it seems to be a little too snug for the Smart Keyboard.
You can get the leather sleeve in four color options: saddle brown, taupe, midnight blue, and black. The leather sleeve is available from Apple for $129.

DODOCase Durables Sleeve for 10.5-inch iPad Pro
Meant to offer durable yet slim protection, DODOCase's Durable Sleeve features a waxed canvas outer layer, combined with a middle layer of recycled felt and a cotton twill liner. The interior is spacious enough to accommodate a Smart Keyboard in addition to your iPad Pro. The Durables Sleeve comes in three colors: sage, midnight, and navy.
You'll find the Durables Sleeve at DODOcase for $69.95.

Waterfield Dash Sleeve for iPad Pro
Shipping on June 30, Waterfield's Dash Sleeve for iPad Pro is meant to hold an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard attached. Your iPad is held in place by a sturdy strap across the top, which you can easily unsnap to gain quick access to your tablet. The case comes in black ballistic nylon, blue, green, grey, and red color options.
Pre-orders are now open for the case at Waterfield for $89.

Waterfield iPad Pro SleeveCase
A more heavy-duty option from Waterfield, the SleeveCase offers most of the convenience of a sleeve but with a little extra protection and a few more features. With an outer shell of either ballistic nylon or tan waxed canvas, the SleeveCase features an easy-to-open flap that lets you quickly store or remove your iPad Pro. It also features a couple of different thin pockets that allow you to store your Apple Pencil, and there's room in the SleeveCase for not only your iPad Pro, but the Smart Keyboard, as well.
While it won't start shipping until June 23, you can order the SleeveCase now starting at $69. For $5 more, you can add D-rings for a strap, while for $22 more, you can get a suspension strap included.

With the release of “The Lost City of Z” and “Good Time,” 2017 may well be remembered as the year Robert Pattinson officially became a critics' darling.
Some might claim the shift began in 2012, when the British actor, still best known for setting hearts aflutter in the “Twilight” movies, drew raves for his change-of-pace performance in David Cronenberg's art-house chiller “Cosmopolis.” Since then Pattinson has reteamed with Cronenberg on “Maps to the Stars,” done further career-redefining work in David Michôd's dystopian thriller “The Rover,” and earned plaudits for his appearances in films including Werner Herzog's “Queen of the Desert” and Anton Corbijn's “Life.”
But his versatility has never been on such dazzling display as it has this year, first with his shrewdly underplayed supporting role as the real-life Amazon explorer Henry Costin in James Gray's “The Lost City of Z.” He followed that with his arrestingly deglamorized star turn as an amateur bank robber in Josh and Benny Safdie's thriller “Good Time,” which opened in theaters Friday.

The steady accumulation of prestigious world-cinema names on Pattinson's résumé represents the fulfillment of a dream that took root during his teenage years. Well before “Twilight” sent him into the celebrity stratosphere, Pattinson says, he was an obsessive film buff with a particular passion for French art cinema. Even critics who have been slow to appreciate the actor's talent (guilty as charged) would likely approve of his taste, which has steered him toward favorites as different as Jean-Luc Godard, Leos Carax, Claire Denis and Herzog.
This month, Pattinson is headed to Poland to begin shooting the sci-fi adventure film “High Life,” the first English-language project directed by Denis, whose films he began watching avidly as a teenager. Pattinson's other forthcoming projects include “Damsel,” a period western costarring Mia Wasikowska and directed by David and Nathan Zellner (“Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter”), and “The Souvenir,” a two-part romantic mystery from British director Joanna Hogg.
I basically approached my career, at least for the first 10 years of it, trying to re-create my DVD shelf from when I was 17. — Robert Pattinson
Have you always been an avid moviegoer?
I was into movies before I was even remotely into acting. I basically approached my career, at least for the first 10 years of it, trying to re-create my DVD shelf from when I was 17.
Tell me what was on that DVD shelf.
You could literally look at my IMDb page and see. James Gray was a massive one. Claire Denis. [Werner] Herzog. These are people I've just been crossing off the list. There was a lot of [Jean-Luc] Godard.
Are there certain titles that particularly inspired you?
Godard's “Prénom: Carmen” (First Name: Carmen) was a massive one for me in terms of tone and performance. I love genre shifts, and I just think for that to start off as a kind of farce and then to develop into one of the most moving relationship stories, unrequited love stories, that I've ever seen — that really stuck out.
Claire Denis' “White Material” was one of the big ones. I love “No Fear, No Die” as well. I love a lot of Claire Denis' stuff. And Leos Carax as well, especially “Les Amants du Pont-Neuf” (The Lovers on the Bridge).
There's something about these filmmakers. I can't think of a better word than “singular,” but they're just so unique. I mean, I like a lot of English-language movies from the '70s, which everybody likes, but among more recent films, for some reason, a lot of French movies — they're more operatic. They're not afraid to be emotionally operatic. I like that.
You must be excited to work with Claire Denis on “High Life.”
For sure. I start shooting on Sunday. I'm flying out there finally after three years. I'm very curious how it will turn out. The script is very ambitious, to say the least.
Who are some of your favorite older filmmakers?
I've recently been watching a lot of Ken Russell. I love his movies. I was watching “The Devils” the other day. There's some kind of through line connecting all these films, but I can never really figure out what it is. A lot of it is performance-based; all these directors get these incredible performances. Oliver Reed in “The Devils” is unreal. That could literally play now and it would still be subversive.
You've worked with some terrific filmmakers in recent years, including David Cronenberg, David Michôd and now the Safdie brothers.
I got kind of lucky. I had worked with some great directors before that, but they tended to go back and forth between personal films and more commercial films. With a lot of the later directors, their films are sort of all personal. But after Cronenberg and “Cosmopolis,” which just kind of appeared out of nowhere — with David Michôd, I remember seeing the teaser trailer for “Animal Kingdom” before it was out, and it was just a phenomenal teaser. I just went after him then and met him a long time, maybe a year and a half, before “The Rover” even came about.

I like the feeling of discovery and meeting someone who is really, really hungry and has a lot to prove. — Robert Pattinson
I like the feeling of discovery and meeting someone who is really, really hungry and has a lot to prove. It's exciting to see the Safdies' progression. Scott Rudin and Martin Scorsese are producing their next film [the thriller “Uncut Gems”].
You've attended the Cannes Film Festival often in recent years. Do you get a chance to see other films when you're there?
This year I saw Lynne Ramsay's “You Were Never Really Here.” It was great. She's another person who's been on my list forever. But in general, it's always a little funny going to see other films when you've got a movie premiering there. I'd love at some point to be on a jury. Everyone is always like, “It's such a hassle seeing three films a day,” but that's kind of all I do anyway.
Are there any films from the past year or so that you've especially liked?
I loved “Embrace of the Serpent,” the Ciro Guerra film. And I loved “Mon Roi” (My King), the Maïwenn movie. I thought that was great.
I love that you said that. I remember “My King” getting pilloried at Cannes.
Everybody hated “My King”?
I wouldn't say everybody. I mean, I can't speak for all my critical brethren, but …
Really? That's crazy! I absolutely love that movie. I thought it was so moving.
Is Maïwenn someone you'd want to work with in the future?
Yeah, for sure. That was one of the best movies of the year for me.

German electronics retail company Media Markt is interested in purchasing its Turkish market rival Teknosa, a report said Friday.
Media Markt already started talks on the acquisition with Sabancı Holding, which owns Teknosa, sources told Bloomberg International.
The report made no mention of a possible price.
A high-ranking Media Markt official, however, told Hürriyet daily that at the current stage there were no negotiations on buying between the companies.
Media Markt has 59 retail stores across Turkey, having first entered the Turkish market in 2007, while Teknosa boasts some 201 stores across the country.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): Minister of State for Information, Broadcasting
and National Heritage speaking at a ceremony held at the PTV headquarters in connection with the Independence Day said “we must all strive to fulfill the objectives of the Independence that Quaid-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah won for us on this day seventy years ago, to realize the dream of Allama Muhammad Iqbal”.
The minister said that the Quaid wanted Pakistan to emerge as a
peaceful and democratic country and it was incumbent upon us to implement his vision.
She said that Pakistan was achieved after unparalleled sacrifices and
it surely had a bright future, adding “All of us are Pakistan and we are proud of it”. She said that on this day each one of us shall have to make a
pledge to read the constitution.
The minister said that the country which was engulfed by darkness in
2013 now had a shining face and was fast moving towards economic stability.
Marriyum said that on this day we should remember that the former Prime
Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif worked dedicatedly for the youth and Pakistan.
She said that it was in pursuance of his vision that great successes
were achieved in the war against terrorism; power producing projects were initiated and under CPEC a number of big development projects were being implemented through direct foreign investment.
She said that it was all made possible due to his vision in the nineties
to build necessary infrastructure. The Minister observed that the former prime minister launched the Health Care Programme which was the biggest such initiative in Asia and also commenced educational reforms programme.
She said that the successes achieved against terrorist outfits during
the last four years had strengthened the contemplation about a safer and peaceful Pakistan for which our valiant armed forces, law enforcing
agencies and police from all provinces sacrificed their lives.
Marriyum also eulogized the role of media as well as the unsung heroes
in the fight against terrorism. The minister acknowledged that Pakistani women had also made a sterling contribution towards the development effort and in making Pakistan safe, along with their male counterparts.
The MOS emphatically remarked that during the last four years the
country had been put on the road to prosperity and progress under the stewardship of the PML-N government.
She said that the PML-N government was faithfully implementing the
pledges that it made in its election manifesto and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbassi was trying to accelerate that process which would take the country to its desired destination of an economic power house.
The Quebec government says it hopes to greatly reduce the use of paper in the province's judicial system in order to make it much more efficient.

The chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. publicly resigned from a White House manufacturing council on Monday, declaring he felt “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
The move by Kenneth Frazier, one of corporate America's leading African American executives, came after President Trump was criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists after violent clashes with counter-protestors turned deadly in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.
Trump quickly lashed out at Frazier on Twitter.
“Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” Trump wrote less than an hour after Merck posted Frazier's statement on Twitter.
Frazier was among more than two dozen corporate executives and union officials advising the Trump administration on boosting American manufacturing.
But after Trump's comments in the wake of the deadly Charlottesville protest, blaming the violence “on many sides” without specifically denouncing the white nationalists who were at the center of the clashes, Merck posted a statement on Twitter from Frazier announcing his resignation from the council.
“America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” Frazier said.
“As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” he said.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/897079051277537280
Many on Twitter noted that Trump responded more quickly and specifically to Frazier's resignation than he did to the violence in Charlottesville.
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that Trump “proves again he's capable of immediate and personal condemnation. Why not for white supremacists?”

On April 18, 1906, an earthquake and subsequent fires devastated San Francisco, California, leaving more than 3,000 people dead and destroying more than 28,000 buildings.
The earthquake occurred at 5:13 a.
m.
with its epicentre offshore of San Francisco, which then had a population of approximately 400,000 people.
The greatest devastation resulted from the fires that quickly followed the quake.
The initial tremors destroyed the city's water mains, leaving firefighters with no means of combating the growing blaze, which burned for several days and consumed much of the city.
Despite the utter devastation, San Francisco quickly recovered from the earthquake, and the destruction actually allowed planners to create a new and improved city.
Bharatiya Janata Party leader and member of Parliament (MP) from Kairana Hukum Singh passed away at the JP Hospital in Noida, ANI reported on Saturday. He was 79.
India TV reported that he had been undergoing treatment at the hospital for a month and that he had been facing breathing difficulties.
Last year, he had stirred up a major controversy by claiming that 346 families had to flee Kairana in Uttar Pradesh because of threats from a 'particular community' and also released a list of Hindus who had to leave the town. However, he later claimed that the exodus was not communal in nature.
After his death on Saturday, prominent political leaders expressed their condolences.
Anguished by the demise of MP and veteran leader from Uttar Pradesh, Shri Hukum Singh Ji. He served the people of UP with great diligence and worked for the welfare of farmers. My thoughts are with his family and supporters in this hour of grief. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 3, 2018
Deeply saddened at the demise of Shri Hukum Singh ji. My prayers are with the family in this hour of grief. May his soul rest in peace. — Jagat Prakash Nadda (@JPNadda) February 3, 2018
Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York City.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced the indictment Wednesday. He says it brings the former movie mogul "another step closer to accountability."
The indictment came hours after Weinstein's lawyers said he'd decided not to testify before the grand jury. They said there wasn't enough time to prepare because he learned the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself on Friday.
Weinstein's lawyers also said "political pressure" on the DA made an indictment unavoidable.
They declined to comment further on the indictment.
Weinstein faces rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York. The 66-year-old has consistently denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's centrist Ciudadanos party refuses to support a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy due this Friday, its leader said on Wednesday, making the votes of smaller parties key in the bid to end the premier's six-year rule.
Spanish political parties are taking advantage of Rajoy's weak minority party and a court ruling last week that sentenced dozens of people linked to his conservative People's Party (PP) to decades in prison in a long-running corruption trial.
The no-confidence motion, presented by the main opposition Socialists, needs backing from a fragmented parliament including nationalist parties from the Basque and Catalan regions each with their own agenda.
Ciudadanos would be open to proposing a second motion of no-confidence with an independent candidate and an eye to calling an early election, Albert Rivera said in an interview with COPE radio station. He said the Socialists had turned down this plan.
Rajoy said in parliament on Wednesday he intended to carry out his four-year term without calling an early election. But opposition parties are expected to continue to try to oust him even if Friday's no-confidence vote fails.
"Even if no successful motion is passed to oust Rajoy, the risk of early elections before the end of the year has increased significantly," said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
"If an early election is held before year-end, a centrist, market-friendly and pro-European government would be the most likely result," he added.
Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez has put himself forward as the alternative candidate for leader and offered to agree with other parties on a date for fresh elections.
So far, leftist party Podemos, which was founded in 2014 and fed off voter frustration with economic inequality and alleged corruption during a biting recession, has pledged its backing.
Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, whose party holds 67 seats in parliament, would support the motion of no-confidence, he said in an interview with La Sexta television on Wednesday.
Even so, the joint votes with the Socialists fall short of the minimum 176 votes required to unseat Rajoy.
"If it fails, as of Friday we will get to work on throwing out the PP," Iglesias added.
Rivera dismissed any partnership with Podemos and the regional parties, branding them "separatists and populists".
"A strong legitimate government arising from elections will give much more stability to Spain than a 'Frankenstein government' with a parliamentary minority," he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday.

One business source, who has discussed the issue with the administration, said that the China tariffs may be subject to a public comment period, which would delay their effective date and allow industry groups and companies to lodge objections.
This would be considerably different from the quick implementation of the steel and aluminium tariffs, which are set to go into effect on March 23, just 15 days after President Donald Trump signed the proclamations.
A delayed approach could allow time for negotiations with Beijing to try to resolve trade issues related to the administration's “Section 301” probe into China's intellectual property practices before tariffs take effect.
The White House declined to comment Monday. China has vowed to take retaliatory measures in response.
FILE PHOTO: The flags of the United States and China hang outside of the New York Stock Exchange March 30, 2011. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson
Reuters first reported on the $60 billion in tariffs last week.
A source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking told Reuters last week that the tariffs, authorized under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms and other products benefiting from U.S. intellectual property. But they could be much broader and hit consumer products such as clothing and footwear, with a list eventually running to 100 products, this person said.
China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number.
In January, Trump told Reuters he was considering a big “fine” as part of a probe into China's alleged theft of intellectual property. Trump said the Chinese government had forced U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there.
Expectations of the anti-China tariffs have alarmed dozens of U.S. business groups, who warned on Sunday they would raise prices for consumers, kill jobs and drive down financial markets.
The Makery, the company that teaches people craft skills, is launching an experiential agency division.
MakeryLive will put on craft events for brands wanting to create experiences for their audience. It is being led by Kate Smith, who founded The Makery in 2009.
The business already works with brands but has now decided to launch a specialist division to target more companies.
MakeryLive will be working with cider brand Rekorderlig at its Summer Sampling tour over this month and September.
Smith said: "We started to get approached by brands a couple of years ago to run experiential activations at their events, although we never actively marketed to businesses.
"It was my participation in the Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Small Business Programme that made me reassess our business model. Our B2B events allow us to be so creative, and they're the perfect way to leverage our experience and scale our business."
More: Earlier this month, Exterion Media launched an experiential arm. In April, communications agency Eulogy launched an events and experiential service.

An artisan on Waidi Ogunseye Street, Meiran, Lagos State, Kingsley Oriaku, has owned up to selling one of his five children, a one-and-a-half-year-old girl, Chimamada Oriaku.He also confessed to kidnapping his neighbour's seven-year-old son, Gabriel Yanga, barely two months after he moved to the area, adding that he used the N310,000 he realised from the sale of the two children for the burial of his father-in-law.It was learnt that the 37-year-old Abia State indigene sold his daughter in September 2017 for N190,000 to the operator of an orphanage home in Aba, Abia State, through a self-acclaimed evangelist, Adaeze Obi.Two days after selling the daughter, he returned to his Lagos residence and reportedly lured Yanga out of the compound, while her mother was not at home.He was alleged to have subsequently taken him to Obi in Abia State, who linked him up with one Loveth Nwako.Nwako was said to have led Kingsley and Yanga to her sister in Anambra State.The sister, Ngozi, collected the child and gave the artisan N120,000.It was learnt that the suspects were arrested in November by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Lagos State Command, Ikeja, where Yanga's parents reported the case.Kingsley was paraded at the command headquarters in Ikeja on Monday along with two of the accomplices, Nwako and Obi.He said that he sold the children to raise funds for the burial of his father-in-law in Abia State.He said, “I am a bricklayer. My father-in-law died and we wanted to do his burial. Peoplr that owed me refused to pay me. I was living in Abia State before with my family. In July, I moved down to Lagos. Early in September 2017, I contacted a nurse called Patience that I wanted Chimamada to be at the orphanage for proper care. She works at a hospital where my wife gave birth to Chimamada.“Patience directed me to the evangelist, who took Chimamada to the orphanage home. I collected N190,000 from the operator of the orphanage home. Two days after, I came back to Lagos and fled with Gabriel (Yanga). I took him to the evangelist on her request and got N120,000. I used the money for my father in-law's burial.”He said after much pressure from his wife on the whereabouts of their daughter, he opened up to her, adding that his wife reported him to the police in Abia State.“We later settled the case and our daughter was recovered from the orphanage. In November, policemen from Lagos came to pick me up in Abia State. Loveth (Nwako) and I led them to recover the boy as well,” he added.The 38-year-old evangelist, Obi, said she got only N10,000 transport fare from Esther, the orphanage owner, adding that Kingsley lied to her (Obi).She said, “Patience contacted me. She said Kingsley told her that he had separated from his wife and that no one was taking care of their children. She asked me to direct him to an orphanage where he could take one of the children to. I took Kingsley to the Queen Esther Motherless Baby Home. He told the woman that he was stranded and needed money to pay house rent.“The woman gave him N190,000 and gave me N10,000 for transport. I did not partake in the transaction. She is a member of my church, Jesus Solution Ministry. I was in Port Harcourt (Rivers State) for a ministry on November 18 when I was arrested.”Nwako, 49, said, “I attended Adaeze's ministry. I told her that my elder sister needed somebody to be helping her because of her health condition. When Kingsley brought the boy to her, she called me. Kingsley and I took the boy to my sister in Anambra State. He said he wanted the boy to be taken care of, but he needed N120,000 to pay house rent. I only helped my sister. Her daughter is observing her national youth service in Nasarawa State.”The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi, said the case came to the knowledge of the command on October 29, 2017, through Yanga's mother, Olabisi.The CP explained that Yanga was recovered at the Ajali village, Anambra State, adding that the suspects would soon be charged to court.He said, “She reported that her seven-year-old son was missing and all efforts to trace him proved abortive. Based on the report received, the command deployed a crack team of investigators drawn from SARS and arrested one Kingsley Oriaku. The team interrogated Kingsley, who confessed to sell the victim, Gabriel Yanga. He also confessed to have earlier sold his child to an orphanage for N190,000.”
To the editor: Remember the "Greatest Generation?" Back when America was at its very greatest, proudly anti-fascist Americans fought and killed Nazis. We did not tolerate them. (“Trump bears some responsibility for the racism on display in Charlottesville,” editorial, Aug. 12)
More than 400,000 American service members died in a war against fascist evil, and they rescued the world. That was the Greatest Generation. That was when America was at its greatest.
Back then, our president did not blame “many sides” for the violence and hate in the world. No, the Greatest Generation had sense enough to put the blame on the shoulders of Tojo, Mussolini and Hitler, all of them fascist nationalists.
Now, our president, Donald Trump, protects violent fascists by dispersing the blame to “many sides.” He has emboldened fascism around the world. And the once truly great Republican Party has become the voice of fascist thugs.
Make America great again. Fight fascism. Fight Donald Trump.

To the editor: While it would have been wildly appropriate for the president to have spoken the necessary words denouncing white supremacy in general and the domestic terrorism they invoked in particular in Charlottesville, I'm not surprised Trump steered clear (again) of risking offending (part of) his base by not explicitly condemning racist white nationalism in his initial statement.
A president has power to do so much good, and yet this embarrassing excuse for a leader continues on his stupid, stupid path. I continue traveling on what apparently is my own stupid path where I still hope the president will start doing and saying the right things.
It is no mystery to me why Trump won't condemn white supremacy. In his heart, he agrees with them. — K.F. Lisovsky, Venice
I'm profoundly sad about Charlottesville. I'm increasingly alarmed by the man in the White House. But I'm an optimist by nature which explains why, in spite of it seeming stupidly futile, I still have hope — although that well is, as they say, running dry. And stupidity won't replenish it.

To the editor: Wow, the president really knocked it out of the park with his statement about Charlottesville, in which he asked all Americans to come together. Surely he will go down in history as the Great Uniter.
Hispanics are very receptive to the message from the man who calls many of them “bad hombres.” African Americans respect Trump for saying that their communities have no education or jobs but plenty of shootings. Journalists are rushing to help promote the "love and affection" message from a president who calls them disgraceful and dishonest. Muslims who've had members of their families banned from this country get his message of acceptance. Republican Senators like Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas will tell their constituencies to listen to the man who calls them "Little Marco" and "Lyin' Ted."
When you've been a humble person who cares for others all your life as Trump has, a message on love and inclusion really resonates.

To the editor: The violence and racism on display in Charlottesville is a wound on our nation, and Trump's response did serious damage to America's standing in the world. When will the Republican Party have the moral courage to stand up and say, “This is enough — this president's words and actions are unacceptable, if we will now put our country before our party”?
I'm not holding my breath.
Trump's incompetence had already been on full display prior to Charlottesville. Instead of a more restrained response to North Korea, where he is creating a crisis, the president chose to be confrontational; and yet in his response to the unacceptable events in Virginia, he chose to be subtle.
Instead of specifically denouncing the racist protesters, he offered a subtle rebuke and gave moral equivalency to both protesters and anti-protesters. Sadly, this uninformed 71-year-old president is not about to change.

To the editor: On Nov. 19, 1863, as a war was raging in this country to determine whether black people would continue to be slaves, Abraham Lincoln stood up at the Gettysburg National Cemetery and declared that "these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom."
Some 154 years after that magnificent paean to liberty, another president stood up at his private golf club and said that he condemns violence and hatred “on many sides."
He said this throwaway phrase after the violence by neo-Nazis and white nationalists had resulted in one death and many more peaceful protesters hurt, but also after these people had echoed the Nazi slogan of "blood and soil" and had made many anti-Semitic statements.
To which vision of America will we adhere? That of our 16th president, who exhorted his fellow citizens to be the best they could be, or that of that man who drew a false equivalence between the neo-Nazis and white supremacists of this country and the peaceful protesters who opposed them?
Donald L. Singer, Redlands
..
To the editor: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides," Trump said. I agree.
There are many sides: The far right side, the alt-right side, the anti-Jewish side, the extreme right side, the white nationalist side, the Confederate side, the neo-Nazi side, the anti-immigrant side, the misogynist side, the anti-Muslim side, the birther side, the Steve Bannon side, the anti-LGBT side, the Breitbart side, the Ku Klux Klan side, the English-only side, the Hitler-lover side and all of the other racist sides.

..
To the editor: It is no mystery to me why Trump won't condemn white supremacy. In his heart, he agrees with them.
He doesn't want to alienate white supremacists, as they are the core of the core of his support. Look at the way he behaved at his own campaign rallies when fighting broke out: He approved of the violence.
So his “condemnation” of the violence in Charlottesville was tepid and perfunctory because he didn't really mean what he said; he just knew he had to say something.

To the editor: Having watched the Charlottesville coverage and Trump's subsequent response, I couldn't help but think of the wise words by Maya Angelou: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."
Regarding coverage of the Grammy Awards: Hip-hop artists deserve their due and their glory. But when The Times' writers insist that hip-hop is now "culturally dominant," it raises issues. First, when anyone insists that any art form is culturally dominant to the point of being the Future, it instantly isn't. Second, it seems to imply that other forms of music are no longer relevant, that if we care about justice and truth, we'll mainly listen to hip-hop (or rock or punk or country). This isn't helpful, because we have a nation of mono-cultures, i.e. people who listen, read or watch only one thing — whether it's Fox News or golden oldies or hip-hop. Genius in all other forms goes unnoticed or forgotten. Hip-hop is strong and deserves its day in the sun, but let the art form stand or fall on its own.

In 2013:Incumbent Mary Polak won this riding for the B.C. Liberals, defeating her NDP challenger (51 per cent to 27 per cent).
In 2009: Mary Polak won, defeating NDP candidate Kathleen Stephany by over 4,500 votes (57 per cent to 36 per cent).
History & Geography: Created in 1966, the riding has had the same general boundaries since the 1991 election, when Aldergrove-Fort Langley was split off. It spans the City of Langley, along with everything south of it between 196th and 232nd Street. Langley voted Social Credit for seven straight elections, and has voted for the Liberals the last five.

The Last Jedi has been hailed as the best Star Wars film ever, while critics and fans have praised Adam Driver's star-making performance as Kylo Ren.
The film, directed by Rian Johnson, has been screening for press and critics in both the UK and the US, where it will go on general release on Thursday and Friday respectively.
Early viewers have singled out Driver's return in a role he originated in 2015's The Force Awakens.
One early viewer wrote: "#TheLastJedi is ... amazing. Gamechanging. Johnson delivers the best movie ever (OT excluded). And Adam Driver? Oscar worthy. Also the biggest twist since I am your father..."
The Independent's culture editor, Christopher Hooton, wrote: "I'll keep it short. #TheLastJedi makes The Force Awakens look like child's play."
Lou Thomas, digital production editor at the BFI, said: "Lots to say about #thelastjedi.
"Adam Driver is now A-list if there was any doubt before. Rian Johnson does a great job as writer-director. Oh and it is easily the funniest and most spectacular of the #StarWars films."
Another early viewer wrote: "#TheLastJedi is mostly excellent with a few niggles. Adam Driver continues to be downright stunning as Kylo Ren."
Another said: "Star Wars: #TheLastJedi - simple storytelling beautifully done. A classic. No wonder LucasFilm gave @rianjohnson three more films. And as always, Adam Driver continues to be the MVP."
Joshua Yehl, editor of IGN Comics, praised the film, saying: "I am STUNNED by #StarWars #TheLastJedi. I gasped, I laughed, I screamed, I cried and I had the time of my life. Rian Johnson pulled it off, making what might be the best Star Wars movie ever. "
Other viewers said they would return to see the film again, with one writing: "Just got back from a press screening of #TheLastJedi It's not often that I'll go see a movie more than once in the theaters, This will definitely be one of those."
However, some noted that the long running time - more than two-and-a-half hours - was a downside.
One member of the audience wrote on Twitter: "Finally out from the @starwars screening! You'll get your cinema ticket money's worth ... IT IS LONG!
"Enjoyable, but as is so often the way nowadays, at least 30 mins too much. Don't know about the Jedi, but the art of 'a 2hr edit', is dead! Now for the loo queue! #thelastjedi"
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is released in UK cinemas on December 14.

Breaking news from the Hornets nest Friday as Alabama State announced Brian Jenkins is out as head football coach and Donald Hill-Eley will serve as the interim. ASU President Quinton Ross announced the move on Friday.
This season under Jenkins' leadership, the Hornets were 0-5, averaging 7.4 points per game. Alabama State scored 10 points or fewer in four of its five games, including Thursday night's 24-10 loss to Alcorn State on ESPNU. It's largest loss came at ASU Stadium in a 34-0 defeat at the hands of Prairie View A&M.
The Hornets are 0-2 in conference play, and have four straight home losses to start the season. Hill-Eley will step in from the Assistant Head Coach/Special Teams Coordinator role, looking to right the ship.
“I am extremely impressed with the wealth of experience Coach Eley has brought to our athletics program as Associate Head Coach,” Dr. Ross said. “His knowledge of Hornets football will be of great benefit as we continue to support our student athletes and the University's football program.”
Hill-Eley joined the coaching staff in 2015 after serving as the wide receivers coach and Associate Head Coach at Norfolk State for a season. He spent 13 seasons in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference as a coach at Morgan State, and was named MEAC Coach of the Year in his first season as a head coach. His 59 wins rank third-most in the school's all-time history.
Hill-Eley also has coaching experience in the professional circuit, spending four seasons in the Canadian Football League, split between the Baltimore Stallions (1994-1995) as a receivers coach and two seasons with the Toronto Argonauts as a guest coach in 1996-1997.
Under Jenkins' two-and-a-half years at the school, the Hornets had a record of 6-5 in 2015 and 4-7 in 2016 before this season's 0-5 start.
Hill-Eley will assume Interim Head Coaching duties immediately.

Outstanding in the Field, a roving restaurant-without-walls, brings guests straight to the source, presenting seasonal, site-specific meals in the farms, gardens and groves where the food was raised and harvested. Founded in 1999, it has since toured all 50 states and 15 countries, collaborating with hundreds of chefs and farmers. At each dinner, a communal table communes with nature, snaking through blades of soft grass or following the curve of a shoreline. Guests sit beside the people who grew their food. Founder Jim Denevan calls it “a picture of place.”
That Denevan offers an artistic metaphor is not surprising. Born in San Jose, Denevan worked in restaurants and on his brother's organic farm as a teenager, but by the time he was a executive chef at Gabriella Café in Santa Cruz in the mid-'90s, he'd also become an artist, creating drawings in the sand designed to be transformed — and ultimately erased — by waves, wind and weather. He practiced his land art at every low tide with the same kind of obsession, he says, that he brought to launching Outstanding in the Field.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified officials.Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Former FBI Director James Comey told Congress last week he believes he was fired by Trump to undermine the agency's Russia probe. The Washington Post, citing five people briefed on the requests who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, and Richard Ledgett, the former deputy director at the NSA, had agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's investigators as early as this week. The obstruction of justice investigation into Trump began days after Comey was fired on May 9, according to people familiar with the matter, the Washington Post said.
Trump's legal team quickly denounced the report on Wednesday."The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal," a spokesman for Trump's legal team, Mark Corallo, said.
A spokesman for Mueller's team declined to comment.Several legal experts told Reuters that Comey's testimony last week that Trump expected loyalty and told Comey he hoped he could drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against Trump.
Comey would not say in his testimony last week whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Mueller "to sort that out."After Comey's testimony, Trump said he had been vindicated because his former FBI director confirmed telling Trump on three occasions that he was not under investigation.While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.

ISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) Quaid Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday dismissed chances of corruption in the ongoing cases against him and his family.
“Allegations of corruption of billions were levelled against me but nothing has been proven so far,” he said, while talking to media after hearing in the NAB court.
He said that whatever they had was bought from personal money and not from the national exchequer. He said that if there is no corruption, this series of vindictive cases need to stop.
Maryam Nawaz also said that there is no point in prolonging the cases any further after the testimony received. She said that the allegation of London flats being in her name was completely baseless.—INP

Indian Wells City Council is discussing how much public money it should invest in a 10-acre hotel/villa complex at a time when numerous luxury hotel projects are in the works from Palm Springs to La Quinta, raising fears that the Coachella Valley could be facing a glut of hotel rooms.
TMC Group, the developers of the $130 million Indian Wells Hospitality Project, are requesting $7.2 million from the city to help fund $9 million in improvements to the public infrastructure surrounding a proposed 139-room boutique hotel, 31 villas and 56 residential condominiums at the corner of Highway 111 and Miles Avenue.
But the least one Indian Wells official is urging caution.
"While everyone is fighting to add hotel units, the demand growth has been pretty steadily fixed for the past decade," said David Gassaway, Indian Wells community development director. "The demand has been growing at 3.5 percent each year for tourism, but we are building hotel rooms faster than that growth rate.”
He added: “The big question is how much public money goes into it, how quickly the city gets the money back and what kind of impact it has on existing hotels."
Members of TMC team did not divulge how low of an offer they would accept from the city, but they said without public funds the project would most likely be unfeasible.
“We are confident that we will get to an outcome that works for the residents, council, staff and ultimately for our development team,” said TMC managing partner Philip Bates.

The $9 million public infrastructure improvements would include:
$4.9 million for the channel lining improvements.
$425,000 to build a pedestrian pathway connecting the hotel property to the Indian Wells Golf Resort.
$250,000 for a three-way stop traffic signal just west of Miles Avenue and Highway 111.
$700,000 for Highway 111 improvements.
$2.7 million in other soft costs, including engineering and permitting costs.
City consultants recommended that if council members agree to invest the funds, they do so after the hotel is open to the public. Bates said they would prefer to be reimbursed once the occupancy permit is issued, as there would be a lag between receiving the permit and opening to the public as they train staff and make last-minute adjustments.
Indian Wells City Manager Wade McKinney noted that while the city would own the improvements made to the infrastructure, the improvements are not a priority for the city.

At the start of discussions during Thursday's meeting, council members were wary of investing taxpayer dollars into something that could pose a risk. They wanted to know what would happen if the development fell through – would their money be reimbursed if the project did not pan out?
By the end of the meeting some worries subsided as there was a general, informal consensus that public money would be protected if it was put in escrow during the project and then allocated once an occupancy permit was given.
Councilman Ty Peabody said he supported the idea of creating an escrow account, while Councilman Richard Balocco said he wanted more discussion about the exact amount the city is able to contribute.
The Indian Wells hotel project is also the first in the valley to be addressed since the change in the prevailing wage law, which makes city participation in developments more difficult, Gassaway said.
“Typically, the way cities have invested has been through TOT (transient occupancy tax) sharing agreements,” Gassaway said. “That allowed developers to get a TOT rebate to help stabilize their operational costs. With the change, now if you do a TOT rebate, it requires the project to be built at a prevailing wage, which is up to a 20 percent cost increase for the developer, making the project infeasible.”

Gassaway said the city staff decided to explore the possibility of putting up cash for the infrastructure costs because the TOT rebate structure doesn't seem to work anymore.
TMC Group, a development company based in Irvine, hopes to begin construction of the hotel and villas in summer 2018 with a completion date in 2019. The condominiums are also slated to be completed in 2019.
The design includes a five-story hotel with a rooftop pool, bar and restaurant. Some of the stand-alone villas will also have their own private pools.
The property is currently zoned for hotel and condominium use, with the caveat that the short-term condominiums be operated as a hotel. Gassaway said the zoning requirements currently require the condominiums to be furnished, guests aren't allowed to stay year-round, a reception desk for guests is mandated as is a bell hop.
The developer is asking for city council to OK a special approval that would allow the condominiums to be sold as residential units that are able to be rented out by the individual owner as short-term rentals.
READ MORE: Indian Wells removes pending ban against short-term rentals
“My indication, based on council conversation, is that the council would be open to that change so long as certain recommendations were met,” said Gassaway.
Gassaway said the city would want the hotel to be open and operational, allowing condo owners to have access to all hotel amenities. In addition, if the city allows the individual condo owners to offer their homes as short-term rentals, the city would like all the rentals to be managed through a central management agency.
Gassaway said it would be very challenging to track each individual unit for transient occupancy tax thus is would be easier to just audit one central management agency.
The unknown is how much TOT the city would capture from the condominiums. The developer is estimating that owners will rent out their homes 50 percent of the year while the city estimates it will be closer to 25 percent of the year. However, there is the possibility that if none of the residents rent out their condos, the city would not capture any TOT from that part of the development.
The developer estimates that the city will see $32 million in revenue over a 10-year period including TOT, property tax, sales tax and revenue from the Indian Wells Golf Resort. The city conversely estimates the 10-year revenue capture will be closer to $22.6 million.
The developer and the city differ in their estimates in part because TMC Group is assuming its units will be occupied more frequently than the city estimates. When considering the possibility that the new hotel will take away revenue from existing rentals, the city's revenue gain from the project becomes even less.
But Gassaway said he is still going to recommend to council that they should approve the zoning entitlement because the city would still capture the bulk of the TOT from the hotel development, as opposed to the condos.

Could your EuroMillions lottery numbers have made you a winner of the biggest jackpot ever offered to UK lottery players tonight (Friday, October 6)?
The latest draw is set to be made, with ticket-holders across Europe crossing their fingers and hoping they might become instant millionaires.
After several rollovers, the jackpot has reached its maximum amount, so tonight's top prize is a staggering estimated £168 million.
A single winner from tonight's draw would become a UK and European record-holder, beating the £161 million won by Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs, in 2011.
And if the jackpot is not won tonight, the money will instead be shared between winners in the next prize tier down, meaning there could be several multi-millionaires from the draw.
Andy Carter, the National Lottery's senior winners' advisor, said: "The extraordinary sum would be life-changing whether won by an individual or syndicate and we have plenty of Champagne on ice ready to celebrate.
"It would enable them to transform their life, as well as the lives of their friends and family, and we are poised to support them from the moment they claim.
"This EuroMillions series has seen players raise an extraordinary £55 million for National Lottery good causes in just a month.
"This supports projects big and small across the country, including funding everything from local community projects to the nation's amazing Olympic and Paralympic athletes."
To guarantee a share of the £168 million jackpot, players must match all five of the main numbers drawn, plus the two Lucky Stars.
And even those whose numbers do not come up should hold onto their tickets as there are extra chances to become a millionaire.
That is because two UK ticket-holders are guaranteed to win £1 million in the UK Millionaire Maker part of the game.
EuroMillions is played in nine different European countries - Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Draws are made on Tuesday and Friday evenings, with players asked to choose five main numbers between one and 50 and two Lucky Stars between one and 12, with tickets costing £2.50.
Tonight's winning numbers will appear here soon.
Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty ImagesCondolences to Gloria Estefan: her mother, Gloria Fajardo, has died. She was 88.
On Facebook Tuesday evening, Gloria wrote, “Tonight at 8:19 pm we lost my dearest mother.” She added that when her “incomparable” mom passed, she was “filled with peace and surrounded by her daughters, grandchildren, sons-in-law, niece, the three girls who cared for her with so much affection, family and her closest friends.”
Gloria says she believes that her mom passed at 8:19 p.m. because her grandmother Consuelo died 32 years ago on August 19 — 8/19.
“[She] wanted to make us clear that she was going very well accompanied by my grandmother and our dear father, José Manuel,” Gloria wrote. “I will miss her every moment of every day and thank her for having been an amazing mother, woman and model to follow for so many people.”
Gloria then thanked her fans for the love, prayers and messages they sent during her mom's decline.
“I want you to know that I let you know in every moment, of all the love and light you were sending and she appreciated and absorbed every one of those beautiful feelings,” she wrote. “Thank you for being in your hearts and tenderly holding hands.”
Last week, Gloria wrote that she'd canceled her July 15 concert to care for her mom. It's not known if the concert will be rescheduled.

Coach co-founder Miles Cahn died Friday at the age of 95. The New York City native founded Coach in 1961 with wife Lillian, who died in 2013 at the age of 89.
The husband-and-wife duo famously developed hides inspired by baseball glove materials — using the leather in bags and small accessories to forge an all-American aesthetic.
Coach began as a family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft in 1941. The company started with six leather-workers who made men's leather goods. Five years later, the Cahns joined the contractor, then known as Gail Leather Products. The Cahns were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business and were knowledgeable about the business. In 1961, the Cahns bought out the factory's owners in a leveraged buyout.
At Lillian's suggestion, the Cahns started making women's handbags with leather used to make baseball gloves. Through excessive wear and abrasion, the leather in the glove became soft and supple. Under the brand name Coach, the sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit and earned a reputation for being nearly indestructible. In 1961, the Cahns hired sportswear pioneer Bonnie Cashin to design Coach handbags. She revolutionized the product's design, making handbags with side pockets, coin purses and brighter colors.
In July 1985, the Cahns struck a deal to sell Coach Leatherware to Sara Lee Corp. for a reported $30 million. The brand became part of Sara Lee's Hanes Group.
The firm's offerings ultimately expanded exponentially under the watch of former president and executive creative director Reed Krakoff and current creative director Stuart Vevers. A representative for Coach did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Cahn is survived by daughters Julie and Susi, son David and five grandchildren.

It's official: Miles Teller has just the right need for speed.
The 31-year-old "Whiplash" star has been cast opposite Tom Cruise in the highly anticipated sequel "Top Gun: Maverick" (in theaters July 12, 2019). Paramount confirmed the news originally reported by trade magazine "Variety."
Teller beat out fellow actors such as Nicholas Hoult and Glen Powell to play the grown son of Nick "Goose" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), co-pilot and best friend of hotshot flyboy Pete "Maverick" Mitchell (Cruise). Goose died in the original 1986 "Top Gun."
The newest "Top Gun" star shared the news on Twitter, saying "I feel the need..."
I feel the need... https://t.co/oOcIQW0zGS — Miles Teller (@Miles_Teller) July 3, 2018
Powell took his washout in stride, joking that he was "taking down all the Tom Cruise posters in my bedroom. Maybe, I'll leave one. Two for symmetry. Okay, the posters are staying."

In the followup directed by Joseph Kosinski (who worked with Teller in last year's "Only the Brave"), Maverick acts as instructor to a new class of fighter pilots. The upcoming movie is also bringing back original star Val Kilmer as Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, Maverick's old rival.

New Delhi: Slamming the BJP for "opposing" cancellation of licence of Max Hospital in New Delhi, Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday asked what relationship does it have with the hospital.
"The way in which the BJP shamelessly stood behind Max Hospital yesterday, we want to ask this to the people of BJP: Without having any love for the baby's mother, what love did you have for Max Hospital? Why do you love the hospital? What is your relationship with the hospital? What is the deal behind it?" AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said at a media meet in New Delhi.
Rai added that they were not against doctors or private hospitals, but only against hospitals which were looting people.
The Delhi government had on Friday cancelled the hospital's licence for erroneously declaring a newborn dead. But on Sunday, Bharatiya Janata Party's Delhi President Manoj Tiwari had questioned the decision.
On Sunday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also said that his government was not against private hospitals, but they can't remain silent on inhuman criminal negligence and slammed Tiwari for "supporting" Max Hospital.
The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) has threatened to go on strike from Thursday, if the decision to cancel the licence is not revoked by the government.
A baby boy was declared dead by Max Hospital on 30 November and handed over to the parents in a plastic bag, along with his still-born sister. However, the baby started moving while being taken for burial. He was then admitted in a clinic in Pitampura, but died on Wednesday.
Paris: The return of Serena Williams to Grand Slam tennis after pregnancy has dominated the early headlines at the French Open, but there are plenty of other players who have seen their careers changed by parenthood in recent months.
Williams' comeback has highlighted the fact that women who return after having a child are treated the same way as those sidelined by injury.
The 23-time Grand Slam champion has seen her ranking slip to 451 and is unseeded in Paris, a decision criticised by many, including Serena's long-time rival Maria Sharapova and even US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka.
Serena herself, though, has never publicly called for a change to the seeding rules, instead saying the biggest difference for her since becoming a mother is wanting to get away from court a bit quicker.
"The biggest difference is definitely that I'm semi on time (for her press conference) today, two minutes late, because I want to get home and see Olympia, because I have been here all day," she said after her first-round win over Kristyna Pliskova on Tuesday, her first Grand Slam match since the 2017 Australian Open final when she beat sister Venus while two months pregnant.
Serena's fellow former World No 1 Victoria Azarenka was forced to miss the majority of last season after becoming embroiled in a custody battle over her son.
With a current ranking of 84, Azarenka was beaten in the first round at Roland Garros by Katerina Siniakova.
Luxembourg's Mandy Minella incredibly played while four and a half months pregnant at Wimbledon last year, having found out she was expecting a child just before going out on court.
"It was a real shock. My whole body was sweating and I was shaking but we were happy straight away," Minella, who also lost in French Open first round, said last July.
Ferrer points out the negatives
With the demands of touring the world while playing a very physical sport, parenthood can also have a big effect on the top male players.
David Ferrer, who blew a two-set lead against fellow Spaniard Jaume Munar to lose in the Roland Garros for the first time in his career, pointed out that being a father isn't all fun and games.
After all, even 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer suffered a knee injury while running a bath for his twins in 2016.
"Being a father is very nice, but it also has drawbacks," said the 36-year-old Ferrer. "It makes me laugh that many parents only talk about the beautiful, but it's also hard and there are sacrifices."
Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas, whose second child was born before the French Open, doesn't necessarily agree with Ferrer.
"I see it as an enjoyment, although sometimes it's tiring, but sometimes there are tiring things that give you energy," said the World No 75, who will face sixth seed Kevin Anderson in the second round on Thursday.
Azarenka was keen to highlight the physical changes that make a successful return to tennis more difficult for mothers than fathers, while Williams feels that an added emotional attachment brings its own difficulties.
"Men don't go through the whole physical experience of becoming a parent," Azarenka said.
Serena, who suffered life-threatening blood clots after giving birth, added: "Emotionally I think it's different, because, you know, I'm so emotionally attached to my daughter. Dads are, too, but I actually breastfed for a really, really, really long time, and so I just had this real connection with my daughter."
The 36-year-old Williams has been very open about becoming a parent, with HBO filming a four-part documentary 'Being Serena', while her daughter Olympia already has a growing social media following.
But some players, like Latvia's Ernests Gulbis, would prefer to just talk about tennis.
"That's a private thing," said the former French Open semi-finalist when asked about his newborn baby.

Aduana stars having only played five matches so far in the GPL are 14th on the league log with just seven points. This puts more pressure on the Fire boys as they look to try to defend the league.
Speaking to Class FM, Yusif Abubakar disclosed that even though he is worried, his team has no choice and have to play the matches as they come. Therefore, they are going to prepare as well as they can and make sure they plan accordingly to be ready for the games.
“It is through no fault of ours that the league has become this compact as we are playing, but we have no choice”, grieved the gaffer.
Aduana stars will now play Berekum Chelsea in their next match at Dormaa.

Florida's Caeleb Dressel was a man on a mission when he dove in as the Gators' 200 medley relay anchor at the 2017 SEC Championships. The Gators sat in 7th place when he entered the pool, but Dressel couldn't be stopped. He tore through the water to bring the Gators back into the race, clocking a 17.90 split to become just the 2nd man to ever split under 18 seconds. When he touched the wall, the Gators had won it in 1:23.44.
What's even more incredible to think about is that Dressel ran down a group man who swam 18-mid splits, making a considerably fast time look almost pedestrian. Alabama freshman Zane Waddell (18.59) and Texas A&M senior Cory Bolleter (18.62) also put up very fast splits to help their teams land a spot on the podium.
The only other man to have ever split under 18 seconds is USC's Vlad Morozov, who swam the 3rd leg of their 200 free relay in 17.86, back at the 2013 NCAA Championships.
Back at the beginning of September, Elon Musk tweeted that the company would unveil its long rumored all-electric semi truck on October 26th. He noted that it was “tentatively” scheduled, leaving the door open for a date change if need be. Turns out that was a good call.
In a tweet this afternoon, Elon says the Semi unveil date is now set for November 16th — a shift of about three weeks.
The reasoning for the rescheduling? Musk mentions two things they're focusing on right now instead: Model 3 bottlenecks and Puerto Rico battery production.
Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017
Yesterday morning Musk offered Tesla's assistance in rebuilding Puerto Rico's electric system after the devastation of Hurricane Maria left just 10 percent of the island with power; by the afternoon, the governor of Puerto Rico was tweeting back to say he wanted to talk about it.
As for the Model 3 bottlenecks mentioned: Tesla aimed to ship around 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2017, but disclosed on Monday that they'd ended up shipping around 260. While the company pinned the shortfall on production bottlenecks, they noted that they already “understand” the underlying issues and are “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term” — so, presumably, tackling those issues will be a key part of these next few weeks.
KARACHI - Barrister Farogh Naseem on Monday served a legal notice on Sindh chief minister and others on behalf of Karachi mayor and MQM's legislators for not implementing Supreme Court's (SC) judgment on devolving the Solid Waste Management Board (SWMB) to local bodies.
A statement issued by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has stated that Principal Advocate Dr Farogh Naseem on behalf of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (Pakistan), Dr Farooq Sattar, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar, MPA Syed Sardar Ahmed, Khawaja Izharul Hassan, MPA Rauf Siddiqui, Faisal Sabzwari and Khawaja Sohail Mansoor has sent a legal notice to the Sindh chief minister, Sindh chief secretary, minister for local government Sindh, secretary local government Sindh, secretary finance Sindh and secretary Sindh Assembly for not implementing the SC's judgment of March 16 on the SWMB, in which it had decreed that “the non-functional Board which has never performed should be dissolved by transferring its functions to the local bodies as provided under the Rules of Business.”
Failing which legal remedies would be sought including the filing of contempt application before the SC and also filing of petition before the Sindh High Court (SHC), or both.
The legal notice said a full bench of the SC in Shahab Usto versus Government of Sindh constitution petition no.38/16 on 16.3.2017, while adversely commenting on the performance of the SWMB has, in the said judgment, been pleased to observe as follows, “The non-functional Board which has never performed should be dissolved by transferring its functions to the local bodies as provided under the Rules of Business.”
It is further stated in the notice that the above observations are binding on you under article 189 of the constitution, but till date no steps have been taken to dissolve the Board and transfer the functions provided in the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board Act, 2014 to the elected representatives of the local bodies, as directed by the SC.
Thus you, in particular the secretary Sindh Assembly, are under a direct duty to introduce and secure legislation in the Sindh Assembly repealing the 2014 Act. Alternatively the Sindh Government may advise the governor of Sindh to repeal the 2014 Act through an Ordinance. It is needless to stress that under Item no 3 of Part II to the 2nd Schedule of the Sindh Local Government Act 2013 the subject of solid waste management vests with the local governments.
Furthermore please note that 2013 Act has been legislated in pursuance of the constitutional mandate prescribed under article 140-A of the constitution and therefore, the functions prescribed therein could not have been eclipsed through the 2014 Act.
The minister and secretary finance Sindh are also under a direct duty to release funds to the local governments in this regard. The notice said that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan was passed on 16.3.2017, but till date nothing had been done at Sindh government's end so as to meaningfully implement the said judgment which is a sheer contempt of court.
It's not uncommon for young adults to experience some joint pain, but specialists worry that high-intensity regimens are causing more hip injuries. ( Dreamstime )
Physical therapist Karena Wu couldn't help notice a trend in patients visiting her New York City office this year. Many were under age 35, enjoyed strenuous workouts and were suffering immense hip pain. The millennials had pushed themselves in endurance races such as the Tough Mudder or weekly CrossFit and metabolic conditioning classes that placed wear and tear on their bodies, she said. And with little downtime between routines or adherence to proper form, they were putting the long-term health of their hips at risk. “A lot of millennials are doing all of these high-intensity exercises that are great for the mental and physical components of health, but if you're not as conditioned as you think, you're going to put excessive stress on the soft tissue and the joint,” said Wu, owner of ActiveCare Physical Therapy. It's not uncommon for active young adults to experience some joint pain, but orthopedic specialists worry that regimens that rely on heavy weightlifting or intense aerobic exercises are causing more hip injuries. There are no definitive studies that correlate the two, but research in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy says high-intensity activities appear to increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease.

What's more, specialists at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have reported a rise in cases of young adults with femoral acetabular impingement, a condition that occurs when the ball of the femur fails to fit securely into the hip socket. High levels of activity, they say, can cause the plate to fuse in an abnormal shape and result in a hip impingement. Shane Nho, an orthopedic surgeon at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, recalls a spike in hip, shoulder and knee injuries as CrossFit gyms sprung up several years ago. These days, he said, patients are coming in with hip ailments from high-intensity interval training, even some barre classes. “We probably see at least a couple patients a week with injuries related to those types of intensive classes,” Nho said. “The types of workouts these guys are doing … they're doing it at all costs, despite poor form, mechanics, fatigue or their actual baseline level of conditioning.”
The Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy, dissolves non-disclosure agreements with sexual harassment accusers
The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday (19 March) with a buyout offer in hand from a private equity firm, the latest twist in its efforts to survive the sexual misconduct scandal that brought down co-founder Harvey Weinstein, shook Hollywood and triggered a movement that spread out to convulse other industries.
The company also announced it was releasing any victims of or witnesses to Weinstein's alleged misconduct from non-disclosure agreements preventing them from speaking out. That step had long been sought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who filed a lawsuit against the company last month on behalf of its employees.
“Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those ‘agreements' end,” the company said in a statement. “No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet.”
In a statement, Schneiderman praised the decision as “a watershed moment for efforts to address the corrosive effects of sexual misconduct in the workplace.”
The movie and TV studio becomes the first high-profile company to be forced into bankruptcy in the nationwide outcry over workplace sexual misconduct. Dozens of prominent men in entertainment, media, finance, politics and other realms have seen their careers derailed, but no other company has seen its very survival as tightly intertwined with the fate of one man as the Weinstein Company.
Some 80 women, including prominent actresses, have accused Harvey Weinstein of misconduct ranging from rape to harassment. Weinstein, who was fired as his company's CEO in October, has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex.
The Weinstein Company said it has entered into a “stalking horse” agreement with an affiliate of Dallas-based Lantern Capital Partners, meaning the equity firm has agreed to buy the company, subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.
Lantern was among a group of investors that had been in talks for months to buy the company outside of bankruptcy. That deal was complicated when Schneiderman filed his lawsuit, citing concerns that the sale would benefit executives accused of enabling Weinstein's alleged misconduct and provide insufficient guarantees of compensation for his accusers. Talks to revive the sale finally fell apart two weeks ago when the group of buyers said they had discovered undisclosed liabilities.
The Weinstein Company said it chose Lantern as a potential buyer because the firm was committed to keeping on the studio's employees as a going concern.
“While we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the Board is pleased to have a plan for maximizing the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible and pursuing justice for any victims,” said Bob Weinstein, who co-founded the company with his brother Harvey in 2005 and remains chairman of the board of directors.
Lantern co-founders Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic said they were committed to “following through on our promise to reposition the business as a pre-eminent content provider, while cultivating a positive presence in the industry.”
Under bankruptcy protection, civil lawsuits filed by Weinstein's accusers will be halted and no new legal claims can be brought against the company. Secured creditors will get priority for payment over the women suing the company.
Schneiderman's lawsuit will not be halted by the bankruptcy filing because it was filed by a law enforcement agency. Schneiderman said his investigation would continue and that his office would engage with the Weinstein Company and Lantern to ensure “that victims are compensated, employees are protected moving forward, and perpetrators and enablers of abuse are not unjustly enriched.”
Other bidders also could emerge during the bankruptcy process, particularly those interested in the company's lucrative 277-film library, which includes award-winning films from big-name directors like Quentin Tarantino and horror releases from its Dimension label. Free of liabilities, the company's assets could increase in value in a bankruptcy.
In more fallout over the scandal, New York's governor directed the state attorney general to review a decision by the Manhattan district attorney's office not to prosecute a 2015 case involving an Italian model who said Weinstein groped her.
The bankruptcy process will bring the company's finances into public view, including the extent of its debt. The buyers who pulled out of the sale earlier this month said they discovered up to $64 million in undisclosed liabilities, including $27 million in residuals and profit participation. Those liabilities came on top of $225 million in debt, which the buyers had said they would be prepared to take on as part of a $500 million acquisition deal.
The Weinstein Company already had been struggling financially before the scandal erupted in October with a news story in The New York Times and The New Yorker. Harvey and Bob Weinstein started the company after leaving Miramax, the company they founded in 1979 and which became a powerhouse in '90s indie film with hits like Pulp Fiction. After finding success with Oscar winners The Artist and The King's Speech, the Weinstein Company's output and relevance diminished in recent years. The company let go 50 employees in 2016 and continuously shuffled release dates while short of cash.
Last year, the studio sold distribution rights for the movie Paddington 2 to Warner Bros. for more than $30 million.

Since the presidential election two years ago, TV programs from “Fox & Friends” to “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” have benefited from a “Trump bump.” Now some shows and outlets are notching viewership surges by featuring people who bump Trump.
Stormy Daniels boosted fortunes all around the set-top box, delivering big ratings for “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and “60 Minutes.” Next up has been James Comey, whose April 15 sit-down with George Stephanopoulos and ABC News resulted in a Sunday hour that generated 9.8 million viewers — not enough to win the night, but a number that nevertheless represents ABC's best rating for a news program since Caitlyn Jenner's interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.
“Trump is a reality-show president,” noted Ben Bogardus, an assistant professor in the journalism department at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. “Now you have these accusers, who are also very entertaining. They know how to talk to the camera. They know how to appeal to an audience.”
A broad range of TV anchors — and even a late-night host — have had their moment with former FBI director Comey. Fox News Channel host Bret Baier will get his turn April 26 on his “Special Report.” “I've watched every single interview. I've read every single thing,” says Baier. “I'm watching intently to find things he has not been asked.”

In the past, a coveted newsmaker would grant an exclusive interview to a single outlet, and the pundits would keep spinning. In a news cycle dominated by President Trump, however, a guest like Comey is generating what seems to be an inexhaustible amount of interest — and the viewership that goes along with it. Judy Woodruff and PBS will get a crack at Comey on April 30.
People can't get enough of what Baier calls “the Full Comey.” “He is the big story we are all following — coverage of the Trump administration and the fallout of his firing,” says Baier. “He has people who are critical of him on both sides of the aisle and people who are supportive of him,” making for broad appeal that doesn't seem to quit.
Comey's April 17 sit-down with Stephen Colbert gave the comedian's “Late Show” its third-highest audience numbers since Colbert took over the program in 2015. Jake Tapper won his hour April 19 among all cable news rivals when Comey visited his “The Lead” on CNN.
Still, there are limits. Rachel Maddow's MSNBC interview with Comey on the same day came in second to a Fox News broadcast of “Hannity” (whose host was recently at the center of his own news maelstrom).
Stormy Daniels has been somewhat less ubiquitous but has also proved to be ratings gold. The exotic dancer and adult-film actress says she had an affair with Trump in 2006, then allegedly signed a deal to keep quiet about it in exchange for money in the weeks before the 2016 election. Her late-January appearance on ABC's “Jimmy Kimmel Live” pushed Kimmel 40% higher than wee-hours rivals in the advertiser-favored 18-to-49 demographic.
Since that time, Daniels has decided to speak more freely — to even more noticeable effect. Her March conversation with Anderson Cooper on CBS' “60 Minutes” drew 22 million viewers — more than the audience for either CBS' more recent Grammys broadcast or NBC's last airing of the Golden Globes. It's the best performance for the newsmagazine since more than 25 million viewers tuned in for a Steve Kroft interview with Barack and Michelle Obama after the 2008 election.
Comey and others remain fresh sources of news despite multiple interviews, says Baier. Maddow's interview of Comey took place, for instance, just as some of his memos about his conversations with Trump had begun to leak. She didn't need to ask him the same questions everyone else did; she had fresh material and a live guest. “I think that's going to continue to happen in this news cycle,” Baier says. “There will still be a lot of bites at the apple.”
A political coalition including several high-profile Egyptians sharply criticized President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi on Friday for a speech in which he warned off anyone seeking to challenge his rule, amid growing calls for a boycott presidential elections.
Earlier this week Sissi said additional steps would be taken against anyone looking to upset Egypt's security and warned that the protests of seven years ago, which toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak in 2011, would never happen again.
In a rare public rebuke of Sissi's own remarks, the Civil Democratic Movement called the speech an attempt "to spread fear among Egyptian voters" which "undermines ... the integrity of the electoral competition."
Former military commander Sissi was elected in 2014, a year after leading the army to the ousting of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. He is expected to easily win a vote slated for March 26-28.
The Civil Democratic Movement includes several notable figures, including a former presidential contender as well as Hesham Genena, a former anti-corruption watchdog head who had been campaigning for former military chief of staff Sami Annan, Sissi's top opponent before he was arrested.
The statement follows growing calls to boycott the March vote after all major opposition campaigns withdrew citing intimidation. Annan himself was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of breaking the law by running for office without permission.
Sissi now faces a single opponent, who is himself a Sissi supporter, in the March contest.
"Clearing the political space of candidates in the name of preserving security is unconstitutional and does not promote security," the statement said.
Sissi said in the speech that he may call on Egyptians to take to the streets to give him a "mandate" in the face of what he described as "villains," without specifying who he meant.
"We affirm that states are not run by mandates and the mobilization of supporters in orchestrated gatherings, but rather by constitutions and respect for freedoms," the statement said.
"Is this a mandate in order to uphold freedoms? Or to crush opposition? Or to violate the constitution?" it said.
KARACHI:- -Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) will formally launch its 15th edition of “My Karachi: Oasis of Harmony” international exhibition 2017 on Wednesday.

Celebrated London detective Sherlock Holmes might be the master of deduction but he has serious flaws… his prices are prohibitive and he doesn't understand people.
Fortunately for those in the mean, overcrowded streets south of the murky River Thames, there is another private investigator, a man who not only charges less than the Baker Street genius, but can also see into people's souls.
While London's wealthy high society take their problems to Holmes, everyone else goes to William Arrowood, down-at-heel sleuth, occasional drunkard and self-taught psychologist.
Welcome to Glasgow-born Mick Finlay's stunningly dark and atmospheric crime debut, a murder thriller that imagines a corner of Sherlock Holmes' capital city in 1895, a place where the poor are hungry, crime bosses are taking control… and the streets are very different to the ones inhabited by Conan Doyle's famous investigator.
Finlay teaches in a psychology department but before becoming an academic he was a man of many parts, including running a market stall on Portobello Road, working as a tent-hand in a travelling circus, as a butcher's boy, a hotel porter, and in various jobs in the NHS and social services.
And it is perhaps this eclectic career that led him to the unwholesome backstreets of late 19th century London and the creation of the indomitable Arrowood, a shambling but ‘emotional agent' who is led by his senses rather than his clues, and despises the ‘deductive' Holmes, his wealthy clientele and his showy forensic approach to crime.
Arrowood's sidekick, Norman Barnett, a former clerk who sprung from one of the city's notorious courts, is certainly no Dr Watson; he knows what it is to have lived amidst filth, despair and human degradation.
Down-to-earth Barnett also knows that emotions are both Arrowood's strength and his weakness, and that is why they make an unlikely but effective team. Together they fight crime, and their patch is sleazy Southwark, a far cry from Sherlock's upmarket Marylebone in the City of Westminster.
It's 1895, the Afghan War is over and a deal with the restless Irish appears to have brought an end to sectarian violence. In London, the wealthy party while the underclasses are tempted into lives of crime, drugs and prostitution. Politicians are embroiled in financial and sexual scandals, and the police don't have the resources to deal with everything that goes on in the capital.
The rich turn to Holmes for help but in densely populated south London, which the great man rarely visits, the person to see is Arrowood, the private investigator who is adept at ‘reading people.'
And when French woman Constance Cousture walks into his rooms seeking help to find her missing brother Thierry, a worker at a local chophouse, Arrowood fears the worst. The owner of the Barrel of Beef is Stanley Cream, the vicious gang leader at the centre of a case which went badly wrong for Arrowood and Barnett a few years ago.
Even though Cream threatened to kill the detectives if he ever saw them again, Arrowood takes on the dangerous investigation but soon his principal lead, the missing man's girlfriend, is viciously stabbed to death outside a local churchyard.
With possible links to Irish rebels, the Fenians, and police corruption, this case is set to be the detectives' toughest quest yet…
It's no surprise that there are already plans for a TV adaptation of Arrowood with Kathy Burke signed up as Executive Producer. This is a story that packs a powerful punch… the intricate, cleverly crafted plot weaves between Arrowood's shabby rooms behind a pudding shop and some of Victorian London's most miserable streets, public houses and dwelling places.
And there are people here we can all recognise – some good, some bad and some, like Arrowood, who possess the larger-than-life vividness of a Dickens novel – but all are flawed and essentially real, their vices and vulnerabilities part of the fabric of this teeming, tumultuous city.
Using his vast research into 19th century life, crime, policing, early theories of psychology and the Fenian bombing campaign in London, Finlay has given us both an extraordinary new perspective on a literary giant, and an exciting alternative to the Victorian crime genre.
With murder, intrigue, dark humour, compelling characters and an extraordinary backdrop, it's to be hoped that Arrowood is just the opener for a thrilling and original new series.

Saudi Arabia: The White House Loves It. Most Americans? Not So Much
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Kitwood/AP Dan Kitwood/AP
With Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman embarking on a nearly three-week road show across the United States, he will have one major hurdle: Americans don't like his country very much.
Despite a 75-year economic and military alliance with Saudi Arabia and regular royal visits, 55 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the kingdom, according to a Gallup poll in February.
Even longtime U.S. adversaries like China and Cuba have scored more favorably.
Crown Prince Mohammed is expected to be welcomed as a reformer when President Trump greets him at the White House on Tuesday. The 32-year-old prince recently expanded women's rights. This summer the kingdom lifts its ban on women driving. Women are also allowed to enter the military for the first time and can attend sporting and cultural events.
He's reined in the religious police who enforced strict rules of public behavior. Public cinemas will be licenses for the first time in decades.
But he's also raised concerns with brazen power moves that include detaining more than 300 businessmen, former ministers and high-ranking royals in a five-star hotel in the capital Riyadh. The Gulf nation's leaders described the wave of arrests in November 2017 as an anti-corruption purge, but for many international investors, it seemed more like a shakedown, as wealthy Saudi businessmen were pressured to negotiate secret settlements and hand over billions to get released or face public trials and personal ruin.
Crown Prince Mohammed has a backer in the White House. President Trump tweeted his approval of the anti-corruption campaign within hours of the arrests in Riyadh.
"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing...." the president tweeted.
After the White House visit, the crown prince's schedule includes meetings in Silicon Valley, in Los Angeles with entertainment executives, oil industry leaders in Houston, captains of finance in New York and high-profile media interviews along the way.
The busy itinerary appears to be a charm offensive to reset American public opinion and woo U.S. investors. Saudi Arabia has a story to sell: a young, dynamic crown prince who claims to be dramatically reforming the kingdom. He will tell a skeptical American business community that Saudi Arabia is safe for investments and even open for tourism for the first time.
The Saudi and U.S. economies are significantly linked by "investment ties, energy markets, and a shared interest in the stability of the global economy," writes Karen Young, a resident scholar at Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. For one, Saudi Arabia is the biggest international buyer of U.S. weapons.
It will be an uphill battle, says Frank Wisner, a retired U.S. diplomat and businessman.
"It's not an easy country to like," Wisner says. "The American mind simply rebels at the way Saudi women are treated, the way they execute criminals, the enforced religious doctrine," he says.
There are other issues that follow the prince to the United States. Members of Congress are urging the U.S. to stop supporting the Saudi war in Yemen, which has triggered a humanitarian crisis in the country.
For all the claims of reform, the prince hasn't talked about free speech or elected leadership. Dissident clerics and critics of the latest reforms have been jailed.
But the issues that color American public opinion come closer to home.
"It goes back to the 1980s, they [the Saudis] were perceived using their oil wealth to rip off Americans," explains Gerald Feierstein, director of Gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute in Washington and a former ambassador to Yemen.
"I see from the coverage that Saudi Arabia is a country that many liberal Americans ... [and] many liberal Westerners love to hate." says Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University.
There have been serious low points in the relationship, like when Saudi Arabia imposed an oil embargo against the United states in the 1970s in retaliation for America's military support for Israel. More recently, last December, Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud condemned President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Worst of all for some Americans, the Sept. 11 attacks still cast a long shadow over Saudi Arabia because 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.
"There are still lots of people who look at the Saudis and think 9/11," says F. Gregory Gause, a professor of international affairs at Texas A&M. "Either they were behind it, for which there is no evidence, or they created the conditions."
For a long time there have been two things you could count on in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
The country has been favored by American Presidents.
But it's unpopular with the American people.
"The White House is always friends with Saudi Arabia. It's largely because the things that the Saudis do that are good for American foreign policy are seen in the White House and very few other places." Says Gause.
"The things that the Saudis do that are good for American foreign policy are seen in the White House and very few other places. The Saudis just do things quietly," says Gause.
The Trump administration is rolling out the red carpet and cranking up the pomp for Crown Prince Mohammed.
It's payback for the Saudi royal welcome Trump received on his first foreign outing as president last summer. But this Saudi royal charm offensive has to reach out to a wider audience.
Crown Prince Mohammed's trip to American financial centers is part of his effort to woo Western investors to avert an economic disaster at home. Since oil prices collapsed in 2014, the Saudis are burning through billions in foreign reserves just to make ends meet. The government provides a generous system of entitlements to Saudi citizens that can only be maintained at ever-higher oil prices. It's an unsustainable a hurry, says Haykel.
"He has a short amount of time to change the economy or the country is headed for disaster," he says, adding that the crown prince has driven a Tesla, an electric car predicted to one day undermine the oil economy.
There are many hurdles ahead as Crown Prince Mohammed tries to deliver on his revolutionary agenda to transform his country at warp speed. It's also too soon to tell if he's simply rebranding Saudi Arabia or leading a reboot of the conservative kingdom.
"He's a different leader from everything that has come in the last 50 years. He has a vision," says Haykel. "He's young and charismatic," but Haykel adds that there is a downside to the breathtaking changes.
"People have pinned huge hopes on his ability to actually change the economy and reform society. Those hopes are very dangerous."
"He is certainly going to change Saudi Arabia," says Norman Roule, a retired intelligence officer who served with the CIA in the Middle East. "The Saudis are superb allies and we have to support them in this journey," Roule says, explaining he believes there is no room for failure for a country that is a key to Middle East stability.
Backers of a close U.S.-Saudi relationship note that Riyadh has been a strong strategic partner for decades thanks to oil and regional politics. Saudi Arabia serves as counter-balance to Iran and the Saudis have helped the U.S. battle extremism. The U.S. needs Saudi assistance in a battle of ideas against al-Qaida and ISIS, says Gause: "Liberal democracies are not going to talk them out of what they are doing. The Saudis can rebut them with their own language."
"If the Saudis don't succeed, what does it mean for the region?" asks Roule. He believes Saudi Arabia is too big to fail. "To me the answer is clear. We have to do everything we can to support him."
Washington: US President Donald Trump is concerned about China's unfair trade practices and striving to stop Beijing from such practices and theft of American intellectual property, the White House said on Thursday.
The White House statement came a day after it renewed its threat to place 25 per cent tariffs on 50 billion US dollars in Chinese goods in retaliation of the latter's unfair trade practices.
At the same time, Donald Trump is having a "good relationship" with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and both are continuing to have conversations when it comes to North Korea.
"Donald Trump continues to have a good relationship with President Xi, but what he is concerned about is making sure he stops the unfair trade practices that China has engaged in for decades; stopping the intellectual property theft that China has been engaged in; and making sure that we no longer allow China to play on a different playing field than the rest of us," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at her daily news conference.
She expressed hope that the two leaders will continue to share a good relationship, but added that Trump would not stand for any unfair trade policy.
"He's not going to allow American workers to be taken advantage of. He's going to call that out, and step up and make those changes," she said in response to a question.
Congressman Drew Ferguson applauded the Trump administration for their decision to place restrictions on China's acquisition of sensitive American technology.
"We must not allow this country to overtake the United States and become a leading power," Ferguson said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce announced the affirmative preliminary determination in the countervailing duty (CVD) investigation of imports of certain plastic decorative ribbon from China, finding that exporters in China received countervailable subsidies ranging from 12.81 per cent to 94.67 per cent.
As such, the Commerce Department will instruct US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits from importers of certain plastic decorative ribbon from China based on these preliminary rates.
In 2017, imports of certain plastic decorative ribbon from China were valued at an estimated 22.5 million US dollars.

The gunman who attacked congressmen at a ball field in a Washington suburb was a “very irascible, angry little man” with a history of charges for assault and other minor offenses, according to his former lawyer.
Lyndon Evanko, a now-retired attorney from Belleville, Ill., said he remembered James T. Hodginkson, a former home inspector and contractor, for his temper and brusque attitude toward police and neighbors.
Hodgkinson, 66, was shot and killed on Wednesday after he opened fire on Republican congressmen, staffers and others at a morning baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.
“He was a pushy little bastard, an in-your-face kind of guy,” Evanko said. “He believed what he believed and he wasn't going to take any s--- from anybody.”
In 1993, Hodgkinson was charged with drunk driving and other traffic offenses by Illinois State Police near his home, a suburb of St. Louis. Court records show that judgment was withheld, and he spent a year under court supervision.
Hodgkinson was arrested in 2006 on a charge of battery by the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office, court records show.
Evanko said the incident started as an argument with Hodgkinson's foster daughter at his home. When a neighbor showed up to complain, Hodgkinson menaced him with a shotgun and apparently fired a shot, the lawyer said. Hodgkinson also cut a car seatbelt as he tried to pull the girl back into the house, he said.
The case was dismissed after witnesses did not show up at court hearings, the lawyer said.
“He was a bit of a misanthrope,” the lawyer said. “He came across as a very irascible, angry little man, but not somebody I would expect to do something like this.
“I would have clients I would suspect for doing something like this, but he's not the one I would have pegged for it,” said Evanko, a longtime defense attorney. “He never had a felony. It was all penny-ante stuff.”
Records show that Hodgkinson allowed his inspection and contracting licenses to lapse. Evanko said he represented Hodgkinson again in 2009 when he was ticketed for doing work without the proper permits.
“Even with that, he had a temper: ‘What are they charging me for? I know what I was doing. So what if I didn't have the paperwork?'” the lawyer said.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's visit to Vancouver raised a few eyebrows when he appeared to support to B.C. Premier John Horgan's effort to stop the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline system.
Inslee sidestepped a question from a Vancouver reporter last week about his own state's use of the pipeline to supply its refineries at Anacortes, Cherry Point and Ferndale, some of which is sold back to B.C. as refined fuels.
Kinder Morgan, current operator of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to its terminal in Burnaby, also operates a branch line running from Abbotsford to Washington that supplies the Shell and Tesoro refinery complex at Anacortes, the Phillips 66 refinery at Ferndale and BP's Cherry Point facility, the largest in Washington located just 11 km south of Blaine.

Inslee spoke of shipping noise affecting orcas and a growing demand for electric cars in his state, and avoided discussion Washington's own busy oil industry. He noted his state's rejection of an oil port at Vancouver Washington, to transport shale oil produced from North Dakota, and thermal coal export facilities proposed to deliver
“We share the most beautiful part of at least North America,” Inslee said at a joint news conference with Horgan Friday announcing a high-speed rail study. “And that vision that we have of perpetuating that beauty for our grandchildren is at risk by increasing the tanker traffic through the Haro Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca by going up about five to seven times.”
But most of the existing tanker traffic around the south end of Vancouver Island is coming from Alaska, and heading for those Washington refineries. The Seattle-based Sightline Institute estimates that while 10 per cent of Washington's crude oil comes from the Alberta oil sands via Trans Mountain, more than half comes from Alaska's Valdez tanker terminal. Washington refineries also receive crude oil tankers from the Middle East and Africa, and oil by rail from growing U.S. shale production is also increasing.

Inslee warned of a “dramatic” increase in tanker traffic from the Trans Mountain expansion. In fact it would represent a six per cent increase in total shipping traffic for the region, including freighters loaded with barely refined bunker fuel and U.S. fuel barges like the one that ran aground at Bella Bella in 2016.

CARACAS -Venezuela's defense minister on Monday declared the army's loyalty to President Nicolas Maduro, who ordered troops into the streets ahead of a major protest by opponents trying to oust him.
Venezuela is bracing for what Maduro's opponents vow will be the “mother of all protests” Wednesday, after two weeks of violent demos against moves by the leftist leader and his allies to tighten their grip on power.
The center-right opposition has called on the military - a pillar of Maduro's power - to turn on the president amid an economic and political crisis that has triggered severe food shortages, riots and looting.
But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said the army “confirms its unconditional loyalty to the president.”
He made the comment before thousands of pro-Maduro militia members at a rally outside the presidential palace, where the president thanked the army and the civilian militia for their support.
“Loyalty is repaid with loyalty,” the president said.
The rally came hours after Maduro ordered the military into the streets to defend the leftist “Bolivarian revolution” launched by his late mentor Hugo Chavez in 1999.
“From the first reveille (on Monday morning), from the first rooster crow, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces will be in the streets... saying, ‘Long live the Bolivarian revolution,'” he said Sunday night in a televised address.
He denounced his opponents as “traitors” and praised the military's “unity and revolutionary commitment.”
Despite his announcement, there was no sign of soldiers on patrol Monday morning in Caracas, though state TV showed images of army units marching in formation in the streets of the capital as the defense minister watched.
Venezuela has been rocked by unrest since March 30, when Maduro's camp moved to consolidate its control with a Supreme Court decision quashing the power of the opposition-majority legislature.
The court partly backtracked after an international outcry, but tension only rose further when authorities slapped a political ban on opposition leader Henrique Capriles.
Five people have been killed and hundreds wounded in the ensuing protests as riot police clashed with demonstrators.
Maduro's opponents have called for a massive protest Wednesday, a national holiday that marks the start of Venezuela's independence struggle in 1810.
The president's supporters have called a counter-demonstration the same day.
It is a touchy date in Venezuela, where Chavez and Maduro have built a politics of populist, left-wing nationalism around the fight for independence from colonial Spain and around the hero of the struggle, Simon Bolivar.
Maduro is fighting efforts to force him from power as Venezuela flounders through a crippling three-year recession and the world's highest inflation rate.
Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, but the fall in global crude prices since 2014 has laid bare its overwhelming dependence on its chief export.
Lacking the oil dollars it once used to import nearly everything else, the country has been hit by severe shortages of food, medicine and basic goods like deodorant and toilet paper.
Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds were known as entertainment icons to millions around the world, but they were known as “mom” and “grandma” to 24-year-old actress Billie Lourd.
Lourd broke her silence on the news on Monday, sharing an old photo of herself, Fisher, and Reynolds on Instagram. With it, she wrote, “Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist. There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my own and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me.”
❤👩‍👩‍👧❤ Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist. There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me. A photo posted by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Jan 2, 2017 at 10:09am PST
Fisher's death was confirmed last Tuesday morning by way of the family's spokesperson, saying: “It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning. She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly.”
Other than that statement, Lourd remained silent on social media and had not commented on the heartbreaking deaths of her mother, Fisher, and grandmother, Reynolds, up until now.
Fisher died Tuesday morning after suffering a what was described as a massive heart attack on Friday while in flight to Los Angeles from London, where she was filming the series “Catastrophe” on which she had a recurring role. She was rushed from LAX airport to the UCLA Medical Center Friday afternoon when the plane landed. Just one day later, Reynolds, 84, was rushed to Cedar-Sinai in L.A. for a reported stroke. She died just hours after she was transported to the hospital. Her son, Todd Fisher, told Variety, “She wanted to be with Carrie.”
Lourd — who is the daughter of Fisher and CAA veteran Bryan Lourd, who was with the “Star Wars” actress from 1991 to 1994 — stars on Fox's “Scream Queens.” In the series, her character wears fuzzy earmuffs, which she told Variety were a tribute to her mother's iconic Princess Leia buns.
In the past days since Fisher's death, Lourd's “Scream Queens” co-stars have shown their support with various social media messages, including those from Lea Michele, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ariana Grande, Taylor Lautner and John Stamos.
Lourd, her mother and grandmother were last seen together at a public event in 2015 at the SAG Awards where Reynolds was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award (pictured).

REUTERS - Madison Keys beat fellow American CoCo Vandeweghe for the second time in eight days with a 6-4 3-6 6-3 victory on Monday to reach the second round of the Cincinnati Open.
Keys beat Vandeweghe in straight sets in the Stanford Classic final and while pushed a little harder on Monday, the 16th seed still had enough to get by her big-serving compatriot in just under two hours.
"CoCo is always going to be a tough person to have to try to get returns in," Keys said during her on-court interview.
"She obviously raised her level in the second set, so then I had to as well in the third.
"From then it was just about who could get more balls in at the end."
Keys, who has never advanced beyond the second round in Cincinnati, will next face unseeded Russian Daria Kasatkina.
In earlier action, Australian Daria Gavrilova shook off an uncertain second set to defeat France's Kristina Mladenovic 6-0 7-6(6).
After cruising through a perfect first set, the 23-year-old Gavrilova needed to save a set point in the second to hand the 13th-seeded Mladenovic her third straight loss.
"She has a history of great comebacks. She has done it at the French Open almost every match," said Gavrilova.
"She stepped up her game and was playing a bit looser and was not making as many unforced errors because the first set was not a great set from her."
Gavrilova moves on to face Italian Camila Giorgi in the round of 32 on Tuesday.
Big-serving Czech Petra Kvitova battled back to defeat Anett Kontaveit 1-6 7-6(2) 6-3 in Monday's opening match.
Kvitova, the tournament's 14th seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, will face either wildcard American Sloane Stephens or Czech Lucie Safarova, who play on Tuesday.

Streets dotted with garbage dumps have become a common sight in the provincial capital of the Sindh. The mounting waste problem poses a threat to public health and environment yet heaps of garbage continue to be present alongside roads and under bridges in different locations in the Metropolis. In such a dire situation, the lack of ownership by city authorities has made the situa-tion worse for the citizens.
Speaking about the problem, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar remarked here Monday that clean-ing the city was the responsibility of the Sindh government. Akhtar remarks come in the backdrop of a Supreme Court's deadline to clean the city within a week issued here Saturday. “This is not my responsibility, they (Sindh government) have not left this option with the KMC,” Akhtar said while speaking to the media.The mayor said that worldwide the cleaning of a city is a function, which is with the municipality, however, this was not the case in Karachi. “I have given this statement in court as well. The chief jus-tice said do whatever can be done.”
On the other hand, Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah remarked that the city has facilities to pick up trash from different sites. He assured that the garbage would be picked up before Saturday. “The citizens must also play their part in this re-gard and restrain from littering on the roads, he added.”
Condo buyers in Canada's already pricey markets may be the next to pay up as the trade battle with the U.S. radiates through the construction industry. Canada imposed a 25 per cent tariff on U.S. steel imports on July 1, retaliating against levies President Donald Trump slapped on goods from its northern neighbour a month ago. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is also said to be preparing quotas and tariffs for other countries to prevent a flood of steel rushing in to undercut prices.

Steel fabricators and metal importers say the tariffs will jack up prices for everything from rebar used in highrise condos to structural steel for industrial builds in a market already facing shortages and soaring prices. Job losses and stalled projects are likely, they said. “If the government's not careful, they will protect one at the expense of 10 times that elsewhere,” said Walter Koppelaar, CEO and chair of Walters Inc., a Hamilton-based steel construction company that counts Brookfield among its customers. “If they apply duties to broad-spectrum steel or metal of any shape, size or description, our industry here would be decimated — it could be thousands of layoffs and it's going to shut down projects right across this country.”

The comments underscore the widening impact of Trump's move to upend the world trade order to get what he deems is fairer access to international markets and to protect domestic jobs. He's pledged tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China and imposed levies on imports of steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Each region has struck back with countermeasures or is planning tariffs of their own. The price of steel used for construction projects across the country has already soared by about 38 per cent in 2018 due to a booming property market and a lack of supply, according to the Canadian Coalition for Construction Steel, which represents 17 companies. “Additional safeguard surtaxes of even 10 per cent will put fabricators and purchasers into a loss position and they will not be in a position to supply the market,” according to a letter sent by the group's representative to the government. Further measures would be “catastrophic,” Koppelaar said. Canadian suppliers, including AltaSteel and ArcelorMittal Dofasco, typically produce only about 10 per cent of the structural steel and about half of the rebar supply in the industry, he said.
Even though global steel tariffs haven't been confirmed, Ferrostaal Steel Canada Inc., a rebar importer whose parent company is Hamburg-based Ferrostaal Trading GmbH, isn't signing new contracts for now because it doesn't know what its prices will be. “The margins are so slim on steel imports that you can't just absorb a 25 per cent tariff,” said Tim McMenamin, vice-president at Whitby-based Ferrostaal.

“We're not even offering steel into Canada because we are the importer of record, so if all a sudden there's a surtax of 10 to 25 per cent, that could create bankruptcy for trading companies such as ours.” Wider steel quotas or tariffs would hit British Columbia hard as the province has historically relied on imports for more than 60 per cent of its annual consumption, according to the coalition. “If they put this quota or tariff on imported materials, we will have no supply,” said Anoop Khosla, president of Midvalley Rebar Ltd. The rebar fabricator and installer, based in Surrey, B.C., sources more than half its supply from offshore countries such as Turkey, Vietnam and Indonesia. “We would have shortages of material come September, October.” The strain would hit a condo market that saw prices soar 8.3 per cent in Toronto in May from the year before and 20 per cent in Vancouver. Some projects have already been cancelled due to rising costs. To be sure, rebar supply typically only represents about 4 per cent of a project's cost, so a 25 per cent tariff would only result in about a 1 per cent increase in the cost of a building, according data to provided by Altus Group Ltd. Still, the increases are likely to be passed on, the company said. Developers aren't too concerned so far. “On the jobs that we've done, we have already tendered the deal, so those prices are locked in,” said Geoffrey Matthews, senior vice-president of highrise at Great Gulf Group. On upcoming developments like the Gehry project in downtown Toronto, the company would likely apply a high contingency against costs at the early stages to manage potential risks, he said. Koppelaar at Walters is forecasting a further jump in steel prices of as much as 30 per cent if the wider tariffs go through. “It's well beyond just that projects will be done at zero profit and well into the fact that we're going to bleed red ink and different companies will have different capacities for how long they can bleed before they die,” Koppelaar said.

Hiring a stranger to work in your home always carries with it an element of uncertainty. They may be the loveliest person you've ever met, and great with your kids – but you never know the full story. This is what happened to Mary Robertson, an American businesswoman who had moved to London in the 1980s. She hired a polite young teenager to work as a nanny for her young son, and thought little else about it. Not until she discovered a slip of paper under her couch, and realized who the new help really was…
In 1980 when Mary Robertson and her husband, Pat, moved from the U.S. to up-market Belgravia in London, it soon became clear that they would need an extra pair of hands to help look after their eight-month-old son, Patrick. They decided to employ a nanny on a part-time basis. A local bureau duly sent over an 18-year-old woman who was shy, but polite and hard-working. Robertson instantly liked her.

“She was lovely, with perfect English skin, a slight blush on her cheeks, and clear blue eyes,” Robertson would later recall of the young woman, in a book she published in 1998. “She looked just like the suburban teenagers I had known in America, only ever so much prettier.” Robertson and her husband welcomed the teenager into the family home.

Declaring the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) eligible for participating in the upcoming general elections, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Wednesday allotted it the electoral symbol of bat.
The ECP issued a notification which declared the PTI eligible for participation in the upcoming elections after it successfully conducted its intra-party polls.
Imran Khan was re-elected as chairman of the party with a resounding majority in the intra-party elections held earlier this week.
Earlier, the ECP had deprived the PTI of its electoral symbol after it failed to hold intra-party elections.
The PTI held intra-party elections from June 11-12 in which members across the country voted for the panel of their choice. There were two panels each having fourteen members and all party members had to choose either the Insaf or Ehtisab panel.
Khan who was chairing the Insaf panel earned 189,055 votes whereas the rival Ehtesab panel secured 41,647 votes. Around 26,255 votes were also reportedly rejected.
The other newly elected office bearers include Central Punjab president Aleem Khan, Sindh president Arif Rehman Alvi, Balochistan president Yar Muhammad Rind, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa South President Ali Amin Gandapur.
Michigan shipwreck hunters have found the remains of a schooner that sank in Lake Michigan in 1873 during a storm.
The Lizzie Throop was found in 280 feet (85 meters) of water along western Michigans coastline some 15 miles (25 kilometers) northwest of the city of South Haven, the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association announced this past week.
The vessel set sail from Muskegon, Michigan, on Oct. 16, 1873, on a lumber run to Chicago, but sank after it began leaking during a squall, Valerie van Heest, the shipwreck associations director, told MLive.com. Two of its six crewmen died when the two-masted, 86-foot-long (26-meter-long) schooner went down.
We realize now that the deck and the masts floated ashore with the survivors, while the hull went to the bottom, van Heest told WZZM-TV.

Side scan sonar images show the sunken vessel on the lake bottom and other footage obtained by divers reveal the devastation the ship suffered when its deck separated from its hull, she said.
The Lizzie Throop was built in 1849 from wood milled at one of the Grand Haven areas the earliest sawmills and was owned by prominent city resident Nathan Throop. It was named after Caroline Elizabeth Throop, who died in 1869.
The ruins are the 10th shipwreck the association has found during its ongoing search for a passenger plane that crashed into Lake Michigan nearly 68 years ago. Northwest Orient Flight 2501 crashed on June 23, 1950, killing all 58 aboard the DC-4 propliner.
The association partnered 14 years ago with author Clive Cussler and his National Underwater Marine Agency to search for the aircraft. That search will resume this spring with the help of oceanographer Gregory Busch, who will bring to the quest the latest sonar equipment and a unique search methodology, van Heest said.
We feel more confident than ever that the discovery of Flight 2501 could happen in 2018, she said.
Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives were investigating a fatal shooting in Carson on Friday.
The shooting was reported about 6 a.m. in the 23500 block of Panama Avenue.
The male victim was transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, the Sheriff's Department said.
The man's identity was not immediately released.

In an interview with 2 on Your Side, Former Trump campaign aide and Republican Political Strategist Michael Caputo said he is working to bring comedian Roseanne Barr back on the air.
Caputo, who lives in Western New York, is an executive with an online streaming startup company called Bond. The streaming site plans to launch on June 25th, and hopes to create a new economic model for the film and video industry through subscribers and crowd investing.
"I think people make mistakes when they're on Twitter when they're trying to crack jokes, none of it's funny, and it tends to happen to people who are trying to be funny," Caputo said. "I don't think she was funny at all. I found it to be a profoundly disgusting comment, but I think she made a mistake, just like others in our community have made mistakes and at some point in time, they have to be able to return to their normal life. They have to be able to make a living."
ABC canceled the "Roseanne" reboot following a racist tweet from Barr aimed at Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. In an interview first published in The Daily Beast, Caputo said he's reaching out to Barr in the hopes of capitalizing on her popularity and giving the show a new platform.
"I think that Roseanne can find her way through to apologize to the community, to apologize to the people she offended most, and move on with her life," Caputo told 2 on Your Side. "To think that she can't is almost totalitarian. I think that she deserves a second chance."

LAHORE - A delegation of Philippines Embassy in Islamabad visited Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) here on Monday.
The delegation comprised Philippine Ambassador Daniel Ramos Espiritu, Philippine Honorary Consul General Rizwan Fareed, Philippine Embassy Economic Officer Maria Dolores, Sales and Economic Assistant Sumaira Bibi.
Philippine Embassy, in coordination with the Philippine Honorary Consulate General in Lahore, held a briefing on Philippine trade and tourism opportunities at the LCCI. The briefing was also attended by around 20 officials of the LCCI led by its Senior Vice President Amjad Ali Jawa and his executive committee. During the briefing, the Philippine Embassy and the LCCI agreed on the need to organise and exchange trade and investment missions to further enhance the bilateral trade and investments between the two counties.
In his keynote speech, Ambassador Espiritu highlighted the Pakistan's and Philippines' close and cordial ties since the establishment of the bilateral relations between the two countries in 1949, which were evident in the high-level exchanges and agreements signed by both countries.
It's no secret that U.S. President Donald Trump isn't a fan of the mainstream news media, but he has never been shy to express his admiration for Fox News, particularly its daily morning show Fox & Friends, which is seen by many as granting particularly favourable coverage of the president.
Accordingly, this week's Saturday Night Live cold open depicts Fox & Friends hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade as fawning over Trump at every opportunity, and being keen to please him with praise and flattery.
However, the first guest to appear on the show is Trump's communications director Hope Hicks, who promptly expresses the Trump administration's admiration for the show.
“We love the show over here at the White House, it's playing at full volume at every meeting,” she says.
Hicks is then asked about her rise to the White House, having only recently been a model working for Ivanka Trump's fashion line.
“There are no real jobs here, you know?” Hicks replies. “Every day feels like when a group of strangers suddenly work together to push a beached whale back into the sea.”
Asked about whether she feels worried about being dragged into the Devin Nunes memo controversy by the FBI, Hicks says with a wink, “Even if a certain White House it-boy did get a little chatty with some Russian hunks, you wouldn't hear about it from me.”

The next guest to appear on the show is firebrand religious leader Louis Farrakhan, who garners praise from the show's hosts for “telling the truth about the FBI before any of us,” before then warning them that all the white people in the room
Then comes the star turn, with Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump pictured in a surprise call with the show's hosts — whilst lying on his bed.
The Fox & Friends hosts immediately begin to fawn over Trump, telling him how big an honour and privilege it is to be able to speak to him.
Trump, smartphone in hand, then reveals that he's getting his daily intelligence briefing.

“From whom?” asks one of the hosts.
“From you guys,” Trump responds. He then lauds Fox & Friends for their high ratings, although “of course not as big as my State of the Union address which was watched by 10 billion people, including all of China.”
The hosts then shower an avalanche of praise at Trump, calling him greater than Julius Caesar and saying that his State of the Union speech was the greatest speech in U.S. history.

Trump then encourages the hosts to back his claim about his State of the Union speech viewership, before asking them, “Who's the most innocent guy in the whole wide world?”
“You are!” they reply in unison.
“I can't hear you,” Trump teases.
“You are!” the hosts exclaim again, prompting Trump to say with satisfaction, “Daddy needed that.”

It's very discomforting to see the nation of India, one of the great potential leading countries of the world systematically self-destruct. Provoking a new war with China over remote chunks of land in the high Himalayas where the borders of China's Tibet Autonomous Region converge with India and the Kingdom of Bhutan, is only the latest example. The question posed is who or what grand design is behind India's foreign and domestic policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Has Modi switched sides? If so to whom?

The question posed is who or what grand design is behind India's foreign and domestic policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Has Modi switched sides? If so to whom?
Eurasian Harmony?
Only a year ago all seemed if not serene, well, then on its way to peaceful development with Modi's Asian neighbors including China and even, cautiously, Pakistan.
Just last year India, alongside Pakistan, were accepted as formal members of the increasingly important Shanghai Cooperation Organization where China is a founding member along with Russia, raising hopes that the common SCO format would permit peaceful resolution of simmering border tensions created by the 1947 British partition of India into a dominant Muslim Pakistan and a majority Hindu India with several unresolved friction areas including Kashmir and slyly left by Mountbatten as future explosion points.

India is also a member along with China in the BRICS organization which just created a BRICS New Development Bank in Shanghai whose President is an Indian. India is also a member of the China-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. And until Modi announced India's refusal to join the May 14 Beijing conference of the China One Belt, One Road, India was also a participant in the vast Eurasian infrastructure project.
OBOR Boycott, Japan ‘Freedom Corridor'
How quickly things have changed. Modi announced his refusal to participate in the May 14 China OBOR conference citing the Chinese investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a $62 billion highway, rail and port infrastructure development between China and Pakistan as part of China's OBOR, which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
Then, with surprising haste, India unveiled a vision document for Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) at the ongoing African Development Bank meeting in Gujarat, in a joint project with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The Indo-Japan AAGC document is an explicit part of a so-called Indo-Pacific Freedom Corridor being put in place by India and Japan to counter China's OBOR, using Japanese money and Indian established presence in Africa.

Under Abe, Japan has signed on to an increasingly aggressive anti-China agenda including over the disputed Diaoyu Islands called Senkaku Islands by Japan in the East China Sea. As well Japan has opted to install US missile defense systems and under Abe is regarded as the strongest US military ally in Asia. When Abe met Trump this February, the US President reaffirmed terms of the US-Japan mutual defense treaty and made clear that the treaty extended to disputed islands in the East China Sea–the Senkaku or the Diaoyu as the barren islands are called in China.
Modi in Washington, Tel Aviv
Weeks later, on June 27 India's Prime Minister Modi met with the US President in Washington. The day prior, conveniently, the US State Department announced designation of Pakistan-based Kashmiri leader of the militant Kashmir Valley Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, Mohammad Yusuf Shah, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). That designation permits US sanctions on Pakistan among other things.
As a result of the Modi-Trump talks, the US agreed to sell India 22 of its Guardian drones, a so-called game-changer, for up to $3 billion. Other items included expanded military cooperation and Indian agreement to buy US shale gas LNG. Modi seemed so pleased with his Washington talks that he invited the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, to lead the US delegation to Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) later this year in India.
Still glowing from his clear Washington political success, India's Modi flew to Israel July 7 for an unprecedented meeting of an Indian head of government in Israel with an Israeli Prime Minister. The talks between Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu were hailed in Indian media as a major shift in Indian foreign policy.

Here is where it gets seriously interesting. There has been a secret collaboration including offices in India between Israel's Mossad intelligence and India's CIA, called RAW going back to the 1950's. In 2008 Israel's Ambassador to India, Mark Sofer revealed that Israeli intelligence had provided the Indian Army with vital satellite imagery during India's 1999 “Kargil War” with Pakistan that allowed India to precisely bomb Pakistani troop positions who had occupied posts in India's Kargil district in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Dubious Role of Ajit Doval
The July Modi visit to Tel Aviv had been months in preparation. Already end of February Modi sent his National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to Tel Aviv to discuss details of the trip. There Doval met with Yosef Cohen the head of the Mossad and discussed among other things the alleged support by China and Pakistan along with other states for the Taliban in Afghanistan near the Afghan-Pakistan border.
Doval is no softie. He is attributed with something called the Doval Doctrine in India, the recent shift in Indian security policy in relation to Pakistan from what he calls ‘Defensive' to ‘Defensive Offensive'. He is reported behind India's surgical strikes in Pakistan in September 2016, and is behind the rise of pro-Indian militants in Kashmir. As an Indian blog describes it the Doval Doctrine, formulated in his speeches in 2014 and 2015 after being named MIDO National Security Adviser, essentially is aimed at China and Pakistan, has three components: “Irrelevance of morality, Of extremism freed from calculation or calibration, and Reliance on military.” Clearly Doval has little use for diplomatic solutions.
Whatever was privately agreed between Modi and Washington in June as well as with Tel Aviv in early July, it was in this time frame that the Doklam dispute erupted in the Indian decision to send troops to forcibly intervene against Chinese construction teams on the sensitive border zone between China, Bhutan and India in the Tibetan plateau.
For its side, China is citing a letter by former Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru to Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai in 1959:
“This Convention of 1890 also defined the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet; and the boundary was later, in 1895, demarcated. There is thus no dispute regarding the boundary of Sikkim with the Tibet region,” the letter read.
China has also cited a reference of May 10, 2006, besides the 1890 convention and the 1959-60 letters which says, “Both sides agree on the boundary alignment in the Sikkim Sector.” China publicly claims also that it “notified” India about the road building as a “goodwill” gesture.
Also read: When Israel Tried To Assassinate Nehru
At this point the real issue is not the validity or non-validity under international law of the Chinese arguments. All surrounding the recent Doklam dispute between China and India suggests the dark hand of Washington and Tel Aviv in cahoots with the Modi government to use the confrontation to sabotage the progress of China's huge and developing One Belt, One Road infrastructure project by attempting to foster another US-instigated proxy war.
The escalating dispute over Doklam need never have escalated on a military front. That was a decision of the Modi government and clearly bears the fingerprints of the fingerprints of Ajit Doval, Modi's security adviser and former head of Indian intelligence.
Has Narenda Modi actually switched sides from a genuine supporter of peaceful resolution of Indo-Pakistani and Indo-Chinese border disputes in a spirit of good-willed collaboration within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or was he Janus-faced in terms of his allegiances from the 2014 onset of his tenure as prime Minister, a kind of Anglo-American-Israeli Trojan Horse sent to sabotage China's promotion of the Eurasian new Economic Silk Road?
The answer is not yet known at least not by this author. However, a well-placed Indian source with close ties to the Indian military forces noted to me in a recent private correspondence that shortly following Trump's election in November last year, a senior US intelligence adviser to the Trump circles stated bluntly that there would not be a war between the USA and China, but rather there would be a war between India and China across the Himalayas. That was in November at a time Doklam was completely quiet.

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP)  Police say an 81-year-old Pennsylvania man who left a phone message threatening to blow up a school says he misdialed and was trying to return a threatening call he'd received from another number.
Online court records don't list an attorney for Lawrence Stabler, the Loyalsock Township man arrested Thursday night.
Police say Stabler left a message on the answering machine at the Donald E. Schick Elementary School threatening to "blow up" the building near Williamport earlier in the day.
Police say Stabler acknowledged making the call, but told them he was trying to call back another number from which he'd received threatening calls.

Stabler has been jailed in Lycoming County, after he was unable to immediately post $25,000 bond.
Let's face it: sports are more fun with villains, characters and causes.
Take the Olympics. Wasn't it more fun when the Cold War was going? Put “The Miracle On Ice” in 1994. Great. America has everything, now. Even hockey, too. Now, onto the NCAA Tournament while our northern neighbors cry and we forget about the Russians until 2016.
It wasn't just the fact Team USA won the gold in a sport dominated by Canadians, Soviets and Eastern Bloc countries.
You have to consider the time: Jimmy Carter was president and, for all the great work he's done rebuilding his image like a Habitat for Humanity house, the guy couldn't run a country. Remember? Meanwhile, the Soviets were one button-push away from ending the planet–or, so we were told.
The Commies were virtual pros, going up against a bunch of collegiates. Yet, the country was brought together by a story of hope that was fulfilled one Sunday afternoon at Lake Placid in a three-channel era.
Meanwhile, the most-watched sporting event in American history was the 1994 women's figure skating competition between America's supposed sweetheart Nancy Kerrigan and the hated Tanya Harding, whose then-husband along with a now-deceased thug conspired to injure the eventual silver-medal winner.
Heroes. Villains. Causes. They're the best ingredients for sports.
Which is why it's awesome the New York Yankees are back in the American League postseason.
No matter how far they go, or how likeable the A-Rod-less Bombers are in 2017, it won't last long. People hate perennial winners. And with the Yankee youth movement, it doesn't look they'll be one-year wonders, which means they'll be hateable soon.
The Yankees. The Patriots. The Cowboys. Notre Dame. ‘Bama. Duke. Kentucky. And sports are better for them.
Yes, those fanbases are huge. But sports are better when they're all good.
The Cubs and Red Sox gained popularity from being lovable losers. And that hasn't changed, even for the Sox, whose 86-year curse still feels like it ended last weekend, despite the fact they've won two more World Series over the next decade.
The Sox solidified their status as good guys (to any non-Yankees fans) after the tragic Boston Bombing of 2013. They had something to play for besides themselves.
The hated Yankees even earned sympathy after 9-11 before falling in seven games to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Eleven months later, the country celebrated the Angels knocking the freshly-Giambi'd Yanks from the ALDS in four games.
Notre Dame even became likeable before getting slaughtered in the national championship to Alabama. Why? So everyone could hate them again. But, ‘Bama wouldn't even allow the Irish to steal that deal, either.
Nick Saban may be the most-hated figure in all sports even when he loses. But, since only Dabo Swinney and Clemson to knock him off, and Swinney is so likeable, and has his own story of overcoming the odds, Saban will continue to make Bill Belichick almost tolerable.
Almost. Regurgitatng the history of the Hate-riots isn't necessary, but what really stings fans is winning Super Bowls after Spygate AND Deflategate. In fact, America collectively groaned last February with each scoring drive Brady & Co. would piecemeal as Atlanta let a 25-point lead to evaporate.
It wouldn't be as much fun if it were the Broncos coming back, would it?
Yes, they can win without cheating, too. Now what do you hate?
Easy: that the Bills can't replicate what they do. In essence, you hate your own team and deflect it on the Brady bunch.
Nonetheless, it is fun to watch New England struggle a bit, isn't it? Some pundits and publications predicted a redo of 2007 which ended the first Thursday of the year.
(In full disclosure, this writer still thinks they'll win it all.)
But it gives Bills fans hope, as well as other potential AFC division leaders. For once, Bill O'Brien's Texans look like they can compete with their leader's former boss. (Thanks, DeShaun Watson!)
Also, remember the Raiders? Injuries have sapped the enjoyment of watching Derek Carr become an All-Pro in back-to-back seasons, but despite a future move to Vegas, fans in Oakland have proven they won't allow their team to see the playoffs without them. If a fanbase who has every reason to hate their team leaving won't leave themselves, America must be enjoying a Raider resurgeance, too.
But if the Raiders can consistently win, Raider Nation will never let America forget, whether it's in Oakland or Sin City, and every Sunday will turn into Halloween at eight other NFL stadia a year.
In this writer's experience, the worst Bills games to attend are when the Raiders are in town.
The NFL is better with the renegade Raiders, as well as the Cowboys returning to a form they last consistently built in the 1990s. Love them or hate them, they're the highest-rated team to watch in the league.
Duke? Kentucky? People were praying they'd be part of the Louisville sneaker scandal that brought down Rick Pitino. But, eliminate them, and who do you root against?
North Carolina? They get sympathy for being the lighter shade of Duke. Let's face it, college basketball needs all the help it can get right now with the FBI involved with the sport's one-and-done culture. You may enjoy watching the biggest teams in sport getting raided like a Sopranos episode, but this toxic mix could bore the sport off the map.
Imagine a Final Four with Gonzaga, Butler, Georgia Tech and St. John's. What a break for TBS!
LeBron James made his famous WWE-style heel-turn broadcasting his move to South Beach, and returned with not seven, not six, not five, not four, not three, but only two rings–but two more than the city of Cleveland collected since the Kennedy Administration. Yet, magically, LeBron assembled another All-Star team to battle the natural All-Star team in Oakland and bring that long-awaited title home, making the Warriors the bad guys.
Golden State answers by signing Kevin Durant, and recapturing the NBA crown, solidifying their most-hated status.
Go Cavs. Go Celtics. Go Thunder. Go Rockets. Heck, even Gregg Popovich seems like a sympathetic figure. Anyone wins the David O'Brien Trophy, just not the friggin' Warriors.
Oddly, other than winning, there's nothing to hate about those guys.
Mayweather-MacGregor was a really bad guy against just a bad guy: a domestic abuser versus a fighter with gang-ties going across the Atlantic. Hence, by the laws of the perceptions of evil, the least of the pair becomes the good guy. And America loved the undefeated boxer vs. the UFC star idea so much, they completely forgot about the Little League World Series championship the next day.
Speaking of which, the LLWS is loaded with bad guys, but since they're kids, and we're Americans, we demonize the other countries.
(Yes. Newsflash. Douchebaggery starts at ages younger than 12. Just not your kid, though.)
They say there's a thin line between love and hate.
Sports are at their best when all the historically hated teams are good.
Enjoy it, even if you won't admit it.
ABC/Ida Mae AstuteHulu wants to thank Elle King for being a friend. The streaming platform tapped her to sing a new version of the theme to the classic sitcom Golden Girls to promote the fact that the show is now available on Hulu. Elle was thrilled, since it's one of her favorite shows.
“Such a big part of my childhood is me watching Golden Girls with my grandmother,” she says in a Hulu interview. “And so it's such an amazing memory for me and I always think of the show so fondly.”
Golden Girls, starring Betty White and the late Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty and Bea Arthur, ran from 1985 through 1992 and focused on four older women who share a house in Florida. Elle says she loved the friendship between the four women, especially one particular aspect of it.
“I love that these women all seem to wake up in the middle of the night and eat cake or pie and none of them ever gain weight,” she laughs. “That's all I aspire to do is, like, eat cake with my friends in the middle of the night and chitchat.”
The Golden Girls theme, “Thank You for Being a Friend,” was originally written and sung by the late Andrew Gold, who had a top 30 hit with it in 1978. The version used for the show was recorded by Cynthia Fee.
Elle posted a shot of herself dressed as a Golden Girl on her Instagram, with the caption, “Honestly, a lot of things have been checked off my bucket list. But being a golden girl for a day felt like how it would feel if Ryan Gosling let me kiss him on the mouth.”

Even as the 2019 Lok Sabha election draws near, the path ahead for the BJP to retain its rule in New Delhi increasingly looks challenging, far from the buoyancy that it had ahead of the 2014 General elections, owing to the massive Narendra Modi wave that swept the country's political scene.
What's worse, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on whose shoulders lie the huge responsibility of steering his party to a win in the state in the big poll next year, has failed to deliver on multiple occasions now.
How patient the BJP top brass would be, with these kinds of back-to-back failures, remains to be seen, as the defeats are a clear indicator of the growing clout of the Opposition in the state.
What's notable is that Congress is playing second fiddle in most of these contests, allowing regional satraps to lead the charge. The result so far has been impressive for the Opposition, which is trying to regroup after the big failures in Lok Sabka election 2014 and Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 2017.
On Thursday, after nine rounds of counting in the Kairana Lok Sabha seat, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal received 66.47 percent of the votes (46,909 votes) while BJP's Mriganka Singh got 31.13 percent (21,970 votes).
RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan, who is leading Mriganka in the parliamentary constituency, looks confident of winning the seat if the trend continues in this manner. Mriganka also contested the Assembly elections in Kairana but lost heavily to Samajwadi Party's Nahid Hasan, who is the son of party's former MP Munawar Khan.
On the other hand, Samajwadi Party is leading in the Noorpur Assembly seat as well. SP candidate Naeem Ul Hasan is currently ahead of BJP's Avani Singh in the Noorpur seat. The by election to Noorpur Assembly seat was necessitated by the death of sitting BJP MLA Lokendra Singh Chauhan in a road accident in February.
In Kairana, the grand alliance against BJP is at play, with the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and SP all offering their support to the RLD. Hassan had won the seat in 2009 on a BSP ticket, against Mriganka, daughter of BJP winner in 2014 Hukum Singh whose death necessitated the bypoll.
Kairana parliamentary constituency has five Assembly segments: Shamli, Thana Bhawan and Kairana in Shamli district, and Gangoh and Nakur in Saharanpur district. According to the Election Commission, there are 16.09 lakh voters in Kairana: 8.73 lakh male voters and 7.36 lakh female voters.
Noorpur Assembly constituency has 3.06 lakh voters. Apart from Kairana, where Samajwadi Party's Hasan represents the Assembly seat, all the remaining four Assembly seats falling under the Kairana Lok Sabha seat are with the BJP. Thana Bhawan is with Suresh Kumar, Shamli is with Tejendra Nirwal, Nakur is with Dharam Singh Saini and Gangoh is with Pradeep Kumar, all from the BJP.
However, despite the advantage, the combined strength of Congress, SP and RLD proved to be too much for the BJP. Adding salt to the wound, the Opposition replicated the formula they used in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by elections early this year, where the ruling party suffered an unexpected defeat. The withdrawal of candidature of Lok Dal's Kanwar Hasan from the fray and his joining of the RLD has only added to the Opposition's confidence.
Although Adityanath left no stone unturned in campaigning for the bypoll along with his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya in Saharanpur and Shamli, the efforts don't seem to be fruitful.
Apart from them, the BJP had thrown in at least five state ministers into the 'fight for Kairana'. They included Dharam Singh Saini (Minister of State for Ayush), Suresh Rana (sugarcane development minister), Anupama Jaiswal (basic education minister) Surya Pratap Shahi (agriculture minister) and Laxmi Narayan (religious affairs, culture, minority welfare, waqf and Haj minister). Jaiswal is the minister in charge of Shamli district, while Shahi is the minister in charge of Saharanpur.
"Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has been roped in since he hails from a farming background," a senior Uttar Pradesh BJP leader had said. BJP MPs Sanjiv Baliyan, Raghav Lakhan Pal, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar and Kanta Kardam also actively campaigned for Mriganka.
The SP and Congress, however, had termed the line-up of Uttar Pradesh ministers as a sign of "party jitters".
According to the locals, the major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. RLD candidate Hasan had accused the BJP-led state government of resorting to divisive politics.
"Sugarcane growers in the region are feeling the maximum amount of pain, as no payments have been made to them by the state government," she had told PTI, rejecting the official claim that the dues from sugar mills were being cleared.
The issue was also raised during an election meeting of state minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, who said that the dues accumulated from the time of the past governments had been paid out, and the rest would be settled soon.
"In Uttar Pradesh, 10,828.59 lakh quintals of sugarcane were purchased by sugar mills from farmers during the BJP government in 2017-18, as compared to 6443.41 lakh quintals under the Samajwadi Party government in 2015-16. Similarly, Rs 21,186.56 crore payments were made during the BJP government in the state in 2017-18, in comparison to Rs 11,841.34 crore made during the SP government in 2015-16," BJP spokesperson Chandramohan had said.
Divergent views also emerged on the reported 2016 exodus of Hindu families from Kairana.
"The area is adjacent to Panipat district in Haryana. The labourers (both Hindus and Muslims) from the area go to the neighbouring state to work in the industries there. They go in the morning and return in the evening," Hasan had said while rejecting the claims of any such exodus.
The RLD leader further said that the locked houses, even of Muslims who had gone to Panipat for work, were photographed and used as a "propaganda". "In Kairana, both Hindus and Muslims live in peace," she had added.
Mriganka, on the other hand, had said, "The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped now. But hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment before the 2017 UP Assembly elections".
The present defeat would compound problems for the BJP as in March this year, SP had won both the Lok Sabha seats of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, which were vacated by Adityanath and Maurya.
With the BSP backing its bitter rival Samajwadi Party, the BJP had to absorb a shock defeat in both the constituencies in what was seen as a major embarrassment to Adityanath in particular.
Samajwadi Party's Nagendra Singh Patel had won the Phulpur seat beating BJP's Kashlendra Singh Patel while Pravin Nishad of the Samajwadi Party won over the BJP candidate Upendra Dutt Shukla in Gorakhpur, which Adityanath had won five consecutive times.
The Uttar Pradesh bypolls are a timely wake-up call for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, as the charm of winning 325 seats in the 403-Assembly in the state last year is certainly gone. Along with it, the magic of winning 71 seats out of 80 in the 2014 Lok Sabha election has also vanished.
There is little doubt that the upcoming Lok Sabha election is altogether a different ball game and if BJP wants to repeat its 2014 feat, it'll have no choice but to totally rejig its electoral strategy.

As a meeting last August in the Oval Office to discuss sanctions on Venezuela was concluding, U.S. President Donald Trump turned to his top aides and asked an unsettling question: With a fast unravelling Venezuela threatening regional security, why can't the U.S. just simply invade the troubled country?
The suggestion stunned those present at the meeting, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, both of whom have since left the administration. This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said.

In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.
But Trump pushed back. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.
The idea, despite his aides' best attempts to shoot it down, would nonetheless persist in the president's head.
WATCH: President Trump says military option could be used for Venezuela
The next day, Aug. 11, Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a “military option” to remove Maduro from power. The public remarks were initially dismissed in U.S. policy circles as the sort of martial bluster people have come to expect from the reality TV star turned commander in chief.
But shortly afterward, he raised the issue with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, according to the U.S. official. Two high-ranking Colombian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Trump confirmed the report.
Then in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trump discussed it again, this time at greater length, in a private dinner with leaders from four Latin American allies that included Santos, the same three people said and Politico reported in February.

The U.S. official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn't play well, but the first thing the president said at the dinner was, “My staff told me not to say this.” Trump then went around asking each leader if they were sure they didn't want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure.
Eventually, McMaster would pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion, the official said.
Taken together, the behind-the-scenes talks, the extent and details of which have not been previously reported, highlight how Venezuela's political and economic crisis has received top attention under Trump in a way that was unimaginable in the Obama administration. But critics say it also underscores how his “America First” foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries.
The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability. Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbours absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
WATCH: Trump threatens Venezuela with sanctions
For Maduro, who has long claimed that the U.S. has military designs on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves, Trump's bellicose talk provided the unpopular leader with an immediate if short-lived boost as he was trying to escape blame for widespread food shortages and hyperinflation. Within days of the president's talk of a military option, Maduro filled the streets of Caracas with loyalists to condemn “Emperor” Trump's belligerence, ordered up nationwide military exercises and threatened with arrest opponents he said were plotting his overthrow with the U.S.
“Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!” thundered Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, at the government-stacked constituent assembly. “If Venezuela were attacked, the rifles will arrive in New York, Mr. Trump,” the younger Maduro said. “We will take the White House.”
Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies were begrudgingly forced to side with Maduro in condemning Trump's saber rattling. Santos, a big backer of U.S. attempts to isolate Maduro, said an invasion would have zero support in the region. The Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying “the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy” and repudiating “any option that implies the use of force.”

But among Venezuela's beleaguered opposition movement, hostility to the idea of a military intervention has slowly eased.
A few weeks after Trump's public comments, Harvard economics professor Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister, wrote a syndicated column titled “D Day Venezuela,” in which he called for a “coalition of the willing” made up of regional powers and the U.S. to step in and support militarily a government appointed by the opposition-led national assembly.
Mark Feierstein, who oversaw Latin America on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that strident U.S. action on Venezuela, however commendable, won't loosen Maduro's grip on power if it's not accompanied by pressure from the streets. However, he thinks Venezuelans have largely been demoralized after a crackdown on protests last year triggered dozens of deaths, and the threat of more repression has forced dozens of opposition leaders into exile.
WATCH: Venezuela's Maduro doesn't want ‘problems' with Trump
“People inside and outside the administration know they can ignore plenty of what Trump says,” Feierstein, who is now a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said of Trump's talk of military invasion of Venezuela. “The concern is that it raised expectations among Venezuelans, many of whom are waiting for an external actor to save them.”
California's program to provide in-home care for its low-income elderly and disabled residents finds itself once again at the heart of a state budget standoff.
It is familiar territory for the workers, advocates and administrators of the In-Home Supportive Services program. The current flare-up — between the state and county governments over how to divvy up IHSS costs — is the latest example of how California's signature program, meant to keep people in their communities and out of nursing homes, has continually been the source of budget friction in recent years.
The tussling comes at a crucial time for the program, which now cares for more than half a million people — and, more broadly, for California, as the state braces for a swell of demands for care from an aging population. By 2036, residents age 65 or older are expected to make up nearly a quarter of the population, according to state projections, up from 14% last year.
“It gets exhausting, to tell you the truth,” said Laphonza Butler, president of Service Employees International Union — United Long Term Care Workers' Union, which represents in-home caregivers, of the recurring budget battles. “But at the same time, in my opinion there's no more important conversation to be having. California's population is aging and it is aging rapidly.”
Advocates for both the workers and consumers of the program say IHSS benefits consumers by keeping them in their homes — and saves the state money on pricey institutional care.
“Overall, it is an invaluable program and it really has accomplished a lot of the goals it set out to accomplish,” said Claire Ramsey, an attorney with Justice in Aging, an advocacy group.
Born from a disability rights movement
Far more than most states, California has embraced the concept of in-home caregiving, which involves assistance with a wide range of daily living tasks such as bathing, feeding, house cleaning and administering medications. There are between 600,000 and 800,000 providers offering in-home care throughout the country, said Candace Howes, an economics professor at Connecticut College, and more than 500,000 of them are in California.
“California did this in part in response to a civil rights movement among disabled people,” said Howes, who has studied the IHSS program. “It was spawned by Vietnam veterans coming back and wanting to have care in the community, rather than institutions.”
As a part of the state's Medi-Cal program, IHSS is an entitlement for anyone who meets the income qualification. Recipients cannot have assets greater than $2,000 — or $3,000 per couple — with certain property, such as homes or vehicles, being excluded from that total.
The federal government typically covers 50% of the cost of the program — that share has gone up for some recipients under the Affordable Care Act. The state and counties cover the rest. Counties administer the program by determining eligibility and assessing how many hours of care each recipient will need. But the ultimate authority rests with the consumer, who gets to pick his or her caregiver. About 70% of program recipients employ a family member as their in-home caregiver. Providers must enroll with the county and pass a background check, but there are no additional training or certification requirements.
California's budget deficit is back, Gov. Jerry Brown says »
Alaina Brooks said in-home care has been a life-changer for her brother, Anthony Cheatham, 59, who was paralyzed due to a gunshot wound more than 20 years ago. Cheatham had been living in a nursing home in Texas, but inattentive care led to dry rot in his legs, eventually requiring amputation, Brooks said.
Now, Cheatham is living in Brooks' Palmdale home and has been hospitalized only once in six years, she said.
Brooks' brother was assessed the maximum amount of care possible, 283 hours per month, for which Brooks is paid $11 an hour.
“We don't go into this for the money,” said Brooks, 51, a former real estate agent who is now active in her union. “That's barking up the wrong tree. It's because it needs to be done.”
Recent budget battles
Backers of the program found themselves playing defense during the recession, when then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called for anti-fraud measures to tamp down on costs and sought reductions to provider's wages and the number of hours recipients would be eligible for.
The cuts continued as Brown returned to the governor's office. In 2011, he sought to slash IHSS service hours, which range from one to 283 hours per month, by 20%. That move was ultimately blocked by a court injunction, but milder cuts, initiated in the Schwarzenegger years, were kept in place.
Butler, who also leads SEIU's statewide council, credited Brown for trying “to engage constructively.” But, she hastened to add, “not always in ways that we have agreed with and not always in ways that demonstrate the level of importance of this program to so many Californians.”
Debbi Thomson, deputy director of the adult programs division of the state Department of Social Services, said the administration recognizes the significance IHSS has in keeping residents in their homes and out of nursing facilities.
“We feel like it's a valuable program, absolutely,” she said.
California's healthier post-recession finances put an end to the string of cuts, and in 2015, Brown restored the service hours that had been cut by 7% in previous years.
Still, there were other points of friction. At Brown's insistence, in-home caregivers were cut out of a 2014 measure to give paid sick leave to all workers in the state. Last year, as part of the deal struck by Brown and labor leaders to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, IHSS workers secured paid sick days, which will take effect in 2018.
Once fully phased in, the increased minimum wage is expected to cost the state more than $1.2 billion just for the IHSS program, according to Department of Finance projections. Compounding the costs are federal labor regulations that went into place in 2016 that require overtime pay for home care workers.
Other changes from Washington could have more dramatic impact. The now-stalled Republican healthcare overhaul included a drastic restructuring of Medicaid financing. Proposals such as block grants, which cap how much money the federal government would provide to states, could mean a more existential threat to IHSS as an entitlement program.

President Donald Trump rallied his base on Tuesday night by feeding them lies about how his policies have benefited African Americans.

Speaking to about 1,000 supporters in Nashville, the president claimed falsely that his policies have improved the lives of Black people, who, he said, have voted for Democrats “for over 100 years.” Aside from Trump's obvious lie about African Americans only voting for Democrats over the past century, the president's policies have in fact been detrimental to the Black community.
Trump, in Nashville, says African Americans have blindly voted for Democrats “for over a hundred years.” If only black folks had the right to vote for that long … — Geoff Bennett (@GeoffRBennett) May 30, 2018
In education, the president has looked for ways to cut education funding to public schools. This comes as many Black children attend schools in building that should be condemned, like many in Detroit, and schools that lack the resources that wealthy school districts offer their students. Moreover, rather than reducing bias in schools, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos approved new guidance, which took effect in March, that permits investigators in her department to disregard civil rights cases.
The president has also falsely insisted that he's responsible for the decline in Black unemployment. However, it has been declining steadily since President Barack Obama's presidency. Indeed, economists have credited Obama's financial recovery initiative from the recession for the declining unemployment. In 2010, during the recession, the Black unemployment rate hit 16.8 percent, but it continued to decrease, falling to 7.8 percent when Trump took office.
At the same time, Trump has ushered in an era of increased hate crimes with his embrace of White supremacists, particularly after Charlottesville. The president folded this racist attitude into his immigration policy, calling for a limit on immigration from African nations and Haiti—places he referred to as “shithole countries.”
Trump now wants to blame his failed policy of separating migrant children from their parents on President Obama and the Democrats.
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018
The president came under criticism after an administration official told a Senate subcommittee in April that the Health and Human Services Department lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children who were taken from their parents by federal officials.
In fact, separating migrant parents and children is a Trump administration policy, according to NPR. Attorney General Jeff Sessions articulated the policy in a May 7 speech in Arizona.

An 8-month-old baby girl died Wednesday in Miramar, Fla., after she was attacked by a family dog, local police said.
The infant was in the care of her grandmother at the time of the attack, Miramar Police Officer Yessenia Diaz told USA TODAY.
The family owns three pit bulls — a mother, one male sibling and one female sibling. The grandmother was walking the dogs when the male dog, which police said was 3 or 4-years-old, got away from her and attacked the baby who was bobbing in a bouncy chair in one of the bedrooms.
The family raised the male dog who attacked the child from a puppy. Broward County and Animal Care and Adoption officials removed all three dogs. Diaz said the dog that attacked would "most likely" be put down, but it would depend on the result of an evaluation by animal control experts.
Police withheld the identity of the victim and her family because the parents asked for time to inform other relatives, the Sun Sentinel reported.
Police were the first to arrive. When fire and rescue officials got to the scene, they declared the child dead, Diaz said.
Diaz said that a victims services unit was made available to provide counseling and support not only to the child's family but also to the first responders at the scene.
"Who isn't going to be affected by that, especially when they're looking at the crime scene?" Diaz asked.

WASHINGTON -
Scientists have witnessed the first modern case of what they call “river piracy” and they blame global warming. Most of the water gushing from a large glacier in northwest Canada last year suddenly switched from one river to another.
That changed the Slims River from a three-metre deep, raging river to something so shallow that it barely was above a scientist's high top sneakers at midstream. The melt from the Yukon's Kaskawulsh glacier now flows mostly into the Alsek River and ends up in the Pacific Ocean instead of the Arctic's Bering Sea.
It seemed to all happen in about one day — last May 26 — based on river gauge data, said Dan Shugar, a University of Washington Tacoma professor who studies how land changes. A 30-metre tall canyon formed at the end of the glacier, rerouting the melting water, Shugar and his colleagues wrote in a study published in Monday's journal Nature Geoscience.
The term “river piracy” is usually used to describe events that take a long time to occur, such as tens of thousands of years, and had not been seen in modern times, especially not this quickly, said study co-author Jim Best of the University of Illinois. It's different from something like the Mississippi River changing course at its delta and it involves more than one river and occurs at the beginning of a waterway, not the end.
The scientists had been to the edge of the Kaskawulsh glacier in 2013. Then the Slims River was “swift, cold and deep” and flowing fast enough that it could be dangerous to wade through, Shugar said. They returned last year to find the river shallow and as still as a lake, while the Alsek, was deeper and flowing faster.
“We were really surprised when we got there and there was basically no water in the river,” Shugar said of the Slims. “We could walk across it and we wouldn't get our shirts wet. It was like a snake-shaped lake rather than a river.”
What had been a river delta at the edge of the Slims River had changed into a place full of “afternoon dust storms with this fine dust getting into your nose and your mouth,” Best said.
The lack of water in the Slims wasn't because of changes in rainfall, Shugar said. They know that because it's a river fed mostly by glacial melt, not rain, and the Alsek increased in amounts similar to what disappeared from the Slims.
The Kaskawulsh glacier covers about 25,000 square kilometres, about the size of Vermont. The front of the glacier has retreated nearly 1.9 million kilometres since 1899, Shugar said.
The scientists calculate that there is only a one in 200 chance that the retreating glacier and river piracy is completely natural without man-made global warming. They used weather and ice observations and a computer simulation that models how likely the glacier retreat would be with current conditions and without heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
Several outside scientists praised the study as significant and sensible.
“This is an interesting study and reconfirms that climate change has large, widespread and sometimes surprising impacts,” Pennsylvania State University glacier expert Richard Alley, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email.
Volkswagen plans to start offering car-sharing services using fully electric vehicles in German cities next year as part of efforts to serve consumers who don't want to buy their own vehicles.
Its offering will compete in its home market with DriveNow and Car2Go, the soon-to-be-merged carsharing services of BMW and Daimler.
Volkswagen said on Wednesday the new carsharing service would be expanded to major cities in Europe, North America and Asia as early as 2020 and focus on core VW brand cars.
VW is seeking to move on from its diesel emissions scandal of 2015, the repercussions of which are still being felt across the German car industry, and focus on greener technologies.
It set up mobility services division Moia in 2016, which focuses on ride-hailing and carpooling and which will be complemented by the new carsharing service.
New CEO Herbert Diess, who took office in April, said it was vital for VW “to pick up speed and make an unmistakable mark” in areas including new mobility services which VW wants to contribute a significant share to future group business.
Renault announced plans on Wednesday to launch a ride-hailing and car-sharing scheme covering the French capital and its surrounding areas from September.
Renault and Peugeot-maker PSA are vying to offer a car-sharing scheme in Paris to replace Autolib, the electric car sharing service run by French tycoon Vincent Bollore's group that was recently ditched by local authorities after a dispute.
Manitoba Hydro is expanding their infrastructure to keep up with the rapid growth of the Pembina Valley.
"Obviously this growth has been going on for awhile, and the area is going to continue to grow. Manitoba Hydro has to be in a position to not only meet the current demand but the demand over the next 20, 30 years," Spokesperson Bruce Owen explains.
He notes more homes and new businesses mean greater energy needs. With so many residents using electricity to heat their homes during winter months, customers will see lights begin to flicker during peak usage times.
Currently, crews are adding new lines to connect to the upgraded Stanley station near Carman. Owen says the investment will result in greater voltage and more consistent, reliable service.
Work is expected to continue throughout the summer.
Image Group LA/ABCWhen Lady Gaga starred in American Horror Story, she was credited as Lady Gaga. But for her first big movie role, she'll go by her birth name.
Warner Bros. Pictures, the company producing Gaga and Bradley Cooper‘s remake of A Star Is Born, has announced that the singer is going by Stefani Germanotta for the role.
According to Warner Bros., filming is now underway on the movie, which will feature Cooper as Jackson Maine, a fading country star who discovers Ally, a talented nobody played by Gaga — uh, Stefani. The two start an affair, but when Jackson makes Ally a star, he can't handle the fact that her fame is surpassing his own. The movie opens September 28, 2018.
As previously reported, Gaga is filming some scenes for the movie this week on the grounds of the Coachella festival, where she performed this past weekend, and will perform again this coming weekend.
During her set this past weekend, Gaga debuted a brand-new song called “The Cure.” A rep for the singer confirms to ABC Radio that the song is a stand-alone single and isn't from A Star Is Born, or some previously-unknown upcoming album. It also won't be added to any additional release of Gaga's current album, Joanne.

AIN ISSA, Syria Islamic State militants have become increasingly desperate in the face of heavy air strikes on their Syrian bastion Raqqa, passing themselves off as civilians to escape detection and killing anyone who tries to flee, witnesses said.At a camp for the displaced in the village of Ain Issa north of the city, people who arrived on Wednesday also said the air strikes supporting an assault by U.S.-backed forces had inflicted widespread destruction as the battle intensified.United Nations war crimes investigators said the air campaign had killed at least 300 civilians in the city, captured by Islamic State in 2014 in the chaos of Syria's civil war.The escapees said the air strikes had flattened rows of apartment blocks along a main road but many of them had already been abandoned by residents fleeing Islamic State's reign of terror and the assault on the town, which began last week."The coalition strikes destroyed a four-story apartment building. I saw 10 people trapped underneath," said Abu Hamoud. "They used phosphorus."Human Rights Watch expressed concern on Wednesday about the use of incendiary white phosphorous weapons by the U.S.-led coalition, saying it endangers civilians when used in populated areas.The coalition is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias who have been closing in on Raqqa in northern Syria for months in preparation for the assault to recapture the city.
Hassan Kirfou, said an airstrike hit the mosque where he works just a few hours after he closed it for the night, and two other mosques were hit.“I saw three dead teenagers on top of each other outside the Nour mosque,” he said. “I don't know why they shot these areas. As far as I know there were only a few Daesh (Islamic State) snipers left there.”Much of the damage from air strikes was inflicted on Seif al-Dawla street, one of the main arteries of the town. “My uncle and two cousins were killed. Their house was destroyed,” Kirfou said.The pressure on Islamic State, which is on the brink of losing the other centre of its self-proclaimed caliphate, the Iraqi city of Mosul, is taking a heavy toll on the group, people who arrived at Ain Issa in the last few days said.
“They have started using microphones to tell people: 'Don't go to the infidels, stay with Islam',” said Abdul Razak Crais, standing near rows of white tents as people lined up for food.“They poured gasoline on the cars of anyone who tried to escape then lit a match and burned the vehicles. I saw them haul people out of their cars and shoot them with AK-47s."The coalition estimates that 3,000-4,000 Islamic State fighters are holed up in Raqqa, the administrative headquarters of Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on civilians across the globe.
Residents who fled say they have been laying landmines on streets, booby trapping houses and digging tunnels in preparation for battle.“They take over people's houses and create big holes in their walls so they can move back and forth during fighting,” said Thaier Ibrahim.Others at the camp said militants were hiding weapons and riding cars with civilians to avoid air strikes.About 10,000 civilians have fled to the SDF-run Ain Issa camp about 60 km (40 miles) north of Raqqa with hundreds more arriving each day, Medecins Sans Frontieres has said.Conditions have deteriorated because of the gruelling summer heat. But people like Mohamed Nahaf took the risk of getting shot to escape Islamic State and a battle for the city that could take months.“They cut off all roads. We had to pay a smuggler $200 to get us out,” he said. (Editing by Philippa Fletcher)

ISLAMABAD - As many as five bigwigs of Pakistani politics including two former prime ministers and two veterans of last eight general elections since 1985 are contesting the 2018 general election in the twin districts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
These five bigwigs include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, ex-PM Raja Pervez Ashraf, former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan. These five bigwigs have remained influential on the horizon of the country's politics in one way or the other.
On the top of the list is the disgruntled PML0N leader and former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan who is a veteran of the last eight general elections since 1985 and has won all. Nisar, this time around, is contesting the July 25 election as an independent candidate from Rawalpindi's two National Assembly constituencies (NA-59 and NA-63) and two Punjab Assembly's constituencies. He is not only facing two candidates of his former party, Raja Qamarul Islam in NA-59 and Sardar Mumtaz in NA-63 but also PTI's Ghulam Sarwar Khan in both these constituencies. He is contesting one of the toughest elections of his political career and many political observers see that this election will decide the fate of his career in politics.
Nisar contested the first general election of Lower House of the Parliament in 1985, which was held on a non-party basis, from Rawalpindi's old NA-40 and won by securing 49,071 votes against his opponent Safdar Ali Shah who got 32,392 votes. He contested next two general elections of 1988 and 1990, on the ticket of Islami Jamhoori Ittihad (IJI) and defeated his opponents and Pakistan People's Party (PPP)'s candidate Habib Khan in 1988 and Pakistan Democratic Alliance (PDA)'s candidate Ghulam Sarwar Khan in 1990 consecutively. Nisar contested the election of 1993 on a ticket of the PML-N and defeated PPP's candidate Ghulam Sarwar Khan with a margin of around 11,000 votes. In the general election of 1997, he on a PML-N ticket defeated PPP's Sardar Shoaib Mumtaz by a margin of around 38,000 votes.
With the new delimitation of constituencies before the 2002 general election, Rawalpindi's old NA-40 was divided into two constituencies, NA-52 and NA-53. Nisar contested from NA-52 and NA 53 simultaneously and defeated PML-Q's Raja Nasir by a margin of 17,000 votes from NA-52 but faced defeat in NA-53 from Ghulam Sarwar Khan, an independent candidate, by a margin of around 10,000 votes. In 2008 general election, Nisar won the election on both constituencies of NA-52 and NA-53 and defeated both the same candidates who were on PML-Q tickets that time. In the election of 2013, Nisar won the election of NA-52 from PTI's Ajmal Sabir Raja with a wide margin of 63,000 votes, however, he faced defeat from PTI's Ghulam Sarwar Khan in NA-53 with a margin of around 8,000 votes. With the new delimitations before the 2018 general election, NA-52 has been changed into NA-59 and NA-53 with NA-63.
From Rawalpindi, AML chief Sheikh Rasheed also a share with Nisar, being a veteran of the last eight general elections. He is now contesting from NA-60 (old NA-56) against PML-N's Hanif Abbasi and from NA-62 (old NA-55) against PML-N's Danyal Chaudhry. The PTI as part of the seat adjustment has not fielded candidates in these two constituencies.
He first contested the non-party basis general election of 1985 from Rawalpindi's old NA-38 and defeated his opponent Ghulam Hussain by a margin of around 21,000 votes. He contested the general elections of 1988 and 1990 from the same constituency on a ticket of the IJI and defeated PPP's Tikka Khan and PDA's Chaudhry Mushtaq consecutively. He contested 1993 general election on a PML-N ticket and defeated PPP's Agha Riazul Islam. He again won 1997 elections and defeated PPP leader Ms Naheed Khan with a huge margin of 47,000 votes.
With the new delimitation before 2002 general election, old NA-38 was split into NA-55 and NA-56 and like Nisar, Sheikh Rasheed contested the election on both the constituencies as an independent candidate. He won both seats by defeating PPP's Agha Riazul Islam and PML-N's Sardar Tariq from NA-55 and PPP's Sardar Shaukat Hayat as well as PML-N's Zafar Ali Shah from NA-56.
Sheikh Rasheed faced first defeat in the 2008 general election on a Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q) ticket from PML-N's Hanif Abbasi in NA-56 and from PML-N's Makhdoom Javed Hashmi in NA-55. In the 2013 general election, he defeated PML-N's Shakeel Awan with a margin of 13,000 votes from NA-55 (now NA-62) while PTI's Imran Khan defeated PL-N's Hanif Abbasi from NA-56 (Now NA-60).
PML-N leader and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also started his political career in 1988 and he was junior to Nisar and Sheikh Rasheed. He is now contesting election from Rawalpindi's NA-57 (old NA-50) against PTI's Sadaqat Abbasi as well as PPP's Mehreen Anwar Raja and from Islamabad's NA-53 against PTI chief Imran Khan. He first contested election from NA-38 (a constituency that also includes Murree) in 1988 as an independent candidate and defeated IJI's Raja Zafarul Haq. He contested 1990s elections on a ticket of the IJI and defeated PPP's candidate Raja Anwar. He contested elections of 1993 and 1997 on a PML-N ticket and defeated PPP's Col (retd) Habib Khan and PML-Junejo's candidate Babar Awan consecutively.
With the new delimitations before 2002 election, this constituency was declared as NA-50 and Abbasi on a PML-N ticket lost election against PPP candidate Murtaza Satti in 2002. In the 2008 general election, he defeated his rival Satti of the PPP.
In 2013 election, he again on a PML-N ticket defeated PTI's Sadaqat Abbasi and PPP's Ms Mehreen Anwer Raja.
Former prime minister and senior PPP leader, Raja Pervez Ashraf is junior to all these bigwigs as he started his political career in 1997. He first contested the election on a PPP ticket from NA-37 (now NA-58), the constituency which includes Rawalpindi's Tehsil Gujar Khan. He lost that election from PML-N's Khursheed Zaman. This constituency was declared as NA-51 before 2002 elections and Ashraf got the victory on a PPP ticket by defeating PML-Q's Raja Shaukat Aziz Bhatti and PML-N's candidate Chaudhry Khursheed Zaman. In 2008 elections, he again on a PPP ticket defeated PML-Q's Raja Qasim Javed (who got 69,690 votes) and PML-N's Chaudhry Riaz (who got 56,381 votes) by securing 80, 247 votes. In the 2013 general election, PML-N candidate Raja Javed Ikhlas defeated Ashraf.
With the new delimitations, NA-52 was declared as NA-58 where Ashraf is contesting against PML-N's Raja Javed Ikhlas and PTI's Chaudhry Azeem.
Imran Khan who is the founder of his own party—PTI, is contesting election from Islamabad's National Assembly constituency (NA-53) against former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. Khan is also contesting elections from four other NA constituencies including NA-95 (Mianwali), NA-131 (Lahore), NA-243 (Karachi) and NA-35 (Bannu).
Khan founded his own party in 1996 and began his political career by contesting the election in 1997. In 1997 elections, he contested from two each National Assembly's constituencies of Lahore and Karachi and contested from each NA constituencies of Abbottabad, Dera Ismail Khan, Swat, Mianwali and Islamabad. He faced defeat from all these nine constituencies.
In the 2002 general election, he contested election from four National Assembly's constituencies including Karak, Swat, Mianwali and Lahore. He only got the victory from Mianwali's NA-71. PTI boycotted the 2008 general elections.
In 2013 elections, Khan contested NA elections from Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Mianwali and Lahore and got the victory from all three constituencies except for Lahore where PML-N candidate Sardar Ayaz Sadiq defeated him.
In the Handmaid's Tale season-two trailer, pairs of black-clad handmaids — identifiable by their now-ebony wings — marched down a snowy path, obviously bound for a funeral. We knew that someone important would die, or else why break out a special mourning uniform and cover their faces with chiffon red veils? But oddly enough, the women weren't lined up for Commander Waterford — who lives on! — or Aunt Lydia, or a Wife. They're marching to bury the 31 handmaids who have died as a result of Ofglen's explosives.
The funeral itself — complete with red caskets, liturgical dancelike arm gestures, and some extra hypocrisy from Aunt Lydia, who declares “I wish I could give you a world without violence, without pain. It's all I ever wanted” — is more than I expected handmaids would receive. History has proven that Gilead's ceremonies are reserved for the “worthy” classes, so this must be propaganda of the highest order, intended to show the handmaids that there is still order in the tenuous nation-state, that the autocracy is a well-oiled machine. Gilead loves a good ceremony; after all, tradition is what people staring into the abyss of meaninglessness have fallen back on for millennia.
The ceremony is meant to show the utmost respect to each handmaid who died, with Aunt Lydia calling out each woman's name — Ofryan, Ofduncan, Ofsomedude — and the handmaids bowing to the caskets and holding the veils to their faces, like professional paid mourners. But to bury these women with their Gilead names slapped on them is like reading out the tattooed number of a Holocaust victim as if it is her true identity.
“Do you know Ofglen's name?” June asks as the handmaids' van speeds away from the cemetery. She'd never asked on any of their shopping trips, and it would have been pretty difficult for Ofglen to relay that information after she'd had her tongue cut out for recalcitrance. But June feels like she needs to know, that she has to supply Ofglen with her real identity so she can be mourned properly. The handmaids' glances around the van indicate a sudden general awareness that they don't know each other all that well, despite their months spent suffering together at the hands of the Aunts and the Commanders. After all, enforced isolation by way of anonymity keeps the handmaids from bonding, and potentially from uprising.
Even in Little America, the identities of the dead remain unknown, tucked away in drawers and drawers of files. Luke knows in his heart, he says, that June is still alive. But Moira needs proof that her own partner — the glamorous OB/GYN who helped Moira through a surrogate pregnancy — is gone, and so she combs through page after page of photos of dead bodies, looking for the familiar face. It's great to give Samira Wiley more screen time — I'd watch her watch paint dry — but this backstory felt shoehorned in. Why haven't we heard more about Moira's relationship? How did the refugee center get ahold of all those photos of dead bodies that lay strewn across pavement in another country with closed borders? Why is Moira's surrogacy handled by the OB/GYN, and why is the baby handed over at 3 months old in the doctor's office? Yes, this story line helps us understand how Gilead knew Moira was fertile, and yes, it adds an intriguing dimension to see a woman willingly give up a baby, but beyond that the story feels like mushy filler.
Commander Pryce, the man who recruited Nick and who promised to have him relocated last episode, is dead as well, which leaves a gaping power vacuum at the top. Pryce ran the Eyes and chaired the Council, which made governing decisions in Gilead. And as an early member of the Sons of Jacob, the religious fringe group that carried out the coup against the American government, he held an unmatched place at the top of the pecking order. With Commander Waterford injured, dipping in and out of consciousness in yet another hospital room that appears ready for its Dwell cover shoot, Cushing (who is, as you might remember, a real dick) steps into Pryce's old role.
The bodies the handmaids see hanging from trees, along with the Marthas being shot in the street, and the speeding Guardian vehicles blaring down the streets, are Cushing's handiwork. Not much one for subtlety, he sees an uprising and — having apparently never read a thing about how NOT to run a dictatorship — tries to quash it with sheer brute force.

Syracuse wing Tyus Battle will withdraw from the NBA draft and return to school for his junior season, sources told ESPN.
Battle averaged 19.2 points per game last season but was considered by most NBA executives as a second-round pick. He had worked out for the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday along with a number of other NBA prospects.
The deadline for college underclassmen to withdraw from the NBA draft is Wednesday at midnight ET.
Battle's return is huge for coach Jim Boeheim and the Orange, who finished 23-14 last season and were 8-10 in ACC play but advanced to the Sweet 16 after knocking off Michigan State.
Syracuse will return its top three scorers from last season: Battle, talented freshman Oshae Brissett and guard Franklin Howard. Big men Paschal Chukwu and Marek Dolezaj will also be back, and the Orange will bring in wing Jalen Carey (ESPN, No. 36) and Boeheim's son Buddy, who is one of the top shooters in the incoming freshman class. East Carolina transfer Elijah Hughes sat out last season, and the 6-foot-6 wing is eligible this year.

A single dose of testosterone steers men towards luxury brands of cars, watches, pens, or clothes which, like stag anglers and peacock tails, signal "status" to the female gender, scientists said on Tuesday.
The sex hormone, it turns out, is a major influencer of male consumer behaviour, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications.
"This is likely because testosterone plays a role in behaviours that relate to social rank (in animals), and owning status products is a strategy to signal one's rank within human social hierarchies," study co-author Gideon Nave of the University of Pennsylvania told AFP.
Studies have already established that humans use consumer goods to exhibit social status. But the role of hormones was unknown.
Nave and a team recruited 243 men aged 18 to 55 for a trial. Some were given a dose of testosterone, applied to the skin in gel form, while others received a placebo or "dummy" dose.
They were then asked to choose between two products — of similar quality but one boasting a trademark considered high status — a judgement determined in a previous survey of over 600 men.
"We found that the men who received testosterone showed greater preference towards the high status brands," said Nave.
The effect, he added, "is akin to behaviour of non-human animals, where testosterone typically rises during the breeding season and promotes the display of traits that signal the organism's fitness to potential competitors and mates," he added.
Do the findings imply that women have a preference for men who drive a Ferrari or wear a Rolex?
"The use of brands to signal status does not necessarily have to 'work', it's enough that the men believe that it works," said Nave.
The team noted that the products associated with status would differ between cultures.

Nokia said its chief operating officer will leave the telecom network equipment maker, which is struggling in the face of a shrinking market and tough competition, after just eight months in the job.
COO Monika Maurer will be replaced by Joerg Erlemeier, currently a senior vice president for Nokia Transformation, effective immediately, the Finnish company said on Monday.
Maurer was promoted to group COO in April, from COO of fixed networks, after Nokia's head of mobile networks Samih Elhage announced his departure from the company and the group said it would break out services as a distinct business group from mobile networks.
“Monika Maurer... will support Erlemeier during a transition period and then leave Nokia to pursue new opportunities outside the company,” Nokia said in a statement, without elaborating.
The telecom network equipment industry is going through the toughest part of a decade-long cycle, as demand for 4G and older 2G and 3G network equipment subsides, while demand for next-generation 5G networks remains a few years away.
Nokia shares lost almost a fifth of their value after the company in October reported a sharp drop in earnings citing weak overall market and internal problems following its 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent.
Nokia shares were down 0.6 percent in early trade.
President Donald Trump wants to send man back to the moon — and on to Mars.
Trump is signing a space policy directive directing NASA "to lead an innovative space exploration program to send American astronauts back to the moon, and eventually Mars."
That's according to White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.
Trump has taken several steps to refocus NASA's mission on space exploration.
He'll sign the directive at the White House Monday.
During a recent meeting of the LeChee Chapter's Voter Rights Coalition the talk got around to Chris Clark Deschene.
That is not surprising since the VRC sprang to life during the tumultuous 2014 Navajo Nation presidential election where Deschene, from LeChee, and a Page H.S. graduate, was a central figure.
The question on everyone's mind seemed to be: will he or won't he?
The talk fell along familiar lines according to Bernice Austin-Begay. Some people thought he might run again for president in 2018, while others figured he would stay in Washington, D.C. where he was a good job with a prestigious law firm, Austin-Begay said.
In a crowded presidential primary field in 2014 Deschene – who holds degrees in engineering and law – surprised many people with a strong second-place finish, trailing behind only former Navajo president Joe Shirley, Jr.
It looked like it was going to be a run-off between Shirley and Deschene.
But, then, two of the losing candidates filed an appeal, claiming that Deschene didn't meet the tribal requirement that the president must be fluent in the Navajo language.
Deschene made several contradictory statements, including that he was currently in the process of learning the language.
When the Office of Hearings and Appeals arranged for Deschene to take a test to demonstrate his proficiency in the language, the candidate refused to participate. With no other option, the OHA disqualified Deschene, removing him from the ballot. He was replaced by third-place primary finisher Russell Begaye.
Months long legal wrangling ensued, with the Navajo Nation Supreme Court upholding the OHA's decision – and eventually removing the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors when it refused to comply with the court's order.
In an unprecedented move President Ben Shelly – who finished a dismal seventh in the 2014 primary – remained in office after his term had ended, until a new election could be held. Six months later Begaye easily defeated Shirley to become the Nation's president.
As part of the brouhaha the VRC was formed, operating in numerous chapters, to support Deschene's candidacy and to change the fluency requirement.
Some of the Navajo Nation Council delegates also sought to amend the fluency requirement and find other ways to include Deschene on the ballot – including allowing for a write-in candidate.
However the court denied those efforts.
Even after the 2014 election went ahead – in 2015 – the VRC turned its efforts to impeaching Navajo Supreme Court Chief Justice Herb Yazzie, who eventually retired shortly after Begaye took office.
Since then the Navajo Code has been amended to let the voters decide whether a candidate is fluent or not.
That has led to speculation that Deschene might choose to run again.
But even before the presidential election was finally held, Deschene had accepted a role with the federal Department of Energy, heading the Office of Indian Energy.
Since then Deschene has left the private sector and now works on Indian energy as a partner in the Rossette law firm's Washington office.
Deschene was interested in joining the firm because leader Robert Rossette has a fundamental belief in supporting tribes and their sovereignty.
Deschene plans to continuing working to educate tribal leaders and professionals on opportunities in the energy field.
Lake Powell Communications has reached-out to Mr. Deschene for comment on this story.
Despite their efforts, Waterloo Regional Police were not able to stop a massive St. Patrick's Day party from forming on Ezra Street by Wilfrid Laurier University.

“Our officers responded to several very dangerous and unsafe incidents throughout the day and into the evening,” said police chief Bryan Larkin.
“Over the next several months we will be meeting with our community partners to discuss how we move forward in terms of shutting down this unsanctioned, unlawful and unsafe gathering.”
Police said officers responded to 248 calls in the area, resulting in 619 charges being laid.
62 under the Highway Traffic Act
435 under the Liquor Licence Act
16 under the Criminal Code of Canada
45 bylaw offences
50 under the Trespass to Property Act
Five under the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act

It's a substantial increase from last year, when 197 charges were laid on St. Patrick's Day.
In the days leading up to Saturday's party, several steps were taken to prevent the party from happening, including recruiting officers from Peel Region, giving bylaw officers more power, and going door-to-door to warn students who live in the area of the fines they might face.
“We have said from day one that we want attendees to have a good time, but we want them to have a safe time,” Larkin said. “This is a major public safety concern.”

Kevin Petendra with the Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services said they also saw an increased demand for service throughout the day and transported 40 patients to hospital.
“Twelve patients transported were in critical or serious condition, all related to alcohol and substance misuse,” Petendra said.
By-law officers responded to 143 calls and laid 35 charges for public nuisance. Officers also cleared 15 properties due to large crowds.
Waterloo Fire had 40 calls throughout the day. Nine of them were for activated alarms and 24 for medical issues.

It's not known yet how much this latest St. Patrick's Day part will cost police.
Meanwhile, Guelph police said there were no major incidents from any St. Patrick's Day parties. Officers stopped about 350 vehicles as part of RIDE check and did not lay any alcohol-related charges.
The governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has succumbed to pressure of the division rocking the party over its presidential candidates between President Mutharika and Vice President Saulos Chilima, therefore the much awaited convention has been set for June this year.
Therefore all positions including that of the presidency are up for grabs.
In a press statement dated May 30, 2018 and made available to The Maravi Post, DPP secretary general Grezeldar Jeffrey said the exact date for the convention will be announced by the chairperson of the convention in due course.
DPP SG Jeffrey Confirmed in a telephone interview saying the indaba will be held in Blantyre at a venue yet to be verified.
“Yes I confirm to have issued the statement, but the actual date for the convention will be announced by the chairperson of the convention in due course. All seats are variable and will be competed for,” confirmed Jeffrey.
DPP last held its convection on April 17, 2013 with Peter Mutharika coming out as the party's torch bearer for the 2014 elections after beating his only contender Henry Chimunthu Banda.
However, according to article 8, point 4 of the DPP convention, the party is expected to hold a National Political Conference (Convention) after every two years or an extra ordinary one in between at the request of the National Governing Council (NGC).
There have been concerns from some quarters in the party over the delay by the executive to call for the convention with some accusing the party's executive members of operating illegally as their two-year term had expired.
The convention announcement also comes amid divisions in the governing party as some have openly opposed the candidature of incumbent president Mutharika at the convention and opted for the automatic takeover of vice president Saulos Chilima as the party's torch bearer in next year's elections while another section wants Mutharika to continue at the helm.
The later camp has through the media threatened to block the Chilima camp from attending the convention.
Article 8, point 4 of the DPP Constitution National stipulates that a National Political Conference shall consist of all members of the NGC, Regional Committee Members, District Committee Members and nine dully accredited delegates from each constituency drawn from the main committee, the Women's Committee and the Youth Committee.
The set convention will be the third this year after that of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) which were marred by conflicts.
The United Democratic Party (UDF) and the People's Party (PP) are yet to announce dates for their conventions.
The Republican-led Senate has voted to block an Obama-era regulation that would prevent an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm.
The 57-to-43 vote to revoke the regulation now sends the measure to President Trump, who is expected to sign it.
The Obama administration rule strengthened the federal background check system by requiring the Social Security Administration to include the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party to manage their benefits.
But some critics said the rule was too broad and unfairly stigmatized the disabled. With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively to rescind several late Obama administration regulations.
China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically on trade and vowed Wednesday to fight back if Washington goes ahead with a threatened tariff hike.
A foreign ministry spokeswoman complained the U.S. decision to renew a threat to raise duties on a $50 billion list of Chinese goods conflicts with an agreement in mid-May aimed at settling that dispute. Treasury Steven Mnuchin said then that the conflict was "on hold" after Beijing promised to buy more U.S. goods to help narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
The spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, declined to say whether Tuesday's announcement might disrupt plans for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to visit Beijing for talks starting Saturday. The Commerce Ministry didn't respond to questions about the status of the meeting, but the American Embassy said a delegation of trade, agriculture and treasury officials had arrived in the Chinese capital to make preparations.
Hua gave no indication of whether Beijing planned to act on its own threat to retaliate by raising duties on a $50 billion list of American goods including beef and soybeans.
"Every flip-flop and U-turn of a country will be simply depleting and squandering its own credibility," Hua said at a regular briefing.
"We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of ones. We will fight back," she said. "We will definitely take forceful measures to defend our legitimate interests."
The White House announcement said it also would impose curbs on Chinese investment and purchases of high-tech exports.
Asian financial markets tumbled on renewed worries about a U.S.-Chinese trade spat. China's main market index fell 2.5 percent and Japan's benchmark lost 1.5 percent.
The White House's latest tariff action focuses on advanced technologies, including those such as robots and electric cars that China has said it wants to develop under its "Made in China 2025" program. The White House said a list of products would be announced June 15.
Trump's surprise announcement reflects his frustration at criticism of his earlier deal with Beijing, Eurasia analysts said in a report. They said he appears less concerned that he needs Chinese support for his proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
"Trump is going on offense, reverting to his earlier instincts on China and re-empowering the trade hawks in his Cabinet," Eurasia Group said. "This dynamic makes it likely that both tariffs and investment restrictions will go into effect."
The American Chamber of Commerce in China said companies are uneasy about the threat of export and investment controls but see them as a possible way to make progress on longstanding complaints about market access and investment curbs.
As a result of Trump's tariff threat, Washington is in very intense negotiations with Beijing "in a way that we haven't been for so many years," said the chamber chairman, William Zarit. He said companies hope Beijing can be persuaded to "level the playing field" by easing curbs on foreign investment and business activity in its state-dominated economy.
"I wouldn't say we are in favor of, specifically, export controls, investment restrictions," Zarit said at a news conference. But he said American companies want equal treatment, "and this seems to be one of the ways to do that."
Also Wednesday, the Chinese Cabinet announced it planned to complete work by July 1 on another measure sought for years by its trading partners — a "negative list" that would make clear what is off-limits to foreign investment, leaving the rest of the economy open.
Foreign companies are frustrated by a system that requires them to wait for Chinese regulators to declare individual lines of business open to them.
Trump has focused on pressing Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the United States, but Zarit said American companies see other issues as higher priorities.
As Chinese companies expand abroad, the United States, Europe and other trading partners are pressing Beijing to ease controls that keep their companies out of industries including banking, insurance, telecoms and health care.
"China's success means that it can no longer credibly defend protectionist policies on the grounds that it is still a 'developing country,'" the American chamber said in a report Wednesday.
The tariff threat is a "very powerful" negotiating tactic, said Lester Ross, chairman of the American chamber's policy committee. However, he said tariffs are a tax on American consumers and a blunt tool to address "very complex problems that hamper trade and investment relationships."
Analysts in the United States suggested the newly confrontational stance also might be aimed at appeasing congressional critics of a deal the Trump administration made Friday that allowed Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. to stay in business.
ZTE agreed to remove its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine. That would be on top of a $1 billion penalty ZTE paid for selling high-tech equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.
In return, the Commerce Department lifted a seven-year ban on ZTE's purchase of U.S. components that it imposed earlier in May. Trump said last month the ban threatened too many Chinese jobs and he wanted to get the company back in business.
Chinese leaders have promised piecemeal trade-related changes including allowing full foreign ownership in their auto industry by 2022.
However, American companies have "major concerns" about unfair conditions, and the recent moves haven't done enough to alleviate those concerns, said the American chamber's Ross.
European companies also complain they are blocked from acquiring most assets in China while Chinese companies are on a global buying spree.

We're all witness to a pair of no-brainer moves out of Los Angeles.
The Rams on Tuesday picked up running back Todd Gurley's fifth-year option. The club did the same with traded-for cornerback Marcus Peters, the Rams announced. Both players are now under contract with the Rams through 2019.
Gurley's $9.63 million option is worth every penny. The 23-year-old runner roared back to life last season under new coach Sean McVay, rumbling for a career-best 1,305 yards and 13 scores.
Gurley was equally dangerous through the air, hauling in a team-leading 64 passes for 788 yards and another six touchdowns. An obvious selection for Offensive Player of the Year, Gurley -- the 10th overall pick of the 2015 draft -- remains the beating heart of this Los Angeles attack.
Peters isn't leaving town anytime soon, either. Acquired from the Chiefs in exchange for a 2018 fourth-round pick and a 2019 second-rounder, the 25-year-old cover man looms as a plug-and-play starter across from fellow Rams cornerback Aqib Talib.
Exercising these options won't preclude general manager Les Snead from pursuing a long-term extension for either player. Gurley, especially, looms as a proven centerpiece for a Rams team imbued with Super Bowl dreams.
Britain's film academy has expelled movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, after suspending him last year over sexual misconduct allegations.
The academy, known as BAFTA, said Friday that "following the suspension of Harvey Weinstein's BAFTA membership in October 2017, BAFTA has formally terminated his membership, effective immediately."
The academy said that although it had benefited from Weinstein's support for its charitable work, his alleged behavior was "completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values."
Police in the United States and Britain are investigating allegations of rape and sexual assault against Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most powerful players.
Scores of women, including well-known actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment. He has been fired by the film company he founded with his brother Bob and expelled from Hollywood's movie academy.
The changing of the guard at Goldman Sachs — and with it, the prospect of the US banking giant retreating from fixed income trading — sent tremors through its London office last week.
The first ripples came in the form of a frantic rush of news. It began March 9 with a report that CEO Lloyd Blankfein would step down by 2019, and accelerated the following Monday when the bank announced that Harvey Schwartz, co-president and co-COO, was stepping down, leaving his counterpart David Solomon as the lead contender for the top job.

In a last-minute decision, Kanye West decided to use a photo of Whitney Houston's drug-strewn bathroom on the cover of Pusha-T's new “Daytona” album, which was released Friday and which West produced. In a statement released by ET, a rep for Houston's estate said they are “extremely disappointed in Kanye's choice” to use the photo. “Even in Whitney's death, we see that no one is exempt from the harsh realities of the world,” the statement continues.
According to Pusha, West paid $85,000 out of his own pocket to license the photo, which was taken in Houston's Atlanta home in 2006 after an alleged drug binge. Pusha told radio host Angie Martinez Thursday that West changed the artwork at the very last minute.
“He changed my artwork last night at 1 a.m. He wasn't feeling it,” Pusha told Martinez. “The [original] artwork — it was pictures that we all agreed on. He picked the photographer, I took these pictures, I was like, ‘Yo, these are fresh.' I picked all of these pictures out, he had a little edit to it, how he wanted the actual grading of the picture to look. Picked the picture, great, we look, boom, boom, boom, it's good.”
The image has been altered slightly from its original rendition, which appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer and was released to the public after Houston's death in 2012: a beer can have been removed, presumably for copyright reasons.
Editor's note: NFL.com analyst and former NFL scout Daniel Jeremiah of the Move The Sticks Podcast shares some of his scouting notes, including:
» A player projection for each of the 2018 NFL Draft picks that changed hands in a blockbuster weekend trade
But first, we kick off this week's notebook with Jeremiah's look at how this year's group of quarterback prospects stacks up against the top QB talents that have entered the league in the previous two drafts.
* * *
I always believe it's helpful during the evaluation process to rank the current group of prospects among the players at the position from the previous two drafts. I recently looked up the grades I gave to the quarterbacks in the '16 and '17 draft classes and I slotted them in with this year's crop of talent. Here's the order I have them in based on their draft grade.
1) Sam Darnold, USC
Draft class: 2018
The skinny: I had very similar draft grades on each of the top four players on this list. However, I gave Darnold a slightly higher grade than Carson Wentz because of his durability and level of competition from college.
2) Carson Wentz, North Dakota State
Draft class: 2016; second overall pick, Philadelphia Eagles
The skinny: Wentz had an ideal skill set coming out of NDSU. His ability to drive the ball accurately and create with his legs made him a special prospect.
3) Josh Rosen, UCLA
Draft class: 2018
The skinny: Rosen is the best pure passer in this time frame (2016-2018). His motion, footwork and arm talent are off the charts.
4) Jared Goff, Cal
Draft class: 2016; first overall pick, Los Angeles Rams
The skinny: Goff was very smooth and accurate at Cal. He was an effortless thrower and you've seen that carry over to the NFL.
5) Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma
Draft class: 2018
The skinny: Mayfield is the shortest member of this group (measured in at 6-foot 5/8 and 215 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine), but I gave him a strong grade based on his touch, playmaking ability and toughness.
6) Josh Allen, Wyoming
Draft class: 2018
The skinny: Allen was an inconsistent performer at Wyoming, but his good moments are incredibly impressive. He is very capable of outplaying my draft grade.
7) Deshaun Watson, Clemson
Draft class: 2017; 12th overall pick, Houston Texans
The skinny: I had Watson as my highest-rated quarterback in last year's class, but based on early returns, I was way too low with my grade. I had concerns with his accuracy and decision making, but he cleaned up both areas last fall. He was off to a remarkable start as a rookie before suffering an ACL tear in November.
8) Mitchell Trubisky, North Carolina
Draft class: 2017; second overall pick, Chicago Bears
The skinny: I loved Trubisky's talent, but he had a very small sample size of production. He was a full-time starter for only one year at UNC, but his upside was tremendous.
9) DeShone Kizer, Notre Dame
Draft class: 2017; 52nd overall pick (Round 2), Cleveland Browns
The skinny: I had a big grade on Kizer heading into his final year at Notre Dame, but he struggled mightily to maintain that level of play. I ended up dropping his grade prior to the 2017 draft and he landed in a really tough spot in Cleveland. He was rushed into action before he was ready to play, and the results weren't pretty. Now, he's getting a fresh start after being traded to the Green Bay Packers earlier this month.
10) Paxton Lynch, Memphis
Draft class: 2016; 26th overall pick, Denver Broncos
The skinny: Lynch was a polarizing player coming out of Memphis. His size, arm talent and athleticism were enticing, but I had concerns about the adjustment he would have to make from his college offense to an NFL system.
MATCHING PROSPECTS TO PICKS INVOLVED IN COLTS-JETS TRADE
The Jets' move up the draft board in a trade with the Colts created quite a buzz over the weekend. The Jets clearly have three players in this draft that they love. They would not have given up so much draft capital if that wasn't the case. In order to acquire the third overall pick, they parted with the sixth, 37th and 49th overall selections in this year's draft and they also included their second-round pick for next year.
I expect them to come away with their quarterback of the future, while the Colts will be able to stockpile players in their rebuilding process. Let's put some potential names to these picks in order to get a better feel for the cost/benefit of the move. This is one scenario that could play out:
JETS GET
Pick No. 3 in 2018 draft: Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA
COLTS GET
Pick No. 6 in 2018 draft: Bradley Chubb, DE, N.C. State
Pick No. 37 in 2018 draft: Tyrell Crosby, OT, Oregon
Pick No. 49 in 2018 draft: Lorenzo Carter, LB, Georgia
Second-round pick in 2019 draft: TBD
I think this could end up being a win/win for both teams. While the Jets did give up four potential starters by trading away those picks, coming away with a quarterback capable of leading your franchise for a decade is a definite win.
For the Colts, this is a chance to add some much-needed talent to their front seven on defense and offensive line. There is also the possibility that the Colts will use one or more of these picks to move around on draft day to secure the players they covet. This will be fun to follow.

The Texas A&M women are a week away from their 2017-18 season opener. They'll kick things off with a pair of dual meets on the road, traveling to South bend, Indiana to battle Notre Dame (October 13) and Michigan State (October 14). The following week, they have their first SEC dual meet of the season on the road against the Auburn Tigers.
The Aggies' first home meet of the season features a top-5 matchup with in-state rival Texas. The meet will take place on November 3, and will be their last competition before their mid-season focus meet. On November 16-18, they host their annual Art Adamson Invitational, which will serve as a chance to qualify for NCAAs early on. After the invite, the Aggies will travel to Houston to face another in-state rival, Rice, on December 2.
After about a month of winter training, Texas A&M begins 2018 with an SEC dual meet against Missouri at home on January 6. They'll hit the road again on January 10 to battle SMU before heading to the Arena Pro Swim in Austin from January 12-14. Their final dual meet of the season will be an SEC matchup with LSU on the road.
The postseason begins with the SEC Championships from February 14-18, which will be hosted by the Aggies this season. They'll look to defend their title after securing back-to-back wins last season. The only remaining meet on the schedule before NCAAs is the Speedo Sectionals meet from March 1-4. Qualifiers will make the trip to Columbus, Ohio from March 14-17 as the team looks to challenge for another top 3 finish. Last season, they hit a program-high 3rd place finish.
TEXAS A&M 2017-18 WOMEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING SCHEDULE:
LOS ANGELES — Despite repeated admonitions from the Trump administration and the possibility of losing federal funds, Gov. Jerry Brown Thursday signed “sanctuary state” legislation authored by a Los Angeles lawmaker that limits local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
“This bill states that local authorities will not ask about immigration status during routine interactions,” Brown said in a message explaining his decision to sign Senate Bill 54. “It also bans unconstitutional detainer requests and prohibits the commandeering of local officials to do the work of immigration agents.”
But Brown also stressed what the bill “does not do.”
“This bill does not prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way,” he said. “They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California. Moreover, the bill does not prohibit sheriffs from granting immigration authorities access to California jails to conduct routine interviews, nor does it prevent cooperation in deportation proceedings for anyone in state prison or for those in local jails for any of the hundreds of serious offenses listed in the TRUST Act.
“These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety, while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day,” he said.
California Senate President pro Tem Kevin De Leon hailed Brown for signing the legislation, officially known as the California Values Act.
“The California Values Act will limit immigration enforcement actions at public schools, hospitals and courthouses where all California residents should feel safe, regardless of immigration status,” he said. “I want to thank Governor Brown for his engagement on SB 54 and his understanding of its importance to the millions of California residents it seeks to protect.”
He said the measure “won't stop ICE from trolling our streets — it will not provide full sanctuary — but it will put a kink in (President Donald) Trump's perverse and inhumane deportation machine.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has warned that the federal government could withhold federal grant funds from “sanctuary jurisdictions” that limit local agencies' work with immigration agents, although Sessions' threat has been challenged in court and temporarily stalled by a federal judge.
Some law enforcement organizations had opposed the legislation, but at least one — the California Police Chiefs Association — removed its opposition and took a neutral position after the bill's language was amended in September.
In Los Angeles, home to more undocumented immigrants than any other city in California, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck supported the bill, but county Sheriff Jim McDonnell opposed it, although his stance softened when the bill was recently amended.
Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens criticized the legislation, saying restrictions on the ability to communicate with federal authorities “will hinder current collaborative efforts to remove serious offenders from our community.”
“This law is inconsistent with widely accepted best practices of open communication amongst all levels of law enforcement,” Hutchens said. “… The new law prohibits certain communications, but not all cooperation is restricted. The Orange County Sheriff's Department remains committed to cooperating fully with federal authorities in all areas where the sheriff has discretion. The department's objective is to work with federal authorities to remove serious offenders from our community.”
Xiaomi is celebrating its 8th-anniversary today in Shenzen, China and one of its most anticipated announcements for the day is the latest version of its custom user interface, MIUI 10.
MIUI 10, as its pre-launch teasers hinted, has been geared towards making the interface across Xiaomi devices respond quicker, while also ensuring that users make the most of the large displays to the fullest. While most of the changes are under the hood, major noticeable changes with MIUI 10 include a new recents tab, a software-based AI portrait mode, the introduction of AI preload to reduce app load times and a new hub to manage all of Xiaomi home devices.
Now, we are yet to hear from Xiaomi as to when should we expect MIUI 10 to arrive and on which smartphones but here's a breakdown of the major changes with MIUI 10 and what we know about them so far.
Recent apps tab
One of the major design changes with MIUI 10 seems to be the new recent apps menu which no longer follows the iOS-inspired card stack design. Xiaomi has introduced a new design which allows you to view your recent apps in two rows, which the company believes, will maximize screen space and let you do much more than just switching between apps.
Xiaomi has thrown in full-screen gestures which users can use to swipe away apps like they did earlier or long press to view more options such as opening it in multi-window mode or locking the app so that it remains open in the background.
AI Portraits
This has to one of the most interesting additions with MIUI 10. Xiaomi is known to roll out updates for most of its older devices but the latest UI update will essentially let every Xiaomi smartphone user take portrait shots with a shallow focus.
This feature will work regardless of whether users have a dual camera setup on their smartphone or a single camera setup, courtesy of AI. This might sound like a bit too much but Xiaomi shared a few results from their older smartphones like the Mi 5 and the Mi Note 2 and they do look impressive at first glance.
AI Preload
Just like a lot of other technology companies out there, AI seems to be the buzzword for Xiaomi as well this year. MIUI 10 will use artificial intelligence to look into users'app usage behaviour and try to predict which app may be used next, to reduce app load times.
We are yet to see for ourselves how this feature works and whether it has any ill-effects on RAM or battery life, but this too is an interesting addition from Xiaomi.
In April, we reported that the Kansas State High School Activities Association Board of Directors had approved proposals from the Classification Committee on reclassifying high school activities in the State of Kansas. The only thing left in the process for reclassification to be put into effect was a vote from all member schools in Kansas. A memo and a ballot were mailed to those member schools on May 3, and the results were announced on Wednesday by KSHSAA. For the proposal to reclassify member schools in 4A, 3A, 2A and 1A in football, 215 schools voted in favor and 73 schools opposed. For the proposal to reclassify member schools in all activities except football, 207 schools voted yes, while 145 schools voted no. The majority vote in each case means that both proposals have been approved.
For football, the reclassification will be effective with the September 2017 football classifications which will be instated for competition in the 2018-19 football cycle. For all other activities, reclassification will be effective with the September 2018 classifications for competition in the 2018-19 school year.
Digging deeper into the numbers, it would probably come as no surprise that the biggest percentage of “no” votes for reclassifying in all activities other than football came from the 1A schools. In the new classifications, there would be 36 schools in 6A, 36 in 5A, 36 in 4A, 64 in 3A, 64 in 2A, and based on the number of approved schools in the 2016-17 school year, that would leave 117 in 1A. Of the 96 schools that voted in Class 1A, 65 opposed, with 44 saying no and 21 abstaining. The only other class that had more “no” votes than “yes” votes was 6A, which was 14 yes's and 18 no's.
In the football vote, only classes 4A through 1A voted, as they were the only one's affected. Every class had at least double the amount of “yes” votes to “no” votes. 1A was 64-32, 2A 51-13, 3A 52-12 and 4A 48-16. The new football system will now have 32 schools in 6A, 5A and 4A, 48 in 3A and 2A, and 1A will again be a separate class with the remaining 11-man schools competing. As has been the case in the past, 8-Man football will split their schools into two divisions. In the case of an odd number, Division I would have the extra school.
We hope to talk with some AD's and coaches that these changes will affect in the coming days on KD Country 94 & Z 96.3 Sports.
The Amateur Radio volunteers on the ground in Puerto Rico continue to provide assistance in a number of areas. Amateur Radio resources have been reallocated around the island to better meet communications needs.
Volunteer Valerie Hotzfeld, NV9L, and a FEMA team member were tasked with calling 68 hospitals and medical facilities. They asked a series of 12 questions geared toward obtaining a better understanding of each facility's communication capabilities, and to see if urgent care supplies and needs were being met.
Gary Sessums, KC5QCN, the Amateur Radio liaison to the ESF-2 Communications Task Force, coordinated the installation of a VHF Amateur Radio repeater on a mountain peak in El Yunque National Forest. The repeater now gives radio coverage to approximately 60% of Puerto Rico, and also extends radio coverage into the US Virgin Islands.
Andy Anderson, KEØAYJ, is stationed at the Guajataca Dam, providing communications support to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica) between their control facility and the dam as the water levels are lowered to prevent the dam from collapsing.
Safe and Well data collection continues at Red Cross shelters, and in reunification work that involves going out into areas that have no communication. Hams are engaged in setting up equipment and entering data into the Red Cross Safe and Well website. Hams also facilitate survivors' access to cell or satellite phones so they can call a loved one to let them know they are safe.
Reunification team officials have expressed that hams have become invaluable to the team, not only performing communications duties, but also having become proficient in multiple skill sets for the Red Cross. Ham radio volunteers are acting as navigators, reunification workers, and anything else that is needed. To date, they have completed 60 reunifications.
Donations to the response effort continue, with EPCOM (El Paso Communications Systems) donating 40 Icom IC-F3001 handheld radios, and the Yasme Foundation providing an Amateur Radio repeater that will be installed at the Arecibo Observatory to provide SAR communications.
Morningside football coach Steve Ryan is a believer in team building activities. This summer Ryan and the Mustang seniors went to Colorado to prepare for the new season.
“We want to make playing football at Morningside an incredible life-changing experience and that is not just only on the football field”, said Ryan. “It gives the guys a chance to go on a little adventure and climb a 14,000 foot mountain in Colorado and just do something that a lot of the guys have not done.”
The plan has been working and the Mustangs have become a perennial power. They enter the new season ranked fourth in the pre-season NAIA Poll and are favored to win a seventh straight Great Plains Athletic Conference championship.
The biggest mountain, however, remains unconquered. Despite 13 straight playoff appearances the Mustangs are still in search of their first national championship. A challenging non-conference slate may boost their post season hopes. Morningside hosts NCAA division two Truman State in week three and opens with a visit to Saint Francis of Illinois out of the Mid-States Football Association.
“Many of our runs in the playoffs have come to an end playing Mid-States teams such as Marian and Saint Francis so we feel it is a really important game just to get us going from a physical standpoint”, added Ryan. “Truman State won their conference last year and should have been in the playoffs at 8-3 as a division two team. It will be a real test.”
Trent Solsma returns for his junior season at quarterback. The former Sioux City Heelan standout passed for nearly 3,300 yards and 32 touchdowns in 2016 and star receiver Connor Niles returns after being injured in the 2016 season opener. Niles led the NAIA ranks in all-purpose yards in 2015.
Council chiefs are putting the heat on the Government for a fairer funding deal after revealing the multi-million pound pressures facing Hartlepool.
Hartlepool Borough Council bosses say future cuts won't come from drastically reducing services in town - because there's none spare to cut.
Hartlepool Civic Centre.
Instead, it's time for the Government to step up and look at fairer funding for towns like Hartlepool, said the town's council leader Coun Christopher Akers-Belcher and authority chief executive Gill Alexander.
In an interview with the Hartlepool Mail, they revealed the intense pressure on the council.
• The revenue support grant has been slashed from around £40million to £21million since 2013;
• The whole of the council's budget has gone down from just under £100million to £81million;
We are probably, over the next two years, facing something like a £6million pressure on our budget and you cant take £6million out of £12million and not do damage Gill Alexander
• Out of that £81million, £69million of it goes on essential services;
• And there's likely to be a £6million pressure on existing budgets in the next two years;
• The council is also trying to find £2.5million extra because of rising pressures on authorities over child social care (including children being taken into protection).
All this is facing a council which is the second smallest unitary authority in the country, said Gill Alexander.
Out of an £81million budget, “£69 million is services that we must provide,” she said.
“They are services such as adult social care packages, packages of support around children in need, services like picking up the bins, and lighting the streets.”
She said only £12million was on services “where we have some choices over.
“There is very little left now.
“We are probably, over the next two years, facing something like a £6million pressure on our budget and you cant take £6million out of £12million and not do damage.
“It is about the need for a fairer funding model nationally which I think is going to be a big priority for Christopher and myself next year, to continue with that national debate and pushing for that national debate on proper and fair funding.”
A solution, she said, could not be found in massive cuts to services because ”we have not got the services left any more to cut.”
Child social care, she added, was “a national problem”.
Nationally, the Local Government Association is forecasting a £2billion shortfall in local government funding over it. “In Hartlepool, we have seen a 40 percent increase in the amount of money we are having to spend on making sure that children are protected and cared for if they have taken into care.”
But it's not the only threat. All councils have had a significant cut in their revenue support grant and the government was expecting councils to bridge that gap through Council Tax, said the Hartlepool officials.
“In some areas which are rich, which have large numbers of properties in the higher end for Council Tax, a one per cent increase on their Council Tax will generate more money than it would for Hartlepool per head of population,” said Gill Alexander.
The biggest single challenge, she said though, was one which the council was not able to predict three years ago.
“We would not be facing the kind of pressure that we were facing if it had not been for the significant increase in the pressures we are facing in terms of children who are in need of protection, or sadly who have had to be taken into care.”
She said the problem was a national one but it was “particularly acute in Hartlepool.
“As a result of that, we are now facing a £2.5million pressure on our budget and we are not certain where we can get the money from to bridge that gap.”
Coun Akers-Belcher said it would need “something like a 7% increase in Council Tax to bridge the children's social care deficit.”
Gill said: “We can't do that through Council Tax.”
PITTSBURGH — There's a picture next to Antonio Brown's locker featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers star wide receiver and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sharing a laugh. The photo includes a note from Roethlisberger saying "AB, we are unstoppable."
Turns out, there might be one thing that slows down one of the most prolific duos in the NFL: the increasingly viral dustups provided by Brown's antics.
The latest came last Sunday, when Brown took his frustrations out on a water cooler after Roethlisberger failed to see Brown running wide open early in a 26-9 victory over Baltimore. Roethlisberger later likened Brown's outburst to a "temper tantrum," one that forced Brown's teammates to spend a considerable portion of the week not talking about Pittsburgh's 3-1 start but Brown's occasionally divalike behaviour.
Brown knows it needs to stop. Soon.
"It can take away the morale of the group," Brown said Friday. "It can take away the morale of myself. Obviously I don't want (Ben) thinking I'm spazzing out because he does a great job of me getting me the ball and giving me the best chances to make plays. Just got to control my emotions ... and understand I've got an effect on every guy here."
Roethlisberger initially laughed off Brown's mini-meltdown but then went public during his weekly radio shows, chastising the 28-year-old Brown for setting a poor example for the rest of the roster.
"I never want to make the quarterback feel like I'm being a distraction or I've got any negativity toward him," said Brown, who is currently second in the NFL in both receptions and yards receiving heading into Sunday's game against Jacksonville. "He's the guy who gave me the opportunity. He's the guy who's been in my corner since I got here."
Brown's emergence as one of the most prolific receivers of his generation — he's the only player in league history with four consecutive seasons with at least 100 receptions and signed an extension in March that made him the highest-paid wideout in the league — has moved in lock step with his profile, one that has put him under a microscope. He drew a strong rebuke from head coach Mike Tomlin in January for livestreaming from the locker-room following a playoff win in Kansas City. He repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the six-year deal he signed in 2012 well before it expired even though the Steelers have a long-standing policy of not entering into negotiations until the penultimate season of a player's current contract.
"Obviously, I know the position I'm in," Brown said. "I've got to take responsibility and be a representative not only for the Steelers, but myself, my family. I've got to be smart."
Roethlisberger hinted Brown's behaviour had an effect on Brown's production over the course of the game. Brown was held to season lows in both receptions (four) and yards (34) even as Pittsburgh posted its most lopsided victory in Baltimore since the Ravens relocated from Cleveland more than two decades ago. Brown thinks Roethlisberger may have a point.
The smiles were aplenty at the annual Rotary/Easter Seals Christmas party in Peterborough on Sunday morning.
Several dozens children and their families gathered at Peterborough Square for a day of arts and crafts, gingerbread decorating and snowman building.

“This dates back to 47 years ago or so, so Rotary and Easter Seals have a really strong connection,” said Rick Storey with the Rotary Club of Peterborough Kawartha.
Santa Claus also made an appearance to hand out presents to children who are members of Easter Seals, the organization which provides services, programs and equipment for children with with physical and/or mental disabilities.
The Rotary Club says the event is a different kind of community service the organization is known
“We like to build things and reach out and have fun with the community because this is fun,” said Storey.
The children and their families were also treated to a lunch and movie after the party.
A prominent white nationalist website that promoted a Virginia rally that ended in deadly violence Saturday is losing its Internet domain host.
GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it has given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company's terms of service.
The site's labeling of a woman killed in an attack at the event in Charlottesville as “fat” and “childless” prompted the move, according to GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race. Heather Heyer was killed Saturday when police say a man plowed his car into a group of demonstrators protesting the white nationalist rally.
“Given their latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service,” Race said in an emailed statement.
Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down.
As marijuana shops sprout in states that have legalized the drug, they face a crucial stumbling block — lack of access to the kind of routine banking services other businesses take for granted.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is leading an effort to make sure vendors working with legal marijuana businesses, from chemists who test marijuana for harmful substances to firms that provide security, don't have their banking services taken away.
It's part of a wider effort by Warren and others to bring the burgeoning $7-billion marijuana industry in from a fiscal limbo she said forces many shops to rely solely on cash, making them tempting targets for criminals.
After voters in Warren's home state approved a November ballot question to legalize the recreational use of pot, she joined nine other senators in sending a letter to a key federal regulator, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, calling on it to issue additional guidance to help banks provide services to marijuana shop vendors.
Twenty-eight states, including California, have legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use.
Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said there are benefits to letting marijuana-based businesses move away from a cash-only model.
“You make sure that people are really paying their taxes. You know that the money is not being diverted to some kind of criminal enterprise,” Warren said recently. “And it's just a plain old safety issue. You don't want people walking in with guns and masks and saying, `Give me all your cash.“'
A spokesman for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said the agency is reviewing the letter.
There has been some movement to accommodate the banking needs of marijuana businesses.
Two years ago, the U.S. Department of the Treasury gave banks permission to do business with legal marijuana entities under some conditions. Since then, the number of banks and credit unions willing to handle pot money rose from 51 in 2014 to 301 in 2016.
Warren, however, said fewer than 3% of the nation's 11,954 federally regulated banks and credit unions are serving the cannabis industry.
Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Assn., a trade organization for 1,100 marijuana businesses nationwide, said access to banking remains a top concern.
“What the industry needs is a sustainable solution that services the entire industry instead of tinkering around the edges,” Taylor said. “You don't have to be fully in favor of legalized marijuana to know that it helps no one to force these businesses outside the banking system.”
Sam Kamin, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law who studies marijuana regulation, said there's only so much states can do on their own.
“The stumbling block over and over again is the federal illegality,” he said.
The federal government lumps marijuana into the same class of drugs as heroin, LSD and peyote. President Obama's administration has essentially turned a blind eye to state laws legalizing the drug, and supporters of legalizing marijuana hope President-elect Donald Trump will follow suit.
Trump officials did not respond to a request for comment. During the presidential campaign, Trump said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana and has expressed support for medicinal use. But he also has sounded more skeptical about recreational use, and his pick for attorney general, Alabama U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, is a stern critic.
Some people in the marijuana industry say the banking challenges are merely growing pains for an industry evolving from mom-and-pop outlets.
Nicholas Vita, CEO of Columbia Care, one of the nation's largest providers of medical marijuana products, said it's up to marijuana businesses to make sure their financial house is in order.
“It's not just as simple as asking the banks to open their doors,” Vita said. “The industry also needs to develop a set of standards that are acceptable to the banks.”

The AP hired Diaz as a staff photographer two months after the raid, kicking off a 17-year-career with the wire service. Within months of starting, Diaz was taking photos of hanging chads during the Florida recount for the 2000 presidential election. The next year, Diaz flew to New York just days after 9/11, when planes were allowed back in the sky, to help document the recovery. Diaz was in Florida for the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, when storm after storm caused billions in damage across the Southeastern U.S. More recently, he rushed to Orlando, Fla., in 2016 to cover another tragedy, a shooting at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead.
After raising three million dollars at her "One Love Manchester" benefit concert, Ariana Grande will become the first person ever to receive one of the city's highest merits: honorary citizenship.
Just two weeks after the horrific suicide bombing at her Manchester concert on May 22, Grande organized a benefit concert in Manchester to honor the victims and their families. The star-studded event included moving performances by Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and more. Those affected received free admission, while proceeds from the sold-out tickets were donated to the Love Manchester Emergency Fund and the British Red Cross.

"We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May—with love and courage rather than hatred and fear," Sir Richard Leese, leader of the Manchester City Council, told BBC News.
He added, "Ariana Grande exemplified this response. I think many people would already consider her an honorary Mancunian and we would be delighted, if the council approves the proposal, to make it official."
The singer will be one of many honored at an event later this year to recognize the selfless acts following the concert bombing tragedy.
5 Breakthrough Performers from 2016 in Men's Tennis (ATP)
Here are some men's tennis stars who have put themselves on the map for 2017.
@VatsalTolasaria by Vatsal Tolasaria Top 5 / Top 10 02 Jan 2017, 10:24 IST
While tennis might never see a 17-year old Grand Slam champion again, it's finally beginning to look as if it has room for younger players doing well at the top as well.
Despite all these players in their 30's dominating, we've had a spate of youngsters this year who have finally started to realize the potential that they exhibited in the last couple of years or so. Let us take a look at five such breakthrough performers on the ATP Tour this season -
1) Alexander Zverev
The German is regarded by many as the future No. 1
Hailed by experts as the next big thing in tennis,19-year old German Alexander Zverev, also known as "Sascha", has done everything possible to strengthen these claims. Born into a Russian tennis playing family, Zverev stands at a towering height of 6ft 6in already.
While both his parents are former tennis players, Zverev's older brother, Mischa, is an active player on tour, with a career high ranking of 45. With that height, Zverev's game is obviously built around his serve, which tops 125mph most of the time.
But there's more to his game than just the serve. A thunderous backhand and fluid movement makes him a really dangerous prospect. “He is a clear possible future no.1. He has all the shots,” said Rafael Nadal, when once asked about Zverev.
Zverev had a stellar 2016 season, having started the year ranked 83, and finishing at 24.
He thus became the first teenager to finish in the top 25 since Djokovic and Murray in 2006. In October, he achieved his career high rank of 20, becoming the youngest player to enter the ATP top 20 since Djokovic in 2006. The German is also the youngest player in the top 50.
He had four wins against top 10 players this year, with the highlight being beating the great Roger Federer in Halle on grass, a place where Roger loves playing. Zverev also beat Stan Wawrinka in a humdinger of a match to win his first ATP title in St. Petersburg.
His other two top 10 wins were over good friend Dominic Thiem and the experienced Tomas Berdych. “I've had a great year, going from No.84 in the world to No.24,” said Zverev, when asked about what he thought of his performance this year.
Knowing that he has not reached his top physical shape yet, Zverev shut his season down early to extend his pre-season training to work on his strength and other fitness aspects. And with work on that front, one can expect him to wreck havoc in the 2017 season. He starts his season at the Hopman Cup in Australia, where he's going to team up with Andrea Petkovic to represent Germany.
Cape mulch piles pose threat amid brush fire season
More than six months after Hurricane Irma hit Southwest Florida, mulch piles are accumulated in a neighborhood off Santa Barbara Boulevard.
The city hired a contractor to clean up the debris in September.
Cape Coral Residents Stephen Margolin and Ed Conrad agreed the both agreed the mulch piles could be a problem.
“If one were ever to set a fire or something that's going to be a mess,” Conrad said.
Crews worked to extinguish multiple brush fires during the 2017 brush fire season in Cape Coral. One of the fires was near Del Prado Boulevard and Kismet Parkway.
Margolin expressed his concern as fire season gets underway.
“I worked hard for my home,” Margolin said. “I don't want to lose it over a fire you know.”
WINK News reached out to the City of Cape Coral to find out if there are plans to remove leftover piles, but have yet to receive a comment.

O-Train service on Ottawa's Trillium Line has been down Wednesday morning because of vandalism, the city of Ottawa's transit service says.
There's been no movement on the north-south train route since Tuesday morning when OC Transpo first reported a “technical issue.”
In a notice on its website Wednesday morning, OC Transpo said the line remains down due to vandalism and it expects train service to resume later in the morning.
The statement did not provide any further details about the vandalism.

A group of students from the Warsaw University of Technology and the Jagiellonian University in Krakow built an indoor location system for disabled students. They're rolling out the app, created during a local Campus App Challenge/hackathon.
The creators, Łukasz Ławniczak, Jakub Kmiotek, Tomasz Urbaszek, Miron Marczuk, and Szymon Stankiewicz, used a tool called IndoorWay to map and locate users in real time in many of the campus buildings.
“Our app, Indoor Available, automatically loads data from USOS, the university student management information system, so that it will know the individual timetables of all users and will alert them of any changes of rooms or cancelled classes in real time,” said Urbaszek.
The team won the Campus App Challenge and are currently bootstrapping the solution with a Polish coding house, Daftcode. They are looking for seed funding to roll the product out to fifty more schools this year.
“The app is integrated with the most popular university IT system in Poland, so nearly one million students will be able to use it the day it's released,” said Iga Majewska of Daftcode. “Integration with other systems will be possible soon, which opens up the doors to universities worldwide.”
“The students knew that an indoor navigation app for the visually impaired is very important as it tackles real problems their alma mater struggles with,” said Majewska. “An indoor location system already deployed permanently at Warsaw University of Technology made it possible to create a prototype of such app overnight. What's important, however, is that the idea is scalable. The app can be implemented in different kinds of public spaces, such as shopping malls, museums or airports.”
Tennis fans around the world stopped for 81 minutes to watch Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal unite for the first time on the same side of a tennis court. This was the sport's equivalent of a solar eclipse. Thirteen years after their first singles match against each other, Nadal and Federer played their first doubles match together.
Where? At the Laver Cup, which made its debut in September in Prague, and which is likely the closest thing that tennis will ever have to the Ryder Cup in golf. The format was similar — Team Europe took on Team World in a fast-paced, three-day competition — and so was the unusual intensity that format generated. Like their peers in golf, tennis' top male pros made the most of their opportunity to cross national boundaries, root openly for each other, and show the emotions that their formal, individualistic sports normally force them to keep in check.
Federer and Nadal began with a hiccup or two; Nadal nearly decapitated Federer when he reached back for an overhead. But they managed to win that match and to squeak past the much younger Nick Kyrgios and Jack Sock, 11-9 in match tiebreakers, in singles.
In between, they talked tactics, high-fived, laughed, hugged, cheered for each other, and sprayed themselves with champagne when it was over. Nadal and Federer seemed to revel in the chance to try out a new relationship, one where they could put their all-time talents together rather than use them against each other.
Laver Cup showed us there can be something — many things — new under the tennis sun. The best of them was seeing that Nadal and Federer make as much sense as teammates as they do rivals.

A 2000-year-old mosaic of the snake-haired Greek mythological monster Medusa has officially been opened to visitors in Turkey's southwestern province of Burdur.
Located around 100 kilometers out of Burdur city center, the Medusa mosaic is at the heart of the Odeon, an ancient concert hall, in the ancient city of Kibyra.
In an interview with Anadolu Agency, Mehmet Akif Ersoy University (MAKÜ) Archeology Department instructor Şükrü Özüdoğru said that the mosaic was discovered during excavations on the Odeon which took place between 2009 and 2012.
"With this structure showing up, Kibyra became famous because structures like odeons are usually located in bigger ancient cities such as Efes, Miletus or Athens," said Özüdoğru, adding that he believes the Kibyra Odeon to be the largest ancient structure covered by a roof in Turkey.
Sitting in the middle of the Odeon, the Medusa mosaic attracts visitors with its unique thin marble plaques, which is one of a kind according to Özüdoğru.
"This mosaic is one of a kind in terms of its building technique. There is nothing similar to it, not in Italy, nor in Greece, not even in ancient Mesopotamia."
The Medusa mosaic which is estimated to have been built around 1st century A.D. is 95 percent original with only five percent of it reconstructed.
The Odeon itself which has a capacity of 3,600 people is believed to have served as a court, a theater and a parliament.
The Odeon, which has been covered up by restorers for 10 months in order to protect the ancient structure from adverse weather conditions, is only opened to visitors for two months every year.
In Greek mythology, Medusa was a female monster with a disfigured face and venomous snakes on her head in place of hair. According to legends, Medusa's gaze would turn anyone into stone and she was beheaded by Perseus who managed to sneak next to her, hiding behind a reflective shield gifted from the Goddess of Wisdom Athena.
TOLEDO, Ohio (AP)  Ohio's blueprint for combating the algae in Lake Erie that has become a threat to drinking water calls for targeting specific watersheds and developing a monitoring network within the next year.
The strategy  first released last May and finalized just this past week  outlines how Ohio plans to reach its goal of sharply cutting the phosphorus runoff feeding the algae.
The algae bloom in recent years have contaminated drinking water supplies, turned the waters an unsightly shade of green and contributed to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can't survive.
Ohio along with Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario signed a deal in 2015 to make a 40 percent reduction over the next decade.

While it's a multi-year plan that's designed to be adjusted if some solutions work better than others, it does lay out several steps for state agencies to take within the next year:
___
TOP TARGETS
The state's Environmental Protection Agency will look at identifying priority watersheds that are prone to runoff around the lake's western end where it can make the biggest impact reducing the flow of phosphorus. The plan says focusing on these areas will help the state see reductions more quickly, but it doesn't mean that work to improve water quality in other areas should be neglected.
___
MORE MONITORING
Within the next 12 months, the state EPA will create a water quality monitoring network that tracks how much progress is being made toward reaching the 40 percent reduction. It also will work with surrounding states and Ontario to make sure the same sampling and lab methods are being used and that there's a consistent method of collecting and reporting information. Increased monitoring will allow the overall plan to evolve over the next decade so that what's being done is most effective, EPA leaders say.
___
WASTEWATER PLANTS
While scientists say fertilizers and livestock manure from farms are the main sources of the phosphorus problem, sewage from treatment plants and leaking septic tanks play a role, too. The state EPA will begin trying to find ways to reduce how much phosphorus is released into rivers and streams by small wastewater plants that don't have a permit limit for those discharges.
___
FARMERS ROLE
Ohio's plan relies on convincing farmers to make changes to practices they've used for years, such as no longer spreading manure on soaked fields and encouraging them to use the right amount of fertilizer. But some environmental groups and researchers contend more needs to be done to make a big dent in the phosphorus runoff.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)  The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department has racked up $1.5 million in overtime costs while assisting the Secret Service since President Donald Trump was elected in November.
Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said he is confident the money will be reimbursed by the federal government.
"I do hope he is correct," said Palm Beach County Administrator Verdenia Baker.
The county sent letters to federal officials in December seeking reimbursement for the overtime security costs from Trump's five-day visit to his South Florida estate called Mar-a-Lago in November, the Palm Beach Post (http://bit.ly/2kmo6Z1 ) reported Tuesday.

Those costs were originally estimated at $250,000, but Bradshaw said the total will be closer to $300,000. Based on the revised number, the sheriff said told the newspaper the security costs are amounting to about $60,000 a day during Trump's visits to the county.
Aside from the five days in November, Trump stayed at Mar-a-Lago 16 days in December. He has returned for two weekends so far in February.
The sheriff's presidential detail is covered by overtime and doesn't compromise law enforcement for the rest of the county.
"We don't take anybody off the road that handles normal calls for service," Bradshaw said. "I'm very confident that we're going to get reimbursed. There'll be a point in time where I'll have a conversation, I hope, with the president personally or with someone high up in his administration."
Baker said the sheriff works closely with the Secret Service and would have a better feel about any reimbursement. "I have not received that type of information from anyone in writing," Baker said.
Presidential visits aren't unusual in Palm Beach County as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all made multiple visits for fundraisers, golf outings and campaign appearances. But they didn't involve extended stays.
"Obviously we take it very seriously and we're fortunate we have the experience and the manpower to be able to handle it," Bradshaw said. "We work seamlessly with the Secret Service because we've done it so much."
In addition to the sheriff's costs, West Palm Beach Chief Financial Officer Mark Parks estimated city police and fire rescue crews have incurred about $26,000 in overtime costs during Trump's February visits. The Post reports the town of Palm Beach did not provide estimates for its costs.

Fire crews battled a blaze that ripped through an apartment building Wednesday morning in the north end of Saint John, N.B.
Firefighters responded to the blaze on Metcalf Street at approximately 6 a.m., after reports of smoke coming from the building.
The apartment building was vacant at the time of the fire.

At least one other building in the area was evacuated as a precaution, though it's unlikely the fire will spread.
Saint John fire Chief Kevin Clifford says a decision will likely come later today on whether the remaining parts of the vacant building will be demolished.

Though she may be only 17 years old and all of 5-foot-1, Alicia Hiis is a firecracker. And that is both on the ice and off of it. The young Swedish defender is a multi-sport athlete who is making her first strides in the Svenska damhockeyligan (SDHL) – the top women's league in her country. While she may be one of the younger players to have skated for her club, SDE HF, during the 2017-18 season, she is determined to become an integral player for her team and the league during the years ahead.
The most noticeable aspect of Hiis' game is her physicality, despite weighing only 110 pounds. She is built very solidly and has a low center of gravity in her compact form. Hiis has utilized her build and positioning to not only bring an aggressive style to her team, but has even been known to throw her body around. While hitting is not allowed in women's hockey – and Hiis has at times needed to remind herself of that – there is no question that her rougher style of play makes a statement.
THW had the chance to speak with her one-on-one and learn a bit more about the fearless blueliner. We may even go as far as considering her the female version of a “little ball of hate”, a moniker bestowed on very few but one that certainly does justice to her kind of play. We think that by the time you have finished reading about her, you are going to like Hiis as much as we do, and you will wish that she was on your favorite hockey club.
Still Very Much a Kid Herself
Hiis turned 17 on Feb. 1, 2001. Given when she started playing hockey, she honestly has not been playing the game very long. This makes it even more admirable that she has already made it to the SDHL. Hiis explained that her original roots in hockey stem from the sport of bandy, which is a game that is quite similar.
“I started playing hockey when I was 10 years old,” Hiis told THW. “There were really two reasons why. One was because I played bandy, which is also a skating and stick sport. But I got tired of that, and since I've always been an aggressive player, my dad suggested hockey. I got interested in hockey, but my dad also told me that when I played soccer in for the club AIK, they told me that I had to quit bandy because they wanted me to focus on soccer. I was only 10 years old then, and I didn't accept that I should choose to quit a sport. So, for some reason I told my dad that since they don't want me to play bandy, then I want to play hockey. Maybe a lot of kids works that way – you tell them one thing, and they end up doing a whole other.”
Blir det fotboll eller hockey för backtalangen Alicia Hiis? ”Känner att jag är ganska bra på båda” @hockeysverige @sdehockeydam https://t.co/bJfLWAfAUE pic.twitter.com/GwjpoIUUqd — Ronnies Skrivsmedja (@skrivsmedjan) November 13, 2017
If you have not garnered it already, you will soon realize that Hiis is very strong-willed. It is hard to not agree with her – why should a child be forced to quit a sport so young? As her 10-year-old self recognized the injustice of it all, Hiis stood firm and did things her way. This ended up being the profoundly right decision for her, as she has excelled in hockey ever since.
Growing up in Sweden
Currently living in the capital of Sweden, Hiis has spent most of her life in Bromsten – a middle-class district of northwestern Stockholm. The municipality of Stockholm has a population of over 950,000, while a few million are living in the urban and metropolitan areas of the city.
“I live in Stockholm and I've always lived here,” Hiis explained. “When I was a little kid I used to live in a suburb called Tensta, but then my parents got divorced and I have basically lived my whole life in Bromsten with my dad. There's one hockey team called Spånga, and the rink is about seven minutes from my house, so it was an easy choice.”
Bromsten actually belongs to the Spånga-Tensta borough of Stockholm, hence the hockey team of said name and nearby rink. Hiis has lived in both locations within the borough.
Making the Most of Limited Opportunities
As far as hockey goes though, the opportunities for a young girl to play the sport in this area have been about average for Hiis, and likely even a little less. With the influx of the “Grow the Game” mentality that is being strongly promoted by NWHL teams, CWHL teams, and women's national teams in North America, there should be some thoughts of appreciation for the way that the women's game has encompassed support for young girls in recent years, specifically in this part of the globe. Especially when considering that the same support is not always found worldwide. For Hiis and other players in Europe, a struggle of sorts has been real.
“As a girl there are okay opportunities to play hockey here.” Hiis would go on to explain, “It all depends on what coach you have. Some have given me the same opportunities as the boys. But others I would say have been a real problem in my career, and that's because I played with the boys from when I was 10 to 16. So, it can really effect the players development if you treat them different from the rest of the group. I went to play with the J-18 team (a boys junior team in Sweden) when I was fifteen. But after we switched coaches it was, in my opinion, no longer about how good or bad I was, but the fact that I was a girl. So I didn't play for about a whole year when having that coach. I won't lie – that year I lost a lot of motivation and ‘gained' of course doubts about me as a player, but also doubts about if it was right of me as a female to play hockey. And the fact that no one in the club wanted to confront him about it, I wouldn't say that it's a good opportunity for a girl to play hockey here. At least not if you want to play on the same terms as the boys.”
You certainly have to respect Hiis's candidness and her ability to recognize, that at least in this particular instance, she was sold short because she is a female hockey player. Wise beyond her years, one would have to say that not playing Hiis was more of a loss for the team.
Finding a Place for Herself in the SDHL
Unlike a lot of young athletes, Hiis has not looked up to a particular player or found one whom she tries to model her game after. Instead, she has geared her focus towards observing different skills or body checks she has enjoyed, and then used those for adding inspiration to her own play.
“Oh I´m not really a player that follows the NHL or other leagues”, Hiis shared. “I know that might sound bad, but I just really don't feel like putting in time to watch any games. Usually I might have homework or soccer, so I can't really find the time to follow a team or a specific player. But I usually just watch skills or hits on YouTube, because then I can decide by my own when to watch and learn. When I was younger and played in the J18, I used to look at the older and more experienced players. The biggest thing I think is just confidence on the ice. You might be stressed out in a specific situation but to keep your cool. That's what the better players do. I think that's one of the many things I noticed while watching some of the J18 guys.”
Since the 2014-15 season, Hiis played women's Division I hockey, which is the tier just below the SDHL. In 48 Division I games, Hiis scored six goals and nine assists while picking up a whopping 72 penalty minutes. Her finest season statistically came during the 2016-17 season for AIK 2 when she scored six goals and five assists for 11 points in 22 games, to go along with 34 penalty minutes.
Hiis admits her feistiness, acknowledging that her hard hitting against boys has carried over into the women's game. This desire to hit and play in-your-face hockey has led her to acquiring more penalties, but has also made her presence known.
“Yes, going from playing with the boys to playing women's hockey, the hardest part was just getting used to ‘no' (hits).” Hiis would go onto explain, “my best skill might be hitting, and since that's the one thing you can't do in women's hockey it has been a quite difficult in my way of playing. I've now gotten used to not making an open ice hit, but it sill is one of my favorite things to do. That's one reason why I miss playing boys hockey. Another strength I have is that I'm a good skater. Maybe I got that a little bit from bandy, but for most part it's just repetition. My best characteristic might be that I like to practice – I appreciate a gym session. Well it's not always fun, but you get it – I do appreciate having a lot of training.”
Still Learning the Game and Plenty of Time to Make Decisions
During the 2017-18 SDHL season, Hiis played 15 games for SDE out of the team's 36 total contests. Although she went pointless, she still finished the year as a minus-two. Normally that number might seem a bit paltry, but SDE finished second to last in the SDHL and scored a league worst 54 goals. After allowing 137 goals, the team finished the year as a minus-83. Hiis' plus/minus was actually the best total of all skaters on the team of those that had played at least 10 games.
Despite the record, Hiis feels that SDE suits her perfectly. The club has also given her the opportunity to continue a successful career in soccer too, in addition to hockey.
“I go to a high school that's called Danderydsgymnasium, which is nearby the SDE rink,” Hiis told us. “Also, for this season I wanted to challenge myself a bit, or maybe step up my game. I decided to go for a SDHL team. But since there are three teams in the SDHL in Stockholm, and the other two teams weren't an option for me by the time, I chose SDE. Also, one of my biggest priorities is that my coach has a good attitude about me also playing soccer. In SDE I have been able to play both soccer and hockey. Some coaches are not up for a player having another sport but really, I just think it's better that a player is at practice developing, even if it's not the same sport. You still get to work on other muscle groups or skills that might be useful. Also, it's better that the player shows character and ambition than doing other stuff like maybe partying on the weekends, but maybe that's just me.”
Hiis also feels that there is more she will be able to contribute to SDE next year. She is only 17 years old age, and is playing in a league with some women who are about twice her age. Hiis, however, is staunch in doing her darndest and going with the approach that she can contribute more.
“Well perhaps taking one step up in my game,” she said, when asked what she is most looking forward to for the 2018-19 SDHL season. “I think I did okay this year, but I´d like to say that I got more to give. Also, maybe us as a team doing better this year I think a lot of the girls are exited for showing what we can do next season.”
Hiis Is Growing as an Athlete and as a Person
11 or 12 year old hockey players are not much younger than Hiis is now, but she has come a long way in her game. As you may have gathered too, she is a very determined young lady. One of Frank Sinatra's most famous and beloved tunes is “My Way”. One thing that can be said for certain about Alicia Hiis is that she is doing things her way. Even at an early age, she has already developed a strong sense of self-awareness.
It is a wisdom too, that she is willing to impart to youngsters. THW asked Hiis if she had any advice for young female hockey players about to enter their teenage years. She offered a rather thorough response.
“I wouldn't say ‘don't be afraid'. That's like saying ‘don't be angry' to someone who's angry. Accept the fact that you are a little nervous, but that you have nothing to lose. I have tried all different types of sports. I've tried ballet, basketball, swimming, boxing and that's just four of about fifteen different sport I've tried. Some of them were not for me, but as an example, I still do boxing now and then. I gained so much from participating in different environments and I've met so many people on the way, and I'm glad I did. No one's great at the beginning of something. What matters is if it fulfills your days with joy and you're growing as a person. I would like to say that my confidence is somehow linked to the sports I've played. I wished more kids would be exposed to different types of sports, because maybe their youth years would've been a whole lot of easier. The teenagers I know that party a lot and tried alcohol at an early age, they're just insecure. And maybe if they would've had something that they feel they are good at, for example a sport such as hockey, they would be more confident with themselves.”
Rather sizable thoughts from someone so young, but she knows what she is talking about. Hiis has also incorporated more of a Muay Thai kickboxing training into her off-ice work, as opposed to traditional boxing. The kickboxing has not only helped with her confidence, but certainly has carried over into balance and strength in her hockey playing.
Some Final Thoughts From Hiis
The best is yet to come for Alicia Hiis. It will be interesting to see how much she has grown heading into the 2018-19 SDHL season, and what more she will bring to SDE. This is a particularly strong blueliner who has no hesitation in being punishing on the ice. To each their own, but it is a shame that hitting is not presently allowed in women's hockey. Hiis would be more of a great white shark out there, capable of delivering some devastating hits. For now, she will need to keep herself in check.
Hockey and sports have taught Hiis a lot already, but as a practitioner of the game she is always eager to learn more.
“I've learned that if you want to be good at something the number one key is repetition,” Hiis explained, “and you have got to have discipline. That means maybe choosing a practice or studying, before being with friends or partying. That does not have to mean that you can never be with a friend or not have fun. That just means that you must make your priorities, and do so wisely. I've also learned that everything isn't always fair, but you can do nothing other than to keep going. I feel like you mature faster, in some sort of way than people at the same age. Maybe because as an athlete you have to take more responsibilities for your training, and that has an impact in your personality to also take responsibility for other stuff such as school.”
Wise words from a tough athlete. Or as we like to call Alicia Hiis, our “Swedish Little Ball of Hate”.
LUCKNOW: As many as 24 wanted criminals were arrested and one gangster killed in 15 police encounters reported from 10 districts of the state in the past 48 hours on Friday evening. The encounters were reported from Muzaffarnagar, Gorakhpur, Bulandshahr, Shamli, Hapur, Meerut, Saharanpur, Baghpat, Kanpur and Lucknow. In all the cases, police recovered firearms including a carbine, factory and countrymade firearms apart from cash, jewellery and cars most of which was robbed by the criminals.Describing the spate of encounters as the result of a fresh crackdown against listed criminals, director general of police OP Singh said at least 8 of the arrested gangsters carried a cash reward on their head ranging from Rs 15,000 to 50,000. "The idea is to arrest these wanted gangsters and put them behind bars. The police have been directed to use force only in self-defence when there was no other option. The bottomline is that outlaws who are wanted in criminal cases have to be stopped," Singh told TOI.In Muzaffarnagar, police achieved a major breakthrough on Friday when the special task force (STF) gunned down Indrapal, a native of Ghaziabad who had 33 criminal cases pending against him.The cases against Indrapal included that of a shootout in Haridwar in 2013 in which a policeman was killed and another robbed of his service pistol. Carrying a cash reward of Rs 25,000 on his head, Indrapal opened fire at the STF team in which a sub inspector was injured.In another encounter reported from Gorakhpur, police arrested two miscreants after an encounter that took place early morning on Friday in Ram Nagar area following an extensive manhunt that was launched after they threatened a village Pradhan for extortion, who in turn informed the police. The two, with gunshot injuries, were admitted to the BRD Medical college where their condition was described as "out of danger".The two carried a cash reward of Rs 50,000 each on their heads and had confessed to their involvement in the murder of businessman Dinesh Gupta on Sunday.In Bulandshaher, police arrested a wanted gangster Mukesh from his residence in Jahangirabad police circle. When the police raided his house during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, following a specific tip-off that he was present inside, Mukesh opened fire at the police but was overpowered. Carrying a cash reward of Rs 20,000 on his head, Mukesh has several criminal cases pending against him, including that of murder, attempted murder, robbery and liquor smuggling.Two more listed criminals were arrested in Hapur after an ambush with the police in which they were injured. Identified as Aas Mohammed and Ashu, the two suffered severe bullet wounds in the exchange of fire with the police and were admitted to hospital where they were undergoing treatment. While Aas Mohammed is a resident of Gautam Budh Nagar, Ashu hails from Ghaziabad. Police recovered two countrymade pistols from them and a car which they had robbed.In the encounters reported repprted since Wednesday night, Lucknow police had arrested Naresh Bhati and his associate Kuldeep Jaat and recovered a carbine and a pistol from them after an ambesh in which the former suffered bullet injuires and was undergoing treatment. Similar arrests were made in Kanpur following an exchange of fire on Wednesday. Public Relation Officer (PRO), DG Headquarters ASP Rahul Srivastava confirmed on Friday evening that 15 encounters had taken place in the past 48 hours in which a wanted criminal has been killed and 24 gangsters have been arrested.

Suzanne Alba O'Hara of Wyoming, Luzerne County, received her first breast cancer diagnosis in 2012, after her dermatologist noticed some skin discoloration. She endured eight cycles of chemotherapy and 42 radiation treatments and believed she had achieved remission.
After four years of celebrating life cancer-free, Suzanne began feeling pain on her right side under her ribs. Thinking it must be her gallbladder or some other non-cancer-related problem, she visited her primary-care doctor, who ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed spots on her liver. Subsequent CT and PET scans confirmed that her breast cancer had come back and spread to her liver and spine, leading to a diagnosis of stage 4 or metastatic breast cancer.
Suzanne knew at the time of her original treatment that there was a possibility the cancer would return. But cancer was the last thing on her mind in 2016. Still, she was kind enough to share her story in an effort to help raise awareness for others.
Breast cancer is caused by uncontrolled growth of breast tissue cells. The disease is treatable with chemotherapy and radiation, which kills these rapidly growing cells, or with surgical removal of a tumor.
Typically, people diagnosed with early stage breast cancer manage to achieve remission, meaning there is no longer any evidence of the cancer. However, although there may be no signs of disease, sometimes the errant cells manage to escape treatment and move to other places in the body. This process of tumor cells migrating and growing in other places is called metastasis.
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is also known as stage 4, advanced or chronic breast cancer. Once breast cancer reaches this stage, it cannot be cured, but it can be treated. Sometimes when breast cancer is first discovered, it has already metastasized. But MBC is frequently diagnosed as a recurrence, often several years after a patient has already achieved remission of an early stage breast cancer. This was the case for Suzanne.
Nationally, there are an estimated 150,000 to 250,000 people in the U.S. living with MBC. This broad estimate reveals a data-collection problem that clouds our ability to say with certainty what percentage of people treated for early breast cancer later suffer a recurrence. Statistics are not collected for metastatic recurrences, which comprise the larger portion of MBC cases. Most U.S. registries count only new cases and cancer deaths. If a breast cancer patient has a recurrence sometime after initial treatment, there is no national registry to which doctors must submit that information.
No matter the statistics, a person hearing the news that he or she has MBC can be overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, plunged into a new medical reality — and a very difficult world to navigate. MBC patients often feel alone and overlooked. They need to know that while MBC is a lifelong disease, it is possible for people with the diagnosis to live well.
Our Northeast Pennsylvania Susan G. Komen affiliate has devoted itself to identifying local resources that can help MBC patients to not only cope, but to thrive. On Saturday, April 29, Komen NEPA and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, with a generous grant from the Moses Taylor Foundation, will present a symposium covering a range of MBC topics. From emerging treatments and clinical trials to social support and the tools needed to care for mental health and physical well-being, people living with MBC — and the health care professionals who care for them — will receive the most up-to-date and comprehensive information available.
There will be several nationally recognized researchers speaking, including two Komen Scholars from Pennsylvania. Komen Scholars are a group of 60 distinguished scholars and leaders in breast cancer research and advocacy. Those scheduled to speak April 29 are Adrian Lee, Ph.D., from the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and David A. Mankoff, M.D., Ph.D., from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
Lee's lab uses genomic approaches to identify the unique signatures of metastatic cells that may be used as personalized therapy for MBC. He will discuss the current gaps in MBC research. Mankoff's research focuses on developing new imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose MBC and monitor treatment effectiveness. Both scholars are committed to improving progression-free survival and quality of life in MBC patients.
Other speakers include Michael Murray, M.D., and Craig Piso, Ph.D. Murray, director of Geisinger's clinical genomics and the MyCode data project, will talk about how genomics is changing the detection and treatment of cancer. Piso, a psychologist, will discuss “Finding Courage and Strength During Life's Biggest Challenges.”
What: “Living Well with Breast Cancer and Beyond,” a symposium presented by Susan G. Komen Northeastern Pennsylvania in collaboration with Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine. The free event is open to anyone affected by breast cancer or metastatic disease or who wants to know more about it.
When: Saturday, April 29, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Where: Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Medical Sciences Building, 525 Pine St., Scranton.

In a large skillet pan, heat the olive oil over a medium high heat until hot, then add your onions and peppers. Season with 1 tsp of taco seasoning, a little salt and cook until the edges start to brown and soften a bit. You still want some bite to the peppers and onions. To the same pan, add the marinated shrimp, along with the little of the lemon juice they have been marinating in and cook just until shrimp start to curl into “C”s. As soon as you see the shrimp start to curl, they are finished. Have yourself a taste and adjust with a little more taco and or salt if needed. Finish with a little fresh cracked black pepper. While the fajitas are cooking, you can heat the tortillas, in a large dry frying pan just until they are warmed and soft. Cover with aluminum. Assemble: Place a little cheese down the center of the tortilla, then your sour cream and guacamole. Add your fajita mixture and top with salsa, Roll and enjoy
Chef's Tips: Another way to warm the tortillas is to place on a plate and lay a damp paper towel over top and place in the microwave for 30-40 seconds right before needed them. I prefer this trick.

KARACHI - Mayor Wasim Akhtar Tuesday said that the Rabies Control Programme was aimed at providing safeguard to citizens against dog biting and spread of rabies virus among local population.
The pilot project initiated in Ibrahim Haidery union councils will soon be extended to other areas of Karachi. Strategies devised by the World Health Organization and World Organization for Animal Health were adopted in the RFK programme which involved anti rabies vaccination in dogs and animal birth control programme.
Presiding over a meeting to review the current progress and decide on future plans, the mayor said that the district municipal administration and union council chairmen will be taken on board in this connection so that basic infrastructure for this programme could be made available in all districts of Karachi.
During a briefing to the mayor, Dr Nasim Salahuddin said so far 2,145 dogs have been vaccinated in three union councils of Ibrahim Haidery whereas about 400 dogs were operated under ABC programme.
The local population was also taken into confidence before starting work in their area and community engagement sessions were conducted.
She said that rabies control could be made sure if in any area 70 percent dogs were vaccinated. The dog catching and vaccination team has been trained by the expert from World Health Organization and about 50 thousand kits were provided by the WHO for this purpose.
The mayor reviewing the overall project and its implementation in Karachi said: “We need to focus more on suburban areas and kutchi abadies besides continuing work in main city.”
He said that the World Health Organization has set the 2030 target for elimination of rabies in the world and we will provide all possible cooperation to the WHO and other concerned organisations in this connection.
He said that daily hundred to 150 cases of dog biting were ported in the city and 15 to 20 thousand cases of dog biting were reported annually. The victim can be expired if no immediate medical aid is provided to him. Industrial areas in Karachi are more suffered due to this situation. He said that new technology was being used to control the rabies and for this purpose dogs will be given anti rabies vaccine and operated under ABC programme.
The meeting was attended by the Metropolitan Commissioner Dr Syed Saif-ur-Rehman, Medical Committee Chairperson Naheed Fatima, Financial Advisor Dr Asghar Sheikh, Director Medical Services Dr Beerbal, Director Coordination Masood Alam, Head of Rabies Free Karachi Programme at Indus Hospital Dr Nasim Salahuddin, Program Manager Rabia Mansoor Khan, Team Leader Aftab Gohar, Research Associate Abdullah Qureshi and other officers.

Karaçay Youth Sports Club in southern Turkey's Osmaniye has become a beacon of hope for the province's underprivileged children and youth, organizing various social events including football training.
Eight childhood friends, all born and raised in the city's crime-ridden Karaçay neighborhood, founded the eponymous youth and sports club 10 years ago. The plan was to use sports to keep children and youth of the area away from bad habits.The club started off with just 15 members. Initially, the founders talked to the young people and visited their houses to persuade their parents.
Fast forward a decade and the club has so far produced more than 200 football players. Although struggling in the second amateur league, the club became an indispensable address for the youth of the area.
Talking to Anadolu Agency (AA), Soner Yiğit Karabay, one of the founders and a coach at the club, said that he grew up in the crime-ridden neighborhood and had a difficult childhood.
Karabay said that he had no opportunities for social and sports activities. "We used to play football on a piece of arid land in the neighborhood. Eight of us grew up together here and decided to open a club so that the children do not face the same difficulties we did. We want to give alternatives to the children of this underprivileged neighborhood. We did not have many alternatives when we were young. We did not have opportunities to socialize or to play sports. But we wanted to change that," he said.
He added that football was not the club's only focus. "Besides football training, we organized theaters, dramas and give musical instrument lessons. We made my house the club building. We have also built a library there.
Ömer Can Kebiş, 14, one of the footballers at Karaçay Youth Sports Club, said he has been with the club since he was six."Other than playing football matches, we attend theaters and drama lessons. We go to the cinema sometimes. Here we have had the chance to experience things that we could not even dream of. Other clubs wanted me to play for them, but I did not go. This is my neighborhood, my family."
Another club member, Muhammed Ersin Dere said that the rate was very high in the neighborhood, but the club has played an important role in improving that situation. "It has affected my school and social life positively," he said.
"Coming back into an offseason where there's no install… it's all 'Hey, this is the play call. This is what we ran last year,'" he said. "It's right back into picking up where we left off. And that will be nice to continue to build that rapport with all the receivers and Todd and the O-line. It will be great."

ARIZONA VS. ARIZONA STATE
Results
Hosted by ASU
Saturday, February 3rd
25 Yards
Dual Meet Format
FINAL TEAM SCORES:
MEN: ASU 203.5, Arizona 94.5
WOMEN: ASU 173, Arizona 127
The Arizona State women closed out their season on a historic note at home on Saturday. Both the Sun Devil men and women took down in-state Pac-12 rival Arizona. This marks the ASU women's first victory over the Wildcats in 25 years. Their last win over Arizona was in 1993.
Claire Fisch, Chloe Isleta, and Marlies Ross each rallied for a winning double individually in the team's big win. Fisch swept the sprint events, first out-touching Arizona All-American Katrina Konopka in the 50 free, 23.07 to 23.18. She battled closely with Arizona's Konopka and Jamie Stone in the 100 free as it came down to the touch again. Fisch led at the halfway mark in 24.31, just 2 hundredths ahead of Konopka, and sealed the deal as she held off a late charge from Stone to win it in 50.39. Stone (50.43) and Konopka (50.47) were hundredths back.
Isleta swept the backstrokes, dominating the 100 back in 53.88 and out-touching Arizona's Cameron McHugh, 1:56.35 to 1:54.46, in the 200 back. Isleta also took a narrow 2nd place in the 200 IM, touching just hundredths behind in 2:01.53 as teammate Ross ran her down on the back half to win it in 2:01.45. Ross' additional win came in the 200 breast, where she used her back half speed to edge out teammates Nora Deleske (2:14.99) and Silja Kansakoski (2:15.03) with a winning time of 2:14.91. Kansakoski had won the 100 breast in 1:01.03, while Ross (1:02.97) took 3rd, just a hundredth behind Arizona's Mallory Korenwinder (1:02.96).
Kirsten Jacobsen of Arizona was also a double event winner on the women's side. She won the 200 free handily in 1:48.19. In the 500 free, she battled closely with teammate Hannah Cox, holding off Cox down the final stretch to win 4:52.16 to 4:52.66. Cox had edged out Jacobsen in the 1000 free earlier in the session, winning in 9:58.66 to Jacobsen's 9:59.33.
Several of the Sun Devil men contributed multiple victories, including All-American Cameron Craig. He got the ball rolling by anchoring the winning 200 medley relays in a quick 19.06. He also led off the 200 free relay in 19.61. Individually, Craig threw down a 1:34.78 to top teammate Grant House (1:35.89) by a second in the 200 free. Craig was dominant in the 100 free, flipping in 20.45 at the halfway mark as he blasted a 42.51. House went on to pick up a pair of wins as well, touching in 4:24.87 to top the 500 free and 1:47.49 to win the 200 IM.
Zachary Poti and Christian Lorenz swept their respective stroke specialties. Poti swept the backstrokes (47.10/1:43.47), while Lorenz earned his wins in the breaststrokes (53.99/1:58.59). Lorenz and Andrew Porter both celebrated their senior day with multiple wins. Porter notched to 50 free wins, out-touching teammate Evan Carlson 20.28 to 20.33. He returned to win his signature 100 fly in 47.43.
PRESS RELEASE – ARIZONA STATE:
TEMPE, Ariz. – On a historic day for the Arizona State swimming & diving program, the No. 7 Sun Devil men defeated No. 18 Arizona by over 100 points, 203.5-94.5, while the women took down the No. 22 Wildcats, 173-127, for the first time since 1993. The men have now beat or tied U of A past three seasons.
“We only lose one woman for next year who's here today and we're bringing in 10 more,” said head swimming coach Bob Bowman . “They're our future and I'm so happy for these women's team.”
Prior to the meet, the 2018 senior class was honored in their final collegiate home meet – Heikki Makikallio , Ivana Ninkovic , Christian Lorenz , Mara Aiacoboae , Rebecca Deacon , Reid Elliott , Andrew Porter , and Patrick Park .
Both Sun Devils squads started the meet on a high note, taking first place in the 200 medley relay, with the men going 1-2. The Sun Devil men's A squad would later take their second relay win of the meet as they cruised to victory.
The ASU men won 10 of 12 individual swim events, including going 1-2 in five of them and 1-2-3 in the 100 breast. Cameron Craig (100 free, 200 free), Christian Lorenz (100 breasts, 200 breast), Grant House (500 free, 200 IM), Andrew Porter (100 fly, 50 free), Zach Poti (100 back, 200 back) each won two events apiece.
For the winning Sun Devil women, Claire Fisch (50 free, 100 free), Chloe Isleta (100 back, 200 back) and Marlies Ross (200 breasts, 200 IM) each won two events apiece while three others won events ( Silja Kansakoski in 100 breasts, Nora Deleske in 200 fly, Fanny Teijonsalo in 100 fly) as ASU won nine of 12 individual swim events.
“ Nora Deleske really stepped up and was key to the women's win today,” said Bowman. “Winning her events was absolutely key and that 200 fly was probably the key to the whole meet.”
In diving, Ashley McCool and Frida Kaellgren finished first and second in both the 1-meter and 3-meter springboard while Youssef Selim and Heikki Makikallio went 1-2 on the men's side.
“I'm looking forward to happens at Pac-12's because that's been the natural progression towards NCAA's. I think we're in a very good place,” Bowman concluded.
The Territorial Cup series point will be decided at the Pac-12 Championships, with the women's swim and men's/women's dive portion taking place Feb. 21-24 and the men's swim championships the following week, Feb. 28-Mar. 3. Both will take place in Federal Way, Wash.

On March 14th, 2018, Grinnell High School seemed unusually guarded around 10:00am. Streets to the school were closed off, police cars surrounded the area, school officials stood outside, and media personnel were standing off school grounds taking pictures and observing. This was due to the nationwide school walkout that had been planned shortly after a shooting at a Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida that resulted in 17 deaths. With many other events prior to this, many people are coming together to advocate for gun reform. Within this issue, there are so many different perspectives. However, the most interesting point of view really comes from the students themselves.
Organizing the walk out is a group of students that have created a Twitter account with the handle @GHSvsGunDeaths. These students have met together to email, call, and write letters to those involved in Congress, specifically those who represent Iowa. The walkout that these students organized was intended to honor the 17 Parkland Shooting victims as well as advocate for gun reform. It is estimated that about 50-60 students from GHS decided to walk out that day, despite the consequence of receiving a detention. When senior Oswaldo Ambrosio was asked about the controversy on the topic within the high school he replies with “In the end, neither republicans nor democrats want children to die, so we agreed that we must tackle the problem by being more kind to people and keeping guns away from people who shouldn't have them”. The walkout lasted 17 minutes: one minute for each victim. As each minute passed, another name of a victim was called out. Although it was very cold and many students were shaking from the chilling wind, they stood in a circle around the flagpole while holding hands.
On the opposite side of the spectrum, many students remained in class and were openly against the school walkout. For example, to alert students of the meeting to email representatives, there was an email sent out to the whole school. There were many students who responded in protest saying things such as “have fun in detention” and “walking out is pointless”. The email spiraled and eventually generated 97 responses, mostly from underclassmen. When the walkout finally happened, many students took to social media to voice their concern including senior Danielle Moore who was interviewed following the event. When asked how she felt when students were walking out of class, Moore responds by stating, “It vexed me in the sense that people are using a terrible situation, a school shooting, to get others to oppose our second amendment right”. Danielle expressed that a solution would be to “Educate students how to properly use a firearm. Educate students as to why we have guns and gun rights in the first place. Educate students to understand the appropriate times and manners to use firearms. All of these are not being taught around schools in the country currently and that should change.” With everything going on in today's world and violence, it is important that conversation about solutions continue.
Overall, there seemed to be no serious conflict between students of opposing sides except some discussion. Junior Mezekerta Tesfay explained that, “Several different students who opposed the walkout made their views public for all to see”, Tesfay continues, “Their lack of empathy and respect for my fellow students and I's decision to walkout was a bit disturbing; however, many students who didn't participate were completely respectful of the students who chose to.” The protest was peaceful and didn't seem to cause any disruptive behavior throughout the days following. The GHS group is also going to be holding a vigil for the 17 victims on April 20th, 2018.
LAHORE - Capital City Police Officer Muhammad Amin Wains Friday said that the police would formally launch “intelligence system” in Lahore very soon.
The CCPO stated this while addressing a large gathering of police officers at Alhamra Hall on Friday. A police spokesman said that some 500 officers attended the parley. The revised intelligence collection system called 111-Intelligence will help police improve surveillance of communities across the metropolis. All field police officials serving in Lahore are asked to submit one intelligence report in a month. The reports regarding gangsters, terror suspects, drug-pushers, brothels, and gambling dens will be shared in a central intelligence gathering mechanism for quick police action.
Additional-IG Muhammad Amin Wains also said that data of 35,000 police had been collected for this purpose. He also appreciated the efforts of SSP Rana Ayaz Saleem for making this project a complete success. “Now, policemen (working in the field) will be able to pass on and share any secret information to the high-command by using their cellular phones. This (system) will help police unearth terror suspects and dens of criminals,” the city police chief said. SSP Rana Ayaz Saleem, who supervises intelligence collection project, said that the basic purpose of the 111-intelligence system was to strengthen police deployed on field duties. He also announced that he would start visiting police stations, offices, and headquarters very soon in order to review the progress. He also urged the officers and foot constables to come forward and play their vital role in the fight against criminals, gangster and terror suspects.
“We have provided a good platform to all the policemen. Now, it will be your responsibility to gather and share information about criminals and gangsters in order to secure communities and to protect the lives and properties of the people,” the officer underlined.
Lahore DIG Security Dr Moeen, SP Headquarters Atif Nazir, SP Civil Lines Ali Raza, SP Mujahid Faisal Shahzad and all branch-heads of the operations, investigations, security, and traffic police departments were also present on this occasion.

Many thought that when gas prices dropped off, so would consumer interest in electric vehicles. But that's far from what has happened, according to a recent study by AAA.
Gas prices have fallen 40 percent from five years ago, but consumers are just as attracted to electric cars today as they were back then. A whopping 15 percent of U.S. customers are likely to purchase an EV for their next car, AAA reports. At that figure, the number of Americans interested in an EV has approached the number planning to purchase a pickup truck. And despite having a reputation for being cash-strapped, Millennials have a particularly large appetite for EVs, with nearly one in five expressing interest in one for their next vehicle.
The top consideration for consumers who want to buy an EV is concern for the environment (87 percent). Other key factors include lower long-term costs (62 percent), the desire for cutting-edge technology (52 percent), and carpool lane access (29 percent). AAA surveyed 1,004 adults in the continental U.S. for this study.
“With their lower ownership costs and compatibility with emerging autonomous technologies, electric vehicles are poised to be a key vehicle of the future,” said AAA Director of Automotive Engineering Greg in a statement, also adding that Tesla “has helped widen the appeal of electric vehicles by showing they can be stylish, performance-focused and filled with cutting-edge technology.”
Although many consumers are eyeing electric cars, more than half are turned away from these vehicles because of range anxiety. That's despite the average round-trip commute in the U.S. totaling 31 miles (46 minutes), which is well within the capability of just about every EV on the market today.
Hybrids should remain a popular alternative. A whopping 32 percent of U.S. consumers are likely to buy one of these vehicles next, according to the study.

Before the compass, clocks, and GPS were invented, Pacific Islanders navigated the open ocean using nothing but nature, which included stars, birds, and marine life.
For the past three years, Hokulea's crew members used those traditional wayfinding techniques to make their way around the world.
Soon you'll be able to see what it's like on Hokulea thanks to virtual reality technology.
Four University of Hawaii at Manoa students created a project called Kilo Hoku.
“We built as part of a class project, but we decided we were going to continue with it and build something even stronger, and hopefully carry it forward and be able to use it as an educational tool,” said student Patrick Karjala.
“Not everybody has the option to actually get on one of the voyaging canoes, and this is a way for anybody to give it a try and see what it's like,” said student Dean Lodes.
You'll be able to experience Kilo Hoku at the Malama Honua Fair and Summit, which takes place this Sunday through Tuesday at the Hawaii Convention Center.
Get more information about the Malama Honua Fair and Summit here.
The team hopes to someday make this available as a free educational tool, so that anyone with the right VR equipment could go online and download the program.
KHON2 will be airing Hokulea's homecoming live on Saturday, June 17, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on our sister station, Hawaii's CW. It will also be live-streamed on KHON2.com.

Today, what is considered to be the best track-only Ferrari model is probably the FXX K Evo that is based on the LaFerrari. Before that model came out, the most hardcore model was the FXX K. But no matter how cool you would be to own any of these two, both of them are not road legal.
It would be the fulfilment of every car enthusiast's wish to see the FXX K or Evo going through modifications to become road legal just like models such as the McLaren P1 GTR and Aston Martin Vulcan.

Woman Admits To Cashing Fake Check At Local Bank
February 3, 2018
A Wayne County woman has admitted to cashing a fraudulent check at a Livingston County bank and attempting to do so at several others.
23-year-old Danielle Denise Anderson of Dearborn Heights was originally charged with three counts of uttering and publishing. At a Friday hearing in Livingston County Circuit Court, she pleaded guilty with an added count of the same charge. Prosecutors agreed to a recommendation that she be sentenced under the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, which would expunge her record if she successfully completes probation. She will be sentenced March 1st.
Anderson was arrested January 4th after a teller at the First National Bank branch in Genoa Township called 911 under the belief that Anderson attempted to cash a $1,500 fraudulent check. Anderson was still on scene when Livingston County Sheriff's deputies arrived, however a second person had fled prior to their arrival. That person is still being sought.
Anderson had unsuccessfully tried to cash fraudulent checks at other First National Bank locations, but was only able to successfully do so at their Fowlerville branch earlier that day. The $1,500 gained from that transaction remains unaccounted for. (DK/JK)

You often hear the admonition “correlation does not imply causation.” But what exactly is causation? Unlike correlation, which has a specific mathematical meaning, causation is a slippery concept that has been debated by philosophers for millennia. It seems to get conflated with our intuitions or preconceived notions about what it means to cause something to happen. One common-sense definition might be to say that causation is what connects one prior process or agent — the cause — with another process or state — the effect. This seems reasonable, except that it is useful only when the cause is a single factor, and the connection is clear. But reality is rarely so simple.
Although we tend to credit or blame things on a single major cause, in nature and in science there are almost always multiple factors that have to be exactly right for an event to take place. For example, we might attribute a forest fire to the carelessly thrown cigarette butt, but what about the grassy tract leading to the forest, the dryness of the vegetation, the direction of the wind and so on? All of these factors had to be exactly right for the fire to start. Even though many tossed cigarette butts don't start fires, we zero in on human actions as causes, ignoring other possibilities, such as sparks from branches rubbing together or lightning strikes, or acts of omission, such as failing to trim the grassy path short of the forest. And we tend to focus on things that can be manipulated: We overlook the direction of the wind because it is not something we can control. Our scientifically incomplete intuitive model of causality is nevertheless very useful in practice, and helps us execute remedial actions when causes are clearly defined. In fact, artificial intelligence pioneer Judea Pearl has published a new book about why it is necessary to teach cause and effect to intelligent machines.
However, clearly defined causes may not always exist. Complex, interdependent multifactorial causes arise often in nature and therefore in science. Most scientific disciplines focus on different aspects of causality in a simplified manner. Physicists may talk about causal influences being unable to propagate faster than the speed of light, while evolutionary biologists may discuss proximate and ultimate causes as mentioned in our previous puzzle on triangulation and motion sickness. But such simple situations are rare, especially in biology and the so-called “softer” sciences. In the world of genetics, the complex multifactorial nature of causality was highlighted in a recent Quanta article by Veronique Greenwood that described the intertwined effects of genes.
One well-known approach to understanding causality is to separate it into two types: necessary and sufficient. If 2 cannot be caused unless 1 is present, then 1 is a necessary cause of 2; if the presence of 1 implies the occurrence of 2, then 2 is a sufficient cause. Note how these definitions leave the door open for other causative factors: 1 may be a necessary cause, but may require other “contributory causes” to make 2 happen. Similarly, 1 may be a sufficient cause, but may not be necessary: 3 may cause 2 as well.
The search for a clear and comprehensive theory of causality may well be a philosophical chimera. However, as Insights readers know, our philosophy is that all subjects, however complicated, can be explored through puzzles. So let's explore multifactorial causation using some simplified mathematical models, restricting ourselves to just three causative factors and omitting interactions between causative factors over time.
Consider a scenario where there are three causative factors, a, b and c, which are real variables that take values between 0 and 2. The three factors interact together to determine the value of a hidden factor, d. If the value of d is within a certain window, then a particular event occurs (Y). If not, the event fails to occur (N).
Problem 1
Consider three models of causation: i) a simple linear interaction between a, b and c (where the value of d is the sum of the three after each is multiplied by its own nonzero constant factor); ii) a “tennis serve” model where a, b and c are like the height, vertical and lateral angle of the hit and d is the position where the ball lands, which has been in the service court; and iii) a “genetic model” where a, b and c are gene products, two of which interact multiplicatively to form an intermediate product that interacts linearly with the third gene product to determine the final concentration of d. The size of the window for d to result in the target event can be set arbitrarily, but must be less than one-twentieth of the total range of values that d can take as a, b and c vary between their extreme values.
Which of the three models described can allow the target event to occur only when a, b and c are all greater than 1 or are all less than or equal to 1, but in no other circumstance? Can you think of a way that a, b and c can interact that will naturally give rise to this result?
The required result is shown in the table below. A “Y” in a specific cell means that the target event can occur somewhere within the sub-ranges of a, b and c values specified in the particular cell; an “N” means that it cannot.
0 < b <= 1
0 < c <= 1 0 < b <= 1
1 < c < 2 1 < b < 2
0 < c <= 1 1 < b < 2
1 < c < 2 0 < a <= 1 Y N N N 1 < a < 2 N N N Y
Problem 2
What are the maximum number of cells in each of these models that can show a “Y”?
Problem 3
Of the 56 possible Y-N patterns that these tables can contain, which model can achieve the most? Can it achieve all?
Of course, these causative models are still quite simple, but hopefully they show how complicated multifactorial causality can get in the real world. When that happens, our simplistic compulsion to find a single cause or agent can lead us to invent spurious causes. I invite readers to cite examples of this phenomenon.

Officials say a woman has been arrested after trying to smoke on a Southwest flight from Portland to Sacramento, then shouting she was going to kill everyone on the plane.
In video obtained by CBS13 in Sacramento, the woman — identified as 24-year-old Valerie Curbelo of Sandy, Ore. — is shown wearing a white hat and sunglasses as she spews profanities and threats at the crew and pushes a flight attendant.
Southwest said in a statement Monday that the plane received priority treatment from air traffic control to land quickly in Sacramento, and law enforcement met the plane on the tarmac to arrest her.
In a jailhouse interview with CBS13, Curbelo said she tried to smoke because of anxiety.
She said she didn't know why she made the death threats, adding that the person doing that “was not me.”

Whistle-blowers at Med Rescue International Botswana (MRI) are accusing the Managing Director (MD) Constance Matabiswana of flouting administrative and recruitment procedures.
Information passed to The Botswana Gazette suggests that the Managing Director was always clashing with parent company called Southview for issues of human resource management.
Before its dissolution last year October, Southview an investment arm of Bomaid, owned 93 percent of MRI while Motor Vehicle Accident Fund held three percent. The remaining four percent was held by “other minority shareholders.” Since this dissolution, only Bomaid holds interests in MRI.
Before the dissolution MRI HR department was administered through Southview.
The clash between Southview and the MRI MD came after she allegedly recommended for the contract renewal of a nurse employed by MRI in Ghagoo mine.
At the time, Southview approved the extension of the nurse's contract insisting on processes like the interviewing of candidates who applied and selection of the best candidate, according to information seen by this publication.
Documents suggest that this process was ignored and the MRI MD went ahead and renewed the nurse's contract without following conditions issued by the mother company, Southview.
After the dissolution in 2016, Southview handed over all the operations including HR to MRI a move which insiders claim to have been due to Matabiswana's motivation.
According to sources, since October 2016 after Southview was dissolved, she had been hands-on with HR issues and was allegedly making sure she is surrounded by “yes men” who are mostly foreigners. According to information reaching this publication, this made her flout some HR practices and to disregard MRI's localization policy.
This publication has seen information where Southview asked her to localize positons of Operations Manager, Call Centre Supervisor and nurse (Ghagoo) because there are capable and qualified Batswana who could fill the posts but she did not.
“Matabiswana would just take Southview HR recommendations and ignore them. She does not want to hire locals but hires foreigners, mostly Zimbabweans, who are her fellow countrymen. She likes working with foreigners because they are pushovers while locals demand their labour rights,” alleged a source.
Another controversy that irked the whistle-blowers is the “handpicking” of MRI HR Officer (name withheld) who was retrenched by Southview from MRI last year December during the dissolution process.
In his retrenchment package letter seen by The Botswana Gazette the HR Officer got an exit package of P325 080.
The HR Officer was seconded to MRI by Southview before his retrenchment.
After enjoying his package, the said officer was hand-picked back to MRI by Matabiswana sources say.
Communication involving MRI top management seen by this publication when Southview was dissolved shows that “all staff were migrated to Bomaid save for positions that were deemed excess to Bomaid which are the shared services including position of HR Officer, therefore the staff in the positions were retrenched accordingly after consultations with them.”
According to sources the HR Officer is being used to flout HR or recruitment processes to hire or fire employees willy-nilly.In 2015 before it was dissolved, Southview had warned its subsidiaries of handpicking people to positions.
All applications and CVs were required to be handed to the HR department which was under the stewardship of Southview. Sources allege that the said HR Officer did not go through an interview process and had never applied for the post.
In the Staff Welfare Service Quality Committee Meeting Management Reports for Quarter 3 2016 minutes seen by this publication, Matabiswana's age became a big issue when Southview recommended that her contract be reviewed. According to the recommendations seen by this publication it was apparent that Southview wanted her out because she was over the retirement age and her contract was supposed to expire on 31 March 2017. The Botswana Gazette turned up information that Matabiswana turns 63 this coming November. According to Southview's Clause 11.1 of Conditions of Service of MRI contract renewal for fixed term contract, staff shall be subject to compulsory retirement of 60 years.
Sources claim that Matabiswana is not competent but is being favoured by the MRI Board which used its discretion to extend her contract.
The same Clause 11.1 further stipulates that if the employee possesses specialized skills the company may give her the nod. It is not clear which “specialized skills” Matabiswana possesses however MRI Board chairman Abel Bogatsu confirmed that it was the board's decision to renew her contract.
He however would not be drawn into elucidating why Matabiswana was given a new term and which specialized skills she possesses. Bogatsu also denied allegations of favoritism.
When contacted for comment Bomaid HR Manager who was also the Group HR Manager before Southview was disbanded, Bennett Maifala said he stopped handling MRI recruitments including contract extensions in October 2016. This means that after the separation of MRI Southview and Bomaid, Matabiswana remained at the helm of all the HR operations of MRI. Maifala referred this publication's enquiries to MRI.
In two interviews conducted by this publication Matabiswana denied the allegations leveled against her.
She said the incumbent in the position of operations manager is indispensable even though he is a foreigner since he possesses very competitive academic credentials and experience.
Matabiswana added that currently there are less than 10 Batswana registered with BHPC at Advanced Life Support Paramedic level. She said this position was advertised in the local media but no one responded to the post advert.
She promised that the Call Centre Supervisor position will be localized in 2018. According to Matabiswana the Ghaghoo onsite nurse does not only possess a nursing qualification but is also an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) a skill which is also locally scarce hence hiring a foreigner. She said she supports localization policy and that out of a staff complement of 186 staff in MRI only 6 (3%) are expatriates.
On the allegedly ‘hand-picked” HR Officer the MRI MD said pursuant to Section 25 (3) of the Employment Act, if an employer seeks to fill position in occupations to which it had retrenched employees, priority of employment shall be given to those whose contracts were terminated due to retrenchment. Matabiswana said the re-employment was therefore consequent to this legal requirement which as a company they are legally bound to adhere to and again, failing to which they would have been in contravention to clause 25 (4) of the Employment Act that would have rendered them liable to a penalty.
“Over and above that, he possessed the requisite qualifications and experience for the job. His retrenchment was not in any way a result of his incompetence or poor work performance but rather because of organizational structural changes,” she said. The HR officer's mobile phone rang unanswered when contacted for comment.
ISLAMABAD - The Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) has achieved “major breakthrough” in the case of narcotics smuggling through aircraft of state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the interior minister was informed on Wednesday.
Director-General ANF Major General Musarat Nawaz Malik on Wednesday told Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan that the force had got a major lead in the smuggling cases, a spokesperson of the interior ministry said.
In a telephonic conversation, the DG ANF informed the minister that some arrests were made in this regard and more developments were expected in the next few weeks.
The minister has directed the ANF that there should be no leniency towards the culprits as the incident had damaged the country's repute. “The cases should be taken to its logical end at [the] earliest,” said Nisar.
The recovery of heroin from two PIA aircraft, one at Heathrow Airport London and second at Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad sent a wave of shock among government circles. The government feared that the incidents might have consequence of banning of the PIA flights in Europe and other countries.
Earlier, in the first week of June, the ANF had told the Senate Standing Committee on Interior that no arrest had been made so far in the two separate incidents as they could not get a lead in the case till yet.
Brig Hammad Ahmed Dogar, enforcement commander ANF had informed the committee that the force had probed around 60 suspects including ground staff at the airport, its sanitary workers and cabin crew but no arrest could be made in the case yet.
The ANF officer said that a separate inquiry headed by senior police officer Hussain Asghar was underway on the directions of the prime minister and his findings would have much more significance.
“All agencies concerned including the ANF, and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) etc are included in this inquiry team,” he had said. The prime minister had to use the same plane, from which heroin was found at the Islamabad airport two days later, for his foreign tour and this could have caused embracement for Pakistan, if heroin was found in the plane of the prime minister at some international airport.
British authorities are conducting a separate probe into the London incident themselves and authorities here in Pakistan claim that the UK had not shared any findings of the inquiry with Pakistan. On May 22, 14.7 kg of heroin was recovered from a London-bound PIA flight at the Benazir Bhutto International Airport during an inspection led by the ANF.
Earlier, British authorities in the second week of May had said that they had found a “quantity of heroin” from a PIA flight that had landed at Heathrow Airport.
Later, it emerged that the quantity was around 11kg.

Stonehouse Town have moved into third place in the Gloucestershire County League with a 5-3 win at Gala Wilton.
They opened the scoring on 17 minute from a long ball from the right to the far post and Liam Gale nipped in behind the home defence to side foot home.
On 26 minutes Lee Keveren scored his first of three for the afternoon when he was put clear to coolly slot the ball home.
Six minutes later Keveren was at it again this time waltzing past three home defenders to make it 3-0.
Gala's Ryan Dobbins headed home on 37 minutes to make it 3-1 but right on half time Robert Humphries netted a fourth for Stonehouse from a corner.
Josh Emery hit an unstoppable shot into the Stonehouse net on 54 minutes and four minutes later Ryan Dobbins controlled a great cross into the box to strike number three for Gala.
The visitors got a fifth on 89 minutes from a long throw that seem to avoid everyone except Lee Keveren who knocked the ball home for his hat-trick.
Broadwell Amateurs, who started the day having lost only two games so far this season, came up against promotion hopefuls Lebeq United.
The home side almost drew first blood on 10 minutes but Jordan Sheens shot from a great run down the flank went just the wrong side of the post.
It was Lebeq who took the lead on 36 minutes a great goal from Leroy Swaby curling his shot into the top corner from the edge of the box.
After having two shouts for a penalty turned away the home side eventually were awarded a penalty on 64 minutes with Paul Manns stepping up to take it but they could not believe it when his shot went the wrong side of the upright.
After end to end play Lebeq finally got the break they needed when Cameron Brown played a one-two with James Hall and then fired his shot under Jamie Merry with seven minutes to go.
Hardwicke came away from the Forest of Dean with three points after defeating Ruardean Hill Rangers 2-1.
No goals in the first 45 minutes with Hardwicke taking the lead on 65 minutes from the penalty spot after the home side had their keeper sent off - Paul Carter stepped up to make sure from the spot.
Five minutes later the home side were level when Ricky Tingle netted from a corner.
The winner came in the 80 minute from the foot of Will Matthews firing home an unstoppable shot from the right side of the box.
Washington: US president Donald Trump claimed vindication Saturday in the probe into Russian interference with the 2016 White House election, following the release of a controversial memo implying partisanship at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The declassified Republican document released Friday claimed that Democratic-funded research prompted the FBI to spy on a former Trump campaign aide.
"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe," the president tweeted, referring to himself in the third person.
"But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on," he said, continuing with a misspelling: "Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2018
In the evening, Trump tweeted: "Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages -- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!"

Democrats and some Republicans say the memo — drafted by Devin Nunes, a Trump transition official, congressman and House Intelligence Committee chairman — is a thinly veiled effort to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties with Russia, and possible obstruction of justice.
The document has glaring holes, detractors say, and the FBI itself said it had "grave concerns" over its accuracy.
Adam Schiff, senior Democratic member on the House Intelligence Committee, countered Trump's claims of vindication.
"Quite the opposite, Mr President," Schiff said in a tweet.
"The most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo was that FBI investigation began July 2016 with your advisor, Papadopoulos, who was secretly discussing stolen Clinton emails with the Russians."
Probe seen continuing regardless
He was referring to George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, who was charged by Mueller's team and pleaded guilty to lying over his Russian contacts.
Trey Gowdy, a Republican lawmaker who this week said he would not seek reelection, told CBS' Face the Nation the president was off the mark.
"I'm sure the president is frustrated," Gowdy said, but he added that he doesn't think the memo "has any impact on the Russia probe."
Gowdy noted that he himself helped draft the memo but said that, even without the Democratic-funded dossier it refers to, there would still be an investigation of other alleged links to Russia.
The memo "also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice," he added.
"So there's going to be a Russia probe, even without a dossier," Gowdy said.
Separately, Trump — who is spending the weekend at his Florida resort — crowed on Twitter about his approval ratings.
Rasmussen pollsters "just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain 'sacred cows.' Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday!"

It was unclear which "sacred cows" Trump was referring to.
Trump's job approval rating is 41.9 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average of various polls.
Deception Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Robo Hunters, Displacing Legacy Cybersecurity Solutions
March 2018 by Mechelle Buys Du Plessis, Managing Director – UAE, Dimension Data
Internet of Things is rapidly expanding the attack surface of the digital enterprise and exposing it to enhanced risk levels not seen before. Deception technologies, artificial intelligence, Robo-hunters, are solutions for tomorrow's enterprise, Mechelle Buys Du Plessis, Managing Director – UAE, Dimension Data.
The convergence between operational and digital technologies is well underway, being driven by the use cases around Internet of Things. Digitally enabling both new and old machines, devices, sensors, and other objects with connectivity, provides benefits not realized before. Real-life and real-time data is much more accessible on the edge of the network and can be rapidly processed to give business insights and business benefit. This results in increased productivity, reduced operational costs, higher levels of safety, and overall better decision making, amongst others.
While the gains are widespread and adoption is increasing in an exponential fashion, there is a downside to this rapidly snowballing trend. The fact is many sensor manufacturers are just not doing enough to secure their products by not including encryption in the product development stage. Since sensors are light weight objects with a low footprint, adding on additional security at a later stage may not be feasible.
This inherent deficiency of large-scale object-based networks in the future, is going to drive the creation of deception technologies, to confuse intrusive malware through the presence of real and fake user identities. Transformative scale-out converged networks, including supervisory control and data acquisition control system architectures or SCADA, operational technologies, and wider IoT infrastructure, will see huge security gains through the presence of deception technologies.
Deception technologies create thousands of fake, user credential in conjunction with real user-identities. Once a threat actor is inside an organization's network, they are unable to distinguish between real and fake user identity credentials. Since there are many more fake user identity credentials distributed, the probability of engaging with a fake user identity credential and triggering an intrusion alert is much higher. Afterwards an incident response alert and action are then initiated. The large number of fake credentials generated through deception technologies also facilitate pattern tracking. This allows internal teams to recreate the pattern of attack and point of entry.
To further strengthen their cybersecurity defences, digitally transformative organizations will begin to tap the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to secure their networks. While these buzzwords are already in place, they have been defined by programmer-built algorithms, limiting the amount of self-learning. Machine learning applied to cybersecurity has traditionally been driven by algorithms that give instructions on the types of malware and their associated behaviour inside internal networks. Now machine learning will be replaced by deep learning applied to cybersecurity.
With deep learning techniques, cybersecurity applications are aided by self-learning technologies. User behaviour is monitored over a period of time using deep learning technologies, and a user behaviour profile is established. This profile is a dynamic one and deep learning technologies continue to add usage patterns, till the profile becomes intrinsic to a particular user. Deep learning applications develop highly granular patterns and analysis of end user activities.
The presence of a threat actor inside a network using an assumed credential, will have a deviant user pattern. This divergent pattern of accessing the network, monitored by behavioural analytics, will trigger a security remediation alert without delay. Examples of such proactive and rapid approach to securing convergent and transformative networks, will take behavioural analytics applied to cybersecurity to a new level. With these intuitive gains around the corner, cybersecurity vendors will continue to integrate deep learning technologies into their products in the year ahead.
Artificial intelligence technologies will also create a new generation of proactive and defensive cybersecurity products called Robo-hunters. Enabled by artificial intelligence, Robo-hunters are automated threat-seekers that scan an organization's environment for potential threats. Since they are built on predictive behavioural analytics, they have available a baseline of normal network activity behaviour.
Robo-hunters scan an organization's environment for any changes that might indicate a potential threat. As they scan the environment, they learn from what they discover, and take remediation action as required. Hence, they are built to make decisions on behalf of humans. Robo-hunters also help deliver a long-standing expectation of the cybersecurity department, which is to access threat intelligence and to track the enemy within.
The cybersecurity stage is set. The threat landscape is too fast moving, too complex, and with enormously high stakes, to rely on present day technologies alone. Artificial intelligence coupled with predictive analytics and high degree of compute, as well as a trusted security partner, will provide a welcome relief in the not so distant future.

Sword Words
This week's words
contretemps
Photo: Josh Davis Sword Words A.Word.A.Day with Anu Garg
If you have ever wondered whether the word fence as in “Good fences make good neighbors” and the word fence as in “dealing with stolen car stereos” and the word fence as in “swinging sharp metallic blades” have any connection, here's your answer: yes. All three owe their origins to the word defense (or defence, for you Brits).
Of the three senses of the word fence discussed today, this week we'll focus on sharp metallic blades.
Hundreds of years of fencing has thrust a number of words into the English language, many now used metaphorically. We saw some of them a while ago and now it's time to visit some more.
While swordplay is good, wordplay is better. Sometimes just the right word, the right remark, the right joke can disarm an adversary. Remember, you may be swordless but you are never wordless. contretemps PRONUNCIATION: the last syllable is nasal (KON-truh-tan, kawn-truh-TAN), plural contretemps (-tanz)
MEANING: noun:
1. An unforeseen and unfortunate occurrence.
2. A disagreement or dispute.
ETYMOLOGY: Originally contretemps was a fencing term meaning a pass or thrust made at a wrong moment. From French contre- (against) + (time). Earliest documented use: 1684.
USAGE:

BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened military intervention in Venezuela, a surprise escalation of Washington's response to Venezuela's political crisis that Caracas disparaged as "craziness."
Venezuela has appeared to slide toward a more volatile stage of unrest in recent days, with anti-government forces looting weapons from a military base after a new legislative body usurped the authority of the opposition-controlled congress.
"The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary," Trump told reporters in an impromptu question and answer session.
The comments appeared to shock Caracas, with Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino calling the threat "an act of craziness."
The White House said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the White House appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak to Venezuela's leader when democracy was restored in that country.
Venezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.
In Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were "baseless."
Trump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.
Asked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. "We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue," he said.
Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.

"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela," he said in a statement. "Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on whom the Executive lashes out at today."
'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'
The president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its "backyard" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.
The U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.
Trump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.
"Maduro must be thrilled right now," said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. "It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say."
The United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.
Maduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.
Washington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.
Venezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.
The United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.
About a year ago, Asus launched its ZenFone 5 Deluxe. It was a big deal for Asus, since this was the company's first ever premium flagship smartphone. But despite all of its efforts, the device fell short of my expectations and as per my review was not up to the mark. In fact, I even concluded that the lesser priced OnePlus 3T (which was a damn good smartphone) was a better choice and it was priced a lot lower as well.
That was the end of 2016, and now, more than a year later, things have changed… drastically. And after doing all of its homework, Asus is back to challenge OnePlus and it could not have come at a better time, when OnePlus built its most polished smartphone ever, the OnePlus 6.
Given its competitive pricing, it is obvious that Asus has built its smartphone with the OnePlus 6 in its crosshairs. A year ago, Huawei's Honor sub-brand tried a similar trick with the Honor 8 Pro and it too came pretty close to the OnePlus 5, but lost out due to its Kirin SoC despite its good build quality.
And now its Asus' turn. So how do the two smartphones compare on paper? Let's have a look.

Now that you have gone through the specifications, it's easy to conclude that both smartphones come equipped and are out to challenge one another in the numbers game.
Whether it's RAM, storage, battery capacity or SoC, both smartphones have packed in enough to give you a tough time selecting one from the other.
But there's are some details that separate the two budget flagships and one of them is software.
Software
Asus has come a long way with its Zen UI and it has integrated AI bits that are supposed to make the software experience smarter and hassle-free. But is that what buyers want? Or is their definition of hassle-free OS closer to a stock, no frills version of OxygenOS that comes with the OnePlus 6?
Eventually, it all boils down to this; more so, because the pricing is so competitive!
Camera
Then comes the camera. While both smartphones offer a dual camera setup, their approach to the same is quite different. Asus with its ZenFone 5Z has gone with dual camera setup which offers a standard and a wide-angle lens. This may appeal to people who love to click travel photos that allow them to capture more into their photos without the need to shoot a panorama. But it comes with a catch. There's no autofocus system available on the wide-angle lens, so I really can't vouch for the added benefit without putting it through its paces in my full review (that should be out soon).
OnePlus takes a different approach with the camera, with the primary camera being a 16 MP unit and a secondary camera with 20 MP resolution. More than optical zoom, the 20 MP sensor is meant to deliver sharper images. This can be handy depending on the lighting scenario.
Weight
I also give one additional point to Asus for the ZenFone 5Z's weight. With glass and metal bodies now becoming a standard, most smartphones have increased in heft and weight. With this in mind, the ZenFone seems to have gone on a diet at just 155 grams versus the OnePlus 6's 177 grams. This is partially thanks to Asus' design that goes with a flat glass as opposed to the curved 3D glass on the OnePlus 6, which needs to be thicker because of its curvy design.
Storage
Asus has also smartly included expandable memory. The Asus ZenFone 5Z features a hybrid SIM tray that allows users to swap one nano-SIM with a micro SD card. This increases the device's storage capacity by quite a bit giving users the ability to add an additional 256 GB microSD card.
It's clear from the above specifications and features that Asus has done its homework this year. But is it enough to dethrone the mighty force of the OnePlus 6?
While I'll reserve my observations for my review of the Asus ZenFone 5Z, it is evidently clear that Asus is back in the game and competitively priced offerings like the ZenFone 5Z and the recently launched ZenFone Max Pro M1 are indicators of this.
OnePlus, better watch out!
Las Cafeteras Celebrates Love In The Time Of Borders
Enlarge this image toggle caption Rafael Cardenas/Courtesy of the Artist Rafael Cardenas/Courtesy of the Artist
Just as President Trump called out Congressman Keith Ellison, Deputy Chair of the DNC, for wearing one of Las Cafeteras' t-shirts that declares, "'I do not believe in borders," the border-busting and genre-blending band share a homage to immigrant love and sacrifice with the "Tiempos De Amor" video, premiered by Alt.Latino.
"Tiempos De Amor" was originally written to document the strength of migrant families and in pointed response to what the band considers the President's open contempt for Mexican immigrants. With lyrics such as "I would cross any river, to be close to you," band member Daniel Jesús French calls the tune an immigrant's version of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
YouTube
The music and dance performance of the video was filmed at Guelaguetza, a Los Angeles Oaxacan restaurant in a historical immigrant neighborhood. This visual segues from the strains of a traditional Oaxacan Marching Band into the smooth and always joyful beats of Las Cafeteras' trademark jarana-imbued urban folk, connecting the past and the present of the immigrant experience. Featuring the urban Afro-Latinx Dance Crew CONTRA-TIEMPO, Las Cafeteras worked with dancer Isis Avalos, a formerly undocumented Dreamer, as well as lead choreographer Ana Maria Alvarez to create the "Tiempo de Amor" visuals. The dance narrative emphasizes the theme of connection and uses both abstract movement and salsa and partner dancing motifs to explore ideas central to immigrant life: tension, distance, restriction and freedom. Framed by backdrops depicting indigenous and migrant life in Mexico, the video expresses a vision where borders notwithstanding, as the song proclaims, a people "the color of earth, born of flowers" move in authenticity and connect in radical joy as they improvise a new existence.
Several Charleston-area civil rights groups called for the shutdown of hatred in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The South Carolina chapter of the National Action Network, the North Charleston NAACP and the Coalition held a news conference Sunday at the Confederate Soldier Monument.
"We are better than what we've seen in our communities displayed," North Charleston NAACP President Pastor Thomas Dixon said. "We are better than what we see every Saturday and Sunday, right here on this Battery displayed when the South Carolina Secessionist Party comes here with Confederate battle flags and waves them on public property as if they are some kind of symbol of pride and unity. When really, they are symbols of terrorism, just as we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia, yesterday."
"The people of Charleston offer our condolences to the family of the three people that were killed in this horrific act of hate and violence in their city of Charlottesville," SCNAN President Elder James Johnson said. "Our prayers and thoughts goes out to them."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Emergency food aid for around a million Palestinians in Gaza may run out from June if the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees cannot raise another $200 million following a cut-off in U.S. funding, the agency said on Tuesday.

Pierre Kraehenbuehl, who heads the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) providing aid for Palestinians across the Middle East, said U.S. President Donald Trump had withheld $305 million in funding, far more than the $65 million reported in January.
“You already have a very, very fragile community (in Gaza),” Kraehenbuehl told Reuters in an interview during an international donor conference in Syria in Brussels.
“So if you suddenly have no certainty about the amount of food aid coming from the U.N. for a million people ... you can just imagine the kind of effects it could have,” he said, although he stressed he was not justifying any link to potential outbreaks of unrest.
Gulf states, Norway and Canada have stepped in with a total of $200 million to help meet a planned $465 million budget for 2018. The United States, long the biggest donor to the agency, is providing just $60 million of a promised $365 million, Kraehenbuehl said.
That leaves a $200 million shortfall to fill for rice, flour, sugar and also to keep funding schools in Gaza and the West Bank.
The U.N. agency's call for help is made harder by the competing demands on donors for crises in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among others.
Kraehenbuehl warned of greater instability in Gaza in part because the economy is already suffering its deepest collapse after a decade of Israeli-led blockades, and internal Palestinian divisions in the coastal strip.
Kraehenbuehl said the shortfall in funding for the agency could also mean there may not be enough money to re-open schools in August and September for the new academic year.
“This is our largest funding crisis ever,” he said.
More than two million Palestinians are packed into Gaza and while Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, it maintains tight control of Gaza's land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border.
RAMADAN DONATIONS?
Trump withheld the aid to UNRWA in January after questioning the value of such funding, while the U.S. State Department said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms.
Many Western diplomats saw Trump's decision as a reaction to the condemnation across the Middle East of his Dec. 6 decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and before any peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. The United Nations also voted to reject that recognition.
Kraehenbuehl, a Swiss national, said he had enacted spending cuts to contain costs within the agency and was trying to find new donors in the private sector. Those could be in Gulf countries, or donations made in solidarity with the Palestinians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Kraehenbuehl said that after donors such as Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had come forward, he would now seek help from Germany, France, Sweden and Britain, travelling to Berlin later this week. Israel is not a contributor to UNRWA.
“It's a modest investment to preserving the region from future instability and uncertainty,” he said.

The FMI on Monday forecast that temperatures across the country will drop midway into this week before rising again in time for next weekend, when scores of young people are expected to celebrate the end of the school year.
Finns have a few more days to enjoy the unusually warm early-summer weather, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).
“After that, the forecasts show signs of a fundamental change in the existing meteorological conditions,” a meteorologist at the FMI stated on Twitter.
The temperatures are therefore to drop closer to seasonal averages all across Finland.
Foreca estimated last week that the shift in the existing conditions will bring about a considerable change in temperatures especially in northern parts of the country, where the mercury will drop by up to 10°C. The drop in southern parts of the country is likely to be roughly five degrees, according to the private weather forecasting company.

WEST KELOWNA – A cougar has been prowling a residential area in West Kelowna.
Peter Haslock is on the strata council for the Terravita housing development in the Shannon Lake neighbourhood.
He says a fellow resident spotted the big cat at about 7 a.m. Monday as it ran past his deck and up a hillside along the third hole of the local golf course.
Haslock wants people to be aware of the predator's presence, especially as there are children in the vicinity.

SAN FRANCISCO With Chief Executive Travis Kalanick taking a leave of absence from Uber Technologies Inc, the vacant job of chief operating officer takes on a lot more importance as the company frames the position as key to solving its woes.Kalanick, under fire for crass behaviour and fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking, in early March announced he was searching for a COO to help run the ride-services company. But in the months since, Uber has suffered a string of controversies and embarrassing setbacks and the job has remained unfilled - part of a leadership vacuum that extends through the company and up to the board of directors.In a report released Tuesday, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, Covington & Burling, recommended sweeping management changes at Uber in the wake of sexual harassment allegations and other scandals. The report advocates for a COO who "will act as a full partner" and run "day-to-day operations." It also calls on the board of directors to take steps to limit the CEO's responsibilities and provide "clear lines of demarcation between" the COO and the CEO."The way the COO job is written in the recommendations makes it a really powerful and important job," said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser. Executive recruiters and tech investors agreed that the job might look more appealing now than it did before Tuesday's report. Still, it remains unclear if the company can attract a top-notch leader while Kalanick retains both the CEO title and, along with two allies, voting control of the company. Kalanick said on Tuesday he was stepping aside at Uber because he needed time to grieve his recently deceased mother and work on his leadership shortcomings, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He also said his leave "may be shorter or longer than we might expect."Such ambiguity will effect Uber's efforts to rebuild its executive ranks, startup experts say.
"The lack of clarity around Travis' position hangs over everything," said Bill Aulet, managing director of the entrepreneurship centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You're dealing with the most important thing, which is, who is your boss?"VACANCIES AT THE TOP
In the meantime, 14 people who report to Kalanick are charged with running the company until the CEO returns or a COO is hired. The company also is without a chief financial officer, general counsel and a head of engineering, among other open positions."We have a strong leadership team including veterans who helped make the business what it is today and new talent who are helping to drive the changes we're committed to making," Uber said in a statement.
Uber is struggling to recruit new employees and has many who are eager to leave. Ed Zschau, founder of Inductus Associates, an executive search firm for startups, said his firm has "people from Uber in the search process" for a new job, including senior-level employees."If the board can be recomposed a bit and get the company back on track, who the COO is will be an important signal as to whether people will want to work there," Zschau said.Concerns about a lack of leadership extend to the board of directors.Holder's recommendations, including prohibiting romantic relationships between bosses and their subordinates and drinking on the job, suggest the Uber board failed to ensure the company had even the most basic checks and balances, say experts.
"The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course," said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "The board shares responsibility for the wreck."Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture.On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report.The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats. Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington. Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, was added to the board this week as an independent director.The Holder recommendations call for a restructured board, but the recommendation to install an independent board chair was left up to the board only to consider.

With less than two days left in the month, statistics suggest May 2018 is on pace to be the driest on record.
A mere 1.6 millimetres of rain has fallen this month in Metro Vancouver, compared to the average monthly total for May of 65 millimetres.
There is, however, a chance of showers on May 31 so the month may not be record-setting.
If the dry weather holds, this could prove to be the driest May since data measurements began at the Vancouver International Airport in 1937.
Vancouver's driest May on record was in 2015, which saw just 4.2 millimetres of rainfall.
READ MORE: B.C.'s flood forecast is looking better, but we're still not out of the woods
Meanwhile, the mean temperature so far this month is 14.9 degrees, well above the long-term average of 12.8 degrees.
As of now, this is the third warmest on record. The highest mean temperature on record is 15.2 degrees in May 1958.
The pattern in the jet stream throughout the month of May drove moisture north and kept Metro Vancouver drier than normal.
The pattern shifted over the last couple of days, leading to cooler, wetter conditions.
Although it looks like the pattern will continue into early next week, the overall summer forecast for June, July and August is trending toward higher than normal temperatures and below normal precipitation levels.
If that is the case, this could be another challenging wildfire season.

Thinking caps are employed Wednesday as Clinton County officials and an interior designer reconfigure the current location of the Board of Elections into space suited to the common pleas court's Adult Probation Department. Among things getting worked out are having enough designated offices as well as open areas. The reconfigured space is expected to include a “testing toilet” where drug tests can be conducted on defendants rather than in a public restroom. As previously reported, the Board of Elections will relocate to the County Annex Building on South Nelson Avenue — a move expected to take place prior to the fall election season. In the photo foreground from left are Casler Design Group Interior Designer Elizabeth Visser and Clinton County Common Pleas Judge John W. “Tim” Rudduck, while in the background is Clinton County Commissioners President Patrick Haley. All of them are reviewing diagrammed floor space options.

SANS Experts Share Five Most Dangerous New Attack Techniques
April 2018 by SANS INSTITUTE
Experts from SANS recently presented the five most dangerous new cyber-attack techniques in their annual RSA keynote session in San Francisco, and shared their views on how they work, how they can be stopped or at least slowed, and how businesses and consumers can prepare.
The five threats outlined are:
1. Repositories and Cloud Storage Data Leakage
2. Big Data Analytics, De-Anonymization, and Correlation
3. Attackers Monetize Compromised Systems Using Crypto Coin Miners
4. Recognition of Hardware Flaws
5. More Malware and Attacks Disrupting ICS and Utilities Instead of Seeking Profit
Repositories and Cloud Storage Data Leakage
Ed Skoudis, a top hacker exploits expert, SANS Faculty Fellow and lead for the SANS Penetration Testing Curriculum, talked about the data leakage threats facing us from the increased use of repositories and cloud storage: “Software today is built in a very different way than it was 10 or even 5 years ago, with vast online code repositories for collaboration and cloud data storage hosting mission-critical applications. However, attackers are increasingly targeting these kinds of repositories and cloud storage infrastructures, looking for passwords, crypto keys, access tokens, and terabytes of sensitive data.” He continued: “Defenders need to focus on data inventories, appointing a data curator for their organization and educating system architects and developers about how to secure data assets in the cloud. Additionally, the big cloud companies have each launched an AI service to help classify and defend data in their infrastructures. And finally, a variety of free tools are available that can help prevent and detect leakage of secrets through code repositories.”
Big Data Analytics, De-Anonymisation, and Correlation
Skoudis went on to talk about the threat of Big Data Analytics and how attackers are using data from several sources to de-anonymise users: “In the past, we battled attackers who were trying to get access to our machines to steal data for criminal use. Now the battle is shifting from hacking machines to hacking data — gathering data from disparate sources and fusing it together to de-anonymise users, find business weaknesses and opportunities, or otherwise undermine an organisation's mission. We still need to prevent attackers from gaining shell on targets to steal data. However, defenders also need to start analysing risks associated with how their seemingly innocuous data can be combined with data from other sources to introduce business risk, all while carefully considering the privacy implications of their data and its potential to tarnish a brand or invite regulatory scrutiny.”
Attackers Monetize Compromised Systems Using Crypto Coin Miners
Johannes Ullrich, is Dean of Research, SANS Institute and Director of SANS Internet Storm Center. He has been looking at the increasing use of crypto coin miners by cyber criminals: “Last year, we talked about how ransomware was used to sell data back to its owner and crypto-currencies were the tool of choice to pay the ransom. More recently, we have found that attackers are no longer bothering with data. Due to the flood of stolen data offered for sale, the value of most commonly stolen data like credit card numbers of PII has dropped significantly. Attackers are instead installing crypto coin miners. These attacks are more stealthy and less likely to be discovered and attackers can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month from crypto coin miners. Defenders therefore need to learn to detect these coin miners and to identify the vulnerabilities that have been exploited in order to install them.”
Recognition of Hardware Flaws
Ullrich then went on to say that software developers often assume that hardware is flawless and that this is a dangerous assumption. He explains why and what needs to be done:
“Hardware is no less complex then software and mistakes have been made in developing hardware just as they are made by software developers. Patching hardware is a lot more difficult and often not possible without replacing entire systems or suffering significant performance penalties. Developers therefore need to learn to create software without relying on hardware to mitigate any security issues. Similar to the way in which software uses encryption on untrusted networks, software needs to authenticate and encrypt data within the system. Some emerging homomorphic encryption algorithms may allow developers to operate on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first.”
Malware and Attacks Disrupting ICS and Utilities Instead of Seeking Profit Finally, Head of R&D, SANS Institute, and top UK cyber threat expert, James Lyne, discussed the growing trend in malware and attacks that aren't profit centred as we have largely seen in the past, but instead are focused on disrupting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and utilities:
“Day to day the grand majority of malicious code has undeniably been focused on fraud and profit. Yet, with the relentless deployment of technology in our societies, the opportunity for political or even military influence only grows. And rare publicly visible attacks like Triton/TriSYS show the capability and intent of those who seek to compromise some of the highest risk components of industrial environments, i.e. the safety systems which have historically prevented critical security and safety meltdowns.”
He continued: “ICS systems are relatively immature and easy to exploit in comparison to the mainstream computing world. Many ICS systems lack the mitigations of modern operating systems and applications. The reliance on obscurity or isolation (both increasingly untrue) do not position them well to withstand a heightened focus on them, and we need to address this as an industry. More worrying is that attackers have demonstrated they have the inclination and resources to diversify their attacks, targeting the sensors that are used to provide data to the industrial controllers themselves. The next few years are likely to see some painful lessons being learned as this attack domain grows, since the mitigations are inconsistent and quite embryonic.”

Los Angeles police conducted an illegal search of the home of the man accused of stalking and breaking into Sandra Bullock's mansion, a state appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The three-judge panel unanimously ruled that detectives violated Joshua Corbett's right to remain silent and thus did not obtain valid consent to enter his Montrose home, where detectives found a cache of illegal automatic weapons. As a result, the court said, evidence from the search could not be used in court.
The court's opinion, written by Presiding Justice Laurie Zelon, upholds the finding of a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge and lands a major blow to the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
The ruling could result in 24 of the 26 felony charges against Corbett being tossed out — gutting most of the case.
Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said prosecutors are reviewing the opinion and weighing options on how to proceed. Capt. Andrew Neiman, a spokesman for the LAPD, declined to comment.
Corbett was arrested inside Bullock's Hollywood Hills mansion on the morning of June 8, 2014, and he was later charged with stalking and burglary in addition to weapons violations. He remains housed in Los Angeles County jail on more than $2.1-million bail.
Detectives determined that Corbett had scaled two gates of the home and managed to force open a sun room's glass door that opened onto a rear patio.
Authorities said Bullock, who was alone in the house, was awakened by a strange knocking sound coming from her third-floor workout room.
She peeked out of her bedroom door, saw a man clad in black sneaking down the corridor and retreated to her bedroom closet, where she dialed 911.
At the time of his arrest, Corbett had a notebook with a love letter addressed to the Academy Award-winning actress that said, “You are my wife by law, the law of God and belong to me,” authorities said. He also had a concealed weapon permit from Utah.
Corbett did not have a gun on him at Bullock's home, but investigators linked him to eight firearms registered in his name.
About 30 hours after he was arrested — and before he was able to make a phone call — detectives began questioning him. At the end of the interrogation, police said that he consented both verbally and in writing to a search of his home. He also provided investigators with the combination to a safe that contained more than 30 weapons.
But Corbett's attorneys argued that the questioning was unlawful and pointed out that detectives ignored his requests not to be interviewed and pressured him to sign a consent form of the search by threatening to use “a pry bar and battering ram” to open his parents' home.
“There is no dispute that Corbett's 5th Amendment rights were violated here,” the ruling issued Tuesday said. “The police ignored his repeated and unambiguous invocations of his right to remain silent and continued to interrogate him.”
The appellate court also noted what LAPD Det. Christina Carlozzi wrote to the prosecutor on the case after she reviewed a transcript of the interrogation: “Doesn't look good. I honestly hope this can be settled without a trial.”
Prosecutors tried to argue that the guns and other evidence recovered in the warrantless search would have inevitably been discovered, but the appellate court rejected that argument. The ruling stated that police did not indicate they took steps that would have led them to illegal firearms, other than the unlawful interrogation.
The judges also stated that the “inevitable discovery” exception does not apply when detectives could have obtained a search warrant but chose not to; the opinion said LAPD detectives had enough probable cause to seek a warrant but elected to rely on Corbett's purported consent.
An attorney representing Corbett could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening. But defense attorney Stephen Sitkoff previously told The Times that his client needs mental health treatment, not incarceration, and that is why his legal team was vigorously trying to quash the gun charges.
Sitkoff said that once the majority of charges are dismissed, the legal team will seek a reduction in Corbett's $2-million bail. He has been held in the county jail since his 2014 arrest.
During his interview with detectives, Corbett acknowledged that he had done something wrong but said he did not want to hurt Bullock: “I don't think people protect her well enough.”
As he was arrested inside the actress' home — on property that is surrounded by a chain-link fence with barbed wire — he repeatedly called out to Bullock, referring to her as “Sandy,” according to court papers.
“Sandy, I'm sorry,” he said. “Please don't press charges.”

James Woods is retiring from the entertainment industry and news of his exit came in the most unusual of ways on Friday: through a press release related to a property he's selling in Rhode Island.
The Oscar-nominated star's news came via the real estate agent Allen Gammons, who is listing Woods' Exeter, R.I., lake property, according to the Associated Press.
Gammons said the 70-year-old “Ray Donovan” alum wants to relax and simplify his life by selling his many real estate holdings on both coasts, the Providence Journal reported. He added that since Woods' brother and mother recently died, the veteran actor hopes to spend more time on passions including photography, antiquing and poker.
The $1.39-million property sits on Boone Lake in Exeter and is one of Woods' four Rhode Island homes, the Journal said. It includes two lakefront houses and has been in the Woods family for decades. Woods will also keep a pied-à-terre in the state, he added.
The outspoken conservative actor, whose major credits include “Casino,” “Once Upon a Time in America,” “Rudy,” “Too Big to Fail” and his Oscar-nominated turns in 1986's “Salvador” and 1996's “Ghosts of Mississippi,” has said his political views have made it challenging to find work in Hollywood. However, Gammons said Woods' decision to retire was not political.
The move comes on the heels of last month's Twitter brouhaha with Armie Hammer and Amber Tamblyn, who accused Woods of hitting on her when she was 16 — an allegation that he called a lie.
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreans are buying more gold and ready to eat meals, while the government plans to expand nation-wide civil defence drills planned for this month as rhetoric between North Korea and the United States ramps up tension.
Long used to living within the range of North Korea's artillery, people in the South have generally ignored its aggressiveness and series of nuclear and long-range missile tests.
But this week, as Pyongyang exchanged increasingly angry words with the United States, there are worries of a clash erupting along the heavily militarised frontier which divides the two Koreas.
Combat Ration Inc, which makes 2 billion won ($1.75 million) of annual revenue selling ready to eat meals, said sales had surged as much as 50 percent in the past week compared to the average.
"Since 2006, when North Korea first conducted its nuclear test, there wasn't this much response as people became immune to frequent missile launches and nuclear tests," said Yoon Hee-yeul, the chief executive of Combat Ration, based in the southeastern city of Daegu.
"I feel it's different this time," said Yoon, who's been in the business since 2004.
Ready to eat meals maker Babmart, based in eastern Seoul, and another Seoul-based online seller, jun2food.com, also said sales have increased. Officials at both companies attributed the surge to the heightened tension.
North Korea said on Thursday its army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.
U.S. President Donald Trump said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was not going to get away with his "horrific" comments and disrespecting America.
"Koreans used to be numb to North Korea's threats, however, it seems different this time, and people are taking it seriously," said Song Jong-gil, an official of Korea Gold Exchange 3M, where sales of mini gold bars have surged five-fold since Aug. 9.
After Trump's "fire and fury" threat heightened tension, average daily sales volume has been 250 bars, ranging in weight between 10 grams (0.35 oz) and 100 grams (3.5 oz), versus about 50 earlier, Song said, adding the trend would continue through August.
Investors widely consider gold a safe-haven asset at times of growing geopolitical risk or economic uncertainty. South Koreans, who are still technically at war with their combative neighbours, are no exception.

Experts say if North Korea did launch intermediate-range missiles toward Guam, all its other missiles and artillery would be ready for action. Hundreds of thousands of troops and huge arsenals are arrayed on both sides of the tense demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
At least 1,000 of the North's artillery pieces are capable of reaching densely populated Seoul and its metropolitan area, home to some 25 million people.
BIGGER DRILLS
Seoul is expanding its participation in a nationwide civil defence drill, set to take place on Aug. 23, Shim Kang-cheon, a local Seoul government official, told Reuters.
Slideshow (2 Images)
The five-minute drill begins with a siren on radio, and cars are stopped at designated spots. Pedestrians are escorted off the streets and taken to safe spots like subway stations.
All of Seoul's 25 districts will participate in the drill this year, Shim said, compared to just five last year.
In a recent message, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said, "Since North Korea is very close to crossing the red line, Seoul needs to ramp up all defence measures against North Korea's potential threat," said another Seoul city official who asked not to be identified by name.
The drill coincides with the four-day "Ulji Freedom Guardian" military manoeuvres on August 21-24, which are held yearly and include joint exercises by the U.S. and South Korean armed forces, as well as drills for emergencies.
But many officials say there is a long way to go to raise public awareness about civil defence. At two subway stations visited by Reuters on Friday, many people didn't know the locations were among Seoul's more than 3,200 designated bomb shelters.
Few bomb shelters have long-term supplies of food, water, medical kits or gas masks, because the mostly private owners of the shelters get no public funding.
"Since the subway stations in South Korea have enough depth and strength, we will be able to survive attacks. It is just a shame that such infrastructure is not advertised well to the public and that we are short of emergency supplies," said Yang Uk, senior fellow at Korea Defense and Security Forum, a research institute in Seoul.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. >> Nick Foles has a calling far greater than throwing touchdown passes.
If Foles leads the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots, hell become a folk hero in a city that has desperately waited for a championship since 1960.
But that wont define Foles in the big picture. He has more important plans for his future.
I want to be a pastor in a high school, Foles said Thursday. Its on my heart. I took a leap of faith last year and signed up to take classes at seminary. I wanted to continue to learn and challenge my faith. Its a challenge because you are writing papers that are biblically correct. You want to impact peoples hearts.

Foles is part of a team that has a strong Christian brotherhood. MVP contender Carson Wentz has been outspoken about his faith and many players spend a lot of time together in prayer, studying the Bible and sharing devotionals.
Foles was one of the study leaders during his first stint in Philadelphia and has become a go-to source for younger guys. Left guard Stefen Wisniewksi also plans to become a pastor after his career ends.
Guys like Nick and Wis can spit out scripture all day and its awesome to take in that knowledge, said special teams ace Kamu Grugier-Hill.
Foles is passionate about helping students find their way and plans to use his experiences to inspire and encourage them.
When I speak to (students), thats such a time of young men and young womens lives that theres a lot of things that are thrown at them. So much temptation in this world, so much going on with social media and the internet that you want to talk to them and address it and share all the weaknesses I have because Ive fallen many times, Foles said. Its something I want to do. I cant play football forever. Ive been blessed with an amazing platform and its just a door God has opened, but I still have a lot of school left and a long journey.
Foles, who was offensive MVP of the Pro Bowl following the 2013 season, contemplated retirement after he asked the Rams to release him last year. He ended up going to Kansas City and reuniting with Andy Reid, who drafted him in the third round in Philadelphia in 2012.
He says prayer helped him decide to stay in the NFL, and he returned to the Eagles to be Wentzs backup. When Wentz tore his left ACL in Week 14, Foles stepped in and led Philadelphia. He was spectacular against Minnesota in the NFC championship, tossing four touchdown passes in a 38-7 win.
Foles  not Tom Brady  has the highest passer rating in postseason history for quarterbacks whove thrown at least 75 passes. Foles has completed 72 of 96 passes for 793 yards, with five touchdowns and no interceptions in three games for a 116.4 passer rating.
It took a lot more faith to come back and play than it wouldve to go in the other direction, Foles said. Either way wouldve been fine. Either way, I wouldve trusted in God. I wouldve done something else and glorified God in that instance.
The reason I decided to come back is Ive loved the game of football since I was a kid, I loved playing sports, I loved being part of a team, and I knew as a person that the more growth Ive had and the more opportunity I would have to glorify God and trust in him would be to go back and play football.

Despite the down season, Sunday was a momentous afternoon in Denver Broncos history.
Demaryius Thomas passed Shannon Sharpe for career touchdowns and receiving yards and into second place on the team's all-time list. But, besides that career mark, the defense did something rare in the game, too.
Denver shutout the New York Jets 23-0, which was the first time in 12 years a Broncos defense disallowed a single point in a game. And, it was even rarer than that, as it was the first time since 2010 an NFL team both shut out an opponent and allowed less than 100 total yards.
Broncos' D vs NYJ was the first in the NFL to shut out an opponent & hold to 100 yds or less in 7 yrs (SD in '10). It's now happened only 10 times in the NFL over the last 20 yrs. pic.twitter.com/c49Jc4De4e — Patrick Smyth (@psmyth12) December 11, 2017
And according to the team, it was also the 32nd straight time the Broncos have won the turnover battle and won the game, which is the longest current streak and now only two games away from tying the Green Bay Packers (2009-13) streak of such wins.
The Jets' two quarterbacks went only 8-21 passing in the game, and Josh McCown was sacked four times to lose 19 yards. Brandon Marshall, Shelby Harris and Von Miller each had a sack while the fourth one was credited to the team. McCown was also picked off by Darian Stewart, and the quarterback lost a fumble, too, while the Broncos racked up a total of seven tackles for losses.

BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump is poised to seek a trade investigation of China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property.
Trump signed an executive order Monday asking his trade office to consider the probe. In the midst of a 17-day vacation, Trump left his New Jersey golf club and returned to Washington to sign the order.
There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.
In a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.
China announced Monday it will cut off imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore and other goods in three weeks under U.N. sanctions imposed against Pyongyang.
Trump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second-largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.
Trump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through or outside of the World Trade Organization.
While Beijing has promised to open more industries to foreign companies, it also has issued new rules on electric car manufacturing, data security, internet censorship and other fields.
An administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.
As the crisis involving North Korea has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.
“I think China can do a lot more,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “And I think China will do a lot more.”
China, the isolated North's main trading partner, has been reluctant to push leader Kim Jong-un's regime too hard for fear it might collapse. But Beijing is increasingly frustrated with Pyongyang and supported a U.N. Security Council ban on Aug. 5 on coal and other key goods.
The Chinese customs agency said Monday that it will stop processing imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ores and fish at midnight on Sept. 5.
“After that, entry of these goods will be prohibited,” said an agency statement.
Trump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options “locked and loaded.” Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm, the officials said.
Trump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security, leading to speculation that raising the possibility of a probe – without committing to one – could be a negotiating tactic to get China to step up its assistance with North Korea.
The forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community, with reports suggesting that losses stemming from it could total hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.
Trump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.
Two small, left-leaning Quebec sovereigntist political parties have voted to join forces ahead of next year's provincial election.

Marvel's “Black Panther,” Chadwick Boseman, graduated from Howard University with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts (BFA) in 2000.
On May 12, Boseman returned to his alma mater to address the Class of 2018, while receiving an honorary degree.
The Howard University graduation is one of more than 100 Historically Black College and University graduations and one of more than 4,000 general graduations across the country.
On May 5, White House Correspondent April Ryan, brought down the house at Bennett College in North Carolina.
In Arkansas on the same day, journalist and political commentator Sophia Nelson, made lasting remarks during the Philander Smith College commencement exercise.
Across the nation, families are gathering, people are celebrating, and graduations are being hailed as an occasion of joy.
However, despite these many festivities, if you are a Black American who graduated from the University of Florida (UF), your achievements may have been marred by the horrible memory of faculty marshals physically pushing you off the stage, after you decided to celebrate your Black Greek (fraternity) pride, with the execution of a few “steps.”
More than 20 students were assaulted by the unidentified faculty member (although some say he is a chemistry lecturer), who is now on paid leave.
Why would the university continue to pay someone who seems to have differentially attacked Black students, as apparently no White students were assaulted or pushed off the stage?
This lecturer is a menace to society and college students, who should not be exposed to his racism, either on stage or in a classroom.
According to The New York Times, UF President W. Kent Fuchs apologized to the affected students and left a personal message of apology on Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity member Oliver Telusma's voicemail, due to the incident.
However, from where I sit, President Fuchs should track that student down along with all the others and visit them face-to-face.
The UF incident reminds Black students that graduation is but one of the many hurdles they must clear.
Every day, every single day, they face the possibility of pernicious racism, differential treatment, and the threat of law enforcement to compel compliance with the most foolish of laws and norms, spoken or unspoken.
That's why Holly Hylton, the White woman who managed a Philadelphia Starbucks, felt free to call the police on two Black men after they had been seated, without ordering anything.
That's why a hysterical White female bigot, called the police on a Black man, who was barbecuing in a public park in Oakland, California, where barbecuing is customary.
That's why the police were called on three Black women (and a White man), because they failed to wave or smile when they exited an Airbnb in Rialto, California, and were detained for 45 minutes despite possessing proof that they had reserved their space.
That's why the police wrestled a 25-year-old Black woman to the ground (exposing her bare breasts) in an Alabama Waffle House, after she asked for plastic cutlery and an ignorant employee reportedly said “she did not know her place,” and the beat goes on and on and on.
The police are too often called to put Black people in their place, to force them to comply, to reinforce the tenet of White supremacy; the notion that when we see a White person, we must shuck and jive and smile. So-called law enforcement officers become servants of racism, who want us in our place.
I want the graduates to know that their place is everyplace.
Class of 2018, your place is in that Starbucks at the table, order or not. Your place is in that Waffle House, getting the utensils you requested. Your place is at the lake in Oakland, burning those bones on your grill. Your place is on that stage at UF.
Resistance has a high price. Who wants to go to jail and end up, like Sandra Bland, whose mysterious death in Texas still has not been solved? Who wants to be handcuffed, humiliated, exposed, and maligned, just for asking a simple question?
Starbucks will close thousands of stores to the tune of millions of dollars for unconscious bias training. But who will train these biased police officers and the racists who call them, because their feelings are bruised when no one waves at them?
The Class of 2018 will learn, as have millions of other Black Americans, that racism is alive and well.
They've cleared a hurdle with graduation, but even as some cross the stage, they are being reminded that there are many more hurdles to clear, to survive in our unfortunately racist nation.
Perhaps though, the Class of 2018, will be among those to dismantle the racist hurdles.
Perhaps in the process of clearing other hurdles (graduate and professional school, marriage and children, artificial intelligence and gentrification), they will also find the wherewithal to eliminate racial barriers to success.

LAHORE, Jul 04 (APP):Director Development and Domestic, Pakistan Hockey Federation, former Olympian Naveed Alam said
Wednesday that Pak team put up dismal performance in the last edition of the Champions trophy in Holland and finishing at last position of number six is a alarming sign for the national sport.
“Finishing with a wooden spoon is a clear picture of sagging fortune of our hockey and we need to work on war footing grounds to arrest the downward trend of our team”, he told APP here.
The team failed to live up to the expectations and its management should be asked to explain the key factors responsible for the debacle of the team which appeared in the last chapter of the Champions trophy, said the former hockey Olympian.
To a question, he said, he watched all the matches of the Pak team on TV and noticed a number of faulty decisions of the team management in crunch situations.
“Definitely I will be putting up my observations to the high ups of the PHF to help them to overcome gray areas of the team before its participation in the Asian Games which is also the qualifying round of the next Olympics”, said Naveed Alam.
Answering a question, he said Pakistan was the pioneer of the Champions trophy and it won the event twice and finishing at last number sixth position in its last edition has shocked everyone and left in dismay.
He said the decision to appoint a junior player as captain of the team in the presence of senior players is beyond comprehension besides players were wrongly twitched to such positions for which they were
not trained or groomed.
“The PHF Board must prepare a plan for bringing in improvement in the showing of the team in its coming assignment and decisions should be made collectively rather empowering the team management”,
said the PHF official.
The PHF Director defended the PHF for its efforts for the revival of the game and improving team's performance by saying “Foreign coaching staff has been hired to infuse new life in team's performance and Pak teams are being sent abroad to give exposure and experience to the players”.
“We are organizing domestic tournaments on regular basis in order to identify new talent besides we have formed junior and development squads to have ample choice of selection in our main national team”, he said adding “We are taking all possible measures for the revival and uplift of the game and we are confident to put hockey at the path of progress”.
On Friday, the accused took the stand as the defence presented its case in an attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault trial stemming from an attack on a woman in Lethbridge in 2015.
On May 3, 2015, a 17-year-old male was charged with a violent sexual assault and attempted murder of a 45-year-old woman in the Palm Road area of Lethbridge.
Police said the woman was asleep when she was sexually assaulted. She also had her throat cut. The woman survived, but died later due to an unrelated cause.
Nearly three years later, the defence is presenting its case to the court. The accused's name is under a publication ban because he was a minor at the time of the alleged offence.
The now-20-year-old man was called to the stand by the defence and he went through his version of events.
He said he never sexually assaulted anyone or cut anybody's throat.
He also said on the night the woman was attacked, he walked around the Galt Gardens area for several hours. He later went out drinking at night clubs before returning to his sister's residence where he went to sleep at around 3 a.m., he testified.
He said he was awoken by police banging on the door and arrested on an outstanding warrant.
He said police asked him why there was blood on his clothing.
The accused said he got into “scraps often” and the blood on his clothes could be from a fight a few days before involving both men and women.
The accused also told the court he wasn't drunk on the night of the incident. He said he had seven shots and two beers, adding it usually takes two 26-ounce bottles of liquor to get him fully intoxicated.
During cross-examination, the Crown said the accused entered the apartment where the victim was sleeping uninvited through the balcony.
The accused said he didn't and denied any involvement in the attack.
Final submission will take place at the Lethbridge Courthouse on Feb. 20.

MOGADISHU Gunmen were holding at least 20 people hostage in a restaurant in Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Thursday, police said, after a suicide bomber rammed a car next door and militants stormed inside in an attack claimed by Islamist al Shabaab militants.Police cordoned off the whole district surrounding Mogadishu's Pizza House, which is adjacent to the Posh Hotel where the suicide bomber attacked first, witnesses said. Posh Hotel is the only venue with a discotheque in the capital."The fighters are still inside Pizza House and they hold inside over 20 people. We do not know how many of those are dead or alive," Ibrahim Hussein, a police major, told Reuters.Earlier on Wednesday, police said nine people, mostly women who were hotel staff, had died in the attack.
Security officials said the suicide attacker had rammed the explosive-laden car into the hotel's entrance before gunmen stormed the restaurant."A suspected car bomb is also parked in front of Pizza House. This and snipers have made it difficult for the security forces to head inside,' said Hussein.
Other officials said victims inside the hotel had been safely evacuated but that there were likely to be more than nine casualties.Al Shabaab claimed responsibility. The group has carried out a campaign of suicide bombings in its bid to topple the Somali government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam.
"A mujahid (fighter) with his suicide car bomb martyred himself after he rammed into the Posh Hotel, which is a nightclub. The operation goes on," Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group's military spokesman, told Reuters.Since losing large swathes of territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the government, the group has frequently launched raids and deadly attacks in Mogadishu and other regions controlled by the federal government.The Horn of Africa country has been racked by armed conflict since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

Karachi: Former opener Nasir Jamshed has been handed a one-year ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) anti-corruption tribunal for failing to cooperate with the investigators in a spot-fixing case, which rocked the Pakistan Super League (PSL) earlier this year.
The PCB said Jamshed, who resides in the UK, has been banned in connection with the PSL spot-fixing case but not charged with spot-fixing.
PCB legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi announced the verdict, saying the investigation into charges was still underway.
"The tribunal has found the charges of non-cooperation with the inquiry and trying to obstruct the investigations, and deemed him ineligible from cricket for a year," Rizvi told the reporters in Lahore on Monday.
"PCB has not levelled any fixing charges on Jamshed as yet as there is another investigation underway against him in (the) UK," he added.
The PCB feels that Jamshed is a key player in the PSL scandal and set-up meetings of the suspected bookmaker Yousuf Anwar with the Pakistani players – Sharjeel and Khalid Latif.
Rizvi said the PCB has evidence against Jamshed.
"We don't want him to get wise and try to cover his tracks but we have evidence against him.
"As far as defamation case against us is concerned, Nasir should first let everyone know why his passport is still with the National Crime Agency in the UK and why is he on bail? And if the investigations against him are wrong, why doesn't he file defamation charges against the NCA?," asked Rizvi.
The PCB's tribunal has already banned Pakistani batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif for five years each in the same case, although the former has been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence.
Rizvi said there would be no let-up in the PSL spot-fixing investigations and they would like Jamshed to appear before the tribunal and respond to the charges against him.
"For now the tribunal has decided to ban him for one year and after that ban is completed he has to complete the due process of rehabilitation under the anti-corruption code."
Jamshed, who last played for Pakistan in the 2015 World Cup, said he would consider filing a defamation case against PCB for trying to falsely implicate him in the PSL spot-fixing case.
The PCB anti-corruption unit last week called up fast bowler Muhammad Sami for questioning from the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and sources said that the links have been found between suspected bookmakers working on the BPL and PSL.
The PSL spot-fixing scandal surfaced earlier this year, on the opening day of the second PSL T20 in Dubai and the PCB immediately sent back Sharjeel and Khalid home after suspending them under the anti-corruption code.
The PCB also banned Test players Muhammad Irfan and Muhammad Nawaz for failure to report approaches made to them. Both have completed their short bans and are back to playing domestic cricket again.

As the Free Syrian Army (FSA) units backed by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) took control of Afrin town center, as part of Turkey's Operation Olive Branch on Sunday, the efforts to provide stability have been simultaneously kicked off. A local council consisting of 30 members was established in the "Afrin Liberation Congress" which was convened in Turkey's Southeastern city of Gaziantep with the participation of over 100 people. In an effort to rebuild Afrin and enable the return of people, the congress took several decisions.
Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch on Jan. 20 with an aim of clearing PKK-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) from the regions it previously obtained under the pretext of fighting against Daesh.
Since the beginning of the operation, Turkey has been stressing that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terror threats directed at Turkey and pave way for the return of people to their lands. Ankara has repeatedly underlined that the operation is not targeting the Kurdish people living in the region, but rather the terrorists.
Commenting on the liberation of Afrin, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Sunday that Turkey will immediately take necessary steps to make sure that the residents of the city are able to return to their homes as soon as possible.
In the congress's final declaration, it was decided that the entry and exits from Afrin should be secured by clearing planted bombs.
The congress announced that the control of Afrin should be given to the people of Afrin and the elections of local council should be held regularly which would be observed by the non-governmental organizations. It was also stressed that the public needs to be disarmed and all segments of the society should be respected. According to the final declaration, local security forces will be formed from people who are not members of any party, in order to provide security.
Touching on the claims that Turkey will not leave the region, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said on the weekend that "We have stated from the beginning that we have no intentions to stay. We heard these claims during the Operation Euphrates Shield as well. In the Jarablus-Azaz line over 135,000 Syrian families settled there. 160,000 students are going to school."
Prior to the Afrin operation, the TSK launched Operation Euphrates Shield against Daesh to neutralize terrorist elements in al-Bab, al-Rai, Dabiq and Jarablus. Turkey cleared the area and substantially contributed to the rebuilding process, enabling the return of Syrians in the areas cleared in the operation. The operation cleared 1,900 square kilometers of Daesh, allowing more than 100,000 refugees to return home. Underlining that a model of state is established in Jarablus, Yıldırım highlighted that "villages, districts are established; security is provided and schools are opened. Courts have been established. A model of state is formed."
At an age when Joe Montana and Peyton Manning had retired from football, Tom Brady is bolstering his already overwhelming case as the greatest quarterback in NFL history.
The Associated Press chose the New England Patriots star as the 2017 Most Valuable Player, announcing the award during Saturday night's NFL Honors ceremony. At 40 years and 184 days, Brady is the oldest player to win the MVP, an award that goes back to 1957. Brady's resume now boasts one Comeback Player of the Year, three regular-season MVPs, four Super Bowl MVPs and five Lombardi Trophies -- with an opportunity for a sixth on Sunday.
Although injuries to Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz and Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown worked in Brady's favor, a December slump allowed Rams tailback Todd Gurley to make it a tight race with a brilliant stretch run. Brady received 40 of 50 votes, with Gurley and Wentz tallying eight and two votes, respectively.
Brady navigated through injuries to his offensive line, backfield and receiving corps, leading one of his least talented Patriots teams to a 13-3 record and the 15th AFC East title of the Bill Belichick-era dynasty. Along the way, the 13-time Pro Bowler led the NFL in passing yards (4,577) while finishing third in adjusted yards per attempt (8.36), passing touchdowns (32) and passer rating (102.8). Even better, his 10 touchdowns and 98.0 rating under pressure were the highest marks in the league.
Of all the marvels in Brady's exceptional career, the most impressive might just be the dominant fashion in which he has reimagined possibilities for aging quarterbacks, increasing his efficiency across the board in completion percentage, yards per attempt, yards per game, touchdown-to-interception ratio and passer rating every year from ages 36 to 39. After incredibly improving his pocket movement in last year's second-place MVP campaign, he threw downfield more than ever in his age-40 season, boosting the accuracy and effectiveness of his deep ball.
Beyond the numbers, Brady has mastered situational football, spreading the ball around, controlling tempo, attacking the right matchup on the right down and distance and turning the two-minute drill into a science. Two respected sources charting every throw by every quarterback -- NFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal and Pro Football Focus -- rated Brady as the cream of the quarterback crop by a wide margin this season.
Stiff-arming Father Time, Brady has managed to maintain the physical abilities of youth long enough to maximize the wisdom accumulated through years of deciphering defenses. After pulling off an incredible string of epic comebacks in the past four postseasons, the future Hall of Famer will enter Sunday's showdown with the Eagles as the most confident contestant in Super Bowl history.
Over the last 242 years, we have argued a lot but broken up only once — temporarily, in the Confederate secession and the Civil War — and it was bitter, costly and deadly. Fittingly, the dispute was over something fundamental to the American people on both sides — the meaning of freedom. Could a nation conceived in liberty continue to deny it to 4 million people of African descent? The answer is obvious today, yet the Confederate states broke off the argument and broke away from the union because somehow they believed that it was their own freedom that was under assault. They lost respect for the institutions that wove the nation together — the presidency, the courts, the Constitution — and for a time they could no longer be bound within what Lincoln called “the mystic chords of memory.”
There's nothing quite like the friendship forged between teenage classmates with the shared responsibility of protecting their school (and the world) from inter-dimensional alien threats.
Created by author Patrick Ness, “Class” follows the adventures of a group of students, and their teacher, who discover the fabric of space and time has worn rather thin at the exact place their school happens to be located. After surviving an alien attack, the “Class” is tasked by a certain Time Lord to keep watch over their school, Coal Hill Academy.
However Ness, who wrote every episode of the “Doctor Who” spinoff, explained that creating authentic teenage characters always took precedence over the timey wimey adventures that come with setting a series in the Whoniverse.
“[Teenagers are] stronger than you think and they're kinder than you think and they volunteer more than you think and they're more interested and curious and just more than you think,” said Ness. “That's where it began.”
(Warning: Spoilers for the premiere episode of "Class" follow.)
The core characters in “Class” include Charlie (Greg Austin), an alien prince living as a human on Earth after losing his people and his home world; April (Sophie Hopkins), a seemingly ordinary student who proves most extraordinary in her convictions and resilience; Tanya (Vivian Oparah), a genius who was skipped ahead three years at school; Ram (Fady Elsayed), a star soccer player with a sensitive side; Matteusz (Jordan Renzo), Charlie's human prom date; and Miss Quill (Katherine Kelly), the only other alien survivor of Charlie's planet bound to the alien prince against her will as punishment for leading a rebellion against his people.

While crafting “Class,” Ness pulled from personal experiences growing up. The showrunner was a year younger than most of his school colleagues, similar to Tanya, who is three years younger than her “Class” mates. And the alien prince Charlie “is the hero I always wanted to see as a teenager but I never did,” Ness explained over the phone to The Times.
But April was the one who started it all. Ness described her as “the heart fairy” of the story.
In addition to being big-hearted, April acquires a specific alien problem of her own when the Shadow Kin — the race responsible for the extermination of Charlie and Miss Quill's people — track the pair of alien refugees to Coal Hill.
A thwarted attempt to vanquish the king of the Shadow Kin results in April's heart being shared between the two. This unique link between their lives becomes one of the central elements of the show's first season.

What was an initial idea for "Class"?
My first idea was the sharing of a heart. The heart that beat on every other beat.
I really liked the idea of this extremely powerful leader of this army, being influenced by this teenage girl [April], and, what do you know, she's his match. She's not afraid of him. She's kind of as powerful as he is, in a way. That felt really, really compelling.
It's like what [April] says in the pilot, that “people's lives are on a knife's edge.” That's what it feels like to be a teenager. I felt that as a center to the show [it] felt really, really great and true and right.
What do you think it is about high school and this age range that lends itself to be told as a scary monster story?
Being a teenager is the very first time you have stepped away from your family and you are saying: “I am not my family. I'm an individual. I am myself and I am separate from you.”
That's a necessary action that has to happen to grow up. It's a terrifying action and a violent action, in a way, because you're stepping away from everything you've known.
It's also a lonely action because you are, until you find your tribe, until you find the people who can understand you, you're kind of alone.
That's why it's such a compelling place to tell stories.
The emotions are big. It's where you are pressing your boundaries to find what your limitations are, what you believe in. What happens if you go over a boundary and when you bump up against a taboo? What are you going to do, what kind of decisions are you going to make?
We learn, and I think we learn to our fault, we learn to take our emotions a bit cynically. A teenager takes their emotions quite seriously because they are testing them out. It's extremely powerful in storytelling.
Love can break your heart when you're a teenager. It really, really, really can. It's just as brave to say “I love you” to someone when you're 16 as it is to save the world.

It's just as brave to say ‘I love you' to someone when you're 16 as it is to save the world. — Patrick Ness
Were you afraid of getting too dark?
You have to earn absolutely everything or your audience is going to smell a fake, but I'm certainly not afraid of going dark. All you have to read is the fiction that teenagers write themselves.
If you assign a class of 10th-graders to write short stories, they're going to write just the darkest, most violent, bleak [stories] and that's OK. I think that's absolutely fine because that's when you're testing your boundaries. Seeing what that kind of feeling, feels like and a story is a safe place to do it.
My philosophy for writing darkness for teenagers has always been that I have to do it because otherwise you're leaving a teenager to face that by themselves. I think that's immoral. To lie to them and say everything is fine, you'll grow out of it, is at the very best unhelpful and at worst abandoning a teenager to their own struggle. Why do that? That doesn't feel right to me.
So I'm not afraid of darkness in stories because teenagers aren't afraid of darkness in stories. If you tell the truth about what's difficult and what's dark then when you tell the truth about what's light they believe you more because you haven't lied.
That's all I wanted as a teenager. I just didn't want to be lied to. And I felt like I was, quite a lot. I really appreciated it when I wasn't.
Tell us about Miss Quill.
I liked the idea of it being Miss Quill instead of Mr. Quill and that nobody bats an eyelid that she was this [alien] general. She certainly seems like a general and she seems like someone you wouldn't want to mess with ever.
That really excited me. A chance to have this really powerful character unexpectedly looking like Miss Quill. But you know, she's a slave, and that is a morally troubling question. Because for most of the time we really like Charlie, but he's got her under his thumb. They talk about it through the series and it eventually comes up.
There's this great pain behind her. She lost everything she ever had and the only reminder she has of her world is her worst enemy to whom she is chained.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday came down heavily on the central government and the Ministry of External Affairs for delay in extradition trial of Vijay Mallya, according to CNN-News18. The liquor baron who has been living in the UK in a self-imposed exile since March last year returned to the Westminster Magisterate's Court in London on 4 December for a hearing in the case.
Mallya lives in a sprawling, $15 million mansion in Tewin, a village about 33 km north of London.
SC has also asked the Centre and the MEA to a file a reply on the matter on Friday while raising the question as to how they can delay the extradition trial despite there was a clear apex court ruling in its favour? Mallya's defence while arguing for him told the court that earlier this year Indian banks refused a settlement of offer from the Kigfisher Airlines founder. According to reports, Mallya had told banks that he was willing to pay them over Rs 6,000 crore as a settlement.
Last week, the Westminster Magisterate had criticised Indian government for gaps in paperwork on which the government representative admitted it and said the paper had got mixed up. Mallya is wanted by Indian law enforcement agencies for cheating on huge loan money.
A group of 17 banks led by the State Bank of India claim Mallya did not repay Rs 9,000 crore loan which he had raised for starting and running Kingfisher Airlines. KFA has been grounded for long for not generating profits and revenue and also for funds crunch.
India's two top agenices -- the Central Bureau of Investigation under Home Ministry and the Enforcement Directorate under the Finance Ministry -- have prepared what they call a strong case against Mallya. They have provided huge amount of documents to the Crown Prosecution Service in London to substantiate their case.
Enrollment begins February 20 for the 2017 summer and fall semesters at Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford. Enrollment hours in the Registrar's Office in the Administration Building are Mondays 8:30 a.m.-4 p.m. and Tuesdays through Fridays 8 a.m.-4 p.m.

It was about five or six episodes into the debut season of “This Is Us” when star Chrissy Metz had an inkling that the show was popular.
She had been wandering through Target when she noticed a woman following her around the store.
“I was like, ‘Does she need help?' or ‘Does she think I work here?' ‘Am I wearing red?'” Metz recalled while visiting The Times' video studio this week. “It was around that time where I realized that people were really taking notice — to the characters and to the story lines and to me... I don't think you can ever prepare for it.”
On the series, Metz plays the adult Kate, one of three children in the time-jumping family drama. Over the course of the first season, Kate dealt with body-image issues, relationship drama and the ongoing grief over the death of her father.
The series quickly emerged as the breakout hit of the 2016-17 season. It has already been renewed for two additional seasons and has nabbed the plum post-Super Bowl slot in 2018.
Quite the turn of events for Metz, who spent much of her time in L.A. as an assistant to her manager and, later, her agent — with acting taking the backseat. She was preparing to move home to Florida after a stint on “American Horror Story: Freak Show” as Ima “Fat Lady” Wiggles hadn't led to any major auditions.
“I thought the universe was helping me out — what's happening here?” Metz says of her time on the FX anthology drama. “I mean, I've been here for 12 years now and I was like, ‘OK … time is about to be up.' And, luckily, ‘This Is Us' came about.”
And now Metz can't go to a public restroom without fans stopping to talk to her about the effect the show has had on them.
“It happens so frequently that it's not awkward,” Metz says of the toilet-adjacent encounters. “I've had a woman hand off her grandchild to me in a bathroom. I've cried with women in the bathroom.”
Watch the full conversation below:
When Chrissy Metz is accosted by "This Is Us" fans in public restrooms these days, she takes it in stride: "It happens so frequently it's not awkward anymore."

London: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp laughed off suggestions from former Liverpool captain Jamie Carragher that club-record signing Virgil van Dijk needs to slim down to recover his top form.
Carragher told Sky Sports' 'The Debate' programme that the world's most expensive defender "needs to lose a bit of weight".
"I am sure Jamie needs to lose a little bit of weight but for Virgil, it is not the case," Klopp told a press conference on Friday.
"He is a big and tall player, that is how it is. We have the best nutrition department and no-one came to me and said we need to work with him."
Van Dijk, who joined Liverpool for £75 million in the January transfer window looks set to return to Klopp's starting line-up for a crucial clash with Tottenham Hotspur in the battle to secure a top-four finish on Sunday after being rested for Tuesday's routine 3-0 win at Huddersfield.
Liverpool, in third, currently hold a two-point lead over fifth-placed Spurs and are looking to avenge their 4-1 defeat at Wembley back in October.
Van Dijk is likely to replace Dejan Lovren, who was substituted after 31 minutes at Wembley having endured a torrid time against Harry Kane.
And Klopp defended the Dutch defender's start to life at Liverpool despite shock defeats to Swansea and West Brom in his two outings since scoring a Merseyside derby winner against Everton on debut.
"It is just exactly as I expected it would be: a few ups and downs," added Klopp.
"We will see Virgil van Dijk at his best after the summer but we don't have the time to wait until then and why should we? He can bring in a lot of things already.
"It is quite difficult because our defending style — and I know how this sounds — is different to Southampton or to Holland so that's why it makes so much sense you get used to it."
It will be a day to remember for the lucky children who are flying to Florida for a day trip at Walt Disney World Tuesday.
It's part of the Sunshine Foundation‘s 63rd annual DreamLift.
In all, 80 children from the London area flew out of London International Airport early Tuesday, along with volunteers from the Sunshine Foundation. The kids are paired with a volunteer buddy for the day.
CEO of the Sunshine Foundation, Nancy Sutherland, says it's a chance for children living with various challenges to go somewhere and experience something they might not otherwise get the opportunity to do.
“They will go off in their groups and do whatever the child wants to do. It's all about being a child led day,” Sutherland says.
“If they want to go on rides right away, go on the same ride over and over again, or maybe they want to eat cotton candy before lunch, whatever it is they want, that's what it's about.”

Myles Ntwari is nine years old and has loved Disney movies for as long as he can remember. He is looking forward to his first visit to Walt Disney World.
“I'm a huge Disney fan, I like Lilo and Stich, I like Winnie the Pooh, I like a lot of Disney movies.”
His mother, Jodi Ntwari, is excited for her son's big day.
“It's a great opportunity for him to leave us and enjoy this with all the other kids, where the day is all about him and everything he wants,” Jodi said.
“Disney is a wonder magical place, and that is what Myles is, too. He's a magical kid and we love him very much.”
Jodi says they found out in January that Myles had been accepted for the Disney trip, but held off telling him until closer to the date. She says he hasn't stopped talking about it.

Daryl Pittman, who is volunteering with Sunshine Foundation, helped out with a trip in Florida back in 2013. It left such an impression that it prompted him to get a tattoo to mark the occasion.
Pittman says the day is all about the kids.
“Just to see the look on their face is everything,” he says. “It's a life-changing experience to be able to do something like this.”
Dr. Rod Lim, site chief of the Paediatric Emergency Department at the Children's Hospital, is one of the volunteers providing medical support.
“These are children who have unfortunately suffered a lot of challenges that most of us won't experience in our entire lives,” Lim said.
“We're here to ensure everything goes smoothly. There are a lot of talented people here with police, firefighters, and other members at the hospital, and we're so excited to help out with this incredible cause.”
All 80 kids are from the London area, and use the services at the Thames Valley Children's Centre.
After a fun-filled day at Disney, the group is scheduled to arrive back at the London International Airport just after midnight.
Wall Street stocks tumbled Tuesday on worries about higher interest rates and disappointment over US corporate earnings reports that have been good but not strong enough to propel the market higher.
Major US indices dropped more than one percent, with the Dow shedding 1.7 percent for its fifth straight decline after a mid-session selloff. European stocks were mixed while Asian markets rose.
"Right now, if you look at what was driving the market for the last year or two, it was relatively high growth and a low-rate environment and a low-inflation environment, and it looks like all three of those are starting to come into question," said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade.
US stocks opened the session mildly positive, but began falling soon after the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond hit 3.0 percent for the first time in more than four years.
The move came as commodity prices have strengthened and follows Congress' enactment in December of a sweeping tax cut supported by President Donald Trump aimed at speeding US growth.
The Federal Reserve has been gradually raising interest rates amid and improving US economy and expectations for steeper inflation. Investors fear that higher yields are a signal the central bank will need to hike interest rates more quickly than currently expected.
A more aggressive timetable for rate increases would mean higher lending costs for businesses and could prompt investors to shift funds from the equity market to bonds.
- 'High-water mark'? -
Adding to the downward trend were some ugly moves lower by prominent companies following earnings, including Google-parent Alphabet, which sank 4.5 percent on worries about higher costs even as quarterly earnings soared more than 70 percent to $9.4 billion.
Alphabet's woes appeared to rub off on other large technology shares, with Amazon falling 3.8 percent, Facebook losing 3.7 percent and Microsoft 2.3 percent. All three companies report results later this week.
"Earnings are good but not great," said Phil Davis of PSW Investments. "It's impossible to live up to the expectations."
In the Dow, Caterpillar shares sank 6.2 percent after a conference call in which chief financial officer Bradley Halverson signaled the company's first quarter would be its "high-water mark" for 2018, denting hopes of higher profits down the road. Executives also confirmed that prices of steel and other materials would be a headwind all year, lending further weight to analyst fears about inflation.
The decline was a big reversal for Caterpillar, which had opened the session sharply higher after scoring a huge jump in first-quarter profits and upgrading its full-year forecast.
3M was another big loser in the Dow, falling 6.8 percent after it lowered its full-year forecast and disclosed an $897 million charge connected to settling a lawsuit with the state of Minnesota over release of chemicals that allegedly polluted drinking water.
Analysts have been gearing up for a strong first-quarter earnings period, but there is rising anxiety about whether there is a downside to that bounty.
"There is now more discussion that first quarter earnings growth, likely to represent record strength, will mark the peak for the current business cycle," said Karl Haeling, head of capital market sales at LBBW.
The Trans Canada Highway is closed through the Fraser Canyon due to a rockslide.
Rocks came tumbling down on the highway near Yale on Tuesday night, north of Hope.
No one was caught in the slide and no injuries have been reported but the incident has stranded cars on both sides of the slide.
At this time, Drive BC does not have an estimated time of reopening and crews will do an assessment in the daylight.
Drivers are asked to detour via Highway 5 and Highway 8.
For students in the Fraser Cascade school district, the slide has affected Wednesday's school day. There are no buses running for students living north of Yale and students in Boston Bar will be starting late today, at 11:25 a.m.
With two wins on either side of the loss against Sri Lanka, India finished as Group B toppers to surge into the ICC Champions Trophy semi-finals. Meanwhile, a washed out game against Australia and a historic run chase against New Zealand ensured a spot for Bangladesh in the final four, a feat they have never achieved before.
As they go head to head in the semi-final, here's a look at the top five clashes between the two sides:
Where it all began
India had lost to Bangladesh before in 2004, but at Port of Spain's Queen's Park Oval, when India were beaten by five wickets, it was an upset which stunned the entire cricketing world. The formidable Indian side were left dazed and crestfallen. While for India the defeat in the group fixture of the World Cup in the Caribbean eventually resulted in an early first round exit from the tournament, for Bangladesh it was a spectacular moment in their short cricketing history — one which helped them discover their future heroes. Mashrafe Mortaza (4/38), Tamim Iqbal (51), Shakib Al Hasan (53) and Mushfiqur Rahim (56*) all played instrumental roles in the famous win. Today all four are regarded as role models in Bangladesh and each one of them will feature in Thursday's game against India.
The monkey is off the back
When they faced off in the 2011 World Cup opener in Mirpur, India were looking to get rid of the ghosts of the 2007 World Cup. Bangladesh, on the other hand, were looking to start on a positive note. Despite losing Sachin Tendulkar to a silly run out early in the game, tons from Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli helped India amass a massive total of 370. The packed Mirpur crowds supported their team till the very end, but once they lost Tamim Iqbal for 70 and Shakib Al Hasan for 55, they ran out of steam to mount a challenge to the Men in Blue. Kohli became the first Indian to score a century in a World Cup debut match as India won by 87 runs.
Outrage in Dhaka
Though the margin of India's victory — 109 runs — would make it seem like it was a one-sided affair, Bangladeshi fans would disagree. A couple of controversial umpiring decisions, including a waist-high no-ball to Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan's catch on the boundary, went in India's favour, much to Bangladesh's chagrin. The result caused protests marches in Dhaka, terming the World Cup quarter-final an ‘international conspiracy' against Bangladesh. Subsequently, ICC president Mustafa Kamal, a Bangladesh native, resigned in protest claiming ‘India had influenced the game'. Even the Prime Minister of Bangladesh said it was an umpiring error that cost them the game.
Rivalry goes viral
Hosting India for a three-match series, Bangladesh sealed the issue by winning the second match by six wickets on the trot at Mirpur. It was the first time they had beaten India in a bilateral competition. It marked the beginning of Mustafizur Rahman, who beguiled everyone including the likes of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, and ended up picking 11 wickets in the first two games thereby capping a sensational debut series. Despite the brilliant on-field performances, off-field controversy soon became the bigger talking point as a Bangladeshi newspaper posted a photo of half-shaven heads of Indian players with Rahman in the background holding a razor — a metaphorical nod to his adroit cutters which outfoxed the Indian batsmen. The image drew the ire of the Indian fans after it went viral on social media. The series win had great significance as it gave Bangladesh points that were important to qualify for the ongoing Champions Trophy.
MS Dhoni's quick feet lead to memorable feat
Arguably the most nerve-wrangling contest in the tournament, where India conjured a remarkable turnaround to snatch a one-run victory over Bangladesh. With two runs required off three balls to knock India out of the World T20, Bangladesh's hara-kiri left them and their fans in dismay and tears. But it took a phenomenal effort by then India skipper, MS Dhoni, who sprinted nearly 20 yards to run out Mustafizur Rahman and take his side into the knockouts on the final ball of the match.

Kuala Lumpur - Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was arrested by anti-corruption investigators Tuesday, officials said, the latest dramatic development in a widening graft probe that has engulfed the ex-leader.
Najib, 64, will be charged Wednesday, a taskforce set up to probe wrongdoing at state fund 1MDB said in a statement, adding he was apprehended "at his home".
The arrest is the latest in a series of stunning moves by investigators that suggest the legal noose is tightening around Najib, his family and many of his close political and business allies.
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama said the former premier is expected to face more than 10 counts of committing criminal breach of trust linked to SRC International Sdn Bhd, an energy company that was originally a subsidiary of 1MDB.
According to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal, $10.6 million originating from SRC was transferred to Najib's personal bank accounts, just one small part of hundreds of millions of dollars from 1MDB that allegedly ended up in his accounts.
Najib had been summoned twice by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) over its investigation into a case related to SRC.
The newly appointed attorney general Tommy Thomas would lead the prosecution team, according to Bernama.
Allegations of massive corruption were a major factor behind the shock election loss in May of Najib's long-ruling coalition to a reformist alliance headed by his former mentor Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib and his cronies were accused of plundering billions of dollars from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund to buy everything from US real estate to artworks.
Najib and the fund deny any wrongdoing.
Since the election loss Najib has been banned from leaving the country and has found himself at the centre of a widening graft probe.
Shortly after his ouster, a vast trove of valuables was seized in raids on properties linked Najib and his family, including cash, jewellery and luxury handbags, worth up to $273 million.
He and his luxury-loving wife Rosmah Mansor were questioned by investigators, as were his stepson Riza Aziz, whose firm produced the hit 2013 movie "The Wolf of Wall Street", and his former deputy Zahid Hamidi.
A special government task force investigating the 1MDB corruption scandal said it froze 408 bank accounts containing a total 1.1 billion ringgit ($272 million) last week.
Local media reports said some of the accounts belonged to Najib's political party, the once-powerful United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Until their shock defeat in May, Najib's party and its coalition allies had run Malaysia for six decades.
A security source told AFP that agents from the MACC arrested Najib at his home, a sprawling mansion in a well-heeled suburb of Kuala Lumpur.
"They came in three to four unmarked cars," the source, a senior security official familiar with the arrest, said.
A spokeswoman for MACC told AFP the former leader was brought to the commission's headquarters in the administrative capital Putrajaya outside Kuala Lumpur.
Najib would stay there overnight and be brought to court Wednesday, she added.
The US Justice Department, which is seeking to recover items allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB cash in America, estimates that $4.5 billion in total was looted from 1MDB.
Veteran legislator Lim Kit Siang, whose party is a member of the current ruling coalition, said Najib's arrest had been expected.
"Najib has to answer the allegations. It is long delayed as the scandal has turned Malaysia into a global kleptocracy country," he told AFP.
Hamidi, Najib's former deputy, said: "I respect the rule of law... Let the rule of law take place."

MUMBAI - Disgraced Australian cricketer Steve Smith will be much stronger mentally when he returns to international cricket after serving a one-year ban for his involvement in ball tampering, former South Africa skipper Graeme Smith has told Reuters.
Former Australia captain Smith was stripped of his position and banned from international and domestic cricket for a year by Cricket Australia (CA) for conspiring to scuff up the ball with sandpaper during a March test against South Africa in Cape Town.
Vice captain David Warner was also banned for 12 months and batsman Cameron Bancroft suspended for nine months, as Australia were criticised globally by fans and commentators for what they perceived to be an arrogant and hypocritical team culture.
“The Australia team got into that mindset of winning at all costs and the way they play the game,” Smith, who played 117 tests while captaining South Africa in 109 of them, said in an interview.
“I would love to interview him (Steve) and ask him if that's something he wishes he had sort of changed a little bit as the leader in terms of the culture, how they play, the win at all cost mindset. And how he's reviewed that now after the situation. That will be an interesting interview.”
One of the leading batsmen in the world, the 28-year-old Australian has also been barred from holding leadership positions in the national side for two years.
He will, however, return to cricket as a marquee player at next month's Global T20 Canada league.
“Playing at the top level is competitive, you want to win,” Graeme Smith said at the sidelines of the Ceat Cricket Rating awards. “He's still a young man, we have all made mistakes. I expect him to bounce back and come back really strong. Mentally he would have grown a lot from this situation.”
The South African remains the most capped test captain in the history of the game. After taking over the reins of the side at the age of 22, he finished as the world record holder for the most test wins as a skipper with 53.
Despite no longer competing, Smith still understands the pressure to gain reverse swing with an old ball and is not completely opposed to a slight relaxation of the rules laid down by the governing body International Cricket Council (ICC).
“The ball is a big issue. The Kookabura ball, in particular, has stopped winging and bowlers are desperate to get some sort of movement,” said Smith, who retired suddenly from cricket at the age of 33 in 2014. “Reverse swing has become such a key. What happened in Cape Town was pretty shocking. I've never seen an actual foreign object being brought out on the field. It was madness. I think the ICC needs to review that. Whether applying sweetened saliva or using a fingernail... I don't have a problem with that actually, but I wouldn't allow foreign objects on the field.”
With the ever-increasing popularity of Twenty20 cricket and mushrooming domestic leagues in the shortest format around the globe, Smith admitted that he remains worried about the future of the traditional five-day game.
Sitting in a hotel lobby overlooking the Arabian Sea, Smith said while cricket needed T20 to draw people into the game, the test format needed better marketing by its administrators.
“I am a big believer that T20 cricket shouldn't be played at international level. Maybe have a World Cup every couple of years but it should be largely a domestic-based format,” Smith said. “Test cricket needs some context, how they get there I don't know. They need to invest in marketing that game a little bit better. So much money nowadays go into marketing the T20 game and rightly so because it's an amazing concept. The ICC needs to sit down and work on a way forward for cricket. Maybe there should be six months a year that's just domestic T20 cricket and six months is international cricket. These things need to be debated because I don't think in the current system everything can survive.”
The Regina Pats are entering their centennial season this year and are celebrating in style.
On Monday, the team announced its 100th-anniversary logo and centre ice logo for the 2017/18 season.
“We are extremely excited to celebrate 100 years of history,” said Pats COO Stacey Cattell.
“These new logos are a great representation of the centennial celebration we can't wait to kick off this season.”
The Pats have numerous theme nights and functions planned for the season. The club is also set to move into new office space on the corner of Dewdney Avenue and Albert Street.
The Pats have set a franchise record this year with 5,000 season tickets sold.
The Pats will open up the season on Sept. 22 on the road in Brandon against the Wheat Kings and will host their home opener the next night on Sept. 23 against the Wheat Kings.
“If we have the technologies to save them, then why wouldn't we try?” said Jan Stejskal, director of the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic, where Najin and Fatu were born.

SEATTLE (AP)  A Seattle-area man who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child but was protected from deportation under a policy by President Barack Obama is suing the federal government over his arrest and detention last week.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina on Friday at his father's home. Agents were there to arrest his father and took Ramirez into custody even though he has a work permit under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, court documents said.
ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said in a statement that Ramirez told agents he was a gang member and based on those statements and being a "risk to public safety," he was taken into custody.
Mark Rosenbaum, one of Ramirez's lawyers, responded that Ramirez "unequivocally denies being in a gang" and that the statement from Richeson is inaccurate.

"While in custody, he was repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation," Rosenbaum said.
Northwest Immigrants Rights Project Legal Director Matt Adams told The Associated Press that Ramirez  who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7  has a job, a young son and no criminal record. Ramirez is being held in Tacoma, Washington.
Adams said Ramirez is the first person he knows of with DACA status who has been detained.
"This appears to be a complete one-off," Adams said. "We certainly haven't seen this with our other hundreds of clients who have DACA status as well."
Attorneys for Ramirez argue the arrest violates his constitutional rights to live and work in this country without the fear of arrest and deportation so long as he satisfies DACA requirements.
"Trust in our government depends upon the Executive Branch keeping its word," Rosenbaum, director of Public Counsel's Opportunity Under Law Project, said in a statement. "Bait and switch sullies the integrity of our nation's core values."
Emily Langlie, a spokeswoman for the US attorney's office in Seattle, said Tuesday afternoon it would be premature to comment on the lawsuit. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday in federal court in Seattle.
Recent sweeps by U.S. immigration agents across multiple states have netted some immigrants with no criminal records, a departure from enforcement actions in the last decade. Under the Obama administration, agents focused more narrowly on individuals who posed a security or public safety threat.
President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, saying he will build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people, although actual plans have yet to be revealed. He has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes.
During an interview with Time magazine late last year, Trump expressed sympathy for the more than 740,000 people in the DACA program, which started in 2012.
"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud," he told the magazine.
Trump can withdraw the promised protection right away through an "operational memo" because Obama implemented it through one, William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said previously.
Adams said he believes Ramirez was apprehended by mistake.
"I don't think this has to do with any change in policy; I just think it was an enforcement procedure gone wrong," Adams said. "Hopefully they're going to come to their senses."
Randall Arney is stepping down as artistic director of the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, the company said Tuesday.
After 17 years with the company, Arney will leave when his contract ends in August, the Geffen said. A search has begun for his successor, the company said.
In addition to serving as artistic director for the theater, Arney has directed many Geffen productions, including “Outside Mullingar,” “The Night Alive,” “American Buffalo” and “Reasons to Be Pretty.”
“Randy Arney's contributions to the Geffen Playhouse are varied and numerous,” Geffen Executive Director Gil Cates Jr. said in a statement. “And we are supremely grateful for his inspired artistic leadership, unwavering commitment to our mission, and for leaving his indelible mark on our beloved institution. We wish him every success and happiness.”
Cates Jr., whose father, producer Gil Cates, helped found the theater in the mid-1990s, was named executive director in 2015 and has been co-steering the theater with Arney since.
Arney's departure was prompted by the theater's desire to ensure it was “well positioned for the future,” a spokesperson said. Remaining true to its mission “of staging the work of emerging playwrights and new interpretations of classics to inspire diverse audiences” will be a priority, the spokesperson said.
Arney was not available for comment.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres named a new head of U.N. peacekeeping operations and retained three senior U.N. officials as part of his campaign to reform the world body's peace and security programs.
“I have announced that reforming the secretariat peace and security strategy, functioning and architecture would be a key priority,” Guterres, who took office in December, said in a statement.
"This important work will require both expertise and experience from principals and all staff members."
The secretary-general said the personnel moves were made in anticipation of an internal review of peace and security operations that will be completed in June and then shared with U.N. member states.
Guterres named French diplomat Jean-Pierre Lacroix to a one-year term as the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, according to the statement. His predecessor, Herve Ladsous, had declined an offer to stay on.
Lacroix will take office on April 1.
Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, the assistant secretary general for peace-building support; Atul Khare, the U.N. chief of field support; and Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. chief for political affairs, accepted Guterres' request to stay on through April 2018.
With high-profile investments from Alibaba and SoftBank fueling an impressive growth story since demonetization last year, you could be forgiven for thinking that Paytm has India's payments market sewn up. But at least one company will agree to differ on that.
MobiKwik, the mobile payments startup that is number two to Paytm in India, is quietly confident that it can take advantage of its rival's focus on e-commerce and recent entry to banking to even the playing field. To strengthen its case, MobiKwik, which is solely focused on payments, is in the process raising its largest financing from investors to date.
Co-founder Upasana Taku confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is in talks to raise $100 million-$150 million in a round that would value the company at more than $1 billion, thereby putting it into the elite club of tech unicorns. Taku declined to name the investors that her company is talking to, saying only that they include one major strategic investor and a number of financial institutions. She expects the round to close in the next couple of months. The plan is to invest as much as $45 million of the capital on growing user and merchant bases, and expand its current base of six offices to more than 20.
With Alibaba ploughing funds into Paytm and already holding a stake in Snapdeal, the scene is set for its arch rival Tencent — which recently invested in e-commerce giant Flipkart — to grab a piece of India's payment landscape. Taku declined to comment either way when asked whether Tencent is among the investors that MobiKwik is negotiating with.
Investors aside, that valuation would be notable for MobiKwik, and India's startup scene itself. The round could double MobiKwik's funding to date, which stands at just over $125 million. However, it would remain the underdog in its battle. Paytm has risen to become India's second highest-valued private tech firm — behind only Flipkart — with a valuation of $7 billion following a huge $1.4 billion investment from SoftBank and a $200 million round led by Alibaba.
Paytm and its parent company One97 have raised over $2.5 billion from investors. That's pushed its business into e-commerce — where the influence of Alibaba is strong — furthered its mobile payment strategy, and seen it branch out into digital banking, via a yet-to-launch project that borrows heavily from China and, again, Alibaba.
MobiKwik co-founder Upasana Taku
On paper, the statistics of its business are hugely impressive. India's demonetization in November of last year, a move that saw ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes (85 percent of total currency) removed from circulation, gave Paytm a huge boost. In the immediate aftermath, traffic grew 435 percent, downloads jumped 200 percent and overall transactions increased by 250 percent. The firm finished the year with 177 million mobile wallet customers — up from 122 million a year earlier — and it went on to cross the 200 million mark at the end of February.
Taku takes issue with some of those numbers, though. She pointed out that Paytm is yet to surpass 100 million downloads on Android — India's overwhelmingly dominant mobile operating system — according to the Google Play Store, which she asserts makes it “hard to imagine” that it has more than nearly 250 million registered users as it claims.
But beyond paper-based claims, she believes that her firm can take advantage of forays into other verticals that have left Paytm with “its hands full.”
“It is reneging on payments while it is pushing bank and e-commerce services,” she told TechCrunch in an interview. “Something's got to give, it is not possible to do justice on 10 different verticals.”
As an example for her argument, she cites the example of Ola Money, the payment service that Indian ride-hailing giant Ola spun out into a standalone business in late 2015.
“I don't see Ola Money accepted in many places,” she remarked, adding that e-commerce firms have also had to prioritize their focus. “Whether it is Amazon or even Flipkart, their clear focus will be on payments on their platform. In India, a lot of people tried it, thinking payments is the easiest thing to do.”
What about MobiKwik?
The company also claims to have ridden the wave of demonetization. Taku said its registered userbase jumped from 25 million to 55 million, while its merchant base rose to 1.5 million from 250,000 before demonetization and downloads rose ive-fold . MobiKwik's ambitious target is to sustain that growth and reach 100 million users and 10 million merchants in the next year.
“Our payment gateway business has seen crazy growth — demonetization has been great for us, all business numbers have grown at least 3X,” Taku said. “We couldn't have imagined where we'd be in terms of numbers. Now, we're net revenue profitable — when you remove merchant acquisition costs — and are on a path to profitability.”
That final push to go to make profit will come from the introduction of financial services later this year, the MobiKwik co-founder said. She said that the services will be directly related to MobiKwik's existing business, for example lending, insurance and investing, alongside partners. One such example is a deal announced with state-owned telecom operator BSNL to gives its 95 million customers basic financial services via a co-branded wallet app.
Currently, the service processes $2 billion in annual GMV — that's the overall value of transactions — but it is aiming to reach $10 billion by the end of this year.
Taku is bullish on the future beyond 2017, pointing out that digital payments currently account for just 15 percent of the estimated $1.5 trillion that is spent by consumers in India each year. She said the figure could reach 60-70 percent over the next two years — and is clearly determined to ensure that Paytm isn't the sole beneficiary of that boom.
LOS ANGELES-Chris Evans finds it ‘'harder'' to stay in great shape as he has got older, and regardless of how hard he works out he still believes he has a ‘'soft section''. The 36-year-old actor - who is known for portraying superhero Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - has admitted he has to spend ‘'a lot'' of time in the gym to maintain his toned physique, because he has claimed his body doesn't ‘'naturally'' want to be slender. Speaking about his fitness routine and his secrets to looking trim to Metro newspaper, the American hunk said: ‘'There's a lot of time in the gym - that's tough. My body doesn't naturally want to be this size and it's getting harder as I get older.''
But the star believed regardless of how many gruelling workouts he undertakes, and how hard he trains, he still has a ‘'soft section'' on his stomach. He added: ‘'And now I've noticed that no matter how hard I work out. I can still feel a little bit of a soft section around the middle.'' And Chris has been forced to diet, although he has revealed it is not a ‘'strict'' eating regime, to help him shed a few extra pounds. The ‘Captain America: Civil War' star said: ‘'So I've had to start incorporating a bit of a diet. ‘'Nothing too strict but no late-night pints of ice-cream.'' Meanwhile Chris, who has recently broken up from his former partner and ‘Gifted' co-star Jenny Slate after nine months of dating, has hinted his career makes it difficult for him to find love.
Speaking about the perks and downfalls of living a life in the limelight, said: ‘'There are pros and cons about being in my industry. The pros absolutely outweigh the cons but there is no denying that some of those cons fall in that arena of finding a relationship''.

SALIMA-(MaraviPost)-The much awaited and inaugurated Malawi-China textile company is expected to employ over 1,500 locals once is fully operational to come June 2019.
The US$30 million textile project will be in two phases including the gunnery and weaving production leading to textile products; clothes among others.
With the cotton need production of 100,000 metric tones, the initiative is expected to benefit 200,000 farmers and 1.5 million households once the projects is fully in operational.
This is a result of Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) initiative of engaging potential investors on various developmental projects.
President Peter Mutharika told the gathering in Salima on Monday after unveiled a foundation stone for the projects that his government was eying to modernise the lakeshore district of Salima with development.
Mutharika assured the public that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government will implement all its projects lined ahead for the country's transformation.
The area's parliamentarian Felix Jumbe expressed gratitude for the factory saying it will help to create jobs.
Lawmaker Jumbe therefore urged government to help farmers with financial support to access improved farm inputs for the initiative.
Four days ago I put up a video and some commentary about a woman student at the University of California at Riverside (UCR) who stole a conservative student's “Make America Great Hat” off his head. Rather than giving it back, she launched into a nine-minute tirade about how wearing that hat was the same as promoting genocide. She was wrong about that, and what she did was clearly theft. The student was criticized by UCR as violating community standards and suppressing free speech, which was an appropriate reaction from the University. I'd prefer they call her in and give her a lecture, but I doubt they'll do that. In the meantime, there were reports she's been threatened, so I didn't give her name.
Below that post was a comment by chrisbuckley80, calling attention to how other students not only defended her behavior, but are now using it to issue the tiresomely familiar set of “demands” to the University. Here's a screenshot of those demands, which you can go to by clicking on the screenshots. The woman's name is now public since she posted the video proudly on her own Facebook page, her fellow students are circulating the demands below in her name, and articles naming her are widely circulated. I see no further need to withhold her name. Nobody on this site, I trust, would engage in threats.
Here are the inevitable demands that this incident led to. Note too that when a hijab is snatched from the head of a Muslim woman, something that's equally reprehensible, the Left gets all up in arms. But when the hat is a MAGA hat, they applaud the snatcher and call for her protection—even for her rent to be paid. Note how the demands fall into the familiar ranks, like soldiers lining up to march:
Note the claim that free speech is used as a “dog whistle for the protection of white supremacist violence.” It was a HAT! Can you get any more hyperbolic than that?
I doubt that Macias will face any sanctions by UC Riverside, but the College Fix reports that the owner of the hat, Matthew Vitale, is filing criminal theft charges against her. Of course the students who signed the petition (I can't find any names, because of course they'd be cowards) characterize her actions as “student dissent” in a “toxic political climate.”
Yes, it's always dissented when “our” side does it.

Rider Nicola Pellett killed after horse walked on guide wire
SUPPLIED Mother-of-two Nicky Pellett, 47, died after suffering a head injury in a horse riding accident on August 6, 2015.
An experienced horse rider had just warned her friend about some wire when her horse "bizarrely" walked on it, knocking her off and causing a fatal head injury.
Nicola Pellett, 47, never regained consciousness after the incident at North Canterbury's Mandeville sports grounds, near her Swannanoa home on August 6, 2015. She was placed into an induced coma and died five days later, on August 11.
A coronial inquest into her death began at the Christchurch District Court before Coroner Sue Johnson on Thursday morning.
Pellett's friend, Athena Fisher, said they were walking their horses to look at a new cross-country area under construction when Pellett warned her about some wire near a fence post.

"We literally were on the wire when Nicola saw it … She said Athena just watch out for the wire so I have seen the wire and her horse Tiny had bizarrely got the wire caught up ... in its shoe."
Fisher said her horse started to get "quite antsy", then she noticed the hinds of Pellett's horse had gone down.
"It all happened so fast, I had a split second to jump off my horse. I knew it was going wrong ... I came off my horse, grabbed hold of my horse and ran to tie it up."
When she turned around Pellett was on the ground and facing the opposite way in the recovery position.
"I went running over for her horse not even thinking Nicky wasn't getting up.
"It still sends shivers down my spine. I approached her, yelled her name several times, she was snoring so I knew it was pretty bad.
"I was sort of hoping that I had got it wrong. I took her hat off … I knew I had to run for help and I didn't want to move her, I was worried about spinal injuries."
Constable Rob Stokes said fencing contractor Paul Addie had partially erected a fence, with a post on either side and ground wire between them, the day before the incident. The wire was lying on the ground.
Stokes said police did not visit the scene until August 11. An investigation found no criminal liability for Pellett's death.
WorkSafe New Zealand health and safety inspector Bridget Murray said she considered the duty of care by the Mandeville Sports Club, Addie and his business, the Eyreton Pony Club and the Waimakariri District Council.
She found under the then Health and Safety Act there were some breaches, but no enforcement was taken.
"[Addie] left when it was dark, there were no lights in the paddock, he didn't understand that the paddock was used for horse riding so he's left a guidewire up in a paddock believing he's going to be there the next morning."
Coroner Johnson apologised to Pellett's family and friends in court that it had taken three years to reach the coronial stage.
"I acknowledge this inquiry might bring up emotions that you have hopefully perhaps been able to put aside sometimes and I acknowledge that you may feel that you're hearing things that may distress you and I would like to offer my condolences to you for Nicola's death.
The inquest has been adjourned to another date when other witnesses will give evidence.

KARACHI - Two hardcore militants, affiliated with outlawed terrorist organisation, escaped from the Central Jail late Tuesday night.
Following the jailbreak, the jail high-ups suspended at least a dozen officials, including superintendent of jail and approached the district police to register a case against them.
Two hardcore militants of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), Shaikh Muhammad Mumtaz and Muhammad Ahmed Khan alias Muna had escaped from the Central Jail, sources revealed.
The militants belonged to the Hafiz Qasim Rasheed and Sabir Munna group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
These groups are considered the most dangerous groups, which have featured in various high profile cases of terrorism.
One of them Ahmed alias Muna had reportedly been awarded 14 years imprisonment.
The officials suspended include Superintendent Prison Ghulam Murtaza Shaikh, Deputy Superintendent Faheem Memon, Assistant Superintendent Abdur Rehman Shaikh, ASI Faroosh Muhammad, SPC Nawab Ali, constables Atta Muhammad, Muhammad Amir, Abdul Ghaffor, Saeed Ahmed, Muhammad Sajjad, Tagial Naseer and Nadir Ali.
DIG Prisons Ashraf Ali Nizamani has also written a letter to the Station House Officer of New Town police station, District East to register a case against the suspended officials over the jailbreak.
It is reminded here that these two militants had escaped from the Judicial Complex adjacent to Central Jail.
“You are requested to lodge FIR under relevant section of law against these prisoners and the following officials as their negligence resulted in the escape of UTPs,” reads a letter.
“The prisoners have escaped from the newly formed ATCs complex inside the premises of the Central Prison. The building is on the outer perimeter of the prison. Therefore, the security is not the same as it is inside the prison,” IG Prisons Nusrat Mangan told media.
“We have suspended some officers linked to the matter and have formed a committee to investigate into the matter. We have zero tolerance for such matters and if someone from within our ranks is found involved in this escape, he will be dealt with iron hands,” he added.
“As per my correspondence with the operations police, teams have been dispatched to nab the suspects and hopefully soon they will be behind bars,” he concluded.
‘Robber' dies in an ‘encounter'
A robber was killed during an exchange of fire with police in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) within the limits of Gizri police station on Wednesday.
Police said that gunmen riding a motorbike were attempting to snatch a car from a man, Imtiaz, in Phase VI, DHA when police intervened.
Resultantly an exchange of fire ensued due to which Imtiaz and a bandit sustained wounds and were shifted to a hospital where doctors pronounced the bandit dead while admitted Imtiaz with serious injuries.
The dead was identified as Ali Asghar, 30, while his accomplice managed to flee.
Police said that Imtiaz had put up resistance to the robbers and in the meantime the police also reached and responded promptly.
The robbers shot at Imtiaz when he offered resistance, and when police reached the scene, the robbers also opened fire at them. “Both the casualties occurred due to fire from the robbers,” police added.
“Police has started the hunt for the robber who is on the run,” a police official said, and hoped that soon the law enforcement agencies would trace him.
The body of deceased bandit was moved to a morgue while later police registered the case.
On the other hand, Karachi police claimed to have arrested at least 15 outlaws in various raids and operations carried out in different parts of the city.
Those nabbed included street criminals, bandits, drug peddlers and others.
Police said it had also recovered weapons and narcotics from their possession.
Twenty years ago, around the same time, Sachin Tendulkar had played two of the greatest knocks in ODI history. With 143 off 130 balls, the 'Master Blaster' had ensured that India passed a stiff Australian test and entered the final, battling a desert storm on the way. Two days later came another gem of an innings. Tendulkar slammed 134 off 131 balls on his 25th birthday to deliver India the Coca-Cola Cup title on a hot afternoon in Sharjah.
Now 20 years down the line, Tendulkar relived those two epoch-making innings, and in an interview to Mumbai Mirror, felt that the innings in the final was of the same value as VVS Laxman's 281 in the Kolkata Test against Steve Waugh's Australia in 2001 that ensured that India not only turned around a hopeless position, but went on to win the Test match.
Asked if his Sharjah innings matched Laxman's knock at the Eden Gardens, Tendulkar said, "I would think so, but I don't do comparisons. Correct me if I am wrong, I don't remember us chasing high totals before that. This was no Twenty20 then and the approach to ODI cricket also was different those days. That's why I felt it was one of the important knocks of my career as well."
Reminiscing about the Sharjah innings, the legendary batsman said that Australia were "virtually unbeatable" at that time, but said that he had prepared well, and was ready for the challenge. He remembered his practice on turning tracks against the likes of L Sivaramakrishnan, Nilesh Kulkarni, Rajesh Pawar and Sairaj Bahutule, so that he could face Shane Warne better.
"I was feeling confident because we had played Australia in India. We also played a tri-series in India involving New Zealand and Australia. I had also scored 80-plus runs against Australia in the first match of the tri-series in Sharjah. I was batting really well. So, I had felt the flow was really really good."
He revealed that he hardly got any recovery time before the final, and was not able to middle the ball at the start, but knew that all he needed was to give himself time to settle in the middle. He persisted and the rest as they say, is history.
The legend said that irrespective of whether it was his birthday or not, on the day of the final, what mattered most was that there was a match to win. He clarified that for him representing the nation was of the greatest priority to him.
In the aftermath of several shootings in Toronto, the city has focused on how to deal with gang violence. In a few short days and over a long weekend, 11 people were shot in Toronto. In the busy places where Torontonians go during the summer — Queen St., Kensington Market, to friends houses — the air has been torn by the sound of bullets leaving guns. Two young men killed outside a Queen St. nightclub — Smoke Dawg and Koba Prime — were up-and-coming rappers in the city's increasingly influential rap scene.
Two men and a woman were rushed to hospital with serious injuries after a shooting on Queen St. W. west of Peter St. at around 8 p.m. on June 30. It is one of several recent shootings in Toronto that police have linked to gang violence. ( Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star )
It would be a mistake to put all of the recent shootings in Toronto down to just more gang violence. But Toronto Mayor John Tory did exactly that when he declared that 75 per cent of the shootings were gang-related and involved “a very complicated network of gangs in the city.” That may be true but the picture is a more complicated one with national scope. Among non-U. S. OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, Canada ranks fourth in gun-related deaths and the majority are deaths by suicide. While overall crime rates have steadily been decreasing, violent crimes in some places have increase. Toronto gets a lot of headlines but the most dangerous city in Canada last year — when looking at violent crimes — was North Battleford, Sask., according to Maclean's magazine's crime rankings. In the two years before that, Grand Prairie, Alta., held the title. The rate of violent gun crime was a major factor in deeming those cities “dangerous.” Clearly, it's not just in Toronto. As Angela Wright, a prolific writer and advocate on gun reform has written, “When mayors and police chiefs in diverse cities like Surrey, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Ottawa and Toronto have publicly spoken about their struggles to grapple with rising gun violence, there is a problem.”
Article Continued Below
In Toronto, the mayor and the chief of police are moving quickly to reassure the public that the city is safe. Tory has stated that the Toronto Police Service is hiring 200 more officers. The plan to hire those officers predates this spate of shootings. Nonetheless, the last thing this situation needs is more police officers. Police officers are a response to conditions that have been created by a lack of political will combined with an ongoing antipathy toward black and racialized communities. What should be an option of last resort has become the first tool pulled from the tool box. Report after report has affirmed that what is needed for a number of vulnerable communities, especially Black and racialized communities, is affordable, sustainable and accessible housing. Instead, the provinces and cities have played a game of tug-of-war with the futures of families. More reports still have affirmed a need for better education and programming. Those recommendations have fallen by the wayside. Another report, reported in the Star this week and doomed to go unheeded, revealed the “cultural competence” of police officers. Delivered to Toronto police in March 2015, it found glaring gaps in how police understood their capacity to deal with Toronto's many and diverse communities. Notably “one in seven police staff fell into a “monocultural mindset,” which includes positions of “polarization” and “denial,” which take “us versus them” perspectives and “disinterest” in other cultures and operate based on “stereotypes about the cultural ‘other.' ” Furthermore, the new provincial conservative government has withdrawn hard-fought gains in ensuring increased police oversight. Rather than taking to heart several decades of research and recommendations connecting crime to poverty and a lack of services, we are adding 200 more matches to a burning fire and looking away.
As observed in Khalil Gibran Muhammad's The Condemnation of Blackness, black communities are met with an assumption of criminality that only entrenches violence; white communities are given parks and recreation centres. This summer promises to be a hot one. And I'm not sure we have seen any of the right answers to cool the heat of the streets. Vicky Mochama is the national columnist for Star Metro.

What would you do if you discovered your parents were super villains? In "Marvel's Runaways," estranged childhood friends decide to join forces in order to take them down (or at least that's what they did in the comics).
Hulu has released the very first teaser trailer of the comic-book adaptation "Runaways." This first look shows just how TV's newest teen superhero team comes to be: by watching their parents perform a ritual sacrifice in their hidden lair.
Based on the beloved series by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, "Runaways" follows Alex Wilder (Rhenzy Feliz), Nico Minoru (Lyrica Okano), Karolina Dean (Virginia Gardner), Gert Yorkes (Ariela Barer), Chase Stein (Gregg Sulkin) and Molly Hernandez (Allegra Acosta) as they learn their parents are members of a super-villain team called the Pride.
There's plenty to unpack for fans in this glimpse. So let's get to it:
For one, it looks like the Hulu series is keeping to the established origin story, ritual sacrifice and all. Other blink-and-you-might-miss-it moments include Nico discovering what looks to be the Staff of One, Molly getting ready to unleash some of her superhuman strength and even the appearance of Gert's genetically engineered dinosaur Old Lace.
The trailer also gives a glimpse of Karolina's alien form. As a Majesdanian, Karolina can absorb solar energy and her body glows with rainbow light.
Of course, not everything on the show will be completely black and white, heroes vs. villains. Josh Schwartz, one of the showrunners, previously mentioned that "there are no true villains in the show." In fact, the show's second episode will revisit the story told in the premiere from the parents' perspective.
"Marvel's Runaways" is scheduled to debut on Hulu on Nov. 21.
Watch the trailer (which contains some adult language) below.

A statement on her official Twitter account reads, “Unfortunately, Lady Gaga is suffering from severe pain that has materially impacted her ability to perform live.” The statement goes on to say that the star is scraping the final 10 dates of the European leg of her tour.

“She is extremely sorry and deeply saddened that she cannot perform for her European fans, who have waited so patiently,” adds the statement, noting that Gaga is “in the care of expert medical professionals who are working closely with her so she can continue to perform for her fans for years to come.”
In an additional statement, Gaga herself says she's “so devastated I don't know how to describe it,” but adds that she knows that if she doesn't cancel, she is “not standing by the words or meaning of my music.”
“I love you but this is beyond my control,” she says. “I promise I will be back…but for now, I need to put myself and my well-being first. I love you, forever.”
Last year, Gaga canceled a concert in Brazil for the same reason. She also revealed last year that she suffers from fibromyalgia, a disorder that causes muscle pain. Symptoms can sometimes begin after physical trauma or emotional stress.
Gaga is due to start a residency in Las Vegas in September of this year.

There is currently a mismatch between transit pricing and our social habits. While there may be value in taking the GO system or hopping on a local bus as an individual, once you start travelling as a group or family the advantage quickly becomes a penalty.
Take, for example, an actual evening out for my wife, my kids and me with family friends, beginning in Hamilton and ending at the Distillery District for some crowd-jostling gift exploration.
Using round numbers, the cost for our two families – 10 people with only two under 18 – of the GO portion was more than $200 between us. The Distillery District is too far to walk from Union Station so we needed to use the TTC with a subway-streetcar combination. At around $3 each, that's another $30 – happily we could use a transfer to go from the subway to the streetcar.
After our time wandering around the shops, we needed to buy another TTC trip – another $30. The price tag is now, very conservatively, $260 just for transportation. It would have been higher if we had used transit instead of our cars to get to the GO station in Hamilton (another $60 for that end of the trip).
There are likely ways to lower those costs (invite younger family members and leave the young adults at home), book something in advance – some group rates need 24-hours notice, for example – but it just isn't convenient even where it is available. The reality is that driving to Toronto in two vehicles and parking would have been significantly cheaper. For a few more dollars, we could have hired a limo.

Taylor Swift has kept a relatively low profile while her sixth studio album Reputation tops the charts and her fans gobble up a holiday helping of confessional new music. Over the weekend, however, Swift made an exception by performing at the Jingle Bell Ball in London.

Her headlining set included a combination of hits from 1989 and Reputation including “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off” from the former. From the latter, Taylor performed “Gorgeous,” “Look What You Made Me Do” and “…Ready For It?” For good measure, Swift threw in a solo rendition of her duet with Zayn Malik: “I Don't Wanna Live Forever.”
The performance followed almost a month after her November 11 appearance on Saturday Night Live. Other acts at the Jingle Bell Ball included Ed Sheeran and Liam Payne.
Watch Taylor perform “Ready For It,” “Gorgeous” and “Look What You Made Me Do” below:
VANDALIA — E-Mek Technologies, LLC, has announced a partnership with Solar Roadways, LLC of Sand Point, Idaho to manufacture its patented Solar Roadways Panels. These modular panels, which include solar cells to generate energy, a heating element to melt snow, and LED lights that can be programmed to direct automobile and foot traffic. It is designed to replace traditional asphalt and concrete surfaces.
E-Mek Technologies is a contract manufacturer, specializing in printed circuit boards, box build assembly, through hole soldering, and prototyping. The company began its operations at its current 50,000 square foot location in Vandalia in 2006.
“We have enjoyed a constructive relationship with Solar Roadways for almost four years, and our two companies have worked closely to develop the panels and fine tune the production process,” said Jeff Harris, E-Mek's Director of Sales and Marketing.
E-Mek initially contacted Solar Roadways after seeing “Solar Freakin' Roadways”- a promotional video about the product- and learning Scott Brusaw, President of Solar Roadways, is a Dayton native. “Scott wants to give something back to the city that he grew up in,” said Harris. “With the help of Montgomery County and the Dayton Development Coalition, we hope to make this project a reality.”
E-Mek plans to begin production of the Solar Road Panels at its Vandalia facility in 2018. With the help of the Dayton Development Coalition, E-Mek was awarded $40,000 in Economic Development Grant funding from JobsOhio to invest in new production equipment. E-Mek projects this investment will result in 50 new jobs.
“E-Mek's expansion demonstrates the company's leadership in providing top quality, cost-effective electronics as solar technology evolves,” said Glenn Richardson, JobsOhio managing director for advanced manufacturing. “This investment speaks to the E-Mek's confidence in Montgomery County's talent, and we are delighted that 50 more jobs are coming to this innovative Vandalia facility.”
“E-Mek can grow here because we have the resources, workforce and culture to support their innovative work,” said Jeff Hoagland, President and CEO, Dayton Development Coalition. “E-Mek's expansion demonstrates their ability to provide quality, cost effective electronics to an exciting solar technology.”
Montgomery County Commission President Debbie Lieberman confirmed the investment is an economic development opportunity for the region. “This unique product and the partnership between E-Mek and Solar Roadways demonstrates the Dayton region's history and capacity for innovation,” said Commissioner Lieberman. “It also exemplifies the region's rich industrial legacy and our bright future as a hub for advanced manufacturing.”
Solar Roadways' partnership with E-Mek Technologies also emphasizes the Dayton region's logistical advantages. “Montgomery County is fortunate to have infrastructure assets like the I-70/I-75 Interchange, which allows our companies to access 60 percent of the U.S. and Canada within one day,” said Montgomery County Commissioner Dan Foley. “Locating the first solar road panel production facility in the Dayton region will allow Solar Roadways and E-Mek Technologies to effectively meet the demand for this state-of-the-art product anywhere in North America.”

#5 Sri Lankan batting disappoints yet again
India handed Sri Lanka a 3-0 whitewash. ​​India beat Sri Lanka in the third and final Test of the 3-match series by an innings and 171 runs with more than two days to spare. The number one Test team registered their first whitewash away from home in Tests (minimum of 3-Test series).The hosts continued their sorry performance with the bat on day 3. Continuing from their overnight score of 19 for 1, they lost Dimuth Karunaratne very early in the day.Mohammed Shami, who bowled a brilliant spell with the new ball in the first innings, was at his best yet again. He dismissed Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis cheaply and put Sri Lanka under pressure straight away.After losing four wickets for not much on the board, the two best batsmen of Sri Lanka - Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, put together a patient partnership of 65 runs. However, both batsmen got out in quick succession looking to play attacking shots.Niroshan Dickwella (41 off 52 balls) impressed once again with his composure at the crease. The attacking southpaw looked the best of the lot during his stay. He employed the sweep against the spinners and kept the scoreboard ticking but it wasn't enough to impact the game. For India, it was Shami who was the pick of the bowlers once again. The quickie started the day brilliantly, getting two quick wickets upfront and setting the tone for the spinners. Ravichandran Ashwin, too, was brilliant with his off-spinners and picked up four wickets for 68. Kuldeep Yadav and Umesh Yadav bagged one and two wickets respectively.With this dominating win, India handed Sri Lanka their first whitewash in a 3-Test series since 2004.Here are five talking points from the day's play.India dominated the hosts in all departments of the game. They bowled, batted and fielded in a superior fashion in all the games and even had a better success rate using DRS.But the main reason Sri Lanka lost this series 3-0 was their uninspiring batting. The hosts just couldn't perform as a team the entire series.It was the same story on day 3 as all the batsmen lacked intent and threw away their wickets. Things are not looking good for the future of Sri Lankan cricket at the moment.​
Renowned and leading Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company, Procter and Gamble (P&G) is planning to shut down its newly commissioned production plant in Agbara Industrial Estate, Ogun State, Nigeria.
A report by Premium Times said the factory, which gulped about $300 million to complete and was commissioned in June 2017 by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, had been operating at loss since it started operations.
Frustrated by this, the management has allegedly decided to sell off the plant.
P&G produces popular products like Always sanitary pad, Pampers, Ariel detergent, Oral B toothpaste, Gillete shaving stick, among other products in the Nigerian market.
Quoting a source, Premium Times said about 120 workers are being laid off as part of the shutdown with some of them already receiving their disengagement letters which is to commence next month.
“About 30 staff will be left who may either be outsourced or deployed to our only remaining plant in Nigeria,” a company source informed the newspaper.
It was disclosed in the report that P&G has already sold one of its two plants located in Oluyole Estate in Ibadan, Oyo State as a result of poor earnings.
The company has two production plants in the area, one of which was used to produce Vicks lemon plus and the other Ariel detergent, but the Vicks plant has been sold.
“We had to sell the lemon plus plant in Ibadan. It was not sustainable to continue to run it at a loss,” the source said.
A resident of Oluyole Estate told Premium Times that one of the Ibadan plants, located along Seven-Up Road within Oluyole Estate, is still functioning while the other plant, which has now been confirmed to have been sold, has been moribund for a while.
The P&G source suggested that even the single remaining plant in Ibadan used to produce Ariel detergent is being reviewed.
“We are keeping it open for a while to see if we can sustain it,” the source said.
Insiders familiar with the development told Premium Times that the company is battling with the challenge posed by government policies that regulate importation of raw materials for its production.
A source explained that the cost of importing raw materials was becoming unbearable for the company, which has refused to involve in shady deals in order to cheat the system and ease importation.
“It is so expensive to import these raw materials which are not produced in Nigeria. Other companies take the short cut by manoeuvring the system, but we cannot,” a top official of the troubled firm disclosed.
Similarly, another factor said to be responsible for the shutdown was the unhealthy competition being faced by the company.
“Our competitors invested much less in their factory, can manoeuver their way in the system, and thus produce and sell for much less. We cannot do that.
“Our investment in Agbara is arguably the largest single investment by a non-oil firm in Nigeria. But we just have to shut it. The loss is much,” the source said.
When Premium Times reached out to the corporate communications desk of the company Tuesday morning, a staff of the desk, who declined to make her name known, quickly disconnected the telephone line immediately the questions about the shutdown were put to her.
But in a follow-up call by Premium Times Tuesday afternoon, a customer care attendant of the company told our reporter that no such development had been communicated to the communications team. The staff, who simply identified herself as Peace, said she was not aware of the situation.
“The information about the plant being shut down has not come to our notice. We don't have the information at hand,” she said.
“So it means the plant is still running. But once we have the information that the plant is shutting down then we can disseminate. But for now we don't have such information,” she added.

U.S. equities markets have been tepid this year, barely able to dig themselves out of a narrow trading range. After a nice climb in early May, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones are in free fall once again as geopolitical turmoil in Europe roils the markets.
Not even dividend-paying stocks, which have become popular with investors in recent years, offer much reprieve. Treasury yields have been on a tear in recent months, with even the lower-yielding 2-year Treasury overtaking the S&P 500 average dividend yield for the first time in a decade. The 10-year Treasury currently yields 3.01% vs. 1.86% average dividend yield by the S&P 500.

Financial Times
Given such a backdrop, it's easy for equities investors to start drooling at fixed-income assets such as Treasuries notes and bonds.
That seems like a no-brainer, but that's only part of the narrative.
Why buying both stocks and bonds makes sense
Investors are often advised to follow the 60/40 rule — i.e. have 60% of your portfolio in stocks and 40% in bonds. That's because stocks offer better opportunities for capital growth while bonds offer a steady source of income and a measure of downside protection against stock market sell-offs.
It's easy, however, for investors to simply look at yields but ignore bond prices. Rising interest rates have been depressing bond prices. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), an ETF that tracks long-term Treasury notes, is down nearly 4% in the year-to-date. Depending on how quickly interest rates climb, an investor could end up losing a large amount of his or her principal when the bonds eventually mature.
Another note of caution, too: Although bonds are flashing considerably higher yields than equities, bond yields are still far lower than their pre-financial levels.
Although bonds are flashing considerably higher yields than equities, bond yields are still far lower than their pre-financial levels.
Bloomberg
The differential between bonds and equities is still quite small compared to historical levels, thus making sense to still own stocks.
In fact, it would be a bad idea for long-term investors, savings minded individuals, pension funds and college endowment funds to completely offload their stocks and buy Treasuries.
There's a fair chance that bond yields will continue to rise further and/or stocks will fall. It makes sense to trim your exposure to equities when that happens.
Morgan Stanley thinks stocks still have some gas left in the tank and can mount a rally before peaking during the second half of the year with a series or rolling tops (read: lots of volatility) expected during the year.
Only 2% of fund managers expect a recession to kick in the current year, with 84% predicting a downturn in 2020.
For very long-term equities investors, the outlook is good. Tom Lee of Fundstrat Advisors expects the bull run to continue for another decade till 2029.
The long and short of it: It doesn't make a lot of sense to sell your stocks and buy bonds right now, though it might in the future.
Avoid junk bonds
For those who need to load up on bonds, not everything goes in this space. It's better to stick to lower-yielding but safer investment-grade bonds instead of buying junk bonds for their high yields.
In fact, Moody's recently fired a warning against buying junk bonds saying that the risk of default is too high.
In this market starved of decent yields, investors have understandably been piling in on speculative high-risk bonds. This is a worrying trend given that company debt has also been surging. If you must buy junk bonds, limit your exposure.

The Colorado Low poised to impact Southern Manitoba Monday and Tuesday has shifted slightly in its path, with the heaviest snow now expected to fall east of the Red River toward the Ontario border.
Environment Canada has ended the Special Weather Statement that was in effect for much of Sunday, and replaced it with a Snowfall Warning for the eastern Red River Valley including areas like Emerson, Steinbach, Vita, Sprague and Whiteshell Provincial Park. A Snowfall Warning is issued when 10 centimeters or more of snow is expected in 12 hours or less.
Snow will begin Monday morning with accumulations near 5 cm by Monday evening, but the heaviest snowfall will occur Monday night with accumulations of 10-15 cm by Tuesday morning. Snow will taper off Tuesday afternoon as the system moves out of the area. Snowfall accumulations in the Warning area east of the Red River will be in the 15-25 cm range by Tuesday afternoon.
“It's important to note, the western Red River Valley including Winnipeg, will still receive a good shot of snow from this storm,” explained CMOS Accredited Weathercaster Chris Sumner. “10 to 15 centimetres is certainly a possibility, and those regions will experience the same gusty, northerly winds as Southeastern Manitoba meaning reduced visibility and challenging driving conditions potentially.”
Meanwhile Southwestern Manitoba is forecast to receive 5 to 10 centimeters from this storm.
Strong northerly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will develop Monday evening reducing visibility in blowing snow, especially toward the Red River Valley and in open areas.
In behind this Colorado Low, an arctic airmass will build into Southern Manitoba bringing with it below average temperatures for this time of year, but lots of sunshine.
“Starting Tuesday daytime highs will be 6 to 8 degrees below normal for this time of year, somewhere in the -17 to -21 range depending on where you are in Southern Manitoba,” said Sumner.
There is a thing about textbook-style technique in cricket. Purists love it, while the dashing, modern-day cricket fans hate it. Chances are that most modern-day players with an impeccable technique and average strike-rate remain stuck to the Test team with a leash.
Ajinkya Rahane is one such individual. The poor soul has been given a rough deal by the selectors far too often in One-Day International (ODI) cricket. Rahane has constantly been shuffled in the batting order despite his stature as a senior player in the side.
He was selected in the ODI team for the Sri Lanka series despite his recent woes in the longer format of the game at home. In hindsight, he should probably have been left out to play the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals for Mumbai against Karnataka, for it would have better prepared him for the challenges in South Africa.
India sorely need Rahane in overseas Tests. Like his mentor, Rahul Dravid, Rahane is a figure of composure and tenacity. He brings calm to the storm and silences the ruckus with his still head and solid defence. In a team of delightful, extravagant, flamboyant cricketers, Rahane is an outlaw; one who adheres to the cricket rulebooks and plays as the situation demands.
In ODI cricket, he is a misfit or so, feels the Indian management. He has often been used as a stop-gap option at the top to ensure that one of Rohit Sharma or Shikhar Dhawan get enough time away from the frenzied world of ODIs.
In the past, he was used as a middle-order batsman too until MS Dhoni pointed out that Rahane's lack of strike-rotation affects India's middle-overs. Dhoni might have been right. Rahane does get a tad stuck at the crease, bides his time to get into groove and then plays freely. These are a quality best suited for opening batsmen. But India does not have a vacancy there with Rohit and Dhawan sealing their spots with scintillating performances.
If Rahane needs to play now, one of Rohit or Dhawan should be missing. Rohit, India's stand-in skipper for the ongoing series against Sri Lanka also spoke along those lines after the first ODI at Dharamsala.
"I think we made it clear in Sri Lanka that he is an opening batsman and we don't want to keep changing his batting slot. It plays on anyone's mind not just his, if one's batting order is kept on changing”, Rohit had said.
In a way, Rohit is right. Rahane's best has always come as an opening batsman. But in conditions where the ball swings around, shouldn't Rahane, India's most equipped batsman technically, be in the playing XI, as opener or not?
Rahane's last four scores in ODIs are all half-centuries — all against Australia in the home series in September — and the Mumbaikar has churned them out opening the batting. In fact, the last time Rahane played an ODI and didn't open the innings was in January, 2016, in Australia.
During that ODI series, Rahane played three games, batted twice at No 4 and made scores of 89 and 50 at strike rates of 111.25 and 90.90. Overall, he averages 37.00 in 20 ODIs at No 4 with five half-centuries. Compare this to his three hundreds as opener and you know that Rohit has a point when he states Rahane should open.
But we aren't here to compare his stats as an opener and middle-order batsman. We are here to assess why Rahane was left out from the playing XI in Dharamsala where India succumbed to 29/7 against Suranga Lakmal's menacing fast bowling.
Would Rahane have stopped the slide and uplifted India from the abyss on Sunday? Probably not. But that he was India's best shot at doing it is known to everyone. Even after being cognizant of the fact that the conditions in Dharamsala demanded for the inclusion of a technically adept batsman, India chose to be complacent and walked out with a fairly inexperienced middle-order.
It was downright rude to expose Manish Pandey and Shreyas Iyer in the early stages of their career to a rampaging Lakmal on one of the most difficult pitches in the country. With India missing Virat Kohli as well, the middle-order was devoid of experience and the presence of Ajinkya Rahane would have been of utmost relief to these youngsters. After all, he is the Test vice-captain and has time and again proven his prowess against the swinging ball.
Where did India's horses for courses policy vanish then? A year ago, skipper Virat Kohli had stated that India would like to choose their players for a game based on the pitch and conditions.
“We see the conditions and the way the pitch is going to behave and we pick the best XI. We specialise in choosing people according to the way the wicket is going to behave maybe on the third and fourth day as well. So you need to keep everything in consideration. It's always a good thing to have a lot of options because you pick the best side according to the conditions we are playing in. The best part is that everyone's bought into the idea, and it's not hard to inform the players that someone else is playing for them. They understand that it's eventually for the larger reason, which is to make the team win. So everyone's at peace with that, the vision we have for the team. Obviously we are going to pick the best XI according to the conditions”, Kohli had told Wisden India.
But of late, that policy seems to have disappeared. In the Champions Trophy final, on a pitch which aided early swing and seam movement, Mohammad Amir wreaked havoc, disintegrating the Indian batting line-up and shunning them to an embarrassing loss. All the while, Rahane stood in the sidelines and watched the drama unfold in the crudest of forms.
A month later, he was back to opening the batting in the West Indies and ended the series with scores of 62, 103, 72, 60 and 39. He was adjudged the Man of the Series. When Jason Holder and his team of seam bowlers made life difficult for India, Rahane was among the only few players to stand up and fight.
When the Lanka ODIs began, Rahane was once again sidelined from the opening slot with the settled pair of Dhawan and Rohit returning, and even the middle-order was full with Lokesh Rahul picked at No 4 — a position that doesn't suit him — to deal with the Lankan spinners.
The move came apart horribly. Rahul struggled immensely against Akila Dananjaya's wily mystery spin and was ousted from the team. Once again, it was harsh. Rahul was made to play out of position and never got a chance to fight for his place in the side in a fair manner.
Rahane, on the other hand, played just one match in the series but was back at the top for the Australian ODIs at home with Shikhar Dhawan resting. He was outstanding once again, racking up scores of 55, 70, 53 and 61 in the series. That he played as an opener is not very relevant in the current context.
In Kolkata, for the first Test against Sri Lanka on a seaming deck, India left out Murali Vijay and chose Dhawan and Lokesh Rahul as their openers. It was once again a deviation from their standard of playing the right players in the right conditions. Vijay roared back with two hundreds in the remainder of the series.
The Dharamsala ODI was just another of those instances when logic flew out of the window. If a senior player like Rahane — good enough to oppose the best of bowlers in the toughest of conditions — is available in the side, why did the management sit him out on a seamer-friendly wicket?
The fact that India conveniently chose to ignore the safety net that Rahane provides belies logic. When Lakmal and Pradeep were unleashing their wrath on the Indian batsmen, Rahane could have been the solid wall, refusing to budge and helping India past the difficult, initial few overs. Instead he watched from the bench as the Lankan lions roared in the picturesque Dharamsala.
The next ODI is scheduled to be played in Mohali which is once again known to favour the quicker bowlers. India can choose to persist with the same XI and destroy the confidence of a few youngsters or bring back Rahane and strengthen their middle-order while the younger guns bat around him. The decision could prove to be a series-changing one.
Damon Albarn was plenty worried about the future of the planet when he made “Humanz,” the fifth album by his band Gorillaz, which he's described as a “dark fantasy” imagining the impossible election of Donald Trump.
But that was last year, before Trump actually won. And before hurricanes demolished Houston and Puerto Rico. And before a madman pointed a gun through a hotel window in Las Vegas and massacred 58 music lovers trying to enjoy a concert.
“Every week the world just gets slightly crazier,” Albarn said Thursday night at the Forum, and he sounded genuinely crushed, if also somehow unsurprised, by the developments of the last few months.
Apart from that observation, though, the singer seemed determined to persist — to live it up, in fact — as he led Gorillaz through a sweaty, exuberant two-hour performance full of guest appearances and singalong tunes.
The message was dire but the vibe was celebratory: a dance party despite (or perhaps because of) the dire state of the world.
That blend of emotions has always defined the music of Gorillaz, which began in the late 1990s when Albarn, best known for leading the Britpop band Blur, teamed with visual artist Jamie Hewlett to create a so-called virtual group fronted by animated characters.
The goofy concept (and the catchy tunes) helped make radio hits of songs with deeply gloomy sentiments, like “Clint Eastwood” and the archly titled “Feel Good Inc.”; the focus on Hewlett's cartoons gave Albarn a break from the personal scrutiny demanded by pop stardom.

Yet these days the singer seems less concerned with all that. At the Forum, where Gorillaz stopped as part of a lengthy world tour, slickly produced videos played on a giant screen at the back of the stage; sometimes those characters even mouthed Albarn's lyrics.
But the real show was watching the frontman and his crew of musicians (including six backup vocalists) bear down on the music, which hit harder and moved faster than on the band's records.
“We Got the Power,” about the will to “be loving each other no matter what happens,” was punky and propulsive, while “Kids With Guns” had Albarn attacking an electric guitar as though he were meting out a punishment.
For “Ascension,” the Long Beach rapper Vince Staples popped out to deliver his vivid lines about how sinister forces are “trying to dinosaur us.” Peven Everett, a soul singer from Chicago, channeled the great Charlie Wilson as he joined the group for an ecstatic rendition of the rubbery “Strobelite.”
And then there was D.R.A.M., the ebullient Virginia rapper, who brought a merry sensuality to “Andromeda.”
Additional cameos from De La Soul (in “Superfast Jellyfish” and “Feel Good Inc.”), Pusha T (“Let Me Out”) and Del the Funky Homosapien (“Clint Eastwood”) kept your eyes on the stage rather than the screen; Jehnny Beth, of the fierce London rock band Savages, was especially commanding in “We Got the Power” as she pumped her fists in the air, her dark hair slicked back like a young Freddie Mercury.
Not everything jumped so intensely. Near the end of the show the band played a new song, a kind of country shuffle, that Albarn said he'd just written during a brief vacation in Idaho.
And the concert finished with the reggae-inflected title track from Gorillaz's 2005 album “Demon Days,” which had the enveloping feel of church music thanks to the mini-choir of backing singers.
But even here — in a decade-old song conceived at a time when “you can't even trust the air you breathe” — Albarn projected a willingness to meet the moment.
Yes, things are bad, he seemed to be saying. But they can only get worse.

This years flu season has now sent more people to the hospital with the illness than in nearly a decade, federal health officials said Friday. Nationwide during the past week, 16 more children died from the virus.
So far this season, influenza has caused the deaths of at least 53 children, rivaling that of the especially severe 2014-2015 flu season. Eighty percent of them had not had a flu shot.
The unrelenting pace of infection is unusual, officials said. High levels of flu activity are widespread across the country, and over the past week, the rate of patients seeking care for flulike symptoms again rose sharply - nearing rates seen during the swine-flu pandemic in 2009, according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Continued below.)

As of this week, overall hospitalizations are now the highest weve seen in nearly a decade, CDC Acting Director Anne Schuchat told a briefing for reporters. Schuchat was placed in charge of the agency Wednesday after Brenda Fitzgerald resigned from the top job because of conflicts over her financial interests.
In her remarks, Schuchat said the personnel change will not detract from CDCs mission to protect the health, safety and security of Americans, including from the flu, which she called one of the biggest health threats facing the country.
For the week ending Jan. 27, more states reported high numbers of patients going to doctor offices, hospital emergency rooms and urgent care clinics seeking treatment for flulike symptoms, said Daniel Jernigan, head of CDCs influenza division.
Of the children who died, about half had no underlying medical conditions.
Schuchat urged parents to be on the lookout for worrisome symptoms that could indicate severe illness: very high persistent fever, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat and significant fatigue or confusion. In addition, a child who appears to be improving but suddenly gets worse could signal a secondary bacterial infection.
Officials said they are particularly concerned about the seasons hospitalization rate - 51.4 per 100,000 people - which is already significantly higher than the 43.5 rate for the same period during the 2014-2015 season.
That season was also characterized by the same predominant flu strain known as H3N2, which typically results in the most complications, especially for the very young, the elderly and people with certain chronic health conditions.
In California, hospitalization rates are four times higher than what they were in 2014-2015; in Oregon and Minnesota, hospitalization rates are double what they were back then.
If trends continue, Jernigan said, the toll from this season could well exceed that of 2014-2015, which ended with 56,000 flu-related deaths, 710,000 people hospitalized and 16 million who sought care from a clinician or hospital. There are early indications that flu activity may be peaking in the West, but we are by no means out of the woods, said Schuchat, noting that the disease continues to increase in the East and remains largely unchanged in the South.
Officials still are urging those who have not yet been vaccinated to get flu shots. The flu season has not yet peaked, and all indications suggest that many more weeks of flu are ahead. The country is now in its 10th week of the flu season; the average duration is 16 weeks but can last for 20 weeks.
Officials said they dont yet know how effective this years vaccines ultimately will be against the three strains of circulating flu. In seasons when the predominant strain is H3N2, vaccine effectiveness tends to be lower than that against H1N1 and influenza B viruses, which are also showing up this season.
Officials have said that they expect this seasons vaccine to be about 32 percent effective against circulating H3N2 viruses. But a study earlier this week by Canadian researchers suggests the H3N2 component of the vaccine is only about 17 percent effective in preventing infection. In Australia, where flu activity is often a clue for what to expect in North America, interim reports suggest that vaccine effectiveness was only 10 percent.
Schuchat said CDC officials plan to provide an interim estimate of vaccine effectiveness in several weeks. We expect effectiveness against H3N2 will be low, but we dont have that final number yet, she said.
One reason the vaccine may be less effective on this strain has to do with the way most vaccines are manufactured: by growing them in eggs. The problem with this H3N2 virus especially is that when you grow it in eggs, it makes changes to the virus that are different to the ones out there in circulation, Jernigan said.

An explosion in central New York pushed the dollar lower on Monday, but stock markets recovered after an early dip, once it became clear the situation had been contained.
New York police said the explosion rocked the Port Authority Bus Terminal as the Monday morning rush hour was getting underway. Three injuries were reported and a suspect was in custody.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes rose 0.1 to 0.3 percent when the main U.S. stock markets opened two and a half hours later.
The dollar slipped as far as 113.245 yen against the Japanese currency. The Swiss franc, a refuge at times of heightened risk, reached a high of 1.16755 francs per euro.
“We did see equities futures moving lower and it is not a surprise that we saw a move in crosses like dollar-yen,” said CIBC's head of currency strategy Jeremy Stretch. “There is a susceptibility, whenever there is a degree of uncertainty, for the usual suspects to react.”
Before the news from New York, European markets were quiet, with the spotlight instead on new bitcoin futures, which were feeding traders' cryptocurrency obsession.
A positive Asian stocks session had helped Europe initially. The rally dissipated, but a fall in sterling and a rebound by mining shares kept London's FTSE 0.5 percent higher. Germany's cyclicals-heavy DAX also held its ground.
But the spotlight was on the debut of Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency in one, two or three months.
The one-month contract, the most-traded on the Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets exchange, opened at $15,850 on Sunday night – a gain of 21 percent.
It was last quoted at $17,850, having earlier traded as high as $18,850. Bitcoin itself hovered at just under $16,000.
Bitcoin has rocketed up 1,600 percent since the start of the year, attracting institutional interest – and concern that it is a bubble in the making.
“The one-month contract is trading at around an 11 percent premium to the underlying bitcoin, and for me that's a clear indication that there's no connection between the two markets,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco.
Several online brokerages have not yet allowed trading of the new futures.
“I can understand you don't see that many people who are willing to offer this contract, because you can't hedge your underlying risk if you can't short it,” Daalder said. “This only adds to the bitcoin phenomenon. It's interesting to watch, but not a market that I would like to touch.”
While frantic trading kept bitcoin volatility dizzying, a gauge of S&P 500 volatility hovered below 10, nearing the record low hit in November, though it was edging up slightly after four days of falls.
Despite the dip in U.S. futures, MSCI's world stocks index was still higher at 505.31 points and close to last week's latest all-time peak of 507.09 points.
“Momentum behind stock markets has been pretty solid, supported in part by good numbers on the economic front and not bad earnings. I don't see anything happening right now that could break the momentum,” Daalder said.
Currency and bond markets were cautious ahead of a big week of policy meetings, although the Federal Reserve is the only major central bank expected to raise interest rates.
The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are widely seen holding rates steady.
Sterling stabilized, edging lower after a volatile week, last at $1.3383.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, eased 0.2 percent to 93.75, still hovering near a three-week high after five straight sessions of gains.
Sluggish U.S. wage growth and inflation have sparked some concern overrate rises, and traders will zoom in on the Fed's future rate projections on Wednesday.
“It's a tall order for the median Fed dots to shift lower, but we may see a slight downshift in the distribution,” said ING forex strategists in a note, adding that the dollar index could fall below 93 as a 25-basis-point rate rise from the Fed is priced in.
Most high-grade euro zone bond yields were a tad lower, with 10-year Bund yields, the benchmark for the region, dropping below 0.30 percent.
“Bunds have drifted lower in recent weeks,” said Robeco's Daalder. “I would say there's some complacency for sure, but I don't see any major moves until the new year.”
In commodities, signs of increased drilling activity after the latest rise in the U.S. rig count dampened oil prices.
U.S. crude fell to $56.91 a barrel before recovering to trade flat at $57.26, and Brent crude inched up to $63.47, holding near a recent 2-1/2 year peak of $64.65.
Spot gold was firmer at $1,250.81 an ounce. Copper prices gained for a fourth straight session, having fallen sharply early last week.

A pedestrian and traffic study will be conducted in the area near the site of Winkler's new K-8 school to be built west of 15th Street and south of Highway 14.
Garden Valley School Division Superintendent Vern Reimer said the study, which will be done in conjunction with the City of Winkler, will assist in assuring compliance with the province's Pedestrian Safety Legislation.
Reimer said they do expect some challenges, as the surrounding landscape has changed so much in the nearly 10 years since the school site was purchased. "That development has come up around the site," said Reimer. "So what we have now is what we have, and we'll certainly work with that."
The study will look at things like traffic control devices, speed limit signs, crosswalks, and pedestrian corridors. Once that is done, recommendations will be forwarded to the traffic authority for implementation prior to the school opening in September of 2019.
Meanwhile, Reimer said the school project is right on schedule. Project drawings should be complete by the end of this month, with tenders going out in January, and construction slated to begin in February.

The CFPB's new rule on small-dollar loans will, as Iain Murray mentioned, draw opposition from Republicans who argue that it will only cut off access to credit for some individuals. It may also increase Republicans' interest in reforming the agency and removing its director, Richard Cordray.
The agency's insulation from accountability to elected officials—it gets its funding from the Federal Reserve, not Congress, and by statute the president cannot fire its director at will—raises constitutional questions. A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the president has to have complete discretion over firing the director, but the ruling has been vacated while the full appeals court is considering the issue.
Conservatives think that this structure is ripe for abuse—and that it has been abused. (I've written about one CFPB overreach in the past: its regulation of car dealers.) Republican state attorneys general are particularly eager to see change at the agency. “When you have an institution with no accountability, it causes great concern,” Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge told me when she was in D.C. last week. She charged that the CFPB is having a negative effect on credit, especially in rural areas.
At the same D.C. event, sponsored by the Rule of Law Defense Fund (a kind of think tank for the Republican AGs), Oklahoma attorney general Mike Hunter also called for reform. Banks were moving too many employees from customer service to compliance because of the agency, he lamented. He suggested that the judicial and executive action was a more realistic prospect than legislation. “At least with respect to the Democratic senators, there is this blank check that they have given Elizabeth Warren on bank regulation. Any reform will be demagogued—I use that word; it's the right word—by Elizabeth Warren.”
A lot of CFPB critics are frustrated with President Trump for not having acted against Cordray. They say that even if he feels he needs to cause firing Cordray, he has plenty. Political considerations are reportedly staying Trump's hand: A firing might help Cordray with his long-expected run for governor of Ohio in 2018. Rutledge was diplomatic about the inaction: “We're still early into this administration.”
The game has consumed the Clippers, keeping their thoughts from veering too far from formidable Western Conference playoff opponent Utah.
There is too much at stake for the Clippers not to be fully engaged seemingly at all times in the best-of-seven series in which they trail 1-0 against the Jazz.
No longer do the Clippers have the home-court advantage after losing Game 1 on Saturday night at Staples Center.
So even after they had downtime after practice Sunday and Monday, the players' attention stayed on the Jazz and how the Clippers can even the series when it resumes Tuesday night at home.
“I don't know as a coach if you ever let it go. I really don't,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Monday. “I watched all the games yesterday. At the very end of the Houston game [against Oklahoma City], I changed [channels]. … Even when you're watching games, I have a notepad. Even when you're watching a movie, you have a notepad next to you.
“But I'm the same way during the regular season. I just don't think you get away from it. I don't want to. I love my job. I enjoy it. I think that's just the life of a coach, and that's not a bad life. I think we would all love that, like something we love or are thinking about. So that's just me.”
Rivers rewound, in his mind, to Game 1 and what went wrong. He also fast-forwarded to Game 2 and the corrections the Clippers must make to avoid falling behind 2-0.
“I think about all kinds of thing,” Rivers said. “I think about Game 1. I think about stuff we can run in Game 2. Yeah, I just think basketball. That's what I am.”
Chris Paul is a consummate professional basketball player, and the game is as important to his family as it is to him.
So they all enjoyed Easter together and then watched NBA playoff games.
And of course, Clippers guard Paul was never far removed from trying to figure out ways to defeat the Jazz.
“I went to church yesterday morning with my family,” Paul said Monday. “Then came in and we had practice. Then after practice, I went home and watched all the games that came on. The kids got in the pool. I tried to enjoy Easter Sunday with my family.
“Ain't no such thing as getting away from basketball. Like that's my normal day with my family.”
The Clippers spent the last two days thinking about how they must match the physical play of the Jazz.
The Clippers rued that their defense wasn't up to the task of slowing down the Jazz.
They regretted not playing as hard as the Jazz did.
So, the Clippers say, they don't have time to stop reflecting about the game.
“Nah. Nah. It's never like that in the playoffs,” Marreese Speights said.
Each player has his own way with dealing with tough losses like the last-second defeat to Utah in Game 1.
Rivers reasoned that some players have short-term memories, others can't let it go.
He was asked if one approach was better than the other.
“That's a good question,” Rivers said. “but I'm not sure on the answer. I don't know. I think to each his own. I think some players hold on and they do better holding on. Some players need to let go and they do better in that. So I would say that's probably an individual thing.”

Tensions rise as Puerto Rico residents lack basic services, electricity
Puerto Rico's Senate has ordered government agencies to explain why tens of thousands of people in rural areas remain without power or appropriate shelter as anger grows about the lack of basic services more than seven months after hurricanes Irma and Maria.
The agencies have been given five days to present a plan on how and when they will address the needs of rural towns, an order that came as police in a small mountain town blocked power crews from leaving Tuesday. Joining the protest was the mayor and dozens of people who noted that nearly 40 percent of Las Piedras' inhabitants were still without electricity service as crews prepared to leave for another town on company orders.
“This is unfair,” 62-year-old town resident Rafael Jimenez said by phone. “I don't have a problem with other towns getting power because it's a national necessity, but we need it, too.”
When an island-wide blackout hit earlier this month, CBS News correspondent David Begnaud, who has reported extensively on the island's devastation, reported that the power authority would prioritize restoring electricity to hospitals, the airport and gas stations. Residences would receive the lowest priority.
The standoff caught the attention of top Puerto Rico government officials and ended several hours later after the power company promised it would keep crews in Las Piedras until service is fully restored. Justo Gonzalez, the company' executive sub director, said in a statement that he is committed to restoring power to everyone but that blocking crews would only delay those efforts.
More than 33,000 power customers across Puerto Rico remain in the dark, including Jimenez, who said he has spent hundreds of dollars to run a small generator to help keep his relatives alive.
Jimenez is caring for his 97-year-old grandmother, who is bedridden and relies on an oxygen tank, as well as for his elderly parents. His mother relies on refrigerated insulin.
The family has been without power since Hurricane Irma, which brushed past Puerto Rico's northeastern coast as a Category 5 storm Sept. 6. Maria then hit the island Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, killing dozens of people and causing more than an estimated $100 billion in damage.
“People are not doing well,” Las Piedras Mayor Miguel Lopez told The Associated Press, noting that there are many elderly people in his town. “They are suffering.”
The mayors of rural towns across Puerto Rico recently complained that they remain largely forgotten, prompting the island's Senate president on Monday to order agencies such as the power company as well as Puerto Rico's department of transportation and housing authority to submit a restoration plan and a timetable to meet the mayors' needs.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing federal power restoration efforts on the island, has said they expect to restore power to everyone by late May. Many remain wary of that timetable, including federal legislators who have requested that the agency's mission be extended as they note that the Atlantic hurricane seasons starts June 1.

Amethi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Centre claiming that its much talked about bullet train project was like a "magic" locomotive that may not materialise. Targeting the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, Rahul also said that despite an issue like Doka La on the border, the prime minister was seen sitting on a swing with the Chinese president.
"Modi's bullet train is like a magic train which may not materialise in reality," the Congress chief said speaking to party activists at Fursatganj. Rahul, who is the local MP, also claimed that the Centre's demonetisation decision had done nothing but derail business activity at all levels. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has broken the "backbone" of small traders while benefitting big businessmen.
"As much as Rs 2 lakh crore of 15 big businessmen have been waived off... The first task that Narendra Modi ji did was that he broke the backbone of small and middle class businessmen," Rahul, who arrived here on a two-day visit, said. "He (Modi) snatched money from your pockets through GST and demonetisation and gave it away to Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi," he added.
The Congress chief claimed employment generation was hit adversely under the current regime. Attacking the government on foreign policy front, Rahul said despite a contentious and sensitive issue like Doklam on the border, Prime Minister Modi sat on a swing with the Chinese president.
Rahul also visited Pure Dhingai village to condole the death of a farmer who allegedly died some time back while waiting for the sale of his crop at a government centre. Meanwhile, a party activist said very soon around 250 youth, active on social media, may be selected and trained by the Jawahar Lal Nehru Leadership Institute in the field of media.
Sam Querrey fought from a set down to defeat Laslo Djere and John Isner won a fifth-set tiebreaker over Dusan LaJovic to give the United States a 2-0 lead over Serbia in the first round of the Davis Cup World Group on Friday.
Querrey had 20 aces in a 6-7 (4), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win in the opening singles, and Isner followed with 24 aces in his 6-4, 6-7 (6), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (4) victory.
Host Serbia is playing without Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki. It won the last two ties against the U.S., including in 2010 when it went on to win the title.
The U.S. can clinch the victory in the series in Saturday's doubles, when Ryan Harrison and Steve Johnson face Nikola Milojevic and Miljan Zekic.
Defending champion France got off to a slow start at home against the Netherlands as Adrian Mannarino was upset by Thiemo de Bakker, a player more than 300 places below him in the rankings, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-3. Richard Gasquet leveled the score by defeating Robin Haase 6-4, 7-6 (3), 3-6, 7-5.
Last year's runner-up, Belgium opened a 2-0 lead over visiting Hungary as Ruben Bemelmans defeated Marton Fucsovics 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3 and David Goffin beat Attila Balazs 6-4, 6-4, 6-0.
Spain, without Rafael Nadal, moved ahead of Great Britain when Albert Ramos-Vinolas defeated Liam Broady 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (6), but 114th-ranked Norrie Cameron evened the series by rallying from two sets down to upset Roberto Bautista-Agut 4-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Spain is playing its first tie at home since 2013.
Croatia, runner-up to Argentina two years ago, opened a 1-0 lead over Canada at home with Borna Coric's 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Vasek Pospisil, but Denis Shapovalov tied the series by defeating Viktor Galovic 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
Germany led host Australia after Alexander Zverev defeated Alex de Minaur 7-5, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4), but Nick Kyrgios leveled the score with a comfortable 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over Jan-Lennard Struff.
Fabio Fognini defeated Taro Daniel 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to give Italy the lead over Japan, but the hosts evened the series with Yuichi Sugita beating Andreas Seppi 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (1).
Switzerland, without Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka, was losing 2-0 at Kazakhstan. Dmitry Popko defeated Henri Laaksonen 6-2, 7-6 (7), 3-6, 7-5 and Mikhail Kukushkin beat Adrian Bodmer 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.

Very few movie franchises have captured the world's imagination quite like the Star Wars series. So it should come as no surprise to learn that the film universe's stories have provoked various theories – some of the ideas are plausible, some less so. The latest installment, The Last Jedi, was no different. The space opera series' eighth movie was written and directed by Rian Johnson, and it is a hidden detail in his script which has recently been the subject of a very interesting fan theory. And it is a hypothesis which is sure to leave millions of Star Wars disciples gob smacked…
It is fair to say that moviegoing sci-fi fans had been frothing at the mouth in anticipation of The Last Jedi. Johnson's film, starring Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and a few old favorites, finally dropped at the end of 2017. It formed the second part of the so-called sequel trilogy, following on from J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens from two years earlier.

The Last Jedi continues the story of hero Rey, played by Ridley, and her battle with Driver's villainous Kylo Ren as the Resistance and First Order fight for space supremacy. Rey is aided by Master Jedi Luke Skywalker, a role reprised by Mark Hamill from the original trilogy, who taught the young protagonist the ways of the Force.

When he was a freshman at Granite City High, Carter Roustio found a new sport — tennis.
“I could play tennis all day,” Roustio said. “It's different than any other sport I played.”
Tennis was certainly good to Roustio all four years at GCHS. He turned in a successful high school career, earning four varsity letters and two all-Southwestern Conference awards. He also was named captain on this year's team that included seniors Brian Ames, Hayden Day and Nathan Tanthavong.
“Tennis was always the most fun for me,” the Granite City senior said. “It was never a chore to play. I always loved playing and I just caught the bug. I just felt like I wanted to play tennis. I played year round. I liked the other sports, but tennis was my No. 1 love.”
This spring, Roustio picked up several wins in No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles and was the Warriors' lone representative on the all-Southwestern Conference team, earning third-team singles honors. The strong senior season earned Roustio this year's Granite City AdVantage News Boys Tennis Player of the Year award.
“Senior year was very enjoyable for me,” he said. “Coming from junior year, I was playing No. 1. I was not winning as much as I would like, but I had to go through that year and get better and I was pushed by my opponents. I took that as a challenge and I got better for my senior year. I saw a little more success in singles and I became a lot better as a singles player in my senior year and I had a lot of fun with my partner, Brian Ames. We played well together.”
Roustio said coach Raffi Karibian has been helpful to him all four years.
“He taught me a lot of discipline outside of tennis in everyday life,” he said. “He's a great coach and he gives us all of the skills and the knowledge in a short period of time to compete in our conference.”
In his freshman year, Roustio was influenced by Karibian to try out for the Granite City boys tennis team.
“I would go out with my brothers (Jake and Jamie) and we were super competitive growing up together,” he said. “We would try to beat each other. I actually played, try to learn and how to improve maybe two or three weeks before my freshman season started. Karibian came out and said, ‘I know you and Jake play a lot together. So I was wondering do you want to actually play on the team for me.' I came out and I was pretty athletic in my freshman year and I did go out and play a little bit.”
Roustio prepared for his senior season by joining Ames and Tanthavong in a summer tennis camp at Edwardsville High last year.
“I got a lot of work in and improved through the summer last year, so that definitely helped me and the seniors this year in match play,” Roustio said.
Roustio said one of his biggest highlights this year was finishing sixth in singles at the Southwestern Conference tournament on May 13 at Edwardsville.
“I lost to Silas Chapman from Alton in super tiebreaker,” he said. “Last year, we played on the same exact court on the same exact spot for singles and he beat me 6-2, 6-2. This year, I beat him in the first set 7-5, lost in the second set 6-4 and lost 10-7 in a tiebreaker. So it shows how much I improved since last season.”
Last year, Roustio earned third-team conference honors in doubles with Jeremy Erickson, who graduated in ‘16.
Roustio plans to attend UMSL next year and major in nursing. He will continue to play tennis for leisure.
“I plan on playing in USTA, playing in intramurals and getting into tournaments,” he said.

NDP leader John Horgan was talking health care during his first campaign stop of the day this morning in Burnaby. As Jordan Armstrong reports, Horgan's plan to address the family doctor shortage was long on ideas but short on specifics.
There was turkey, stuffing and all the fixings.
Penticton's Soupateria hosted its annual Easter feast for 140 of Penticton's less fortunate on Monday.
“I just feel I want to give back in some way. I've been blessed all of my life so it is time to give back,” said volunteer Joyce Ensz.
Volunteers spent several hours preparing the scrumptious meal and decorating the hall.
There was a steady stream of hungry patrons and demand for the soup kitchen is on the rise.
“It's an economic thing, there is very little affordable housing in this city,” said volunteer co-ordinator Lauraine Bailie.
The rental housing crunch and the increasing cost of living is forcing more and more people onto their doorsteps.
“Sewage charges, and gas and hydro and that type of thing, people are really struggling and as for large apartments for families with children, three-bedroom apartments, they are few and far between in this city too,” Bailie said.
Last year a survey conducted by various local non-profits recorded nearly 130 homeless people in the south Okanagan city, double than what was initially expected.
Of those, nearly half have been homeless for more than a year and 86 per cent of those surveyed suffered from mental health issues.
It is putting more pressure on organizations like the Soupateria Society which relies solely on donations.
“Last year our budget was 85,000 dollars and this year it will go up considerably,” Bailie said.
Volunteers said they will continue to dish out compassion one meal at a time.
Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, has begun collecting personal data of persons suspected of people smuggling, terrorism and other cross-border crimes collected as part of its operation in Greece.
The data collection will take place as part of the operational project PeDRA (Processing Personal Data for Risk Analysis), which contributes to the fight against cross-border crime by ensuring that information containing personal data is effectively managed and reported from the operational area to the national and EU levels. At Frontex, the data is used for risk analysis in accordance with data protection principles, and is also transmitted on a daily basis to Europol to support investigations in other countries.
PeDRA was launched in Italy in February 2016 and was later introduced in Spain. It represents a significant milestone for the EU's fight against facilitated irregular migration and other cross-border crimes because it demonstrates that Frontex joint operations can be used as an effective platform for the collection and subsequent analysis of personal data of suspected criminals at the EU level.
More than 2,000 reports have been collected across the operational areas as part of PeDRA, generating more than 1,400 descriptions of individuals suspected of involvement in cross border-crimes such as facilitation of irregular migration. Risk analysis of this data has shed light on the activities of criminal networks and have provided Europol with new areas for investigation.

Carlos Santana has issued a statement regarding controversial comments he made regarding Beyoncé.
Santana got into hot water when he insinuated Queen Bey lost to Adele at the GRAMMYs because she couldn't sing.

“I would like to clarify a comment that was reported when I was doing an interview for some upcoming shows in Australia & New Zealand,” he wrote.
“My intent was to congratulate Adele on her amazing night at the Grammies [sic]. My comment about Beyoncé was regretfully taken out of context. I have the utmost respect for her as an artist and a person. She deserves all the accolades that come her way. I wish Beyoncé and her family all the best.”

Canada would love nothing more than to take the gold medal on American soil. After the United States defeated the Canadians in the 2017 gold medal game 5-4 in a shootout, their neighbors of the north were in agony to have come so close and just fall so slightly short. To have it happen in hallowed Montreal was even a tougher pill to swallow. To say that there might be old scores to settle in Buffalo is likely an understatement.
As far as Canada is concerned, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is their time and opportunity to return the favor to the United States. Tit for tat in its truest sense. Canada has not won a gold medal since 2015. For the rightful birthplace of hockey, that is far too much time to have elapsed. They want gold and they want it in Buffalo.
Goaltending
Canada is one of the few teams to have named more than three goaltenders to their 32-man preliminary roster. At most, only three of those goalies will make the final cut. Michael DiPietro is the odds on favorite of the four possible choices. And why wouldn't he be? The 18-year-old third round selection of the Vancouver Canucks in 2017 has been incredible throughout his junior career with the OHL's Window Spitfires.
Last year, in 2016-17, DiPietro backstopped Windsor to the Memorial Cup championship, and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Goaltender. At 6-feet and 200 pounds he has near perfect goaltending size. In 51 games last year he had 30 wins, and put up numbers of 2.35 goals against and .917 save percentage. DiPietro may very well be the best of any goaltender in Buffalo.
Carter Hart is one of only seven players from Canada's 2017 junior team that is potentially making a return — it is pretty safe to say that he will. Hart played in four of Canada's seven games last year, including the gold medal loss to the United States. In those four games he was a 2.38 and a .906 in net. The second round selection in the 2016 draft by the Philadelphia Flyers has an incredible 1.32 goals against and a whopping .961 save percentage in 17 games this year with his junior club, the Everett Silvertips of the WHL.
Colton Point and Samuel Harvey are the other two possibilities in net. Harvey has played four straight years with the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. Each year his save percentage has improved. Currently in 2017-18 Harvey has played in 24 QMJHL games and has a record of 16-4-1, to go with a .921. Point has been remarkable for the NCAA's Colgate Red Raiders. A fifth round selection in 2016 by the Dallas Stars, he presently has a 1.90 goals against and .938 save percentage for Colgate. Point is also a big boy too, at 6-foot-4 and close to 220 pounds.
Defense
You will not find many better defenseman (if any) at this tournament than Jake Bean. One of three blueliners returning from 2017, Bean was the 13th overall selection of the 2016 NHL Draft. The Carolina Hurricanes found themselves a heck of a gem. In his four seasons with the Calgary Hitmen, he has been nearly a point per game defender. 173 points in 186 games to be exact. Bean scored 24 goals from the backend during the 2015-16 WHL season.
Cal Foote would be an ideal selection for this team as well. Much like his Cup-winning father (Adam), the younger Foote plays the same robust, tough-as-nails style. He has the size to back it up too at 6-foot-4 and around the 215-pound mark. Foote was a first round selection (14th overall) by the Tampa Bay Lightning over the summer. His finest junior season for the WHL's Kelowna Rockets came last season when he tallied 51 assists in 71 games.
Canada has a true giant on their blueline with Logan Stanley, and he is not a gentle one on the ice. At 6-feet-7-inches and over 230 pounds, Stanley could physically manhandle the opposition in Buffalo. Not a force that you want to awaken. Stanley is presently playing for the Kitchener Rangers after coming over from three seasons with the Windsor Spitfires. He has seven goals and 18 assists in 29 games for the Rangers, in addition to 58 penalty minutes. He had 103 PIMS in 64 games for Windsor in 2015-16.
The other defenders up for consideration are Kale Clague (Kings), Dennis Cholowski (Red Wings), Cale Makar (Avalanche), Josh Mahura (Ducks), Dante Fabbro (Predators), Conor Timmins (Avalanche) and Mario Ferraro (Sharks).
Forwards
Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, and Taylor Raddysh are the three returning forwards from the '17 team. McLeod is a first round draft choice, having been selected 12th overall in 2016 by the New Jersey Devils. Dube and Raddysh also were chosen in 2016 but went in the second round to the Calgary Flames and Tampa Bay Lightning respectively. All three are capable of immense firepower. Raddysh is fresh off of a 109-point season in just 58 games for the Erie Otters in 2016-17. All three will be in Buffalo in 2018. No question.
All of the other possible choices at forward for Canada are just as exciting to put onto this roster. Take Cody Glass for example. Selected sixth overall this summer by the Las Vegas Golden Knights, Glass is just an incredibly intelligent player. He plays both ways, thinks steps ahead and is very difficult to strip the puck off of. He already has 20 goals and 28 assists in just 30 games this year for the WHL's Portland Winterhawks. Vegas could very well have drafted the face of their franchise.
Rink Trained @GlassCody12 named to the @HockeyCanada National World Junior Camp! Congrats Cody! pic.twitter.com/BDRIX7ZsxR — The RINK (@TheRINKWPG) December 6, 2017
Sam Steel is another one of the seemingly endless elite caliber players available to Canada. Steel was taken by the Anaheim Ducks in the first round of the 2016. He has served as an alternate captain for the Regina Pats in 2015-16 and 2016-17, and is presently the team captain this year. Last season, '16-17, he compiled 50 goals and 81 assists in just 66 games.
Any one of the aforementioned players is capable of blossoming into a superstar. They are surrounded by numerous other talents for Canada, including Brett Howden (Lightning), Jordan Kyrou (Blues), Robert Thomas (Blues), Nick Suzuki (Golden Knights), Tanner Kaspick (Blues), Alex Formenton (Senators), Drake Batherson (Senators), Jonathan Ang (Panthers), Maxime Comtois (Ducks), Jonah Gadjovich (Canucks), Boris Katchouk (Lightning), Kole Lind (Canucks), and Tyler Steenbergen (Coyotes). The entire selection of Canada's forwards have been drafted by NHL teams.
The Bottom Line
If they want it badly enough, the gold medal in Buffalo will belong to Canada. They are the most talent-laden team of any nation in the tournament.Team Canada has every aspect of the game covered. Size, firepower, two-way play, hockey smarts, crisp passing. The list could go on, but there is no need — Canada on paper is extremely dominant. But now they need to assemble all of those attributes with the glue of drive and a will to win.
You also need cohesion. While nearly every player on the preliminary roster could be considered a star, the question becomes, “Well, how well do these stars play together?” That remains to be seen. Team Canada coaches and management will need to find the appropriate recipe. If they are able to do so then Canada will be able to claim victory.
Here is THW's prediction as to who makes the final 23-man roster for Canada:
Goaltenders: Michael DiPietro, Colton Point, Carter Hart.
Defense: Cal Foote, Jake Bean, Logan Stanley, Kale Clague, Dante Fabbro, Cale Makar, Dennis Cholowski.
Forwards: Sam Steel, Dillon Dube, Michael McLeod, Cody Glass, Taylor Raddysh, Brett Howden, Robert Thomas, Nick Suzuki, Maxime Comtois, Jonah Gadjovich, Boris Katchouk, Kole Lind, Tyler Steenbergen.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has one wish for the Constitution — that the document guarantee gender equality.
“I take out my pocket constitution and say ‘I have three granddaughters,'” she told a Washington audience of 1,400 people on Feb. 1. “I point to the First Amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech, press, religion. I would like them to see in the Constitution a statement that men and women are persons of equal citizenship stature.”
In a 1 hour and 20-minute conversation with Forward Editor-in-Chief Jane Eisner at Adas Israel Congregation, the 84-year-old Ginsberg was witty and professorial as she talked about women's rights, other justices, Jewish and not, and her own future plans.
Ginsburg said that although explicit gender discrimination had largely faded by the 1970s, when the Equal Rights Amendment was passed by the Senate, it still occurred in more discreet ways.
“There was a tendency to tune out when a woman was speaking, because she couldn't have been saying anything worthwhile,” she said.
Last month, Ginsburg expressed support for the #MeToo movement and revealed that while a student at Cornell University she was propositioned by a chemistry professor who gave her an advance copy of an exam.
“I knew exactly what he wanted in return,” she told NPR's Nina Totenberg.
When Eisner asked Ginsburg if she had experienced sexism since then, she said, “Not that kind of sexism,” but discrimination it is still an issue.
Eisner told Ginsburg that, according to the Harvard Business Review, the Supreme Court's female justices are interrupted by their male colleagues three times more than the men interrupt each other. She said that sounded accurate, and recalled an oral argument during which she interrupted Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, leading to a media frenzy.
“The next day in USA Today the headline, was ‘Rude Ruth Interrupts Sandra,'” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg said she apologized to O'Connor, who said, “Don't worry, the guys do it all the time.”
Ginsburg said the reporter attended oral arguments the next day and said, “You know, [O'Connor's] right, but I never noticed it when the men interrupt all the time.”
Ginsburg joked that the real reason she interrupted O'Connor is because her colleague is a slow-talking “laid back gal from the West” and she is a “fast-talking Jewish girl from New York.”
The justice told Eisner that more than once the Court has adjusted for its Jewish justices. There had been no Jewish justice since the 1960s when Ginsburg was appointed. She discovered that the dates on the certificates admitting attorneys and jurists to the Supreme Court bar read “In the year of our Lord.”
“And he's not our Lord,” Ginsburg said, referring to Jesus.
A fellow justice pointed out that former Jewish justices Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, Felix Frankfurter and Arthur Goldberg never objected to the reference to Christ.
“It was not good enough for Ginsburg,” she said.
A year later, Stephen Breyer became the court's second Jewish justice. She said the two teamed up to ask Chief Justice William Rehnquist to reschedule a case that fell during the High Holidays so that they could celebrate them. Rehnquist obliged.
“The argument that was utterly convincing for the chief was that in an argument, there will inevitably be Jewish lawyers,” she said. “Do you want to take away from them the opportunity to present their case? And that resonated. So now we don't sit on the High Holy Days.”
Asked how her Judaism has informed her career, the justice drew on the themes of the Jewish diaspora as she discussed how her parents had immigrated to the United States from Europe.
“The sense of being an outsider, of being one of the people had suffered oppression for no sensible reason… it's the sense of being part of a minority,” she said. “It makes you more empathetic to other people who are outsiders.”
“She really expressed how she interprets the constitution and what it means to be human,” said Patricia Hunt, who teaches an introductory law course at Wakefield High School in Arlington.
Falls Church resident Roz Cohen said Ginsburg was “just as wonderful” as she anticipated, and appreciated her comments on gender discrimination.
“In these times, you think you've won all these battles, but the same old issues come around again, so I was glad that she pointed that out,” she said.
Although Ginsburg said she would not discuss any cases before the court, she was willing to weigh in on whether Supreme Court justices should have fixed terms rather than the current life term.
“It is a subject on which I am biased and prejudiced,” she said, eliciting applause from the friendly crowd when said she has no plans to retire from the court.
“As long as I can do the job, I'll be here.”

Playbook: “Washington has always been a place for people with sharp elbows. The old saying ‘Politics ain't beanbag‘ is apt and accurate. The difference: it was done behind closed doors. Trump insiders seem to revel in the credit they get for knifing whoever is on the outs with Trump. Crowing about shoving people under the bus seems more prevalent than ever.”
“There have been a lot of pieces about how the Trump administration and the various players who have come to Washington have impacted D.C. Cache now comes from hanging out at the Trump Hotel and the stock of pubs like Breitbart has soared as the White House looks to leak info to sympathetic reporters. But the most stunning example of a pervasive culture shift in the past several weeks has been the overt campaign by conservative operatives and factions in the West Wing to take out National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Lots of people have told us unflattering and sordid details of people's lives that may, or may not be true. But the steady drumbeat of personal attacks against aides in this White House is stunning.”

Mercedes-Benz already has the CLA, but the automaker sees room for a second, more practical sedan in its compact car family.
This new sedan is being previewed on Wednesday at the 2017 Shanghai auto show by the A Sedan concept which also heralds the new look for Mercedes' next-generation compacts.
The new look is clearly an evolution of Mercedes' current design language known as Sensual Purity, and is contrasted by more defined proportions and smoother surfacing.
“Our concept A Sedan shows that the time of creases is over,” Mercedes design boss Gorden Wagener said in a statement. “With its perfect proportions and a sensual treatment of surfaces with reduced lines, it is the next milestone of Sensual Purity and has the potential to introduce a new design era.”
At 179.9 inches in length, the concept is similar in size to the CLA but should be roomier due to a longer, flatter roof and what appears to be a more cab-forward design. The concept also has taller windows, a more vertical C-pillar and shorter overhangs front and rear compared to the CLA.

The 20-inch wheels, A-wing splitter and “Panamericana” grille are all elements we can expect on the future compact lineup from Mercedes-AMG. Don't hold your breath for the ultra-low stance, flush door handles and grid structure of the headlights showing up on any production model, though. The grid structure was implemented to provide a contrast with the smooth body. It also features a special coating that enables it to give off a different glow whether it's the daytime running lights shining on it or the main headlight projector.
Mercedes' current range of compacts based on the MFA front-wheel-drive platform have proven extremely popular, with more than two million of them sold since the first member, the current A-Class hatch, was introduced in 2012. The success has prompted Mercedes to add even more models for its next-generation compact car family based on an updated MFA2 platform.
One of these new models will be a production version of the A Sedan concept, likely to be called an A-Class. Others will include a rugged, G-Class-inspired SUV and possibly a convertible. These will be in addition to replacements for the A-Class hatch, B-Class minivan, CLA coupe-like sedan, CLA Shooting Brake wagon, and GLA urban SUV.
The first member of Mercedes' next-generation compact family will be an A-Class hatch, prototypes for which have been spied. It's due for a reveal later this year. It's not clear when the A-Class sedan will arrive and whether Mercedes will even sell it in the United States.

Haseena Sunilkumar Prannoy heralded his return to the international badminton circuit in great style, with an emphatic 21-13, 21-18 triumph on Wednesday over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, sidelining the bustling Indonesian in front of the latter's home crowds at the Jakarta Convention Centre and making the pre-quarter-final round of the $1 million prize money Indonesia Open Super Series Premier tournament.
The bearded 24-year-old India – ranked 29th on the Badminton World Federation (BWF) ladder – was playing his first premier tournament after a prolonged injury lay-off, and was full value for his success against a player three years younger and ranked nine places above him.
The short-statured Ginting had been the toast of his nation as recently as last month, with an impressive three-game victory over world No 2, Viktor Axelsen, that had enabled Indonesia to beat Denmark 3-2 in their Sudirman Cup mixed team group encounter. But Prannoy remained in control of the lion's share of the rallies and was able to play the speedy Ginting swiftly. His exquisite control over the length of his tosses and clears was a big factor in his win.
Prannoy was joined in the second round by his Gopichand Academy sparring partner, Kidambi Srikanth, who displayed distinctly improved stamina and poise, in comparison with his showing in earlier competitions this year, while overcoming Hong Kong's Wong Wing Ki Vincent 21-15, 17-21, 21-16.
Srikanth, ranked 14th in the world, shrugged off not just the long-term after-effects of an ankle injury, but also his inferior head-to-head record against the 11th-ranked Vincent. The two had met on three occasions earlier; and the Hong Kong shuttler held a 2-1 lead, including a win in their most recent clash at the 2016 Korea Open last September, shortly after the Rio Olympics.
The Indian ace next takes on Denmark's fourth-seeded Jan O Jorgensen, who won handily on Wednesday at 21-16, 21-18 against Frenchman Brice Leverdez. Srikanth and Jorgensen have met twice earlier, and the score stands at 1-1, with the Indian winning their encounter at the 2013 India Open, while the Dane levelled career meeting scores with triumph at the 2014 year-ending Dubai Super Series Finals. The two have not bumped into each other over the past 30 months.
The third Indian in the men's singles mix, Bhamidipati Sai Praneeth, was unable to emulate the sterling example of his compatriots, of conquering players ranked higher than them in the BWF pecking order. Praneeth found his 11-match winning streak over two tournaments snapped, as he went down to the freshly installed world No 1 Son Wan Ho, by a 14-21, 18-21 margin in a 40-minute clash that the second-seeded Korean had under control for the most part.
Also, a little short of luck was the Indian women's doubles pairing of Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy, who could have won their lung-opener in straight games, but faded badly in the third stanza, to bow to the none-too-strong Indonesian combination of Dian Fitriani and Nadya Melati at 21-19, 19-21, 13-21, in two minutes over the hour.
The 24-year-old Fitriani is ranked a lowly 58th in the world in the company of the 30-year-old Melati, whereas Ashwini and Sikki Reddy's 28th ranking had made them firm favourites to win their first round match in a tournament that has been witness to upsets galore even before the half-way stage.
Indeed, Wednesday was a disastrous day for top seeds, with two of them in the paired events biting the dust, and one coming within three points of elimination. Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei, who straddles the men's singles seedings in this tournament, was hard-pressed to defend that exalted ranking by former world championship bronze medallist, Tommy Sugiarto of the host nation. The two were locked at 18-all in the third game of their desperately close encounter, as the clock ticked over the one-hour mark.
However, the 34-year-old Chong Wei, who has slipped to the third spot behind Son Wan Ho and Viktor Axelsen in the latest BWF rankings, pulled out all stops and finally stormed through the inspired Indonesian's doughty defence that had stood him in such good stead throughout the joust. The three-time Olympic silver medallist won 13-21, 21-10, 21-18, to record his 15th successive win against Sugiarto without reply. The Malaysian runs into India's Prannoy in his next outing on Thursday.
The No 1 seeds in both the men's and women's doubles were not lucky enough to escape the carnage as Chong Wei had, and bit the dust in the first two morning matches of the day's lengthy programme.
Playing side by side on two of the three courts employed for the opening round matches in the main draw, the crack Indonesian pairing of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, and the equally illustrious Japanese combination of Ayaka Takahashi and Misaki Matsutomo bit the dust with nary a whimper.
It was clear that the top-ranked Indonesians suffered from a serious bout of stage fright as they took on unseeded Danes, Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen, and capitulated within 34 minutes by a 16-21, 16-21 scoreline. It was the tamest performance conceivable, with the title favourites being at sixes and sevens throughout, and hardly indulging in the wily fast drops and unexpected, adventurous forays to the net that they are known, and feared, for.
Just ten minutes later, the much decorated, top-seeded Japanese pair of Takahashi and Matsutomo exited the women's doubles, having been shown the door by a 21-7, 22-20 margin by the newly formed Chinese pairing of Huang Yaqiong and Yu Xiaohan, who were playing together for the first time in a premier tournament.
The 23-year-old Yaqiong is ranked second in the world in the mixed doubles, but only holds a No 22 rank in the women's paired event, while her partner is ranked slightly higher at No 16. Yaqiong normally plays with Tang Jinhua, but appears to have been tried out with Xiaohan by the Chinese badminton bosses – with spectacular results.
The Chinese youngsters were all over the renowned Japanese pair, who appeared gobsmacked and played the 44-minute match as if they were enveloped in an impenetrable fog – to be treated with near-contempt by their rivals in the first game, and with only marginally more respect in the second.
The shocks did not end there. Two other serious men's singles title contenders joined a motley crowd of acknowledged champions on the sidelines – the third and seventh seeds, Viktor Axelsen of Denmark and China's five-time world champion and two-time Olympic gold medal winner, Lin Dan, respectively.
Axelsen, installed recently as the world No 2, fought gamely for nearly an hour with fellow-Dane Emil Holst before being forced to concede defeat at 12-21, 21-12, 17-21, while the legendary Super Dan looked a pale shadow of his formidable self, as he bowed out to Chinese Taipei's Tzu Wei Wang – ranked 23rd on the BWF ladder – by a 16-21, 18-21 scoreline in just 42 minutes, in what must be considered a most insipid performance.
On Thursday afternoon, the Indians left in the fray in the singles events will present their credentials for claiming quarter-final berths. Prannoy will clash with top-ranked Lee Chong Wei, while Srikanth takes on Jorgensen. Saina Nehwal will cross swords with Thailand's Nitchaon Jindapol, while PV Sindhu will play an evening match against Chinese-American Zhang Beiwen. The Indian doubles teams will no doubt watch from the sidelines, and cheer on their compatriots in the arena.
Sitara Wafadar yearns for long hair like other girls. Instead, the Afghan teenager has disguised herself as a boy for more than a decade, forced by her parents to be the "son" they never had.
With five sisters and no brothers, Sitara lives by the gender-twisting custom known as "bacha poshi," which in Dari refers to a girl "dressed as a boy," enabling her to safely perform the duties of a son in the patriarchal country.
The 18-year-old, who resides with her impoverished family in a mud-brick house in a village in Afghanistan's eastern province of Nangarhar, has pretended to be a boy for most of her life.
Every morning she puts on the baggy shirt and trousers and flip flops typically worn by Afghan males. Sometimes she covers her short brown hair with a scarf and deepens her voice to conceal her real gender.
"I never think that I am a girl," Sitara tells the Agence France- Presse (AFP) news agency at the brick factory where she and her elderly father work six days a week as bonded laborers to repay money they borrowed from the owner and feed the family.
"My father always says 'Sitara is like my eldest son.' Sometimes... I attend funerals as his eldest son" - something she would never be allowed to do as a girl.
Bacha poshi has a long history in Afghanistan, where boys are valued more highly than girls and women are often confined to the home.
Normally it is families with no male heirs who make a daughter dress as a boy so she can carry out the duties of a son without getting harassed, or worse.
But some girls choose to pose as boys so they can enjoy the freedom their male counterparts take for granted in a country that treats women as second-class citizens.
While most bacha posh, as they are known, stop dressing as a boy after reaching puberty, Sitara says she keeps wearing male clothing "to protect myself" at the brick kiln.
"When I go to work most people do not realize that I am a girl," Sitara says.
No choice
Sitara started working at the factory when she was eight, following in the footsteps of her four older sisters, who also made bricks instead of going to school - until they married, after which they stayed home.
She makes 500 bricks a day in return for 160 Afghanis (just over $2).
From 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. she crouches on the ground preparing mud and clay and then pushing it into brick molds under the hot sun that has turned her skin brown.
"I don't feel ashamed about what I am doing but people my age tell me 'you have reached puberty and now you don't have to work at a brick factory,'" Sitara says.
"But what should I do? I don't have any other choice."
Sitara's father, Noor, says "almighty Allah" did not give him a son, leaving him with no choice but to force his daughter to dress as a boy and work.
The family says they owe 25,000 Afghanis to the factory owner and relatives that they borrowed to cover the medical expenses of Sitara's diabetic mother.
"If I had a son I would not have faced all these problems and my daughter's life would be peaceful and prosperous," Noor tells AFP.
"All the responsibility is on my and Sitara's shoulders - we have to provide for the family and pay back the loans."
'I wish I had a brother'
Sitara's mother, Fatima, wishes Sitara could wear female clothes and stay at home, but she needs her to "bring groceries, take me to the doctor and do other work because my husband is old."
While Sitara recognizes that her situation is "unfair and unjust," she is resigned to it, mainly because her younger sister, who is 13, would "face the same fate as me" if she stopped.
"I will do the hard work because I don't want my younger sister dressing as a boy and working at the factory," Sitara says.
"When I put on boy's clothes I wish I had a brother, then my dreams would have been fulfilled," she says.
Dining hall workers and students celebrate the winning vote for the unionization of dining hall workers at Chase Center on Apr. 24. Christine Lee / The Tufts Daily
Tufts Dining Services employees voted decisively to unionize with UNITE HERE Local 26 on Tuesday. The vote tally for the election, organized by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), was 127 in favor of unionization and 19 against, with 1 void ballot and 11 challenges, surpassing the simple majority required to secure a union victory. About 89.8 percent of 176 eligible voters cast ballots, according to NLRB Field Attorney Miriam Hasbún.
The results of the election still need to be certified, according to Hasbún. If the results are certified, Tufts will be required to recognize UNITE HERE as full- and part-time dining workers' exclusive collective bargaining agent. The vote did not include supervisors, managerial staff or current Tufts students, according to the NLRB's election notice.
More than 75 percent of dining staff previously signed a union petition that was filed with the NLRB's Boston office on April 3, exceeding the 30-percent minimum needed to guarantee an election.
UNITE HERE Local 26 represents thousands of hospitality workers in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including the Harvard University dining staff who earned a new contract after striking for more than three weeks in fall 2016, according to the union's website.
Dozens of Tufts dining workers and students gathered inside Carmichael Hall, the polling location, on Tuesday afternoon to watch the vote-counting. Less than 45 minutes after polling closed at 4:30, Hasbún announced the results followed by cheers from the audience.
This week's vote comes almost a year after graduate students in Tufts' School of Arts and Sciences (A&S) chose to unionize, and more than three years after A&S part-time faculty formed a union.
Last month, the Limestone District School Board felt a tremendous loss after Trustee David Jackson's sudden passing left an empty seat on the board. After the unfortunate news, the board decided not to fill his role until November.
According to the Education Act, after a trustee passes, a board has two options. Either they can hold a byelection or appoint a qualified person for the role. Due to time constraints, a byelection isn't possible so the board decided to appoint a qualified person. Some parents and chairs of schools showed interest in the role. But they say they were not considered.
Christine Innocente is a school council co-chair at École Sir John A. Macdonald Public School and says, “There were several parents that were interested in filling the void temporarily — myself and at least a half a dozen other people, and I think any one of them [was] worth considering.”
Some community members attended the last board meeting in mid-May where recommendations for the role were being reviewed. They told CKWS News that the trustees decided to go into a private session and asked them to step out for that portion of the meeting.

They were told that a report would be released to summarize the discussion which continued at their next meeting this past Tuesday.
“There was no risen report, which was certainly expected so again, something happened in the private session before the public session tonight that precluded that. We are not aware of what that is and now we have discovered that they've replaced the vacancy with a former trustee,” says Innocente.
The board of trustees appointed former trustee Helen Chadwick to fill the vacancy.
Debrah Rantz, director of education with the Limestone District School Board, says “given the timeframe that needs a replacement trustee, really essentially September, October and November, they wanted to [go] with a former trustee, who was democratically elected by her constituents who could sort of hit the ground running.”
While Innocente says, “The fact that they chose not to engage the public at all, and not even to report back to the public, except to just name someone, it doesn't smack of openness and transparency.”

“There were a number of legal documents shared with the trustees, legal opinions on how best to pursue the filling of this vacancy, and when there are legal matters to discuss as I mentioned as well, names of individuals, so it is not appropriate for names to be discussed in public,” says Rantz.
Chadwick will be sworn in at their next board meeting in June and will serve until November, after which a new board will be elected at the next municipal election at the end of October this year.
Kendrick Lamar's victory lap continues. The rapper closed the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Sunday night — like most Coachella performers, he'll return at the same time next weekend — with a set that blew through social media thanks to live-streaming and widespread interest in his new material. Lamar's intensely anticipated new album, DAMN., came out Friday (stream it here), and live debuts of its songs highlighted and bookended his sprawling, career-spanning, 19-song set list.
As they are with DAMN. itself, fans are still digesting Sunday's performance, pieces of which are scattered across the Internet via YouTube footage. Given the setting, high-profile guests (including ScHoolboy Q, Future and Travis Scott) were a given, but fans were also treated to high-wire acrobatics and an appearance by the "Kung Fu Kenny" alter ego who pops up throughout DAMN. Reviews of his set have been effusive, while footage of Lana Del Rey enjoying the set went momentarily viral overnight.
In other first-weekend news, Lorde premiered a new song called "Homemade Dynamite" and briefly covered Kanye West's "Runaway." Someone (definitely not Lorde) was arrested for allegedly stealing more than 100 cell phones. Drake accused a country club of racial profiling on Instagram before deleting the post.
So what will next weekend's Coachella bring, besides most of the same performers and hopefully not quite so much pick-pocketing? Stay tuned.
He's the movie mogul behind some of Hollywood's biggest block busters, an industry legend for so many A-list stars, Harvey Weinstein.
This morning the New York Times is reporting bombshell allegations against him, describing several accusations of sexual harassment against Harvey.
According to two anonymous company officials, Weinstein reached at least eight settlements with accusers over the last three decades.
The alleged victims, according to The Times, are all in varying positions, from an assistant to a model, to a movie star named Ashley Judd.
She tells The Times that in 1997 while filming, Kiss the Girls, Weinstein invited her to a breakfast meeting at The Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills.
Judd says he requested that she come to his room where he answered the door in his bathrobe and asked her if she would like a massage, or if she could watch him shower.
Judd says she said no a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at her with some new ask.
She recalled feeling, “panicked and trapped.”
Weinstein spoke to the New York Post and told them he bears responsibility for his past behavior, but claims The Times' article is “reckless reporting” and he is now suing for defamation asking for 50 million dollars.
Weinstein says, “I came of age in the 60's and 70's when all the rules about behavior in work places were different, that was the culture then.”
He says he is taking a leave of absence to “conquer his demons.”
Weinstein says he wants to earn the forgiveness of Judd and his family, which consists of five children and his wife Georgina.
He says his wife will be with him along with others kicking his ass to be a better human being and to apologize to people for his bad behavior.
He really wants to say “I'm sorry” and to absolutely mean it.
Weinstein also settled a suit with actress Rose McGowan back in 1997 paying her $100,000 for another alleged episode in a hotel room.

RIYADH - Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected French President Emmanuel Macron's comment that Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri had been held against his will in the kingdom in November. Hariri announced on November 4 that he was stepping down in a televised address from Riyadh, only to rescind it the following month after Macron's intervention.
New Delhi/Lucknow: An internal government probe has found that a Lucknow passport officer and the police exceeded their brief, asking irrelevant questions from an interfaith couple whose travel documents have now been approved, officials said.
"The passports of Tanvi Seth and Anas Siddiqui have been cleared,” Regional Passport Officer (RPO) Piyush Verma told PTI in Lucknow Wednesday. The probe found that department official Vikas Mishra was wrong in asking the couple questions about their religion when they visited his office with their passport applications, sources said on Wednesday.
They said the police in Uttar Pradesh police were also wrong in seeking details about their residence while conducting the verification process required for issuing a passport.
The couple had alleged harassment by a passport official, saying they were targeted because of their interfaith marriage.
RPO Piyush Verma said there was no adverse report from the police after the verification of the couple under the Ministry of External Affairs guidelines.
He said under the new MEA rules which came into force in June, the police report only on six points related to criminal antecedents and citizenship.
In an attempt to ease the police verification process, the MEA had reduced the number of questions applicants have to answer from nine to six, restricting the focus on any criminal antecedents, he said.
The controversy arose on 20 June when Tanvi Seth and Mohammad Anas Siddiqui, who have been married for 12 years, wrote on Twitter that they were humiliated at the passport office in Lucknow.
They had alleged that official Vikas Mishra asked Siddiqui to convert to Hinduism and pulled up Seth for marrying a Muslim.
On 21 June, the RPO transferred Mishra to Gorakhpur and issued passports to the couple. The couple had tagged External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and following the official's transfer, the minister was trolled on Twitter. The local police sent their report to the RPO office on 26 June, saying Tanvi Seth had been living in Noida, and not Lucknow as mentioned in her application, for the past one year.
Celebrity chef Mario Batali is stepping away from the TV show “The Chew” and the day-to-day operations of his businesses after a report detailed sexual misconduct allegations from multiple women spanning at least two decades.
Batali did not deny the allegations against him, saying in a statement Monday that “although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.”
“That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses,” he said. “I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.”
In an investigation published Monday by food website Eater, four women — three of whom had worked for Batali in some capacity — said he touched them inappropriately.
According to the Eater piece, a woman who worked for Batali in the late 1990s told Eater he came up behind her in the dining room "put his hand on half of my butt and he squeezed it. Another former Batali employee said he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tight against his body. Another former worker said he groped her. One woman who never worked for Batali said the chef rubbed her breasts at a party about 10 years ago after someone spilled wine down her shirt.
Eater did not publish their names.
Batali gained mainstream recognition with the 1997 debut of his TV show “Molto Mario” on Food Network. Five years later, the chef was recognized by the prestigious James Beard Foundation as the best chef in New York City.
Batali — who has a strong presence in the Los Angeles food scene, including his Mozza restaurants and the Eataly marketplace that opened at the Westfield Century City mall last month — also has co-hosted the ABC daytime talk show “The Chew” since it launched in 2011.
Backlash against Batali has been swift.
On Monday morning, B&B Hospitality Group, which provides back-office and operational services to 24 restaurants owned by Batali and others, said it took the allegations “very seriously.”
“Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company's operations, including the restaurants, and he has already done so,” the company said in a statement.
B&B Hospitality Group said it has had systematic policies and training about sexual harassment for more than 10 years, and that all members of management, including Batali, have participated in that training.
The company said employees who want to make claims about corporate officers “or owners specifically” can now contact an outside corporate investigations firm, who “has discretion to independently investigate complaints and report to outside counsel.”
Food Network said in a statement Monday that it is putting relaunch plans for “Molto Mario” on hold.
An ABC spokesperson said the network has asked Batali to step away from “The Chew” while it reviewed the allegations against him.
“ABC takes matters like this very seriously,” the statement said. “While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”

New Delhi: KKR-backed Radiant Life Care on Tuesday made a revised bid for Fortis Healthcare Ltd (FHL) with a binding offer to acquire its Mulund hospital for an enterprise value of Rs 1,200 crore. This is the second revised offer received by Fortis after Malaysian major IHH Healthcare made a binding offer to infuse Rs 650 crore immediately in the Indian firm as part of an overall proposal to invest Rs 4,000 crore.
The company has received a binding offer from Radiant Life Care, FHL said in a regulatory filing.
"In order to provide immediate liquidity to FHL, we would like to make a binding offer to purchase Fortis Mulund hospital without due diligence and as a going concern at an enterprise value of Rs 1,200 crore as the first step," Radiant said in its revised offer to FHL.
The transaction would provide an immediate liquidity of Rs 680 crore to FHL, Radiant said. Radiant had earlier offered to acquire at least 26 percent stake in FHL at Rs 126 per share, excluding its diagnostic business SRL.
Radiant in its new deal said it has proposed spinning off or excluding SRL so that FHL can run an independent competitive sale process to maximise returns. "If the valuation achieved for 100 percent equity value of SRL is Rs 4,000 crore or Rs 43.20 per share of FHL, the implied per-share value of FHL ascribed by our offer would be Rs 170," according to the new offer.
In case the SRL valuation is Rs 4,500 crore, the implied value per share would be Rs 175 apiece. It also proposed a demerger of hospitals business of FHL into a new company, excluding FHL's stake in SRL.
It will launch an all-cash open offer for the shareholders of the new hospital company at Rs 126 apiece subject to conditions. Radiant's offer comes after Malaysia's IHH Healthcare Berhad on Tuesday made a binding offer to immediately infuse Rs 650 crore in the Indian firm as part of an overall proposal to invest Rs 4,000 crore.
The revised offers have come two days ahead of a meeting of Fortis Healthcare Ltd (FHL) board to consider recommendation by an expert advisory panel formed to finalise evaluation process of only binding offers.
Manipal-TPG combine and Munjals and Burmans were the only two groups that had made binding offers out of total of five suitors in race.
Chinese firm Fosun Health Holdings and KKR-backed Radiant Life Care had also made non-binding expression of interests in FHL.

Jerry West, one of the NBA's most distinguished executives ever, who once presided over making the Lakers a sports powerhouse, is finalizing a deal to join the Clippers as a consultant, said several league officials who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
West spent the last six seasons as an executive board member with the NBA champion Golden State Warriors. He would serve in the same advisor role with the Clippers, according to the officials.
One official said West, 79, took the Clippers job because he wants another “challenge” after helping the Warriors acquire Kevin Durant last summer and then watching Golden State defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals Monday night.
An official announcement is not expected until next week, one executive said, possibly as early as Monday.
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Frazzled by rising U.S. Treasury yields, emerging stocks were on track for the first weekly loss since early December on Friday while currencies wobbled despite a frail dollar with South Africa's rand weakening 1 percent on political woes.
Losses in Asia weighed heavy on the benchmark, with South Korea seeing its stocks tumble 1.7 percent. MSCI's emerging market index fell 0.8 percent on the day and looked to end the week nearly 3 percent lower.
Equity markets around the globe have come under pressure in recent days after yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries climbed steadily, trading at near four-year peaks, on flaring inflation expectations.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified index - indicating the average premium investors demanded to hold emerging market sovereign hard-currency debt over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries - had steadily narrowed over the week.
The index lost 4 basis points from a week ago, standing at 259 bps - its lowest level since summer 2014.
“You have got a bit of hope that the rise in U.S. yields is just a function of higher global inflation expectations, and if it is that, it's associated with stronger growth,” said Koon Chow, strategist at UBP.
“If that is the situation, then it's mainly a problem of U.S. Treasury yields rather than any other markets.”
Yet in a sign that more pressure could be ahead, Bank of America Merrill-Lynch's indicator of market sentiment hit a “sell” signal pointing to a downturn for risk assets.
Rising U.S. yields have failed to prop up the dollar index which hovered around a three-year trough. Emerging currencies struggled to make any gains as investors were awaiting key U.S. job's data due later in the day.
South Africa's rand chalked up the biggest losses on the day, slipping more than 1 percent.
Markets were cautious ahead of President Jacob Zuma meeting the top six officials of the ruling party over his future this weekend, adding to speculation he could be removed as head of state, although parliament said he would deliver the State of the Nation Address on Feb 8.
Turkey's lira nearly matched the losses, with investors once again wary over pressure on the central bank. On Thursday, President Tayyip Erdoğan met Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya and officials from state banks to discuss steps to reduce interest rates and encourage investment.
Russia's rouble and Mexico's peso also weakened, though all were on track for weekly gains.
China's yuan proved the exception, ending the domestic session at a new 2-1/2-year high against the dollar on Friday, and is set for the eighth straight weekly gain.

A new device passing certification from TENAA with the model number TA-1054 could possibly be the 2018 edition of the Nokia 6. This new report debunks the previous theory of this device being the Nokia 9.
However, at this moment, TENAA hasn't mentioned about any hardware specs and neither are there any leaked images of the device.
According to Nokiapoweruser report, what we do know is that this will be a dual-SIM version of the original Nokia 6 and it will also have the design language quite similar to that of the Nokia 7. This would mean that the capacitive touch button would be removed in favour of the on-screen navigation buttons.
Earlier leaks, according to GSMArena, have suggested that the phone is expected to have a 5.5-inch 18:9 touchscreen, the Snapdragon 630 SoC at the helm, 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, and a possible dual rear camera setup. It could also feature the Bothie camera which was first introduced in the Nokia 8.
In more news concerning Nokia, it is believed that HMD Global is planning to unveil the Nokia 9 alongside the second generation of Nokia 8 on 19 January in China.
Even though the price of the Nokia 8 has not been revealed as of yet, the alleged Nokia 9 has been given a rumoured price tag of CNY 3,699 for the 64 GB and CNY 4,199 for the 128 GB variant.
Don't toss that yogurt cup even if it's a few days past its best-before date, says a national study on reducing Canada's colossal food waste.
The National Zero Waste Council says confusing and unnecessary best-by labels are a major cause of food waste in Canada.
“(People) don't know what they mean,” said Denise Philippe, who helped write the report.

“When they see ‘best before' they think it means if they eat it afterwards, there's going to be a health problem. That's not true.”
Research suggests Canadians are among the biggest food-wasters in the world. A recent study found every Canadian lost or wasted almost 400 kilograms of food a year. A lot of that waste – 47 per cent – happens at home.
The council has been considering how to reduce that waste since 2016. Its work has included 900 submissions from industry groups, governments, organizations and individuals.
Best-before labels emerged as major villains. People assume food past the date on a package is spoiled, Philippe said.
WATCH: Tips for cutting down on food waste
With the exception of products such as eggs, best-before dates refer to food quality, not safety. Many products that carry the dates don't even need them, she said.
“That chip might be slightly crispier if you eat it before that date and slightly less crispy if you eat it after. You would be amazed at how long that yogurt lasts.”
Presentation and language are also ambiguous.
WATCH: How you can reduce food waste at home
“Consumers have no idea of what it is they're looking at,” Philippe said. “(A product) might say ‘best before 1/3' and it's not clear whether that's January 3rd or March 1st.
“We don't have clarity around the text that's being used, the format of the date, the product that it's stamped on, nor the meaning of the word.”
That means good food ends up in the kitchen garbage bin and the grocery dumpster.
“Perfectly good pallets of hummus are pulled just before their best-before date.”
Canada needs to standardize dates and terms, Philippe suggested. That's already taking place in Europe and the United States, where labels are beginning to say “use by,” “freeze by,” or “tastes best by” to address safety and quality.
The report makes other recommendations.
It says governments should harmonize rules on food donations and food waste in landfills. Processors and retailers, where another 30 per cent of waste takes place, need better inventory control, it adds.
Packaging smaller servings for smaller households would help. So would avoid consumption-based marketing such as two-for-one sales.

Retailers can market visually imperfect food at a discount. Unused food can be turned into other items. A British company, for example, brews beer from stale bread.
Business is behind the effort, said Cher Mereweather of Provisions Canada, an association of industry groups that participated in the council's study.
“If we're wasting product, then that drives down our profitability. There's also the environmental impacts. Then on the social side, if we have more food available to feed the growing population, that's a good thing,” she said.
Mereweather echoed the call for consistent government rules and standard labels.
“What we're looking at is the need for clear language … so the consumer knows ‘expires by' means no longer safe and ‘use by' means it's a quality standard.”
The federal government has promised to cut food waste in half by 2030 and is writing a national food policy that will also tackle waste.
Philippe said her group will soon begin a national campaign to get people thinking about how to waste less of what they eat. But she knows change will take time.
“This issue is huge. It's global. It affects huge supply chains.”
It affects everyone, said Mereweather.
“It's not easy. We need a shift in our mindset.”

Los Angeles police say the students hurt in the middle school shooting suffered their injuries after a single gunshot was fired from inside a 12-year-old girl's backpack in a middle school classroom.
Police spokesman Josh Rubenstein said Friday that investigators believe the bullet struck a 15-year-old girl in the wrist and then hit another classmate in the head.
Doctors say the bullet that struck the boy in the head didn't hit anything vital and his injuries are not life-threatening.
Two other children and a staff member were hit by broken glass.
Police have said they believe the shooting was an accident. Rubenstein said the semi-automatic handgun wasn't registered. Detectives don't know where the girl got the gun.
The girl was booked into Juvenile Hall on Thursday night on suspicion of negligently discharging a firearm on school grounds.
Police said she's retained an attorney and was not answering questions.

Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan says Germany's largest financial institution is making progress in its effort to cut costs and streamline operations - despite posting a third straight annual loss.
Cryan said Friday that many important steps would take time to improve profits. He cited slashing the number of overlapping computer systems, ditching businesses in less-profitable countries, and installing a low-cost culture.
Earlier, Deutsche Bank posted a 2017 loss of 497 million euros ($627 million). That would have been a profit of 900 million euros had the bank not have to adjust deferred tax assets due to recent U.S. corporate tax changes.
The results sent the bank's shares sharply lower. They traded down 5.6 percent on the day at 13.93 euros in midday trading in Europe.
Cryan said it's "always been clear that it would take more than two or three years" to achieve the bank's full potential but "good progress" was being made.
The bank said the new tax regime would be positive for its earnings in the future. The results showed the bank, a pillar of Germany's economy, still struggling to turn solid profits after years of wrenching restructuring and legal trouble.
Earnings have been eroded by a low interest rate environment that has squeezed interest margins - by charges for past misconduct, including a $7.2 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over complex securities based on house mortgages, and by new regulatory and compliance burdens aimed at stabilizing the banking system after the global financial crisis.
Deutsche Bank has also taken write-downs and losses on businesses and investments that it decided to shed as it refocused its business and reduced risky holdings. The bank has slashed its workforce and withdrawn from doing business in some countries.
Earnings last year were helped by dwindling expenses for litigation resulting from past misconduct and by lower asset impairments.
The bank's fourth-quarter loss of 2.2 billion euros reflected the tax charge - but also weakness in key businesses such as bond and currency trading, where income fell 29 percent.
Unusually low market volatility during the fourth quarter led to lower client activity and thus less revenue for the bank. Equity sales and trading also fell, by 25 percent year on year.
Cryan said that the current zero-interest rate environment - the result of the European Central Bank's stimulus efforts - was hurting earnings. He said if the ECB raised its benchmark by just one percentage point, then the bank would gain 1.4 billion euros in the first year and 1.6 billion in the second without any additional expense. The ECB's main interest rate is currently zero.
ECB officials have pointed out that the stimulus, which involves the purchase of bonds to keep market interest rates low, has actually helped banks by supporting the economic recovery. That reduces the amount of loans that are not repaid by businesses.

Little Acorn Productions, the Dewsbury-based theatre company, is set to showcase a production at Wakefield Arts Festival.
The company is performing its two-man play, Thick as Thieves, at the Theatre Royal and Opera House on Saturday (2 June).
Chris Sheard and Cev Barker play two unluckly thieves Barry and Steph who break into what they believe to be an empty house, but things start to unravel with hilarious consequences.
Chris and Cev have both directed and performed this comedy several times before.
However, this will be a slightly different version to the previous productions.
Chris said: “We have been working on this show for two years now and have been changing the script and staging to bring the best to the stage.”
Cev said: “Its really a modern farce. If they did the sensible thing when everything starts to go wrong then the whole play would be over in 20 minutes.”

Accused killer won't testify in Charlotte County murder trial
PUNTA GORDA, Fla. Accused killer David McMannis changed his mind about plans to testify in his own trial.
David McMannis had been expected to take the stand to defend himself against accusations he killed 19-year-old Tara Sidarovich, but he told a judge Tuesday he had a change of heart. The case will go to the jury on Wednesday, meaning a saga that's stretched nearly 16 years could be nearing an end.
Sidarovich was home alone waiting for a plumber in 2001 and disappeared. Her remains were found nine months later in the woods off Burnt Store Road, deputies said. Phillip Barr was convicted for his involvement in the murder in 2015.
The judge on Tuesday dismissed a motion for acquittal from defense attorney Michael Bross after the defense had already rested its case. The defense called the state's case circumstantial at best and cited a lack of physical evidence linking McMannis to the murder.
But prosecutors said that's not the case, arguing they've offered more than enough evidence to go to jury.
The judge agreed with the prosecutors, ending the defense's last-ditch effort to get the case thrown out.

MOUNT ORAB – Wilmington maintained its undefeated record in SBAAC American Division play Friday night with a 65-49 victory over Western Brown.
With the win, WHS is now 11-5 overall and 6-0 in the division while the Broncos fall to 11-6 overall, 3-4 in the SBAAC.
Friday night's game was the eighth time Wilmington has held an opponent under 50 points, and it was the seventh consecutive winning contest that the Hurricane opponent did not score 50 points against them.
The teams battled to a 14-14 standoff in the first quarter, but Wilmington outscored the Broncos 17-10 in the second period, taking a 31-24 lead at the intermission. Matt Smith had a pair of three-pointers in each of the first two periods. Jeffery Mansfield had six of his 10 points in the second quarter.
It was a strong defensive effort in the second half by the Hurricane that was the difference as Wilmington held the Broncos to just 25 points. Western Brown came into the game averaging better than six made three-pointers a game. WHS held them to three.
“We wanted to hold them to just three behind the arc, because they shoot it so well from there, and we especially kept it away from number 33 (Elijah Smith). He was held to just 10 points for the entire game,” said WHS head coach Mike Noszka. “After that first quarter, we really locked it down, and played the type of defense we're capable of playing.”
Noszka believes this is another big road win for the Hurricane in its bid for a conference crown. The next challenge is less than 24 hours away.
“At the start of the year, we felt our three toughest games on the road would be at Clinton-Massie, here, and at Goshen,” said Noszka. “So, we will need to come right back with a strong effort there, playing these teams back-to-back.”
Wilmington will play at Goshen 4 p.m. Saturday. The junior varsity game tips off at 2:30 p.m.
On the strength of seven three-pointers, Smith led the Hurricane with 23 points. Mansfield connected for 20 points, eight in the final period.
Willie Morris, a key contributor, added nine points.
Wilmington played without the services of Sam Jacobyansky, who sustained an injury in practice earlier in the week.
“I really feel we are showing noticeable improvement and are getting better,” Noszka said.

Last week, Essential Politics opined on the potential for a slow week in news with the California Legislature, Congress and President Trump on vacation. Boy, was I wrong.
More provocation from (and toward) North Korea was only pushed lower in the headlines by violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va., at a gathering of white supremacists.
In today's highly charged environment, the story quickly turned to the response from the president, who seemed uncharacteristically tongue-tied.
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, on many sides," Trump told reporters.
His full statement was 398 words, but as violence ripped through the Virginia college town, Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike for those specific three words and for not using the term "white supremacists."
Our team has firsthand accounts of the beatings and how the political fallout evolved on the Sunday shows, with national security advisor H.R. McMaster saying Sunday on CNN: "The president's been very clear. We cannot tolerate this kind of bigotry, this kind of hatred."

CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS DIVIDED
Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes' support for California's cap-and-trade legislation is threatening his ability to retain his leadership post, Chris Megerian and Seema Mehta report for our front page Monday.
The San Bernardino County Republican argues that his vote for the state's signature climate change program was an effort to show Californians that he and his party are serious about a matter that is important to them, and to fight more restrictive efforts by the state's Democratic lawmakers. But a growing drumbeat from conservative critics, who argue that was a betrayal of party principles and a tactical blunder, threatens to force him out of his leadership post.
This weekend Phil Willon covered a gathering of tea party leaders from across California. While ecstatic about Trump winning the White House, they were generally in a surly mood at their conference in Fresno. They had their talons out for Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, but their biggest target was what they called the Republican "establishment."
Drawing the most ire was Mayes, whom Tea Party leaders vow to unseat. But he was not alone. California Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte was accused of putting the party in the pocket of "big money," kowtowing to Republican mega-donor Charles Munger. Still, Democrats were openly mocked, including Los Angeles Rep. Maxine Waters. Amid all of this, the top two GOP candidates for governor dropped by in search of support and pledging reverence for Trump.
DEMOCRATS DIVIDED

Route 170 in Clinton Twp. in Wayne County reopened in both directions Thursday night, State Department of Transportation spokesman James May said.
Crews completed repairs far more quickly than township officials expected. Ice jams produced flooding last week that caused the west branch of the Lackawaxen River to flood the road. As the water receded, it washed out a 30 by 50 foot section forcing the road's closure.
“This happened much faster than I anticipated and especially when they first saw the condition of the road. It is still a little bumpy out there until they can go back in the spring and do some more permanent repairs, but they got it open.” May said.

Helios and Matheson Analytics, the parent company of MoviePass, has acquired the exclusive option to buy Emmett Furla Oasis Films, the producers of “Lone Survivor” and “End of Watch,” Variety has learned.
If completed, the deal will enable the company to buy the entire film library and current production slate of EFO Films. Helios and Matheson plans to use the library and the filmmaking expertise of EFO Films to launch its own production company, MoviePass Films. Randall Emmett and George Furla will serve as co-CEO's of the new venture.
The deal comes as MoviePass, best known for allowing customers to see a movie a day for less than $10 a month, is facing questions about its long-term future and current capitalization. Last week, Helios and Matheson's stock fell to 40 cents-a-share, its lowest closing price, amid investor alarm about a cash shortage. In October, Helios and Matheson's stock had been trading at $38.86 a share. The value has declined rapidly since a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed the company had $15.5 million in available cash at the end of April, plus $27.9 million on deposit with merchants. Its monthly expenses totaled $21.7 million. Helios' stock did rebound on Monday, rising 15% after it was revealed that Citadel Securities, a leading market maker, had taken a 5.4% stake in the company.
In an interview with Variety, Helios and Matheson CEO Ted Farnsworth said the deal to acquire EFO Films is a sign that MoviePass remains viable.
“This signals our long-term commitment to the movie business,” he said. “We're here for the long haul.”
In an earlier interview at Cannes, Farnsworth hit back at critics, claiming that the company had roughly $300 million available from an equity line of credit. The deal for EFO Films is a combination of cash and stock. The financial specifics of the pact were not disclosed.
Even before the pact to buy EFO Films' library, MoviePass has been inching into the content business. It is releasing “American Animals” on June 1 in collaboration with the Orchard, and it will release “Gotti,” a crime film with John Travolta, on June 15. EFO Films produced the picture, which is how Farnsworth became acquainted with Emmett and Furla.
Helios will own 51% of MoviePass Films, while EFO Films will own the remaining 49% of the company. The partners say that MoviePass Films make new movies both for theatrical release and for other forms of distribution, such as direct-to-streaming services.
“Since we began disrupting the movie industry with our unprecedented low-cost movie theater subscription service, MoviePass, we have envisioned owning and developing our own content and using the power of our several million subscribers to bolster the success of our films,” Lowe said in a statement. “I believe this partnership with Emmett Furla Oasis Films will accelerate those efforts.”
Stuart Benson, CFO of Helios, will serve as the CFO of MoviePass Films; while Farnsworth will be MoviePass Films' chairman of the board. MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe will hold a seat on the board.
The EFO Films library also includes “Broken City,” “Rambo,” and “The Frozen Ground,” as well as films in development such as “Escape Plan 2” and “Asteroids,” an adaptation of the Atari video game.
MoviePass has been a controversial figure in the industry. The company pays movie theaters for its tickets and subsidizes its customers. However, exhibitors such as AMC have faulted the company for introducing an unsustainable pricing model into the business. Tickets in cities such as New York City or Los Angeles are in excess of $10, or cost more than a monthly MoviePass membership. They believe that MoviePass won't be able to afford to keep subsidizing movie-going, leaving customers feeling aggrieved.
MoviePass has countered by saying that it is diversifying its business beyond subscriptions. It sells ads and plans to use the data from its customers to target moviegoers in ways that make money. Presumably, producing movies is part of its diversification.
Emmett said that his time working on “Gotti” had made him a MoviePass convert, praising the service for being able to drive its user base of more than 2 million customers to buy tickets.
“To do a deal with Helios and MoviePass is epic for us,” said Emmett. “The MoviePass subscription service has totally disrupted the movie industry, for the better.”

In order to encourage more of the nation's young people to pursue careers in science, it pays to help them dress the part.
That is the key finding of a study we conducted recently to determine what kind of effect a simple article of clothing – in this case white lab coats – have on students' confidence in their ability to do science. We also wanted to know if lab coats help students see themselves as scientists and aspire to science careers.
We are science education researchers interested in understanding how the symbols and tools of science can promote students' interest in studying science.
This is an important topic because jobs in science, technology, engineering and math – or STEM jobs – are not only important for the economy, but are also growing faster and pay more than many other fields.
Although the number of jobs in STEM fields are increasing, the number of people choosing to major in those fields remains below what is needed to fill the positions.
The power of clothing
In order to encourage more young people to choose to major in STEM fields and pursue STEM careers, we believe it is important to help them see themselves as someone who can be successful in those fields. One item often associated with scientists is the white lab coat.
Clothing can be a powerful tool for changing one's self-image, as seen in previous studies of the effects of suits and lab coats on adults.
In an effort to help students see themselves as scientists and as individuals who can be successful in science, we conducted a study that put students in lab coats for science instruction.
Along with Sarah Carrier, Emily Cayton, Tammy Lee, Lauren Madden, Katherine Chesnutt, Marissa Phillips and graduate students Lanette Phillips and Pam Huff, we worked with five fifth-grade teachers from four rural schools who taught at least two science classes.
Same lessons, different attire
For each teacher, students in one of the classes wore lab coats for at least 10 class periods over the course of two months. The other class did not wear lab coats. The teachers taught the same lessons to each class to minimize the differences between teachers. The participants were interviewed before and after the 10 lessons and also took a pre- and post-survey that explored many factors, such as their sense of self as a scientist, their confidence in their skills related to science, and whether they had career goals related to STEM fields.
For the 110 youth in the group who didn't wear lab coats, there were no statistically significant changes in their responses from the pretest to post-test for any question on the written survey. However, for the students who wore the lab coats, there was a significant increase in their perceptions of whether others see them as scientists.
More specifically, of the 72 students who wore lab coats, 47 percent changed their responses on the post-survey to indicate they feel like others see them as someone who likes science.
Also, of the 42 lab coat-wearing students who had low levels of confidence in their science skills, 45 percent changed their responses on the post-test to positive responses. Another 36 percent of the students in lab coats with low levels of self-confidence did not change their response from the pre- to post-test but this included the students who already felt they had high levels of recognition.
Positive effects
To test for performance and competence in science, students were asked questions such as “I think I am good at science” and “I am good at using science tools like thermometers, rulers or magnifying glasses.” The youth who wore lab coats but had low levels of self-confidence had a significant increase in their responses to these questions. More specifically, 60 percent of the students changed their answer from disagree to agree.
To test for career aspirations, the students were asked questions such as “I would like to have a job that uses science.” For the students wearing the lab coats who had low confidence in their science skills, 50 percent changed their answers from disagree to agree.
A worthy investment
The bottom line is that for youth that initially had low levels of confidence in their science skills, the lab coats had a significant improvement in their beliefs in their abilities, their levels of recognition and their science career aspirations.
Of course, lab coats cannot supplant a solid science education. At the same time, these simple articles of clothing may represent an inexpensive way to help more young people get interested in science and see themselves as future scientists.

Salute: Is Shah Rukh Khan going to replace Aamir as Rakesh Sharma in upcoming biopic?
Looks like there is no dearth of news around the Mahesh Mathai film Salute, which is being filmed on the first Indian astronaut to go to space, Rakesh Sharma.
While the news of Priyanka Chopra and Aamir Khan coming together for the very first time left fans excited, the recent news of Aamir walking out of the project possibly left many heartbroken. Now, there are fresh claims of Shah Rukh Khan joining the team.
Multiple reports claim that Shah Rukh Khan has replaced Aamir in the biopic, and he will be seen playing Rakesh Sharma, alongside Priyanka Chopra. Though there is no confirmation on the news from the makers or the actor's part, fans are already celebrating.
SRK, who is currently busy hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, conducted an #AskSRK session on Twitter recently. In reply to a fan's question, on whether he has signed Dhoom 4, he said he has not signed any other film but the Aanand L Rai's.
I haven't signed any new film...yet except @aanandlrai film https://t.co/VeZ7kunavn — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) December 10, 2017
In an earlier report, while speaking on Aamir's exit, a source was quoted as saying, “Aamir is not someone who will do a film if he's not 100 percent convinced of it."
SRK and Priyanka Chopra were last seen together in Don 2, and it will be exciting to have them back on big screen together, if this news turns out to be true.

Michael Flynn's ouster as President Trump's national security advisor over his postelection conversations about sanctions with Russia's ambassador did not unfold with the cold efficiency of typical Trump axings on reality TV.
Trump was warned weeks ago that Flynn had misled White House officials about his phone calls with Russian envoy Sergey Kislyak, but the president took no action until “an eroding level of trust” and “a series of other questionable incidents” prompted him to act, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday.
Nor did Flynn's forced resignation late Monday night, after a weekend of conflicting signals from the White House, end the broader drama over Trump and Russia.
Instead, Trump's decision to jettison Flynn after only 24 days in office has deepened questions about current and former Trump aides' dealings with Moscow and about Trump's often-stated pledge to forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, an autocrat most U.S. lawmakers consider an implacable foreign adversary.
Almost since he launched his insurgent presidential campaign two years ago, Trump and several key advisors, including Flynn, have been dogged by allegations of murky ties to Putin's government that seemed to produce favors for both sides.
They included a push by Trump's campaign aides at the Republican National Convention last summer to water down GOP criticism of Russia's armed intervention in Ukraine and revelations that Trump's former campaign chairman had lobbied for a pro-Russia strongman.
More importantly, Moscow apparently tried to help Trump in return. Last month, before Trump took office, the top U.S. intelligence agencies publicly assessed that the Kremlin's leaders had used hacked emails and other tactics in a deliberate effort to help Trump win in November.
Trump has consistently denied getting any Russian help or of being in debt to Russian banks or oligarchs for his real estate empire. He also angrily denied unproven salacious allegations in a widely circulated dossier, produced by a former British intelligence officer, that said he could be blackmailed to do Moscow's bidding.
But Trump has lavishly praised Putin in speeches and on Twitter, and dismissed warnings even from other Republicans of getting too close to the Russian leader who has aligned with Iran in the war in Syria, seized Crimea at gunpoint and threatened NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.
Flynn's departure only worsened this split within Trump's party, as more Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in calling for a broad congressional inquiry into Moscow's attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election as well as its relations with Flynn and other Trump advisors.
“I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned," Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday in an interview with KTRS, a St. Louis radio station.
With Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, Trump can still count on GOP leaders running interference for him, at least for now. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) dismissed Democrats' calls for an independent commission with broad powers to probe deeper into links between Russia and Trump's team.
The congressional inquiries parallel a separate FBI investigation of possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia.
It was this investigation that led FBI agents to question Flynn shortly after Trump's inauguration about his phone calls with Kislyak, on which the U.S. had eavesdropped as part of routine monitoring of the Russian diplomat.
The multiple unfolding investigations will make it difficult for Trump to pivot away from questions about his links to Moscow, adding to the turmoil in a White House battling a series of self-inflicted errors on immigration, ethics and other issues.
It will also be harder for Trump to fulfill his stated goal of joining forces with Putin to defeat Islamic State, a plan that the Pentagon and intelligence agencies already view with considerable skepticism given Moscow's record in Syria, where Russian-backed forces have repeatedly bombed schools, hospitals and other civilian targets.
“What seems to be the case is that Russia for quite some time has invested in Donald Trump or the people around him,” said Derek Chollet, a former Obama administration official who now is executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank. “We just don't know the truth. As long as those questions are out there, it has a corrosive effect.”
For now, the turmoil has pushed the White House to finally do what Trump had previously declined to: harshly criticize Russia's activities in Ukraine and demand that Russia withdraw from Crimea.
"President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in Ukraine and return Crimea," Spicer told reporters Tuesday. "At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to get along with Russia."
The jettisoning of Flynn closely resembled Trump's decision last August to fire Paul Manafort, his first campaign chairman, after disclosures that Manafort's consulting firm had lobbied for former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovich's ruling party.
Although the Manafort firm's work for Yanukovich, a Putin ally who took refuge in Russia after he was forced from office in 2014, was widely known, it wasn't until August that Trump removed him and elevated Stephen K. Bannon, a pugilistic conservative-media honcho who is now one of his closest White House aides.
Trump last month appeared to deflect any more questions about his supposed ties to Russia after a 35-page dossier of supposedly compromising personal information was made public in January by BuzzFeed. Most of the material could not be proved.

On Saturday, August 5, cars lined the streets of downtown Blue Hill, as people enjoyed the 9th Annual Blueberry Festival held at the First Congregational Church. From children's activities to games and food, the day was a celebration of all things blueberry.
The festival began with a (blueberry) pancake breakfast, attracting many into the Fisher Hall. Snacks and treats such as smoothies, and granola on ice cream were available—all featuring the blueberry as the main ingredient.
Music filled the air, as live musicians played instruments and sang throughout the day. Children played in a Scooby-Doo themed bounce house, and people tested their aim at the dunk tank. Magician Jim Picariello entertained a group of all ages with his magic tricks, and juggler Zachary Field brought smiles to many faces during his act.
The church parking lot was filled with vendors selling homemade and handcrafted items including jewelry, soap, and jams made from local blueberries.

Aaron Rodgers threw three of his four touchdown passes in the second half, lifting the Green Bay Packers to an NFC North-winning 31-24 victory over the Detroit Lions and the NFC North title at Ford Field on Sunday night.
Detroit's Matthew Stafford connected with Anquan Boldin for a 35-yard touchdown pass with 13 seconds left, but the Packers recovered the onside kick and Rodgers had only to kneel once to seal the victory.
The 10-6 Packers closed the regular season with six straight wins — running the table as Rodgers said they would after losing four in a row midway through the season — to win the division for the fifth time in six years. Like his team, Rodgers has been perfect during the streak with 15 TD passes and no interceptions. He will lead fourth-seeded Green Bay at home against the fifth-seeded New York Giants in an NFC wild-card game next Sunday.
The Lions dropped their last three contests after leading the North by two games, spoiling a shot at their first division title since 1993. They will be in the playoffs, though, for the second time in three years under coach Jim Caldwell. The sixth seeds will play at No. 3 Seattle on Saturday night.
FALCONS 38, SAINTS 32: Matt Ryan bolstered his MVP credentials with a brilliant first half, throwing four touchdown passes in a home win that secured a first-round playoff bye. Ryan was 17 of 19 for 235 yards by halftime, directing the 11-5 Falcons to touchdowns on all five possessions and a commanding 35-13 lead. He finished 27 of 36 for 331 yards, leaving him with a franchise-record 4,944 yards, 38 touchdowns and just seven interceptions this season. Atlanta is seeded second in the NFC to Dallas. One consolation for New Orleans: Drew Brees became the first quarterback in league history to throw for 5,000 yards five times. He was 29 of 50 for 350 yards, giving him 5,208 on the season. His 471 completions also set an NFL record.
In the wake of white nationalists descending on the University of Virginia and the town of Charlottesville for “Unite the Right” rallies that turned violent over the weekend, college leaders at universities across the country are standing together to oppose the movement's ideology, which they view as hateful.
Student body presidents, college newspaper editorial boards and leaders of College Democrats and College Republicans alike have all made statements denouncing the racism and violence displayed at the rallies, which culminated in three deaths and the injury of 19 others.
As of today, 119 presidents of student governments have signed a collective statement offering support to students at UVA and at any other college standing up to “violence, racism, white supremacy, bigotry and acts of terrorism.”
It goes on,
“As the voice of our students, we collectively call on one another to speak up in the face of injustice, as silence reduces us to bystanders in oppression.”
Jalisa White, student body president at Florida Gulf Coast University, says she wants to foster inclusion. “I think that college campuses should be a place of acceptance, and students should feel comfortable when they step on their campus. They should feel included, they should feel like that is their place,” she says. “If students are feeling scared or students are feeling confused by what's going on, I wanted them to know that they have my support.”
White says the letter is an important show of support to students at FGCU because the campus has seen recent racist acts that prompted protest. Last October and again in March, racial slurs were found written in campus buildings.
“We recently did have a racial slur on our campus in around October of last year and so I understand how that feels,” White says. “What I personally want to achieve as student body president representing a Florida institution is a sense of collectiveness, a sense of support, offering those students, ‘We feel you with what's going on, and we really want to help and be there and support you guys.'”

University of Wisconsin-Platteville student body President Lucas Frey, who signed the statement, tells USA TODAY College that it was started in a group chat of student government presidents who met at a conference earlier in the summer.

Now, student leaders are faced with the question of what to do moving forward to support minority groups and continue the conversation on their campuses.
University of Northern Colorado student body president Kellion Ellis says his student government plans to arrange civic engagement workshops that foster the respectful and open sharing of ideas.
“As a person of color, it truly hurts me to see that this is still happening and that there's not really protection on some campuses,” Ellis says.
Leaders of College Democrats and College Republicans campus chapters are also coming forward to condemn white nationalism.
The UVA College Republicans issued a statement prior to the march through campus Friday night, dissociating the Republican Party from the ideology of the rally organizers, and the College Republicans National Committee called on any College Republicans leaders in support of the ideology to resign.
At least one College Republican leader, Washington State University College Republicans president James Allsup, attended the rally. Allsup already stepped down.
This has been planned since before #UniteTheRight but the club's VP has effectively assumed the presidency. — James☝️Allsup (@realJamesAllsup) August 14, 2017
He spoke out on Twitter against the alt-right and Nazism.
UVA College Republicans chair Adam Kimelman says his chapter supports the view that the ideology espoused at the rally does not align with that of the majority of conservatives or members of the Republican Party.
“The problem becomes when too many people in the conservative movement and too many people in the Republican Party try to rationalize this or blame the far left or try to blame the police instead of the Nazis,” Kimelman says.
The UVA College Republicans will work in the fall term to partner with their Democratic counterparts and organizations representing minority groups to provide a forum for students to discuss their reactions in the form of a “We Love Charlottesville” rally, according to Kimelman. The University Democrats, too, will be redoubling efforts to promote the importance of inclusivity and diversity, says Virginia Chambers, the group's communications coordinator.
“What the board had kind of talked about — even before beginning this — was the need to be as strong as possible in our dedication to minority communities and to making sure that we recognize that this was really domestic terrorism, and we are not going to stand for it here on our grounds or in our town,” Chambers says.
Joel Thomas, an incoming freshman at UVA, told USA TODAY College on Saturday that he plans to join the College Republicans chapter. He says the events in Charlottesville stem from hatred, and supports the chapter's decision to stand against them. “I believe they should fiercely condemn the events that have taken place,” he says. “UVA is a historic institution where some of the greatest minds have attended, and it is no place for the kind of hate that has been displayed.”
Thomas likes the idea of a campus event to foster unity and denounce hatred. If he encounters a UVA classmate who espouses bigoted views, he says he will confront him or her: “I would do everything possible to convince the student that they are not only degrading themselves, but also hurting the college experience of the minority students who will be living in fear.”

NYC Port Authority explosion: What we know about the suspect
New York City police have identified the suspect in an explosion in a crowded subway corridor near the Port Authority bus terminal Monday morning as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah. Police say Ullah was carrying an “improvised low-tech explosive device” when it went off as he was in an underground pedestrian passageway at 42nd street between 7th and 8th Avenues, beneath the major commuter hub.
Mayor Bill de Blasio called it an “attempted terror attack.”
Three people suffered minor injuries and the suspect was seriously injured. No other threats were apparent, the mayor said.
“Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve his ultimate goals,” de Blasio said.

Ullah is in police custody. Officials say he sustained burns to his abdomen and hands after the crude pipe bomb exploded. A photo confirmed by CBS News showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with his shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering his bare midriff. A police officer is holding the man's hands behind his back.
Surveillance cameras captured the man walking casually through the crowded passageway when the bomb suddenly went off at 7:20 a.m. amid plume of white smoke, which cleared to show the man sprawled on the ground and commuters fleeing in terror.
Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), but apparently had no direct contact with the terrorist group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the suspect or incident.
NYPD commissioner James O'Neill said the suspect “made statements” when he was taken into custody but wouldn't say whether he made reference to ISIS.
The device was based on a pipe bomb and affixed to the suspect's body with a combination of velcro and zip ties, said John Miller, the deputy commissioner of intelligence & counter-terrorism for the NYPD. A federal law enforcement official told CBS News' Jeff Pegues the device malfunctioned. The source says “it did not fully detonate which possibly caused the injury.”
O'Neill said it wasn't clear whether the suspect detonated the device by accident or whether the location was intentional. Officials were investigating how it was made.
The suspect also had another device on him, sources tell CBS News.
OTHER NEWS: Transgender people can enlist in military Jan. 1
Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible “lone wolf” attack based on the rudimentary construction of the device, reports CBS New York.
The suspect is from Bangladesh. CBS News has learned. 48 Hours' Murray Weiss reports he has an address in Brooklyn. O'Neill wouldn't confirm whether the suspect has a local address but said it's part of the NYPD's investigation. Ullah entered the U.S. with his parents and three to four siblings in February 2011 on an immigrant visa, sources tell CBS News. He obtained a green card and became a permanent U.S. resident.
Just over a year after arriving in the U.S., in March 2012, Ullah secured a livery license, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission tells CBS News' Graham Kates. That license, which was not for a New York City cab, but instead for a so-called “for-hire” vehicle, lapsed in March 2015.
Ullah had no criminal history prior to Monday's attack, Weiss reports.
Anyone with information about Ullah is asked to call 1-888-NYC-SAFE.

As the second half of June rolled around, local area hospitals saw a spike in severe bleeding cases. From never-ending bloody noses, to extremely heavy menstrual cycles, these were the same type of cases Chicago-area hospitals had been seeing since early March.
In Chicago, the cause was Synthetic Cannabinoids tainted with Brodifacoum, a blood thinner that was also found in rat poison. As of June 20, 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health had received reports of 164 cases, including four deaths since March 7, 2018.
Synthetic Cannabinoids, or Fake Weed, are marketed as a euphoria-inducing incense. They are branded in shiny foil packages that are cheaper than natural marijuana and are easily accessible at gas stations, drug paraphernalia shops, novelty stores and online. The chemical coated plant product also goes by: K2, Spice, Fake Weed, Scooby Snax, Bling Blang Monkey, The Joker, Black Mamba, Maui Wowi, Cloud 9 and the list goes on.
On Monday, the City of Milwaukee Health Department issued an alert about the spike in severe bleeding cases. Since Monday, there were 27 severe bleeding cases in Milwaukee, which was compared to the 10 cases that were reported only six days earlier. Just like in Chicago, testing showed that several patients had Brodifacoum in their system.
“These dangerous products are circulating in our community,” stated Patricia McManus, Commissioner of Health, in statement. “I urge everyone in the community to steer clear of these products. They are unpredictable and they are not safe.”
Alderman Khalif Rainey, 7th District, issued a statement to the public following the spike in health calls for the Synthetic Cannabinoid on Wednesday.
“K2 is illegal and extremely dangerous,” said Rainey. “I encourage parents to speak to their children about the dangers of K2 as well as residents to be aware of the extreme health complications it can cause.”
Dr. Jillian Theobald, Wisconsin Poison Center Toxicologist, hosted a press conference to shed the light on the dangers and symptoms from tainted synthetic cannabinoids floating around the community.
“What happens is that it thins the blood, so it doesn't clot properly,” Theobald said. “People could bump their head and bleed into their brains, and we've had cases of that.”
Theobald said she had also seen cases of internal bleeding in the chest and abdomen area, uncontrollable nose bleeds, excessive menstrual cycles and blood in urine. She added that most of the symptoms may not show until days later.
“The bleeding can be pretty severe because they require blood transfusions and procedures,” Theobald said. “It is difficult to reverse the anti-coagulant, Brodifacoum, because it lasts for weeks to months.”
She added that patients would need extended treatment to remove the contaminant because it stayed in the system for so long, which included receiving heavy doses of vitamin K.
She said most of the cases people had bought the product in Milwaukee, and there were several where people had shared a Hookah pipe.
Theobald said the age range for these cases were adults in their 20's to early 30's. She noted that there were several reasons people chose to smoke Synthetic Cannabinoids, whether it be the significant price difference from its natural counterpart, the overpowering effects and the absence of the product in a drug test.
Rafael Mercado, Team HAVOC and MKE Heroin Diaries founder, said he knew the effects of K2 firsthand. He said that in that most of the cases, the individuals using the product were probably on probation or parole.
“K2 is used by most trying to skirt the urine drops,” stated Mercado in a message to the Courier. “It's highly addicting as one goes thru [sic] withdrawals when they pull themselves off it. I know because I used it when I first got out of federal prison.”
Theobald said one of brands that had popped up several times after speaking with forthcoming patients was “The Joker.”
After scouring the internet for the manufacturer of the Batman-villain inspired incense, it seemed the only available information was marketed on webpages selling the product.
Most of the websites stated “The Joker” was one of the top-selling brands, which knocked users out of reality and into a feeling of pure insanity.
Most webpages clearly state that these Synthetic Cannabinoids were for slow-burning only and were not meant to be consumed orally.
One web-supplier, Incense Express, had a disclaimer about “The Joker” manufacturer claiming there were counterfeited bags with fake ingredients floating around, but there was no date or location of where bags were shipped and if there were any health-related incidents involved.
Another supplier, The Official K2 Incense, had a page dedicated specifically on how to spot counterfeited brands.
After reaching out to several of the online suppliers about possibly tainted synthetic cannabinoids, nobody returned the message.
Though this was not Milwaukee's first fake weed outbreak, Theobald said the symptoms are always different. She said she had seen everything from being trapped in zombielike-state to expressing extreme anger and irritability.
“It all depends on what compounds are sprayed on the plant, so there could be a wide array of clinical side effects,” Theobald said.
The MHD stated that if you, a family member, friend have purchased synthetic cannabinoids, or K2, do not use them.
If symptoms like severe bleeding and unexplained bruising show call 911 or the 24/7 Poison Control Hotline (800) 222-1222.
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia opening batsman David Warner was a victim of friendly fire when he was struck in the neck by a bouncer from teammate Josh Hazlewood and retired hurt during an intra-squad match in Darwin on Tuesday.
The pugnacious lefthander dropped his bat and slumped to his knees after his attempted hook shot went awry at Marrara Oval but quickly picked himself up and walked off the ground unassisted.
Vice-captain Warner was dismissed for four in the first innings and had only made two from 14 balls when he was struck, denying him time in the middle before Australia's two-test tour of Bangladesh.
Cricket Australia tweeted that he was "recovering" from the blow, without elaborating on his condition.
The squad depart for Bangladesh on Friday ahead of the first test in Dhaka which starts on Aug. 27.

A biofuels industry leader says the jury is still out on the Trump administration's attitude toward biofuels.
Doug Durante, executive director of the Clean Fuels Development Coalition, says the industry is still trying to figure out how to deal with the new administration.
One thing is for sure, Durante says the ethanol industry's argument that it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps clean the air doesn't resonate with the Trump team.
“This is not a pro-renewable energy administration,” Durante says. “They make no bones about it, this isn't a secret.” According to Durante, the Trump administration is “very skeptical about climate change,” so reducing carbon emissions isn't a priority. But, Durante is hopeful that Trump's EPA will be easier to work with on regulatory issues.
“That the EPA will be more inclined, under this administration, to look at things differently…because it hasn't been good for us in the past,” Durante says. “If they reinterpret some of these things and accept new data and listen to what we're telling them, that part I believe is going to be very good. So from that standpoint, I'm encouraged.” Last month, new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt set up a task force to review existing EPA regulations and invited public comments.
Brian Jennings, Executive Vice President of the American Coalition for Ethanol, says the top priority for his group is having the EPA revise emissions standards to allow E15 and higher ethanol blends to be sold year round.
“Today, in most parts of the country, retailers are now allowed to sell E-15 in the summer months. That's because EPA has refused to update a regulation regarding evaporative emissions for fuel,” Jennings says. An update of that regulation, Jennings says, would increase demand for more ethanol production and higher ethanol blends, which could help increase the price of corn.
“We all know we're sitting on surplus stocks of corn today and low corn prices. So at the end of the day, this is about increasing demand for corn and providing a valuable market for farmers,” Jennings says. The deadline to submit comments to the EPA on its regulatory review is May 15th. Iowa is the nation's leading producer of both corn-based ethanol and biodiesel.

(Bloomberg)—Few people on Wall Street believe in Eddie Lampert like Eddie Lampert.
Thirteen years after merging Sears, one of America's most iconic retailers, with the budget Kmart chain, the hedge-fund billionaire is moving -- again -- to salvage what he can.
His latest plan, announced Monday, would have his ESL Investments Inc. buy Kenmore, Sears's well-known appliance brand, as well as several other businesses. In other words, Lampert, also chief executive officer of Sears Holdings Corp., wants to sell what is perhaps Sears's last jewel to his own hedge fund -- at least if other bidders don't emerge.
The news gave Sears's long-suffering stock a bump, but for Lampert and his investors, the respite masks a harsh reality: The department-store chain confronts a wall of debt and pension obligations that would be difficult to surmount even if its business weren't as bad as it is -- and business, by all accounts, is very bad indeed.
The numbers tell the story. About $1 billion of Sears debt will come due within the year, according to the company's latest results. It has promised pensions to about 100,000 retirees, but its plan was underfunded by $1.47 billion as of Feb. 28. Its bonds are trading well below face value, with some selling for less than 50 cents on the dollar -- a sign many investors doubt Sears will pay its debts in full. In the last eight years, Sears stock has plummeted about 95 percent.
Extracting Cash
“This is a slow-motion liquidation that has gone on for several years, trying to extract cash out of it,” said Craig Johnson, head of research firm Customer Growth Partners. “If you keep going, Sears the retailer will end up with more liquidity that maybe buys it a few more quarters. But to what end, if all Sears is going to end up as is four walls, a roof and a parking lot?”
A spokesman for Sears declined to comment Monday beyond the earlier statement about ESL Investments.
Monday's plan was Lampert's latest attempt to put off what some analysts warn may be inevitable: a bankruptcy for the 125-year-old company, whose “Dream Book” catalog was once a fixture in many U.S. homes.
Lampert has previously called for going to an “asset-light” operation. He wants to manage a retailer with fewer stores and a robust online business. That makes sense, given the accepted fact that the U.S. has too much retail space. He's put in a plan to cut costs by $1.25 billion a year and raise cash with some success -- the U.S. tax overhaul helped the ailing retailer post a rare quarterly profit last month.
In addition, Lampert's offloaded real estate and other units, including its Lands' End clothing division and Craftsman tool brand. Sears Canada had suffered similar losses and shrinking revenue to the U.S. business, and the partially spun-off chain filed for protection from creditors in Canadian court last June. And at the end of last quarter, Sears had just $182 million in cash and equivalents, down from $286 million a year earlier.
Creating an ‘Illusion'
Monday's announcement that ESL is interested as a buyer is an effort to make Sears's remaining assets seem healthy and worthy of a high sales price, said Noel Hebert, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
“Sears has been really good at creating the illusion that something is happening that can turn the business around,” he said.
Some question how realistic that plan is. According to ESL's latest SEC filing, the firm had just $1.3 billion as of Dec. 31, and about $433 million of that was in AutoNation, Lands' End and Sears-related stocks. The firm didn't indicate what price Kenmore could sell for, or what Lampert's other holdings are.
The biggest chunk of Lampert's net worth is made up of cash, so he's been fairly insulated from Sears's performance. Since June 2013 when Bloomberg Billionaires Index began tracking Lampert, his net worth has dropped by 20 percent to $3.7 billion from $4.6 billion. Meanwhile, shares of Sears have plummeted more than 90 percent in the same period.
In the meantime, the true value of Monday's announcement remains unclear. While there is worth in Sears's real estate, much of that lies with Seritage, the real-estate investment trust, which did a previous deal with Sears, Customer Growth Partners's Johnson said. And a new owner is no guarantee that potential buyers find Kenmore more attractive. They could still wait for its value to decline further, he said.
“Sears, the retailer, unless things change, looks like it's going to be left holding the bag,” Johnson said. “This allows it to hold the bag a little bit longer.”

For nearly 10 years, Shazam has been something of a one-trick pony. Its app has a single purpose: identify a song that's playing and connect users to a service to download or stream it.
But behind the nifty song-detecting technology lies something that could explain why Apple is buying Shazam for a reported sum of $400 million — its treasure trove of data.
The British company got its start in 2002 by offering a phone service that helped people identify music. Users dialed 2580, held their cellphones to a source of music, and Shazam responded with a text message containing the name of the artist and the title of the song.
In 2008, the company rolled this feature into an ad-supported app and launched it on the newly created Apple App Store. It started making money from music referrals too. It became and remains one of the most-downloaded apps.
Its longevity puts the company in a unique position, analysts say. Over the years, as technology has advanced, the software that runs Shazam is no longer considered cutting edge, and the tech itself is now easily replicable. But in an industry where apps commonly fizzle out after a few months, Shazam has amassed something valuable to the giants of Silicon Valley: a trove of user data built up over a decade.
“The only reason they've been successful is they've done it for years, and they've got a strong installation base of customers,” said Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights. “For Apple, it's about buying that customer base and data."
Information such as what music customers search for, what they're buying, and their historic music preferences are “very valuable in terms of Apple's library of knowledge,” Ives said.
Both Apple and Shazam confirmed the acquisition Monday.
“We can't imagine a better home for Shazam to enable us to continue innovating and delivering magic for our users,” a Shazam spokesman said in a statement.
An Apple spokeswoman, declining to confirm how much the Cupertino company paid for the British service, described the two companies as “a natural fit."
“We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement,” the spokeswoman said.
It is unclear whether Shazam will continue to exist as a standalone app once the acquisition is complete, or whether the app will be absorbed into Apple Music.
Snap Inc. and Spotify, which have existing partnerships with Shazam, were reportedly interested in buying the company, but both lost out to Apple, according to TechCrunch, which broke news of the sale. Apple and Shazam declined to comment on what will happen to these partnerships once the deal closes.
Snap, which has a Shazam feature integrated into its camera app, declined to comment. Spotify, which pays Shazam a referral fee every time a listener is directed from Shazam to the Spotify app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Music has long been a major part of Apple's business. Ever since the launch of iTunes in 2001, the company has invested heavily in remaining relevant in the fast-changing music business. It acquired Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014 for $3 billion. It launched its own music and video streaming service, Apple Music, two years ago to compete with the likes of Spotify and Pandora.
As consumers come to expect personalized music recommendations and playlists, Shazam's user data could give Apple a leg up in understanding and reaching new customers. And while Apple hasn't yet detailed its plans for Shazam, it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine a Shazam app that prioritizes referrals to Apple Music.
The deal is another sign that Apple is taking the battle of the mobile music customers seriously, Ives said.
“They're putting more fuel in their gasoline tank,” Ives said.

Sharing is caring, as they say, but letting your friend borrow your mascara or toothbrush could leave you with some new and gross pals – from fungi to pinkeye. Here are 20 things you must never even lend to your BFF.
20. Tweezers
At your friend's house and spot a stray eyebrow hair? It may be tempting to borrow her tweezers, but here's why you really shouldn't. As Mount Sinai Medical Center's Joshua Zeichner told Allure in 2015, “If any bleeding occurs as the hair is pulled from the follicle, it can contaminate the tweezers and infect someone else who uses them.”

19. Bar soap
You can share soap because it cleans itself, right? Wrong! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise using liquid soap instead. Meanwhile, cosmetic dermatologist Neal Schultz has revealed in a 2014 Medical Daily article that bar soaps don't dry out completely. And, consequently, this can “[lead] to an accumulation of bacteria, fungi and yeast that can be passed from person to person.” Nice.

Ben Cowan-Dewar was a bright-eyed 25-year-old entrepreneur when he visited Inverness, N.S., and saw a jaw-dropping landscape fit for a luxury golf course.
Past the abandoned mines and hardscrabble edges of the Cape Breton village, he envisioned a boutique 18-hole course and upscale resort perched atop craggy cliffs.
“It was a magical day,” Cowan-Dewar said recalling his first impressions of the coastline.
“There was a mile of ocean frontage that mirrored the great links courses of Scotland and Ireland.”

The trouble was money.
Finding capital is tricky for any entrepreneur. But banks are notoriously nervous about new ventures in rural regions – even golf courses in picturesque locations destined to attract well-heeled golfers.
To help build Cabot Links, and later its sibling Cabot Cliffs, Cowan-Dewar's company turned to private financial partners and taxpayer-backed assistance.
Cabot Links at Inverness LP cashed interest-free loans of $6.5 million from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), while the government of Nova Scotia inked an $8.25 million cheques for a low-interest loan.
Several years later, the business is on track to repaying the loans, and the golf course is held up by economic development guru Donald Savoie as an innovative way to bring jobs and prosperity to a rural area.
“They've added a new Grade 1 classroom (at the local school). People are moving to the community,” said Savoie, the architect of ACOA and an influential Universite de Moncton professor. “The unemployment rate used to be in the double-digits and it's now virtually zero.”
Critics argue the golf courses are government-subsidized playgrounds for millionaires. They say most of the jobs are seasonal, and question why taxpayer dollars are helping a private business cater to wealthy golfers.
But the economic impact of the two golf courses is incontrovertible: Hundreds of people work at the resort, and the town has a new restaurant and coffee shop.
It's a glimpse into a polarizing economic development debate that for this story starts on a spring day 30 years ago.
WATCH: Dartmouth's Spring Loaded Technology gets ACOA funding
In the beginning
In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stepped off a plane in St. John's, N.L., with a massive economic experiment.
Atlantic Canada was a have-not region steeped in economic misfortune and staggering unemployment.
The fisheries were in a downturn, coal mining was dying and military bases were shuttering.
It was time to relieve the burden of regional disparity, Mulroney said, to create an economic renaissance in a struggling region.
His solution: The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.
“We begin with new money, a new mission and a new opportunity,” he declared optimistically. “The agency will succeed where others have failed.”
The experiment unveiled on a spring day three decades ago has exceeded expectations for some. Thirty years, $10 billion and 56,000 grants and loans later, ACOA stands as a lasting legacy of the Mulroney government, a recognition by Ottawa that Atlantic Canada had been short-changed since Confederation.
But economic malaise continues to grip the East Coast, and while ACOA has spurred jobs and startups, critics say it has simply propped up failing firms and padded the coffers of private enterprise.
Thousands of loans worth more than $425 million have been written off over the last three decades, unpaid by insolvent firms. Eyebrows have been raised when top-level ACOA positions have gone to allies of the governing party.
And despite Mulroney's avowal on that June day 30 years ago that “the region does not need another bureaucracy,” the agency now has a staff of 651 in its Moncton, N.B., headquarters, Ottawa and across the Atlantic region.
WATCH: Fredericton cross-country skiers enjoy newly crafted trails
In all, its operating costs, including salaries, office rentals and equipment, have tallied up to almost $2 billion over the last three decades, roughly one-fifth of its $9.5 billion in total spending over 30 years.
The agency has been described as a boondoggle masquerading as economic development, a vehicle for pork-barrel politics, patronage appointments and make-work projects.
Concerns have been raised about repeat users, firms that have secured money from ACOA year after year for decades.
Atlantic Wallboard – a gypsum wallboard manufacturer under the powerful Irving empire – received more than $40 million in “conditionally repayable” loans, for example, which means the money is only paid back if the investment is successful.
Whether the loans have been repaid, or how much has been paid back, is “subject to client confidentiality and cannot be shared,” ACOA spokesman Robert Bourgeois said in an email, adding only that Atlantic Wallboard is a client in good standing.
In a perfect world, said Savoie – author of “Looking for Bootstraps: Economic Development in the Maritimes,” released earlier this year – governments wouldn't give grants to big businesses flush with cash.
The problem, he said, is companies can pick up and move to Maine or North Carolina in search of more favourable treatment. Savoie said some companies “shop around” for “juicy morsels of government assistance.”
“There are places in the U.S. where they won't pay taxes for 10 years,” he said.
“We could be holier-than-thou and say we're not going to help the Irvings or the McCains. They'll say ‘Fine, we'll just go somewhere else where governments are happy to help us.”‘
Ian McAllister, economic adviser under former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Joey Smallwood, disagrees. We should let them go, he argued.
“If a company comes up to me and says ‘If you don't give us a grant we're going to go south of the border' I would shake their hands and say ‘Well enjoy yourself' because that is not a good case,” said McAllister, who headed the regional development unit of the federal Finance Department in the early 1970s.
McAllister said the promise of “jobs, jobs, jobs” shouldn't be enough to obtain public money, unless there is a thorough and compelling cost-benefit assessment attached to those jobs.
“The companies that are the most capable of extracting funds through programs are the big multi-national corporations,” he said. “But we shouldn't have to bribe them to come here.”

Harnessing the energy and skills of the region
Before ACOA, economic development meant building big industrial parks and luring outside investors with handsome cash grants.
Savoie's vision was a sharp departure. Regional development should be endogenous, he said, harnessing the energy and skills of Atlantic Canadians.
Two months after ACOA was born, his vision was emulated in other regions.
“Now every postal code in Canada has a regional development agency,” Savoie said.
There are six agencies in all: Atlantic Canada, northern Canada, western Canada, Quebec regions, northern Ontario and southern Ontario.
Advocates of ACOA-style economic development say it helps beleaguered towns and gives local entrepreneurs a fighting chance.
In the early years, ACOA was lambasted for creating an uneven playing field through generous grants. But it has increasingly moved towards repayable loans.

Although more than 80 per cent of the 56,000 awards handed out are so-called non-repayable contributions, or grants, the vast majority of those are to cities and towns, universities, and not-for profit organizations.
Atlantic Canada's still-weak economy could be worse without ACOA, its backers contend.
While statistics show the region continues to lag the rest of the country, figures also show the economic chasm dividing the East Coast from the rest of the country is closing.
In 2016, GDP per capita – a measure of economic activity – rose to $37,980 per person, or 82 per cent of the national level, up from $30,600 or 76 per cent in 2000, for example.
Joblessness in the Atlantic region is also better, at just over nine per cent, down from a staggering nearly 14 per cent in 1987.
But whether those improvements are due to ACOA is hard – impossible even – to gauge.
ACOA spokesman Bourgeois offers a list of statistics that support the agency's existence: Fifty-seven per cent of ACOA-assisted firms are still operating five years after starting up, compared to 31 per cent without support. Sales and labour productivity are also higher and grow faster for firms cashing ACOA cheques. And for every dollar ACOA has spent, the region's GDP grew by more than $5 over a five-year period, with the GDP of all four Atlantic provinces combined about a billion dollars higher in 2012-13 as a result of investments.

30 years on
After 30 years watching the agency grow, the Savoie says he's hopeful about its future, calling the newly minted president, Francis McGuire, “a bolt of energy.”
“He's shaking things up,” Savoie said of McGuire, a former businessman who became ACOA's deputy minister in June. “He's bringing a new level of energy, a fresh perspective.”
McGuire has an ambitious plan to raise Atlantic Canada's profile in Ottawa and says he's ready to lead the agency down a new path.
“ACOA over the years has not played as aggressive a role in terms of advocacy,” said the former president and CEO of Major Drilling Group International Inc.
Looking forward, McGuire said ACOA needs to help companies with changing demographics, skills mismatch and the need for increased automation.
In a recent interview on the agency's 30th anniversary, Mulroney admitted ACOA hasn't been perfect.
“But I think it did a lot of good,” he told The Canadian Press. “It's done a tremendous job in helping small and medium business in Atlantic Canada.”
Mulroney added: “I think that governments obviously have to play a role. And one of the key roles obviously is creating a climate within which the private sector can flourish. But you'd have to be foolish not to understand that in a region like Atlantic Canada the government must be there to be of assistance. This is not like downtown New York City, it's not as easy to attract industry here.”
Ben Cowan-Dewar says his world-class golf courses would never have happened without government backing.
“Financing was a massive challenge. The farther you get from a major city, the harder it is to find financing,” he said. “The combination of it being rural and the relative market size … there just seemed to be so many odds stacked against us.”
Situated in the westernmost part of Antalya between green mountains and the blue Mediterranean Sea, Kaş bursts with natural beauty. Those who come to Kaş, which has a summer population of over 100,000, often engage in diving, paragliding and hiking on the Lycian road, or enjoy swimming in the turquoise sea and visiting ancient cities like Patara and Xanthos, the former capitals of the Lycian civilization.
Despite the many things that Kaş offers to its visitors, this lovely summer spot aims higher and wants to become one of the most important diving centers in the world.
Hundreds of scuba divers travel to Kaş every day to discover the districts' underwater wonders. Those who dive in Kaş's clear water often encounter stingrays, sea turtles, rare nudibranchs, lionfish, octopi, Mediterranean moray eels, leerfish, damselfish, saddled seabream and cuttlefish along with the remains of the previous shipwrecks.
There are 42 diving points in the district with 34 spots in Kaş's city center and eight in Kalkan Quarter. There are 17 diving schools in Kaş and 19 in Kalkan. Kaş and Kalkan host a total of nearly 100,000 dives per year.
District Governer Bilgehan Bayar said Kaş has become the center of diving tourism in Turkey, stressing that the district is also one of the most important centers for diving tourism in the world.
Recalling that the 2nd CMAS Apnea World Championship Outdoor 2016 and the 1st CMAS European Apnea Outdoor Championship 2017 were held in Kaş with both organizations successfully completed, District Governor Bayar said the two championships also made significant contributions to the promotion of Kaş, adding that many underwater athletes also break world records in the region.
District Governor Bayar pointed to the importance of why people prefer Kaş for diving. "Kaş's sea has a unique blueness, cleanliness and clarity. The visibility is excellent too," Bayar continued. "Over the years, warplanes, Coast Guard boats and tanks have been sunk for diving tourism. A replica of Uluburun Shipwreck, located underwater in Hidayet Bay in Kaş and removed from Kaş, is now displayed in Bodrum Museum."
Noting that Kaş's underwater caves, wrecks, rich sea life and abundance of plants can be found nowhere else in Turkey, Bayar said it is possible to see fish species and fish swarms that are not seen in many parts of the Mediterranean, especially the protected grouper, in Kaş, underlining that the richness and underwater view of the islands is also another feature of the district.
District Governor Bayar pointed out that diving can be performed throughout the year in Kaş due to the water temperature and the conservation of the bays, noting that diving tours in Kaş continue throughout the winter as well.
Bayar also added that many world-famous athletes train for championship at the CMAS- TSSF Academy 'Kaş is Different' Training Center established in collaboration with World Underwater Federation (CMAS), Turkey Underwater Sports Federation (TSSF), Kaş District Governor's Office and Kaş Municipality, inviting underwater enthusiasts in Turkey and around the world to Kaş for diving.

AN initiative has begun in St. Lucia to determine what sectors, policies and regulations could spur St. Lucia's competiveness and drive inclusive long-term economic growth.
The Dialogue for Private Sector Development and Economic Growth, held on July 27 at the Finance Administrative Centre, was driven and facilitated by Compete Caribbean through its local focal point the National Competiveness and Productivity Council (NCPC).
In his address, Minister for Finance, Dr. Ubaldus Raymond, noted the timeliness of the initiative as St. Lucia lags behind in productivity and innovation.
He lamented that, “Unfortunately, St. Lucia is no longer ranked first place in the region in the World Bank's Doing Business indicators. This situation is further compounded by low levels of productivity and innovation, as well as lack of competitiveness.”
The Minister noted that government has been working on a Private Sector Development Strategy and a National Export Strategy in its efforts to stimulate economic growth.
Dr. Raymond added that: “The Government is, therefore, committed to leading the process by creating the enabling environment which will support private sector-led growth. This support will be channelled through the NCPC and other agencies of government in collaboration with our development partners, such as Compete Caribbean”.
Fiona Hinkson of the NCPC detailed the successes of the NCPC in advancing the island's competiveness and noted her organisation's readiness to facilitate the dialogue. The NCPC Executive Director expounded on the functions of her organisation, noting that, “We actively research on factors and principles of productivity and competitiveness in order to inform policy, project design, and dissemination of key indicators.”
Dr. Sylvia Dohnert, Executive Director of Compete Caribbean Partnership Facility, said that private sector development programme has agreed to fund three projects that will lead to meaningful reform or the institutional strengthening needed for business growth in St. Lucia. Similar offers are being made to other OECS States.
She noted that one call for proposals “is at the national level in each country and is about a policy or regulatory reform or institutional strengthening projects that St. Lucia wants To Compete Caribbean to fund”.
The Compete Caribbean Program was launched in 2011 with a view to increasing productivity and stimulating private sector development in the region. Building upon the successes of Phase 1, Phase II (2017-2020), funded by the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development and the Caribbean Development Bank, it is intended to further facilitate private sector development and economic growth in the region.
The second call for proposals targets clusters with a bias towards job creation. Dr. Dohnert described clusters as “groups of firms that do things together. In the first phase of COMPETE Caribbean, we found them to be very powerful; over 5000 jobs were created through 8 clusters that we supported.”
A deadline of August 31 has been set for the receipt of submissions. Proposals for clusters can be submitted directly to Compete Caribbean (competecaribbean@iadb.org). Proposals for policy or regulatory reform and institutional strengthening should be forwarded to the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council at:

According to court records, Bradford, an engineer, never showed up to work at TRW on the day of the slaying. He didn't call in sick, either. It was so out of character that his boss went to his apartment to check on him. When he saw Bradford, the boss asked why he hadn't called the office. The employee — who seemed depressed — said he didn't feel like it.
Dog owners are continuing to speak out about the lack of off-leash parks in Regina. Last year, the city approved three new year-round sites, but so far there has been no word on where or when they will open.
READ MORE: City of Regina recommends new off-leash dog parks
Patricia Czaplicki and her two-year-old German Shepard mix Freddy are frequent visitors at the newest fenced in dog park in the city's east end. It's only one of two all-season off leash dog parks in Regina.
“We were able to bring on the East Industrial site a couple of years ago as an inter measure until we could work with the development community to get some other locations,” Janine Daradich, Manager of Recreation, Planning and Parks with the city of Regina said.
READ MORE: Regina opening up another off-leash dog park
But the city has yet to move forward with more sites, and it's becoming a growing concern for some residents.
“We live in the city, we have dogs that need exercise,” Czaplicki said. “I really wish that there were more, quite a bit more of this year round.”
Czaplicki isn't alone. Amanda Racette has been coming to The Cathy Lauritsen Memorial off-leash dog park for more than 10 years. She says the lack of off leash areas means having to drive across the city.
“I know this one is always full,” she said. “So it would be nice if I could even walk my dog to the dog park, instead of having to make an event of it, make a plan to make sure I'm here on time, before it's dark, those types of things,” she said.
While Regina also has five seasonal sites, other cities like Saskatoon have 10 year-round off-leash dog parks.
It's something Nicole Foulston thinks should be more of a priority here in Regina.
“It's an extra 20 minutes to take my dog to the dog park whereas if I take them for a walk, I can walk an hour, but they still don't get the same level of exercise,” she said. “I'd love to have one in each point of the city.”
Other residents say more upgrades to the existing off-leash dog parks would be nice.

“I don't know if it would be asking for a lot but some lighting would be nice for when the days are short and it gets dark early,” dog owner Kurt Anthony said. “Some fresh water for the dogs would also be nice, instead of having to drink out of the creek.”
Last year city council gave the go-ahead for three new year-round dog parks, one in the north, east and south but Daradich says conversations are still being had and the city isn't in a position to make an announcement.
WASHINGTON | Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York and Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore have urged the House and Senate to past the Conscience Protection Act of 2017.
They called it “essential legislation protecting the fundamental rights of health care providers … to ensure that those providing much-needed health care and health coverage can continue to do so without being forced by government to help destroy innocent unborn children.”
The two prelates made the plea in a joint letter dated Feb. 8 and released Feb. 10 by the USCCB. Cardinal Dolan is chairman of the bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities and Archbishop Lori is chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee for Religious Liberty.
In the Senate, the Conscience Protection Act of 2017 is known as S. 301, and in the other chamber it is H.R. 644. The companion bills would provide legal protection to doctors, nurses, hospitals and all health care providers who choose not to provide abortions as part of their health care practice.
In the House, Republican Reps. Diane Black of Tennessee and Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska introduced the measure Jan. 24. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma sponsored it in the Senate Feb. 3 and it now has at least 16 co-sponsors.
“While existing federal laws already protect conscientious objection to abortion in theory, this protection has not proved effective in practice,” Cardinal Dolan and Archbishop Lori noted, citing recent examples in which the federal government has refused to enforce these laws.
Last June, they said, the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights declared that the state of California could “continue forcing all health plans under its jurisdiction to cover elective abortions — in violation of the plain text of the Weldon Amendment.” Weldon was enacted in 2005 to protect the conscience rights of institutions and individuals.
“The Conscience Protection Act will address the deficiencies that block effective enforcement of existing laws,” they said, “most notably by establishing a private right of action allowing victims of discrimination to defend their own rights in court.”

Health care is not a business, but a service to life, pope says
VATICAN CITY | A nation's health care system cannot be run simply as a business because human lives are at stake, Pope Francis said.
“If there is a sector in which the ‘throwaway culture' demonstrates its most painful consequences, it is the health care sector,” the pope told patients, medical professionals, pastors and volunteers attending a meeting sponsored by the Italian bishops' national office for health care ministry.
Anticipating the celebration Feb. 12 of the World Day of the Sick and marking the 20th anniversary of the bishops' office, the pope said Catholics obviously give thanks for the advances in medicine and technology that have enabled doctors to cure or provide better care for the sick.
He also praised medical personnel who carry out their work as “ministers of life and participants in the affectionate love of God the creator. Each day their hands touch the suffering body of Christ, and this is a great honor and a great responsibility,” he said.
But, the pope said, any public policy or private initiative regarding health care that does not make the dignity of the human person its central concern “engenders attitudes that can even lead to exploitation of the misfortune of others. And this is very serious.”
“Indiscriminately adopting a business model in health care, instead of optimizing resources,” he said, risks treating some of the sick as disposable. “Optimizing resources means using them in an ethical way, with solidarity, and not penalizing the most fragile.”
Protecting human life from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death means that “money alone cannot guide political and administrative choices” in health care, he said. And the increasing lack of health care “among the poorest segments of the population, due to lack of access to care, must leave no one indifferent.”

Kolkata: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said she has plans to meet industrialists in Shanghai during her visit to China soon.
Stating that she has received a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this regard, Mamata said she would try to attract investments in the manufacturing sector.
"I will make this visit on national interest since China wanted me to visit the country. I have received a communication from the Ministry of External Affairs. I will also try to meet industrialists in Shanghai," she told "News 18 Bangla".
The chief minister is likely to visit China in June, state secretariat sources said.
Prime minister Narendra Modi is also scheduled to visit China on 9 to 10 June for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.
Incidentally, a large business contingent from China had participated in this year's Bengal Global Business Summit, which received a huge proposal for investments.
Secretariat sources said that during the proposed visit, the chief minister may be accompanied by state finance minister Amit Mitra and a host of industrialists from West Bengal. Besides, manufacturing sector, there could be business dialogues over healthcare, tourism and IT, they said.
The chief minister also said that she would be visiting Chicago to celebrate the 125th year of Swami Vivekananda's speech at the World Parliament of Religion, on Ramakrishna Mission's invitation.
"I have a plan to visit Chicago to attend 125th year of Swami Vivekananda's speech at World Parliament of Religion
on Rama Krishna Mission's invitation," Banerjee said.
"During the visit to the US, I along with my delegation will visit the Silicon Valley. We are planning to set up a similar type of facility here over 100-acre of land," Banerjee said.
Sources at the chief minister's office said that Banerjee may visit Chicago in September. "We have also improved in infrastructure and as a part of it, three major ports are coming up at Sagar, Kulpi and Tajpur. A major coal block in the state will also help grow industry here," she said.

Stories of overcoming long odds are always the best. San Jose's Kevin Labanc has a story of his own that's just starting to take shape.
The former Barrie Colt great finds himself these days on the Sharks' top line playing to the right of Logan Couture. That's not bad for someone who originally came into the league as a sixth-round draft pick. A total of 170 players heard their name on draft night in 2014 before Labanc heard his.
The Sharks took Labanc 171st overall after compiling 35 points in 65 games for the Colts in 2013-14. While these numbers seem underwhelming, Labanc enjoyed a nice playoff run that season. In 11 games, he scored three goals and seven points. Those watching him could tell he had another gear to his game.
Good thing the Sharks thought that as well.
Labanc exploded the next two seasons for the Colts scoring 107 and 127 points. He added 26 points in 15 playoff games in 2015-16. He became one of the best forwards in the entire Ontario Hockey League and paid off the Sharks' trust in him in a huge way.
After spending time with both the Sharks and the San José Barricuda the next two seasons, Labanc now has exactly 100 NHL games under his belt. He has 14-33-47 in those 100 games and is a +4. He has a career-high 21 assists this season.
We caught up with Labanc after the Sharks' morning skate in Columbus to discuss a variety of topics including the season to date, how he overcame long odds to get to this point and we get the inside scoop on his epic Twitter handle.
Q&A With Kevin Labanc
THW: The race to the playoffs is so tight these days. Does every game you play these days feel like a playoff game?
LaBanc: Yeah, I mean every game is just so tight. Every game counts. You don't want to waste the points. You gotta really come to play every night. There are no nights off.
THW: You are in the midst of three games in four nights and tonight is your third game of a five-game road trip. Just how crucial are these games for you given where you're at in the standings?
LaBanc: It is really important. We need those two points to better ourselves in the standings and to make ourselves feel comfortable later in the season. We gotta come ready to work.
THW: Your team obviously misses Joe Thornton. What part of his game do you feel you miss the most?
LaBanc: He's such a good, all-around player. He creates offense and he's great defensively. But it's that offensive production. You can't replace that. He's just so skilled and that experience to say you know what, we're ok here. We'll just get back to work here. We'll get one, we'll get two and we'll be on a good start.
THW: So you are in your second full season with the Sharks. You already have a career-high in assists. What do you think is working so well for you?
LaBanc: I'm just feeling more comfortable. The longer you play, the more comfortable you feel being out there. Things just start to slow down for you. You're not as nervous with the puck. You feel confident. I'm experiencing that now.
THW: I really love your story from the time you were with the Barrie Colts. (The Sharks) made you a sixth-round pick. Looking back at your career, what do you feel like you had to overcome to go from a sixth-round pick to now playing on the top line for the San José Sharks?
LaBanc: Just my work ethic. That's what I was doing when I was back with Barrie. I was working hard. They have a great coach there too in Dale Hawerchuk. He taught me a lot about the game. He's a hall of famer and he knows so much and he's so knowledgeable. You just learn so much by looking and listening. That's what I did. You gotta learn everyday otherwise once you stop, things start to go downhill.
THW: Who's really mentored you in the room to help get acclimated to the league?
LaBanc: Goodness, there are so many guys you could say (Joe) Pavelski, (Tomas) Hertl, (Logan) Couture. Jumbo is obviously, probably the one because he's been in the league the longest and he's had the most experience. He knows what it takes to become the player that he is.
THW: So my last question for you, Twitter handles (Labanc starts laughing.) @str8tothebanc is one of the best ones. Where did this handle come from?
LaBanc: I think it was a 50 cent song. It started with that then one of my buddies just said to make that your Twitter account. I was like alright. He made it for me. I was like alright let's just stick with it.
Coach Peter DeBoer's Thoughts
Sharks' head coach Peter DeBoer said today that LaBanc “is a special offensive player.” But he adds that the 5-on-5 game is a work in progress. That's expected for someone who is a power-play specialist and gifted offensively. While he still has areas of the game to learn, LaBanc is earning the trust of the coaching staff and continues to show improvement in key areas of his game. Playing on the top line is a testament to how far he's come.
LaBanc and the Sharks hope to get back to the winning way Friday night in Columbus. We thank him and the Sharks for his time in talking with us.

It's a fantastic time to be fishing here in Charleston! The usual suspects, redfish and trout, are now complimented by a host of seasonal species including spanish mackerel, ladyfish and sharks. Combined with warmer temperatures, the fishing conditions are now excellent.
Redfish have been making quick work of any well placed bait. Make sure to carry your cast net and try catching some menhaden or finger mullet. We've been having the most success around rock walls, docks and other structures while fishing live bait on a carolina rig. Make sure to use a weight heavy enough to hold the bait stationary, otherwise your rig will slide along the bottom until it snags.
As for trout, not much new here. Popping corks remain the way to go. Surprisingly, mud minnows have been outperforming live shrimp under corks. Usually, it is the other way around. If little fish keep picking at your live shrimp, switch over to a D.O.A. 3” artificial shrimp. Their Glow/Gold Rush Belly color has been quite productive.
Anglers focused on flounder have been reporting good numbers being caught. Work finger mullet along the bottom around structures. Move the bait slowly along and when you think you have a bite wait a few seconds before setting the hook. We've been picking up quite a few flounder with mud minnows under a popping cork as well.
My favorite summer time fish is the ladyfish. With the warmer weather, ladyfish will flood our waters. These exciting fish will smack bait under a popping cork and make your drag zing. Their acrobatic jumps and hard runs make these fish so entertaining. You'll find them in some of the same spots that you find trout. See you on the water!

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO): Two Fort Wayne-based health insurance providers will be merging.
Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana and Pro-Claim Plus Inc. have announced plans to merge on September 30th.
The Journal Gazette reports that PHP will keep providing group health insurance plans, while self-funded administrative services will stay under Pro-Claim's name.
There shouldn't be any disruptions with service or coverage, and the soon-to-be-combined company says they actually have plans to add jobs in the near future.
This is a big deal. Snapchat is finally launching a developer platform https://t.co/P2A1VCD9QJ — Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) May 29, 2018
Since Snapchat's launch, its developer has released everything from face filters to the ability to create your own geofilters and everything in between, but one thing people have been asking for for a while now? A developer platform. This week it was announced (or leaked, rather) that Snapchat will be launching its first complete developer platform, and it's called Snapkit.
The platform's prototypes indicate it will let other apps offer a "login with Snapchat" options, use the Bitmoji avatars it acquired and host a version of Snap's full-featured camera software that can share back to Snapchat. Multiple sources confirm Snap Inc. is currently in talks with several app developers to integrate Snapkit. (Josh Constine, TechCrunch)
Along with the new developer platform, people will be able to "login with Snapchat": Snapkit will allow users to sign up for new apps with their Snapchat developer credentials instead of creating brand-new ones. As pointed out by TechCrunch's Josh Constine, one benefit to this is the ability to bring your Bitmoji avatar with you.
While Bitmoji has offered a keyboard full of your avatar in different scenes, Snapkit could make it easy to add yours as stickers on photos or in other ways in third-party apps. Seeing them across the mobile universe could inspire more users to create their own Bitmoji lookalike. (Josh Constine, TechCrunch)
JOHOR BAHRU-The daughter of one of Malaysia's most powerful sultans married her Dutch fiance Monday in a ceremony steeped in centuries of tradition during a day of lavish celebrations. Princess Tunku Tun Aminah Sultan Ibrahim, 31, the only daughter of the Sultan of Johor, tied the knot with Dennis Muhammad Abdullah, 28, capping a romance of over three years.
The Dutchman, who has converted to Islam, and the princess wed according to Muslim Malay custom at the Serene Hill Palace, the royal family's residence in the southern city of Johor Bahru. The private ceremony was attended by close family and friends. The groom wore traditional white Malay wedding attire and the bride wore a white dress. Dennis Muhammad placed the wedding ring on Tunku Aminah's finger in a special room in the palace, according to the royal press office.
In keeping with centuries-old wedding customs in the Muslim-majority southern state of Johor, he also gave her a dowry of 22.50 ringgit (about $5), and the couple kissed the hands of their parents, aunts and uncles as a mark of respect. An evening reception will be the main event which will feature a “sitting-in-state” ceremony, with some 1,200 guests due to attend and crowds expected to watch the event on a big screen in a city square.
There have been frenetic preparations in recent days, with the grounds of the main palace decorated with bunting and main streets adorned with flags.
“I am taking my wife and two young children to the city square tonight to witness the live broadcast of the evening celebrations,” Azim Mohamad Nurazim, a 34-year-old local salesman, told AFP.
“It is a celebration for all Johoreans. My message to Tunku Aminah and her husband is long and healthy life, and may Allah bless the couple with lots of children.”
The Dutchman, who now works for a property development company in Johor, was born Dennis Verbaas and adopted a Muslim name when he converted to Islam in 2015.
Johor's royal family is rich and powerful and possesses its own private army - the only state to have one.
Malaysia has a unique arrangement in which the throne of the Muslim-majority country changes hands every five years between the rulers of the nine states which are still headed by Islamic royalty.
The current king is Sultan Muhammad V, from the conservative Islamic northern state of Kelantan, who steps down in 2021.
But Dennis Muhammad is unlikely ever to assume the role since the rulers choose among themselves who the next king will be.
The low hills along the coast of southeastern Bangladesh typically receive up to 40 inches of rainfall in a month at the peak of the monsoon — almost as much as Los Angeles averages in three years. To accommodate the masses of refugees who began crossing from Myanmar in August, sandy knolls were flattened and more than 1,000 acres of forests were chopped down, heightening the risk of landslides.
The Lakeland Aero Club on the campus of SUN ‘n FUN at Lakeland-Linder Regional Airport (KLAL) has added a Redbird FMX full motion flight simulator to its fleet.
This installation will be different from the norm as club members will perform the installation themselves.
Two of the club's student leaders, Katie Esker, a sophomore, and Sean Stoltz, a freshman, visited Redbird headquarters in Austin, Texas, last month for installation training.
They spent two and half days learning how to assemble and maintain the simulator under the tutelage of Kenyon Odell. After the simulator was completely built at Redbird, it was then dismantled and put in a crate for shipping.
The deconstructed FMX arrived in Lakeland during the week of SUN ‘n FUN, with the students expect to complete its reassembly in about three days.
“Lakeland Aero Club provides its members a variety of amazing opportunities through active participation and practical experience. So, it was only natural that the club ask to build the simulator themselves,” said Redbird's President, Charlie Gregoire. “We were happy to accommodate and had lots of fun training the students. They are smart, talented, and professional and have been some of the best customers to work with.”
Once the simulator is up and running, the students will draft operating guidelines and begin to use it for flight training.
The simulator can be configured to operate as a Piper Warrior, Piper Seminole, or a Cessna 172.
The Lakeland Aero Club was founded with the mission to introduce young people to all aspects of aviation. The club not only provides an accessible platform for learning to fly, but its members are empowered to make the decisions on how it is operated and run. Members are also offered experience in aircraft restoration and maintenance.
Republicans may have abandoned their latest effort to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, but some advocacy groups aren't letting the issue go so easily. A couple of groups started running ads in the districts of GOP members of Congress this week, encouraging voters to call their representatives and demand that they reject the concept of a healthcare repeal altogether. Save My Care, a left-leaning healthcare advocacy group in Washington, began running a series of digital ads this week taking aim at California Reps. David Valadao (R-Hanford), Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) and Darrell Issa (R-Vista). "Just like a zombie, repeal keeps coming back," the ads warn. They're part of a "five-figure" national media buy, said Marcos Rodriguez Maciel, a spokesman for the group. He declined to disclose the group's major funding sources.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also began running its first California TV ad of the year this week. The ad, titled "Never Stop," features Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and warns that "They'll never stop...coming after your healthcare." The ads are running on MSNBC and CNN in Denham and Valadao's districts, and are being paired with radio ads that specifically target each member. In Valadao's Central Valley district, constituents will also hear Spanish-language versions on the radio.
"I will ask, however, that sermonizing, biblical references and talk of a great afterlife that some say is awaiting us all be limited to those comments made by God him or herself," he said. "Should God appear personally and, supplying adequate identification in the form of a passport, credit card or driver's license, I would welcome God's words."
Purdue did more than advance to the Sweet 16 in holding off Butler on Sunday afternoon. It also clinched its first 30-win season in program history.
Win No. 31 will have to come against Texas Tech in Boston. To record the “W,” and advance to the Elite Eight, the Boilermakers must be able to handle suffocating defense and ball pressure. Purdue had nine turnovers in its NCAA opening win vs. No. 15 Cal State Fullerton and 10 vs. No. 10 Butler in the second round. Amazingly, point guard P.J. Thompson went the first two rounds without a single turnover. This team generally has done well limiting turnovers and handling the ball. No doubt, having a quick guard like Carsen Edwards will help.
Purdue will need to slow star senior guard Keenan Evans, the team's leading scorer. Jarrett Culver (11.5 ppg) and Zhaire Smith (11.5) are the other double-digit scorers for a team that finished tied for second in the rugged Big 12. Can Purdue handle the quickness? The Boilermakers aren't overly athletic, so they must make the Red Raiders play vs. a set defense, limiting transition points. Having 7-3 redshirt freshman Matt Haarms playing big minutes should help the Boilers defend. He is long, quick and energetic as the replacement for 7-2 senior Isaac Haas, who is out with a fractured elbow suffered in the NCAA opener. Haarms was productive in the win vs. Butler with seven points, six rebounds and two blocks. Purdue also needs to use its size inside for points in the paint and to protect the rim while also gobbling offensive rebounds. Again, keep an eye on Haarms, who should be able to deal with the Texas Tech quickness better than Haas would have.
The winner of this game will take on the winner of the No. 1 Villanova vs. No. 5 West Virginia clash for a shot at the Final Four.

No. 2 Purdue (30-6) vs. No. 3 Texas Tech (26-9), East Region, Boston, approximately 10 p.m. ET
Know Texas Tech: Red Raiders coach Chris Beard is familiar with Purdue. Back in 2016, he was the coach of Arkansas-Little Rock. His No. 12 seed Trojans were trailing by 12 with 3:33 to go but rallied to force two OTs and then win it 85-83 vs. No. 5 Purdue. Beard was a long-time assistant to Bob Knight in Lubbock, so he's an intense coach with proven chops. With their best record since 1995-96, the Red Raiders are an athletic team that beat No. 14 Stephen F. Austin and No. 6 Florida to reach the Sweet 16. Texas Tech is a small team that starts four guards. But they get after it. This isn't a great shooting squad, and it lacks depth. But the Red Raiders are relentless defenders, rolling into their first Sweet 16 since 2005 and only second (1996) since the tourney field was expanded to 64 in 1985. And Tech rolls from defense to offense quickly, getting transition points in bunches.
Key player: Take your pick between senior forward Vincent Edwards and sophomore guard Carsen Edwards. These are the straws that stir the drink for Purdue. The elder Edwards is a Swiss Army knife who can do a bit of everything. Witness his 20-point effort vs. Butler that included a monster blocked shot late. The younger Edwards is coming off a 4-of-17 clunker in the second round, but he's the team's most dynamic player who is capable of taking over a game … and winning it.
Key number: 42.1, Purdue shooting percentage from 3-point range, hitting 346-of-822 bombs. That's tops in the Big Ten. If the Boilermakers want to march to their first Elite Eight since 2000 and first Final Four since 1980, they will need to be hot from long range. Carsen Edwards, Vincent Edwards, P.J. Thompson, Ryan Cline and Dakota Mathias all are capable from beyond the arc. Mathias is just six 3-pointers from setting the school record for 3-pointers made in a season. These sharpshooters must have good aim on Friday night in Boston.

The Walking Dead will be back before we know it (October 22nd to be exact), and more brutality is sure to come along with it. The end of last season saw Rick and his crew learning some tough lessons about the strength of Negan and the Saviors, and finally, it seems like (with the help of Kingdom and Hilltop) their resistance will now have enough power to fight Negan and his band of psychopaths for real.
For some, The Walking Dead has lost a lot of its charms since its main feature — the walking dead — have been sidelined as the show has worn on. Like in the comics, decomposed bodies can only amble around for so long, and now the problem is those that have survived are largely a group of insane sadists. Not all but … an uncomfortable amount. The show has thus pivoted to Negan and his story, and his reign of terror over the original crew. But with so many TV series focusing on gritty violence and deranged humans being terrible to each other, do we need another one? Bring back the walkers!
Today AMC released some new images for Season 8 that highlight the major players in character portraits, and feature some stills of the cast gearing up for the big fight. Check that out plus the official synopsis for Season 8 below. The Walking Dead‘s new season will also feature it's a 100th episode — a milestone for any series!
Last year, Rick Grimes and his group of survivors is confronted with their deadliest challenge yet. With the comfort of Alexandria, they let their guard down, only to be reminded how brutal the world they live in can be — and the introduction of Negan and the Saviors broke the group.
Feeling powerless under Negan's rules and demands, Rick advocated the group play along. But then seeing that Negan couldn't be reasoned with, Rick began rallying together other communities affected by the Saviors. And with the support of the Hilltop and Kingdom, they finally have enough firepower to contest the Saviors.
This year, Rick brings “All Out War” against Negan and his forces. The Saviors are larger, better equipped, and ruthless — but Rick and the unified communities are fighting for the promise of a brighter future. The battle lines are drawn as they launch into a kinetic, action-packed offensive.
Chennai: Husband of jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala, M Natarajan, died on Tuesday at a corporate hospital in Chennai, an official said.
He was 74.
"It is with profound grief and sorrow that we announce the sad demise of Natarajan Maruthappa at 1.35 am today," an official release issued by Shanmuga Priyan, chief operating officer of Gleneagles Global Health City, said.
Natarajan was admitted to the hospital on Saturday with severe chest infection and was put on ventilator support.
In 2017, he underwent a kidney transplant.
Natarajan's body was later kept at his Besant Nagar residence for people to pay homage.
Sources close to him said that his body will be taken later in the day to his native village in Thanjavur district for the final rites.
However, it was not immediately known when the final rites will be held as the family anticipates a possible parole for Sasikala.
Convicted in the Rs 66.6 crore disproportionate assets case, Sasikala is serving a four year jail term in Bengaluru Parappana Agrahara prison since February last.
She was granted an emergency parole in October last year when Natarajan underwent the kidney transplant.
Natarajan was an avid Tamil activist and was also running a vernacular magazine called 'Puthiya Paarvai'.
He was formerly a Public Relations Officer with the state government.
In 2011, he was one of the family members of Sasikala who were expelled by late chief minister and then AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa from the party.
Though Jayalalithaa expelled Sasikala, her close aide, she later re-inducted her.

Teachers Union of Malawi (TUM) says will hold a national wide strike starting from 9 July.
This has been revealed in a press statement released by the body signed by its general secretary, Charles Kumchenga and the president Willie Malimba.
According to the press statement the decision has been made following meeting the teachers held on 30th June.
The statement says it is sad to note that despite holding several meetings with relevant government authorities, ministry of finance is yet to pay the salary arrears it owes them.
The communication says it is sad to note that teachers are facing a lot of challenges in the country despite a wonderful job they do.
It has however stated that the national strike which will be in form of a sit in will be called off by TUM once government has started processing the money meant for the teachers.
“We should bring to your attention that the national strike shall be in form of a sit in and that it will be called by TUM once government has started processing money for the teachers,” reads TUM statement.
The statement says all primary and secondary teachers from public schools will participate in the national wide strike.
Saint John Common Council is considering what to do about a large number of deer – and the problems that go with it – in one of its residential neighbourhoods.
Parks and Recreation Deputy Commissioner Tim O'Reilly delivered a presentation to council on Monday detailing several of the municipality's options, including the implementation of what is called a nuisance program.
Special permits would be issued to homeowners to allow them to hunt the animals – which would coincide with hunting season.
READ MORE: Rare white deer spotted in New Brunswick
Saint John Deputy Mayor Shirley McAlary thinks there's a lack of solid evidence to warrant such extreme measures.
“Somebody who's an amateur out with a bow and arrow shooting or trying to shoot a deer, if you do that you may not kill the deer, so you're going to leave an arrow in a deer and let it run off in the woods and maybe in five to six days it'll die,” said McAlary.
Ray Crowdis has lived in the Millidgeville area of Saint John for years.
He's taken measures to protect his property from deer, including erecting a fence.
But Crowdis is convinced the number of deer in his neighbourhood has actually dropped. He thinks urban sprawl has a lot to do with why many think the deer population has grown.
“Because we've moved into where the deer used to live,” said Crowdis,
“So we're taking away their territory, so I guess they have a right to come in and eat whatever you plant.”
WATCH: Three deer crash New Brunswick gas station
Before any hunting program is implemented, the city will consult with the public, continue to gather information, and if need be, issue a request to the province to enact the program. A similar program was adopted in the nearby Kennebecasis Valley several years ago.
For now, O'Reilly says first steps include posting road signs in areas where there's a higher volume of deer collisions. He also has advice for residents.
“Feeding deer draws urban deer population in,” he explained. “Having vegetation on your property that deer like to eat is an issue.”
Council will decide whether to move forward with a request for a nuisance program by the end of June.
The Spectacular Zanzibar Amber Resort is Africa's Future Wonder
Set to open its doors by 2020, the Zanzibar Amber Resort aims to be one of the world's most luxurious retreats, an East African wonder spreading across 3,756 acres, with an underwater nightclub, an international school, water parks and superyacht facilities, plus many other goodies that would make this place a real-life paradise.
Designed to be more like a luxurious community, this breathtaking project will be developed by Pennyroyal Gibraltar Limited and it's valued at an astonishing $1.6 billion. The Zanzibar Amber Resort will include not one, not two, but five high-end hotels, promising various levels of elegance and fun for guests of all ages.
Facilities include East Africa's first championship Ernie Els-designed golf course, a deep water marina, a massive aqua park, an underwater restaurant and nightclub, a souk for shopping, an equestrian center, and a special yacht facility that just can't be ignored.
But this is merely the tip of a very cool iceberg. You see, there is also talk about a private airport with a 9,842-foot runway, a medical facility, and even a private international school. I'm not sure if you were thinking about moving in, but now there are some encouragements.
Permanent residences will be available, yes, and 1,914 luxury villas and 3,440 luxury apartments will be on offer with price tags going upwards from $700K.
Ritz Carlton and Anantara confirmed they will be part of the community; speaking of which, the upcoming Ritz Carlton Zanzibar will be an all-suite and villa resort, with 90 lavish suites on offer and several villas boasting private pools. 2020 seems so far away…

Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES®) volunteers in the Maryland-DC Section activated in the wake of regional flash flooding on May 27. Hit especially hard was Ellicott City, where vehicles were reported to have been washed away by fast-moving flood waters upward of 10 feet deep. At least one person was reported to be missing.
“As many watched Alberto, radio amateurs in Maryland watched more and more rain locally,” said ARRL Assistant Maryland-DC Section Manager and Public Information Coordinator Ken Reid, KG4USN.
By 5 PM, heavy rain, as much as 8 to 10 inches, soaked portions of central and southern Maryland.” The flooding disaster was the second since 2016 in historic downtown Ellicott City, which was still recovering from the earlier event. High water also affected Arbutus, Dundalk, and Catonsville. Section leadership asked radio amateurs in the flood-affected areas to check on the health and welfare of their neighbors. Reid said high-water rescues were needed in Perry Hall and Patapsco State Park.
When the flooding quickly became serious in several locations, MDC Section Manager Marty Pittinger, KB3MXM, activated ARES in eight central Maryland counties at 6:30 PM EDT, and 15 minutes later, more than 40 ARES volunteers reported to their respective 2-meter nets in five counties. The majority of flood-affected communities were in Anne Arundel, Prince Georges, and Howard counties. Amateur Radio volunteers in the MDC Section provided additional situational awareness, and Pittinger interfaced with Atlantic Division leadership, Maryland Section Emergency Coordinator Jim Montgomery, WB3KAS, and state and local authorities.
“Many county [emergency operations centers] in affected areas were also activated. Anne Arundel County ARES and Howard County ARES were in communication with their local Emergency Management Agencies and were both told to stand by in case of need,” Reid said. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency.
“Regular situational awareness updates were shared throughout the nets to ensure communication readiness for served agencies, community leadership, neighbors, first responders, and fellow radio amateurs,” Reid said. Conventional telecommunications continued to function throughout the heavy weather, which caused road closures and power and natural gas outages.
The MDC ARES volunteers remained in duty until 10:15 PM on May 28. During the activation, radio amateurs made use of VHF, UHF, and HF capabilities, as well as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) modes.
Miki Sudo downed 37 franks to win her fifth straight title in the women's competition of the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest.
The Las Vegas competitor fell short of the 41 hot dogs she consumed last year but still beat out second-place finisher Michelle Lesco, of Tucson, Arizona. Lesco chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees braved 83-degree temperatures and a heat index of 91 degrees to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.
Ten-time winner Joey "Jaws" Chestnut will confront 20 other men during the men's competition later Wednesday for the coveted Mustard Belt.
Sudo was a fan favorite, drawing big cheers from the crowd during her performance, which was slightly delayed after she requested new water to soak her buns.

Opportunities for Amateur Radio and non-amateur volunteers are available for the 122nd running of the Boston Marathon on Monday, April 16, sponsored by the Boston Athletic Association (BAA). Amateur Radio volunteers are needed for starting line, course, and finish line positions, and non-amateur volunteers are wanted for medical transportation and various other medical and logistical roles. Volunteer registration is open through Wednesday, February 7.
Those interested in volunteering for the 2018 Boston Marathon but unsure if they will be able to participate in April should register now and notify the volunteer coordinators later, if it turns out they will not be able to attend.
“It will be very difficult to bring in volunteers once registration closes, and if you register but can no longer volunteer at the event, please let us know as early as possible so contingency planning can be completed,” the Boston Marathon Amateur Radio Communications Committee has announced.
Amateur Radio volunteers do not need to specify any group name or passcode; just request at least one ham radio assignment of your preference. Volunteers will receive an application confirmation number. Returning volunteers will be asked to provide a BAA Volunteer Loyalty Number, sent by BAA via e-mail in early January.
“Help us get the word out by forwarding this e-mail to your club and other hams who might like to volunteer, and for non-hams to any volunteer groups who might be interested in supporting the event,” the Committee said. “If you know new amateurs or other new people involved in volunteering for events, let them know. Even a quick mention at your club meeting or regular meeting of your organization can be a big help.”
Prospective Amateur Radio volunteers should visit the Boston Marathon - Amateur Radio Communications page or the Boston Marathon Volunteer Registration page for more information.
“Volunteering at the Marathon is a big job, and we appreciate the time and effort everyone puts into it,” the Committee said. “We're happy to do what we can to make your work more comfortable or effective.” — Thanks to Matthew Forman, K6MCF, and Rob Macedo, KD1CY, of the Boston Marathon Amateur Radio Communications Committee

I shouldn't have to shut up just because I'm 'male, pale and stale'
ROBERT KITCHIN/STUFF Karl du Fresne: As an older, white male, I, and others like me, now find we're expected to shut up.
OPINION: I am writing this column as a member of a despised minority. I will be 68 next birthday. I'm fair of skin and male of sex.
To put it another way, in the language of "progressive" millennials and people who, with no sense of irony, describe themselves as liberals, I'm male, pale and stale.
There is no more crushing condemnation in the 21st century political lexicon. To be male, pale and stale is to be racist, sexist, bitter and selfish. Don Brash and Sir Bob Jones are prime examples of this wretched form of humanity. I am too, albeit of a lower order of celebrity.
supplied Ageing white males are considered fair game because we're seen as having enjoyed privilege for too long, says du Fresne.
It goes without saying that I can't help being old. I can no more control the ageing process than I could dance the prima ballerina's role in Swan Lake. Neither did I have any say over my ethnicity or sex.

Perhaps if I'd been born six decades later I might have been encouraged to decide for myself what gender I wanted to assume and to alter my sexual identity at will, regardless of physiology. But I've been a bloke all my life and it's a bit hard to reinvent myself at this point in my life cycle.
Having said that, I've been happy being a male and never felt any desire to have it any other way. Nor have I felt ashamed about it, which is not to say I'm not regularly appalled by the behaviour of some of my fellow blokes.
Moreover, I don't hate or fear women and have never felt that I was in competition with them, still less perceived them as a threat. So I'm not sure that I deserve the implied accusation that men like me are by definition misogynistic.
The women who have been closest to me throughout my life have been stroppy and strong-willed. If I preferred women to be submissive, I've been either desperately unlucky or spectacularly unwise.
But never mind all that. I'm stuck with being a bloke, just as I'm stuck with my skin colour and my inexorably advancing age. Yet I, and others like me, now find ourselves regularly being pilloried for having the temerity to express an opinion about things. It seems we're expected to shut up.
Let's unpick that phrase "male, pale and stale". The first thing you notice is that it explicitly criticises people on the basis of their skin colour.
Ah, but that's okay, because we're white. And as I heard a moronic talkback host assert recently, only minority groups – i.e. non-whites – can be subject to racism.
You can forget all that warm, inclusive talk on the Left about celebrating diversity. The embrace of diversity mysteriously stops short of ageing white blokes. We're the one demographic cohort against whom it's permissible – in fact fashionable – to display undisguised and often venomous bigotry.
In any other context, attacking people on the basis of their age, sex and skin colour would be labelled a hate crime, but no-one should expect the Human Rights Commission to take up our cause.
Being white and male, we are seen as being in a position of power and therefore unscathed by discrimination and immune to insult. And if we are discriminated against, we're expected to suck it up because … well, because we deserve it.
Ageing white males are considered fair game because we're seen as having enjoyed privilege for too long. Now the tables have turned and we're expected to pay the penalty by keeping our supposedly rancid opinions to ourselves.
This treats freedom of expression as a zero-sum game where one person's right to speak can only be achieved by silencing someone else. But that's not how free speech works.
In any case, if white males dominated newspaper opinion columns in past decades, as has been alleged, then any imbalance has been more than redressed. The media today is awash with comment that uncritically embraces the "progressive" agenda (there's another word that's used with no sense of irony) and sneers at anyone who stands in its path.
Am I pleading for sympathy here? Not a bit. We curmudgeonly tuataras can look after ourselves. All I'm doing is highlighting the double standards of social justice warriors who shriek with outrage at any perceived slight against a favoured minority group, but pile in for the attack when it's an old white bloke who's on the ground getting kicked.
One last thought. Today's angry social justice warrior has a funny way of turning into tomorrow's crusty reactionary.
One day the people who rant about ageing white men will themselves become old, and they can't discount the hideous possibility that they too will morph into conservative dinosaurs, because by then they might have learned a few things about life, politics and the human condition.

LOVE her or loathe her, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is known for keeping her cool while copping a grilling from the world's toughest journalists.
But this week, a powerful question from a 13-year-old finally broke her.
During Ms Sanders' regular press briefing, she took a question from teenage student and budding reporter Benje Choucroun, who was covering the event for Time for Kids.
The Californian student took the opportunity to question Ms Sanders about America's appalling gun violence track record.
"At my school, we recently had a lockdown drill," the boy began. "One thing that affects mine and other students' mental health is the worry about the fact that we or our friends could get shot at school.
"Specifically, can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?"
The mother-of-three was visibly rattled by the question.

In a video recording of the briefing, Ms Sanders is seen choking back tears with a shaking voice as she attempted to answer the question.
TFK Kid Reporter Benje Choucroun visited the @WhiteHouse today. Watch as he asks Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) an important question. https://t.co/OwIHgVivUr — TIME For Kids (@timeforkids) May 30, 2018
"I think that as a kid, and certainly as a parent, there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe. So I'm sorry that you feel that way," she replied.
"This administration takes it seriously. And the School Safety Commission that the President convened is meeting this week, again, an official meeting to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off."
Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal took to Twitter to praise his young reporter, posting that he was proud the magazine "has a deep bench".
Proud today that @time has a deep bench. Great question from TFK kid reporter Benje Choucroun. https://t.co/sZI3Ox7VoT — Edward Felsenthal (@efelsenthal) May 30, 2018
But while the Marin Country Day School student was showered with praise by other Twitter users, many accused Ms Sanders of using "crocodile tears" to evade the question.
"So she does have a heart … wow …" one person posted, while another added: "Amazing what they've done to make the robot tears look realistic".
She cries tears just like a real girl. Still, through all that emotion, all that comes out of her mouth is bullshit. She didn't even answer the kid's question. #SarahSanders #CrocodileTears. https://t.co/adf1rZA8KJ — ¿How Deep Is Your State? (@memii_social) May 30, 2018
It has been a horror year for gun violence in the US, with more than 100 mass shootings taking place in the troubled country this year alone, according to the non-profit Gun Violence Archive.
And according to CNN, there has been more than one school shooting per week on average in 2018.
Earlier this month, two teachers and eight students were killed when 17-year-old gunman Dimitrios Pagourtzis opened fire at Santa Fe High School in Texas.
And on Valentine's Day, 17 students and teachers were killed and a further 17 were wounded following a massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Many teenage survivors of that attack spoke out publicly on the need for stricter gun control, making household names of activists including David Hogg and Emma González and inspiring nationwide protests.
Mornings for recent chemical engineering graduate Stephen Situ consist of a bowl of cereal and a search through job boards before he starts driving for Uber Technologies Inc. at lunch.
Situ, like many in his under-25 age bracket, hasn't found regular, full-time employment since graduating from the University of Calgary two years ago, except for a few months doing door-to-door internet sales for Telus Corp. and some construction labour in various parts of northern Alberta.
“I lost hope, but I started to see the bigger picture. This is life and sometimes it doesn't work out,” said the 24-year-old, who estimates he has sent out more than 1,000 resumés. He said he's also had a difficult time finding jobs in other sectors as well.
Indeed, young Albertan men are the only demographic whose employment numbers have continued to fall — and sharply at that — while employment levels for older men and women of all ages have almost recovered to pre-recession levels.
Put simply, Situ and other young men have not participated in Alberta's economic recovery.
Statistics Canada data show 67 per cent of males between 15 and 24 were employed in the fall of 2014 when Alberta's brutal, years-long recession began. Today, 55 per cent of them are employed, a 12-percentage-point decline even though real GDP grew 4.5 per cent in 2017.
Similarly, Alberta's unemployment rate for males aged 15 to 24 was 14.6 per cent in March, which starkly contrasts with the province's overall unemployment rate, which fell to a three-year-low of 6.3 per cent.
It's not for lack of trying. Situ rattles off a long list when asked what he's done to improve his job prospects: He's been to career coaches and placement agencies, reworked his resumé, and widened his search to include all of Western Canada.
“I have a network, but it's mostly unemployed people,” Situ said. “I have friends that went to graduate school and they're still unemployed.”
In 2014, the U of C's post-graduation employment rate for chemical engineers was 87 per cent. That fell to 41 per cent in 2015 and rose slightly to 43 per cent the following year. Most other engineering disciplines had similar declines, other than software engineering.
University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe estimated that overall employment in the province is still 40,000 jobs below pre-recession levels. He said the drop-in employment for young men is equivalent to 30,000 jobs, which represents 75 per cent of the province's yet-to-be-recovered jobs.
“It is so stark,” he said, calling the phenomenon a “male-dominated recession.”
Data specific to the province's energy sector corroborate that the recession, which has resulted in a net loss of 29,800 oil and gas jobs in Alberta since 2014, hit younger workers particularly hard.
“We have a seen a decline in the younger workforce,” said Carol Howes, vice-president of Petroleum Labour Market Information, a division of Energy Safety Canada.

“We have a seen a decline in the younger workforce,” said Carol Howes, vice-president of Petroleum Labour Market Information, a division of Energy Safety Canada.
The organization's data show that 24,674 people aged 15 to 24 worked in the Canadian oil and gas sector in 2006, accounting for 15 per cent of the total workforce. In 2016, the last year for which data is available, that had fallen to 12,497 people, which accounts for just seven per cent of the sector.
Howes said there are a few factors that have hurt younger workers. Most notably, many companies use a “last in, first out” approach to layoffs and they are also looking to retain experience as they cut jobs, which has eliminated positions for fresh graduates and stunted the careers for people just getting established.
Erik Nyman, an out-of-work journeyman electrician, was a general foreman in his mid-20s at a thermal oilsands project when he was laid off in December 2015.
Since then, he's gone back to school at Mount Royal University in Calgary to upgrade his skills — obtaining a project management certification and doing courses toward a Blue Seal apprenticeship certification — worked with career coaches and placement agencies, and lost count of how many custom-tailored résumés he's sent out.

Father John Misty – "Leaving LA" [Official Music Video]

From Pure Comedy, out now on Sub Pop.
I know I know, a thirteen-minute hymn to your own hyper-awareness (a “10 verse chorus-less diatribe”) is self-indulgent horseshit. It's impossible to argue with that.
And yet…
Try to forget for a sec what a bloated self-righteous asshole Josh Tillman has become, and just listen to the song. Listen to the string arrangement by Gavin Bryars and think of “Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me” or “The Sinking of the Titanic” and just listen.
“Leaving LA” is arranged, performed, and recorded perfectly. It sounds great. It's a beautiful song even if the sentiment is bitter.
Tillman claims to assume this song will cost him some fans. The “teenage rosebuds” and “college dudes” will “all jump ship” and think, “I used to like this guy but this new shit makes me want to die.” I dunno. Maybe. I'm a couple decades past being a college dude, and I'll admit I prefer the manic hedonism of Fear Fun over the grumpy cynicism and misanthropy of the more recent stuff, but I'm guessing his core fanbase knows exactly what they're getting into.
What I find fascinating about Father John Misty in general and this song in particular is Tillman's quest to find some kind of balance between his onstage persona and his true self. I don't think that's a put on. I believe him. I think he honestly struggles with this dichotomy. Maybe everybody in showbiz does, but Tillman is unusually open about it.
A couple of lines illustrate this. Take a look at this couplet:
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
Think about that. You'd think that if he's closing the gap between the mask (Father John Misty, the demonic clown character) and his real self (Josh Tillman), then he'd be becoming more human, not less. So is the mask more human, more real? Or is he losing himself and becoming more like his persona?
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling's getting bought
At some point you can't control
What people use your fake name for
It seems like Tillman is embarrassed of anybody who buys into his shtick. But at this point there's nothing he can do about it.
Josh Tillman is a phony. But on the other hand he isn't a phony because he's a real phony. He believes all this crap he believes.
It's easy to dismiss him as just “another white guy in 2017 who takes himself so goddamn seriously” and he's acutely aware of that (obviously), but there's a lot more to it than that. And since defining an agreed upon reality has become the fundamental issue of 2017, Father John Misty is an important artist for our time and his songs reflect our long national nightmare better than anybody.

“Silicon Valley's” season five won't only be the “most different season we've had so far,” teased star Kumail Nanjiani, but will also address one of Hollywood's biggest headlines — gender equality and the treatment of women.
While Nanjiani said the show wouldn't directly address the #MeToo movement, he told Variety at the Paley Center for Media's PaleyFest panel in Los Angeles, Calif. on Sunday, “there is a plot that goes over a couple of episodes later in the season that does talk about that movement, not directly, but what that movement is about is definitely tackled.”
Co-star Zach Woods added, “It's hopefully not too on the nose, but that informs some of the plots in the middle of the season.”
The show, which centers around four guys creating a startup in the tech industry, has long been criticized for it's lack of female characters and roles for women, which star Thomas Middleditch said was intended to mirror the gender breakdown of the real Silicon Valley. “The creators, their response has always been that their objective is to accurately portray it and that's kind of what it is,” he said. “Hopefully that's something that will change, but not something for the show to do.”
During the panel, the cast of the show, along with executive producers Mike Judge and Alec Berg, also discussed what may be season five's biggest change, the absence of T.J. Miller's Erlich Bachman, who was written off the show at the end of season four. Berg compared it to the difficulty of redirecting the show when Christopher Evan Welch, who played Peter Gregory, died following season one of the show.
“We had this central character that we were not going to have on the show anymore, so we had kind of been through it before, so we knew going in ‘Okay, this is a surmountable challenge. It's not going to be fun and it's going to be difficult,'” Berg said during the panel. “Also, the Erlich character was getting harder and harder to write him into the show because he wasn't someone who worked at the company, he was their past investor and their landlord and we started doing stories about how he was feeling marginalized and he wasn't really one of the gang and what he was doing about that.”
The producer added that this issue was becoming even more pressing in season five, when the startup was moving out of Erlich's house and into an office space. “It was at a point where it was going to be really hard to find an organic way to get the Erlich character into the show anyway, so from that standpoint it was kind of time. And then T.J., for a number of reasons, just decided that his time had come and gone and he wanted to move on, so we had the narrative challenge to keep him in the show and then it became ‘OK well, maybe it's just time to not have him on the show,'” Berg said.
During the panel for the new season, which will follow the Pied Piper gang as they get their first taste of tech success, the cast also discussed Amanda Crew‘s role as one of the only women on the show, yet the decision for her not to have a romantic relationship with any of the male leads. Crew joked that before looking at new scripts she thinks ,”If there is a f—ing love scene I'm out.”
While there have been rumors that season five will be “Silicon Valley's” last, Judge hinted there could be more. “Looking at these episodes, it kind of takes on a new life, kind of second wind,” he stated. “I think it could go on for a while, you never know.”
“Silicon Valley” season 5 premieres March 25 on HBO.
QUEENSLAND Nationals MP George Christensen says he'll await the outcome of a new manoeuvre in the Queensland parliament to try and break the protracted deadlock between Wilmar and Queensland Sugar Limited (QSL) but remains committed to forging ahead with a federal industry code of conduct, to resolve the impasse.
Yesterday, the LNP in Queensland put Wilmar and QSL on a 48 hour time-limit to reach an agreement to agree to resolve their long-running dispute, by February 28.
The state's LNP Leader Tim Nicholls said if the agreement wasn't reached or the dispute remained unresolved by February 28, the LNP would act and amend the state's Sugar Industry Act.
“Everyone in the industry is sick to death to this and it needs to end,” he said.
“Both parties need to grow up, bury their egos and sort this out, otherwise growers will lose out.
“Wilmar and QSL need to provide an iron-clad guarantee within 48 hours that negotiations will be finalised for supply and on-supply agreements by February 28.
“If not, then the LNP will introduce amendments to State Parliament compelling millers and marketers to go into arbitration.”
Today, Mr Christensen said he still backed a mandatory industry code of conduct with penalties, which resulted from a taskforce established to examine the issue and recommended in a Federal Senate inquiry that tabled a report in June 2015.
But he said he'd wait and see what the outcome was of the 48 hour notice, given to Wilmar and QSL to resolve their disagreements, by the Queensland LNP, which could force the two parties into arbitration.
He also remains in ongoing talks about the issue with senior Coalition cabinet members including Treasurer Scott Morrison and Agriculture and Water Resources Minister Barnaby Joyce.
“Under any circumstances a mandatory code of conduct is still warranted and is still critical,” he said.
“I'm going to support what the Queensland LNP need to do to resolve this issue and to get these amendments through to force arbitration between Wilmar and QSL but will keep a very close eye on what's happening.”
But Mr Christensen said any hiccups in the negotiations, like the Queensland Labor party calling an election – that's due to be held this year – in the next few weeks, or if the amendments “fell over” in parliament, would bring the federal move of a mandatory code of conduct into play.
“There's a myriad of things that could go wrong,” he said.
“I've stepped back from the federal legislation of a mandatory code of conduct for now just to wait and see what the state outcome is but will be keeping a watching eye over proceedings.”
CANEGROWERS is urged QSL to commit to negotiate their way past their current impasse on a crucial sugar marketing contract.
CANEGROWERS Chairman Paul Schembri said an on-supply agreement was needed, so growers can finalise cane supply agreements (CSA) with the miller for the 2017 season.
“But time is running out - the season will start in around 16 weeks and 1500 farmers are in limbo with the economic future of their businesses at risk,” he said.
He said the Queensland Sugar Industry Act had to be amended in December 2015 to prevent millers from creating regional sugar marketing monopolies, to secure choice for growers and competition in the provision of marketing services.
“Since then, six of the seven sugar milling companies operating in Queensland have negotiated commercial agreements with growers and QSL which allow the 2017 season to proceed,” he said.
“Only Wilmar has been unable to do this.
“Frustration and anxiety levels are sky high in the four cane growing regions where Wilmar owns mills but our growers are determined to stand together.
“They want nothing less than a CSA which guarantees the marketing choice they are entitled to under the legislation.”
Earlier this week, Mr Christensen said he described Wilmar's actions in April 2014 to announce it would depart from the traditional QSL marketing arrangements as a “bastard act” and still does.
“They came to this country saying that they would not change the marketing arrangements and yet a few years later they did and you could not help but forgive growers for thinking this was their intention all along,” he said.
Mr Christensen said the dispute also remained “highly fluid” in Canberra this week as the two factions sought to reach agreement on an on-supply agreements so farmers can have choice on who markets their sugar.
But he also said he'd explore “other options”, including crossing the floor to vote against his party, unless a code of conduct was announced, to enforce the sugar industry's protection from Wilmar.
His deadline is February 28 for an on-supply agreement to be reached between Wilmar and QSL - after which point growers will be unable to lock in world record sugar prices on forward contracts.
Mr Christensen said he was writing to his own government - including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Morrison and his party leader and Deputy Prime Mr Joyce - outlining his hard-line demands.
“The Deputy Prime Minister already knows this but if Wilmar have not reached that on-supply agreement by February 28, I'm asking the federal government, at the close of business March 1, to have announced that they're going to proceed with a mandatory code of conduct for the sugar industry, that has a range of penalties in place,” he said.
“If we don't go ahead and offer a hand to these people, not only will there be turmoil for them but there will also be turmoil politically because this issue will bite us; not just on the state scene but also the federal scene.”
Mr Christensen said resolving the ongoing sugar marketing issue satisfactorily was “crucial” to his political future.
“I'll go so far as to say that if there's one thing that I want to have delivered in my political career, it is this code of conduct, if indeed Wilmar don't do the deal with QSL,” he said.
“I'm not going to make threats – and other newspapers have speculated – but all I'll say is this.
“If the government says ‘no' then I'll explore other options to get a code of conduct.”
Asked what the options were that he'd be exploring, Mr Christensen said “there's a myriad of other options to force the government's hand on this”.
“They need to know that's the reality and that I want this so much, that I'll do whatever it takes to get it,” he said.
Asked whether he would cross the floor Mr Christensen he said, “if that's what it takes to get it”.
“I hope that they'll see sense and just do it,” he said.
Mr Joyce has also recently indicated he was prepared to implement an industry code to resolve the sugar marketing dispute - as he'd done for managing access to wheat ports - and the drafting process could see only growers allowed to make representations.
The story Christensen to monitor state ploy on sugar marketing dispute first appeared on Farm Weekly.
A 15-year-old Calgary high school student with a love for coding things like robots and phone apps has earned himself an invitation to a major event in SiliconValley next week.
Aiden Olfert was one of 350 people selected to attend Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).
He was recognized with a scholarship to go after developing an educational math app that helps students with times tables. He's also working on a new app right now that's an activity tracker, which he plans to release later this year.
Olfert said he can't wait for some one-on-one coaching with Apple engineers at the gathering.
“It's really big. I've been wanting to go to WWDC for a long time now. I've been watching the keynote basically every year since I was nine,” Aiden said.
Olfert will also get the first look at some of Apple's new software.
The coach of Olfert's school robotics team said it's amazing that he's become so good at coding at such a young age.​

GUJRANWALA: Spark from a Gepco power line reduced standing wheat crop over 100 acres of land to ashes in village Dera Noor Alam here. The affected farmers alleged that the fire erupted due to a spark from the 11 KV electricity transmission line, passing over the fields. They alleged that this is fourth incident of crops burning which have cost them millions of rupees losses. They said that they will get registered FIR against Gepco officers for their negligence.
NASA has revealed how it plans to bring back Martian samples to Earth for the first time with the help of its next rover mission to the Red Planet, Mars 2020.
After landing on Mars, a drill will capture rock cores, while a caching system with a miniature robotic arm will seal up these samples. Then, they will be deposited on the Martian surface for possible pickup by a future mission, NASA said.
"Whether life ever existed beyond Earth is one of the grand questions humans seek to answer," said Ken Farley of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
"What we learn from the samples collected during this mission has the potential to address whether we're alone in the universe," Farley said.
Mars 2020 relies heavily on the system designs and spare hardware previously created for Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover, which landed in 2012.
Despite its similarities to Mars Science Laboratory, the new mission has very different goals, it will seek signs of ancient life by studying the terrain that is now inhospitable, but once held flowing rivers and lakes, more than 3.5 billion years ago.
To achieve these new goals, the rover has a suite of cutting-edge science instruments.
It will seek out biosignatures on a microbial scale.
An X-ray spectrometer will target spots as small as a grain of table salt, while an ultraviolet laser will detect the "glow" from excited rings of carbon atoms.
A ground-penetrating radar will look under the surface of Mars, mapping layers of rock, water and ice up to 10 metres deep, depending on the material.
The rover is getting some upgraded Curiosity hardware, including colour cameras, a zoom lens and a laser that can vaporise rocks and soil to analyse their chemistry, NASA said.
The mission will also undertake a marathon sample hunt.
The rover team will try to drill at least 20 rock cores, and possibly as many as 30 or 40, for possible future return to Earth, NASA said.
Site selection has been another milestone for the mission. In February, the science community narrowed the list of potential landing sites from eight to three.
All three sites have rich geology and may potentially harbour signs of past microbial life. But a final landing site decision is still more than a year away.
"In the coming years, the 2020 science team will be weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each of these sites," Farley said.
"It is by far the most important decision we have ahead of us," Farley said.
The mission is set to launch in July/August 2020.
One day after CEO Bob Bakish announced his new strategic plan for Viacom, Comedy Central's Kent Alterman — one of Bakish's highest ranking employees — announced a new structure for the talent and development teams at the cable channel he oversees as president. Alterman obviously timed his announcement to pivot off of his boss's, right?
“I'd like to say that I'm that thoughtful that I could plan things,” Alterman said. “It just kind of came together this way.”
Alterman is closing in on his one-year mark as president of Comedy Central. It's been quite a year. Viacom has been roiled by turmoil, with longtime chairman Sumner Redstone's daughter Shari Redstone seizing control of the company, forcing out CEO Philippe Dauman, flirting with merging the company with CBS, then backing off from that prospect and appointing longtime Viacom international TV executive Bakish CEO. Alterman's boss Doug Herzog, who facilitated Alterman's ascension to network chief, departed Viacom amid the churn.
But looking ahead, Alterman has reason to be optimistic. Rolling out his new Viacom strategy last week, Bakish identified Comedy Central as one of six core brands that would be the foundation of his rebuilding effort. And despite his admonition last week that “leadership needs to be held accountable,” Alterman, MTV and VH1 president Chris McCarthy, and TV Land, CMT, and Spike chief Kevin Kay are believed right now to have Bakish's confidence.
Alterman, meanwhile, is plowing ahead. “Knowing that Bob has expressed a direct commitment to the value and importance of Comedy Central as a flagship brand and knowing what comes with that with more resource and support and so on, that's great, because that just enhances what we've already been doing,” he told Variety. On Friday, he named two of top lieutenants, Sarah Babineau and Jonas Larsen, to lead talent and development, filling the void created by his promotion last year. “On some level, not that much will change,” he added. “We're still going to be doing the same things that we've been doing in terms of identifying and nurturing and developing and launching comedy talent, and that continues.”
What is likely to change in the coming year is Comedy Central's relationship to Paramount. Bakish said last week that he envisions a close relationship between the movie studio and its cable cousins, one that will eventually yield collaborations on several feature-film releases a year.
“The idea is not for Paramount just to make a comedy movie of their own accord and then slap our logo on it,” Alterman said. Details — such as whether Comedy Central will form a feature-film development unit within the network — have yet to be sorted out. “This has mostly been moving forward I think at a 40,000 foot macro level. It's starting to formulate now how it's going to be executed. But what has been expressed is that it's going to be real and tangible and kind of two-way street.”
Speaking with Variety last week, Bakish said, “We've had a lot of talent in the past that we've groomed and then let them off to do films elsewhere. We're going to try to stop having that happen.” It's a safe bet that much of the talent Bakish was talking about comes from Comedy Central, which has seen the likes of Amy Schumer and Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele branch out beyond their network platforms.
Alterman said that Paramount will be a carrot, not a stick when dealing with talent. “I don't think we're going to be moving forward in an indentured servitude kind of way,” he joked when asked whether Comedy Central talent would be locked into more restrictive deals. “I think that it's more that we're actually going to have something that is going to be enormously appealing to talent. I only see it as a positive thing, not as a leverage thing.”
Another positive is what Alterman sees in his flagship late-night franchise, “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.” After a rocky start in 2015 and steep ratings declines, Noah has seen his numbers climb — although not yet to the heights enjoyed by his predecessor Jon Stewart. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the show averaged its highest 18-49 rating yet under Noah, with those numbers continuing to rise in January.
“He just continues to keep really having a strong point of view and his voice is coming through, and he has really shown that he has an original, unique voice, and very relevant and strong voice,” Alterman said. He added that the network still has not settled on a permanent solution for the 11:30 p.m. post-“Daily Show” timeslot, which has been occupied by “@midnight” since “The Nightly Show” was canceled last year. But finding a long-term fixture there “is definitely a priority for this year.”
Another priority: Continuing to look to digital as a developing ground for talent and projects, as the network did with “Broad City” and “Workaholics” as well as the more recent “Idiotsitter” and the upcoming “Hood Adjacent.”
And although Alterman is planning no intentional pivot toward politics, the rolling drama of the Trump presidency is already informing development.
“We definitely are getting lots of pitches that seem to be driven by our current presidential situation,” Alterman said. “We're not going to do anything just for the sake of it. But of course, the best comedy as it is reacting to what's going on in the world.”
He added, “When things are heightened, of course, the cream of the crop in the comedy world are going to be the ones that step up and do it in really profound and strong ways.”

Photos released of suspects in Polo Ralph Lauren theft
Two people are accused of stealing clothing from a Polo Ralph Lauren outlet store in Estero.
According to detectives, two female suspects, one of whom may be a male, walked into the Polo Ralph Lauren store at Miromar Outlets shortly after 5 p.m. on June 11th.
LCSO said, six minutes later, both individuals exited the store with large tote bags. As they walked out, the security alarm was triggered, prompting both individuals to walk quickly away from the area before anyone could catch up with them.
When managers reviewed the store's surveillance video, both suspects were seen loading their bags with clothing from the store, and several employees recognized the two from prior thefts at the store.
Anyone with information on the identities and whereabouts of the two unidentified suspects is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS (8477).
All callers will remain anonymous and will be eligible for a cash reward of up to $3,000. Tips may also be made online at www.southwestfloridacrimestoppers.com or by submitting a tip on the P3Tips mobile app.

Apple overtook Samsung in the fourth quarter as the largest smartphone producer in a declining global market for handsets, research firm IDC said Friday.
A survey by IDC showed Apple -- which reported its quarterly data Thursday -- led all vendors with 77.3 million iPhones sold, giving it a 19.2 percent market share.
Even though Apple's fourth-quarter unit sales were down 1.3 percent from a year earlier, it was able to move ahead of South Korea's Samsung, whose 74.1 million devices sold gave it a market share of 18.4 percent, IDC said.
Huawei held the number three position with a 10.2 percent market share, followed by fellow Chinese makers Xiaomi and Oppo, with 7.0 and 6.8 percent, respectively, according to IDC.
Overall smartphone sales were down 6.3 percent with 403.5 million handsets shipped, according to the survey.
IDC said the data showed consumers appeared in no rush to upgrade to the most expensive flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung.
"The latest flock of posh flagships may have had consumers hitting the pause button in the holiday quarter," said Anthony Scarsella, an IDC research manager.
Scarsella said these high-end devices "proved to be more of a luxury than a necessity among upgraders."
IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said that as the top brands expanded their offerings, "brands outside the top five struggled to maintain momentum."
Samsung, which reported a 4.4 percent decline in the fourth quarter, remained the top smartphone vendor for the full year with a 21.6 percent market share, to Apple's 14.7 percent, IDC said.
Overall smartphone sales for 2017 were virtually flat -- down 0.1 percent at 1.47 billion units, the report said.
Huawei's share for 2017 was 10.4 percent, followed by Oppo (7.6 percent) and Xiaomi (6.3 percent), IDC said.
Huawei has been seeking to grow its market share but faced a recent setback by failing to strike deals with US carriers, following concerns voiced in Washington over the Chinese maker's ties to the Beijing government.
A separate survey from Strategy Analytics found similar market share for smartphone vendors but found a nine percent drop in fourth-quarter sales, described as the largest decline in the smartphone era.
"The shrinkage in global smartphone shipments was caused by a collapse in the huge China market, where demand fell 16 percent annually due to longer replacement rates, fewer operator subsidies and a general lack of wow models," said Linda Sui of Strategy Analytics.

Injured Moore set to miss Ar Mad Ascot ride
JOSH MOORE will miss the ride on Ar Mad in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot later this month after a fall on Boxing Day left him with a dislocated shoulder.
The 25-year-old was injured when his mount, 20-1 chance Torhousemuir, fell at the seventh in a novice hurdle at Huntingdon.
Moore, who was stood down by the doctor after his fall, is facing a "couple of months" on the sidelines after subsequently seeing a shoulder specialist.
His father Gary said: "Josh has a serious enough injury and will be out for a good while I would imagine.
"He dislocated his shoulder in the fall and has his arm is in a harness which the specialist said would help him recover. It's certainly not the way he wants to be starting the New Year but hopefully he won't be out for too long.
"The immediate plan would be for Jamie [Moore, brother] to ride Ar Mad at Ascot where we are aiming to run him in the Clarence House on January 21."
Moore, who broke his collarbone when Sire De Grugy fell in the Melling Chase at Aintree in 2015, celebrated his biggest win to date when Ar Mad won the Grade 1 Henry VIII Chase at Sandown later the same year.
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's tourism agency has hit back at lifestyle magazine Time Out for ranking the wealthy city state among the world's least exciting cities, by releasing a video that mockingly declares, “There is nothing exciting to do.”
The magazine's City Life Index 2018, published this week, ranked Singapore 31st out of 32 cities, one spot above Istanbul, based on a survey of more than 15,000 people.
Chicago topped the index, followed by Porto in Portugal and New York City, scored on factors such as food, drink, culture, friendliness, affordability, happiness and liveability.
Singapore won praise for safety and public transport, but was rated the lowest for its arts and culture scene, with just 17 percent of respondents saying, “There is always something to see and do.”
In response, the Singapore Tourism Board posted a 56-second video on its Facebook page, opening with the tongue-in-cheek claim, "Singapore is boring ... there is nothing exciting to do." (here)
The message backdrop features Universal Studios Singapore, the Formula One race, and the city's Artscience Museum, as well as a newly-opened A J Hackett bungy jump at Sentosa island.
“Yeah, Time Out London, we're pretty ‘unexciting',” it continues, turning the spotlight to Singapore's delicacies, including a S$2 ($1.52) Michelin-star soy sauce chicken meal at a Chinatown food stall with the caption, “Everything is so expensive.”
Terrence Voon, the Singapore Tourism Board's digital and content director, said, “We created this light-hearted response to let the audience have a glimpse of what Singapore can offer.”
It is not the first time the tourism board has rebuffed what it regards as misconceptions of the island.
Last April, it posted photographs debunking geographical and factual inaccuracies in an episode of CBS's “Criminal Minds”, which referred to Singapore's “red light” district of Geylang as the “dark side of paradise”.
GRANITE CITY — Marquis Shaw entered the Granite City High School conference room on May 9 and saw a large group of people.
“I thought I was in trouble,” the GCHS senior said.
But he wasn't in trouble. Instead, he received an early graduation present — a free yearbook from former Granite City School Board member and teacher Ron Dillard and the GCHS yearbook staff.
Dillard bought yearbooks to 12 GCHS seniors. Shaw was the last senior to receive one.
“All of my years (in high school), I have never bought a yearbook,” said Shaw, who plans to attend Lincoln College next year. “I always looked at my friends because I never had planned on having one. It feels really good having my own yearbook in my senior year.”
All of the other seniors — Kariem Ali, Hannah Barnett, Brandon Bettag, Fatima Bucio, Torrey Deal, Chaz Haller, Matt Hunsinger, Addaya Moore, Cole Phelps, Anthony Stasiak and Kendrick Williba — received their yearbooks the week before.
“We focused on a kid who really would love to have one, but may not have the means to get one on their own,” said Amber Baileygaines, the yearbook's adviser. “We tried to go that route if we can, but we don't always privy out that information. Some teachers know some students better than others and that's how they get put into the bucket, so to speak.”
Dillard, now a commissioner for the Granite City Park District, was a teacher in the Granite City School District for 30 years and served as a member of the Granite City School Board for 24.
Dillard has been donating yearbooks to GCHS seniors since 2013.
“(From 2011-2012) I just gave one monetary scholarship and Adrienne Johnson was the coordinator of scholarships in two years,” he said. “After 2012, I said I couldn't do it anymore. It's so hard to pick one student out of maybe 10 to 12 applicants. So I sat down with her after we discussed this and I said, ‘What if I buy some yearbooks and distribute yearbooks to seniors?”
To receive a free yearbook, a student must be a senior. Dillard said administrators and staff members select the students.
“The two years Karen Greenwald took care of the yearbooks, they gave the names to her,” he said. “Then, Amber Baileygaines took over for the last three years and it was the same situation. The names were given to her.”
The donations were made in memory of Dillard's wife, Jackie, and his late son, Tim. Jackie and Tim passed away in 2003 and 2008, respectively.
“I enjoyed it for sure because I came into the program (in 2014) and I didn't know anything about it until Mr. Dillard contacted me three years ago, and it's been very enjoyable as well,” said Baileygaines, yearbook adviser since 2014.
Dillard said he's been getting praise from teachers for his donations.
“Last year, (GCHS math teacher) Tim Wilson emailed me about a student coming back and walking into his classroom and yelping about his new yearbook,” he said. “It's all been worthwhile.”
Seth Allen, Tori Brooksher, Megan Burge, Lily Burke, Kelsi Coats, Haley Crider, Skylar Dippel, A'tyanna Dixon, Baylee Dochwat, Robyn Pointer, Haley Walker, and Traonna Ward are among the staff members who created this year's edition of the Warrior, titled “You Are Here.” Dochwat is the senior editor and Crider is the co-editor.
“We always like making the yearbook,” Dochwat said. “We always want people get what we create because we work so hard on it for them. Being able to have it makes it more worthwhile.”
Dillard said the students are always thrilled when they receive a free yearbook.
“I noticed (on May 2) when we gave the senior class a yearbook, I look down a table and everyone of them had their yearbooks open and were looking through the yearbooks,” he said. “It's the satisfaction down the road that these students have something to remember.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan deleted a tweet on Saturday cheering a $1.50 increase to a Pennsylvania school secretary's weekly pay because of a $1.5 trillion tax cut after it drew criticism that he was out of touch with ordinary Americans.
Ryan's tweet had linked an Associated Press story on Americans reaping the benefits of the tax cut. The story cited as an example, Julia Ketchum, a secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, who said she was “pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week.”
“A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week ... she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year,” Ryan tweeted.
Ryan's office was not immediately available to comment over the weekend.
The Trump administration and Republicans have cast the massive tax cuts, which came into effect in January as creating jobs and boosting economic growth. But critics have argued that they benefited the rich and would blow up the national debt.
Some social media users accused Ryan of being out of touch, with California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom posting on Twitter that “Guess someone told Paul Ryan you shouldn't go around praising yourself for giving a working person an extra $1.50 a week — because he deleted this tweet.”
House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also criticized Ryan's tweet.
“Paul Ryan deleted his embarrassing tweet of a blatant admission because he and Republicans don't want you to know the truth: the #GOPTaxScam is a gift to corporate America and the top 1% at your expense,” Pelosi tweeted.

Tech initiative Armut, which has transformed Turkey's professional services marketplace, is looking to use the tremendous growth at home last year to expand its businesses overseas.
Armut, the brainchild of former Turkish expats in the U.S., Başak Taşpınar Değim, and Erol Değim, is an online marketplace for professional services like home painting, carpentry, and plumbing.
Last year the startup saw substantial growth as it expanded its businesses to six countries under three different brands. Overall, it achieved a 72 percent growth and was Turkey's second fastest growing technology company.
HomeRun Brand in world
Armut operates under the brand "HomeRun" in the U.S., the U.K., Romania, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. It is looking to maintain its global expansion and become a market leader. It is already Turkey's leading services marketplace with more than 192,000 listed professionals now it is looking to continually improve the quality of services and boost customer satisfaction.
The founders of Armut said that the online services sector is quickly growing in Turkey and the world. They said the company will be more assertive with its global brand HomeRun and was preparing to launch a new service called, "Rahat Taşın" (Move Comfortably).
"In the Deloitte's Fast 500 EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) program, we ranked 40th among 500 companies. We have accomplished this with a team of 70 people from six different countries.
"In 2018, we will continue to grow with the diversity we have created in our own ecosystem in terms of reverse brain drain and manage all our operations from Istanbul," said Başak Taşpınar Değim.
Demand for cleaning services grows tenfold in three years
Baﬂak Taşpınar Değim said that their startup has seen the number of requests for cleaning services grow 10-fold over the last three years. "Cleaning services have become one of the most popular categories on our platform. We received more than 183,899 requests last year," she said. "The services on our platform can be easily reached through an 'Instant Booking' system. Besides Istanbul, we also list cleaning service providers in Izmir and Ankara in 2017."
Guarantee, transparency in service sector
One of Armut's founders, Erol Değim said they have made Turkey's services sector more transparent and largely bringing down customer dissatisfaction.
"When establishing Armut, we wanted to make it easier for people to reach high quality and reliable service providers. In our first year, we invested heavily in developing the technology and improve the quality of services. We have raised it to a satisfactory level over the years, thanks to our comment system and our intelligent algorithm."
"Of course, we are not fully gratified and continue to work on developing new solutions for our global services. Last year, we introduced the "Armut Guarantee" for some of our services so that our customers can have the peace of mind.
Screen time reaches three hours a day
A survey, "University Youth Mobile Application Data Research 2017," carried out by Startups.watch, involving students from Istanbul University, Kadir Has University, Koç University, Maltepe University, Marmara University and Yıldız Technical University has found that university students on average have a daily screen time of more than 196. Meaning they spend more than three hours on their smartphones and devices every day.
Social networks
Startups.watch's Serkan Ünsal said that the youth spent their time on apps like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat.
"If we look at the three most used apps, they spend 56 minutes on Instagram, 47 minutes on WhatsApp and 21 minutes on YouTube."
He added that university students were listening to music for 13 minutes, playing games for 15 and use other applications for 14 minutes.
He underlined that the youth, on average, spend 112 minutes every day on applications that belong to Facebook, like Instagram and WhatsApp.
"It means, young people, spend 57 percent of their time screen time on applications that belong to Facebook."
Videos and stories
According to the survey, Instagram and YouTube also claimed a significant chunk of the screen time and the amount is constantly going up.
Ünsal stressed that in 2017 there was no change in the time spent on WhatsApp compared to the previous year.
"But for Instagram, the time increased from 18 minutes to 56 minutes, and for YouTube, it changed from four minutes to 21 minutes. However, for Snapchat it went down from 14 minutes to seven."

Cloud accounting and taxes
Tax and accounting jobs are no laughing matters. At present, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which don't want to get lost in taxation complex details, are leaning towards cloud-based solutions.

Stephen Curry is eligible to receive a maximum contract this summer.
For two-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP, that would come out to be a whopping $205 million over five years.
But in case there's any concern among Warriors fans, recent comments by one of the people who would be paying that contract should come as excellent news.
“We're going to do whatever it takes to keep Steph here and happy,” Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob told the Bay Area News Group. “And I know he wants to be here and we want him here. So, I do not anticipate any issues with him staying.”
Curry just finished playing out the $44-million contract he signed in 2013. At the time, his long-term durability was a question mark; now we know the deal was an incredible bargain for the Warriors. Curry made $12.1 million in salary this season, less than 72 other players in the league. Obviously, Curry is not even close to being the 73rd best player in the league.
While receiving such a bargain on Curry, the Warriors were able to construct the roster that just won a second NBA championship in three years. They signed Klay Thompson and Draymond Green to extensions and were still able to afford to bring in free agent Kevin Durant for more than $26 million this season.
But if the Warriors want to keep this lineup intact, they won't be done spending money once they get Curry's situation settled because Durant can opt out of his deal this summer.
But, hey, like Lacob said, whatever it takes.

Spain and Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta penned a farewell note to the Spanish team and fans after retiring from international football.
Spain were eliminated in the Round of 16 by hosts Russia, which turned out to be Iniesta's last international match.
The 34-year-old Iniesta, who signed for Japanese side Vissel Kobe in May from Barcelona, thanked fans as he reflected on his achievements with the Spanish national side.
"Hello everyone, 14 years ago I wore the shirt of the national team for the first time, I was 15 years old and I will never forget that moment," he wrote in the letter, which he posted on Twitter.
"It was the dream of my life to be able to defend the colours of my country. It is something very special, not only a dream, but also a great responsibility.
"During all these years I have tried to be aware of what it means and to give my best so that you feel proud."
The four-time Champions League winner wrote about lucky he was to have played with a very talented generation of Spanish players in his time with the team.
"I think I've been lucky to live one of the best phases of Spanish football, with a generation of players who have been and are exceptional in every way," he posted.
"We have achieved great success, things that we all dreamed of when we were young, but we have also had great disappointments and we have experienced very difficult moments.
"To everyone, thank you very much for making me a better teammate and better soccer player. It has been my pride to be able to share with all of you all these years."
Despite their disappointing performances in Russia, the midfielder praise the current Spanish side and urged them to focus on the future.
"Now is the time to step aside and it hasn't been an easy decision, on the contrary, I have been thinking about it for many months," he noted.
"The future is exciting, with a group of players who are incredible and who from now on will have me as a fan more supporting them unconditionally."
"I have no doubt that what is ahead will be wonderful and that great successes will be reaped, as the group there is impressive."
And lastly, he thanked everyone, from the presidents to all the coaches he played under, and all his supporters.
The 34-year-old won 131 caps for Spain and scored 13 goals, including the winner in the 2010 World Cup final against the Netherlands.
He also lifted two European Championships, in 2008 and 2012.

While Opposition parties realise that they don't have electoral numbers to get a president of their choice, it is now becoming clear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to create history by getting a Dalit-tribal duo to fill the posts of President and Vice-President of India in July.
According to senior political sources that Firstpost spoke to, Modi will not agree to a consensus candidate backed by NDA and Opposition as this is the first time when a BJP-led government has a majority in the electoral college to get right-wing candidates into the two top posts.
Until 2015, when Modi appointed Draupadi Murmu, a tribal leader from Odisha as Jharkhand Governor, never had a tribal woman held a governor's post in the country.
Modi and BJP president Amit Shah's strategy to get Dalit-tribal duo in president and vice-president offices is meant to achieve multiple objectives.
First off, the objective is to get president and vice-president who come from RSS. Secondly, BJP wants to create history by getting a tribal leader and a Dalit leader into the two posts for the first time and market its outreach to Dalits and tribals as genuine. Thus, they want to portray opposition parties as anti-Dalit/Tribal. Lastly, this is being done to target the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to widen BJP's support base.
After winning UP elections, the NDA government has expanded its electoral footprint and BJP rules in 12 of the 29 states on its own and in 2 states of Jammu and Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh as an alliance partner. In the last few months, Modi has managed to widen the electoral support base for his choice of candidate with smaller parties like YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh, AIADMK factions in Tamil Nadu.
Barring a last-minute hitch, the two strong candidates to win nomination of NDA-led alliance are Kariya Munda, a former deputy speaker and tribal from Jharkhand who is known for his austere lifestyle and is dyed in RSS ideology, and Thawar Singh Gehlot, social justice minister in Modi's cabinet and a Dalit leader from Madhya Pradesh.
A source said that Gehlot's name for vice-president's post is virtually sealed but Modi has to take a final call on the presidential candidate. For several weeks, the name of Jharkhand Governor and BJP ST leader Draupadi Murmu has been doing the rounds. But Kariya Munda as a prospective candidate to be the next president has gained strength due to his decades-old ties to RSS. Munda's simple lifestyle was much talked about when he became a deputy speaker. Today, he continues to live in a mud house in village Khunti, Jharkhand. Though 80-plus, Munda comes from RSS, unlike Murmu, who directly joined the BJP.
On Friday, when BJP leaders meet Opposition leaders, starting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, they are unlikely to feel modest about their electoral strength and numbers in the electoral college to get Pranab Mukherjee's successor. A clear hint came from union minister Venkiah Naidu on Wednesday when he told media persons that NDA has the “mandate”. Opposition leaders can quibble, complain and protest Modi government's terse refusal to let go of a historic opportunity and humour them. But Modi-Shah duo are determined to make "history”.
LOS ANGELES-Kylie Jenner has put one of her mansions up for sale again for $3.3 million. The 19-year-old star withdrew her Mediterranean-style abode from the property market for four days before she decided to list it for a second time earlier this month. The property is the same one Kylie rented to brother Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. However, it's not clear why the reality TV star - who has been trying to sell the mansion since June 2016 - initially decided to withdraw the property from the market. Kylie bought the 5,100 square-foot mansion for $2.6 million in March 2015, a few months before she celebrated her 18th birthday.

LOS ANGELES-Lindsay Lohah has lent her name to another nightclub.
The ‘Mean Girls' actress already allowed a wild establishment in Athens to use her identity in a bid to appeal to more customers and now she's agreed for another club in Greece to be named Lohan Beach House on the popular island of Mykonos.
According to the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column, the beach house had a ‘'soft opening'' on Saturday and it's believed Tyga, French Montana and Travis Scott are among the names who have been invited over to perform.
Meanwhile, the 31-year-old actress - who started out as a model at the age of just three - hasn't made a film since 2013's ‘The Canyons' and has been living in London and with Syrian refugees while she got her life back on track following a turbulent period of numerous stints in rehab and run-ins with the law.
However, acting has always been Lindsay's ‘'true passion'' and she feels the life experiences she's gained over the last few years can only help refine her talents.
Lindsay - who appeared in West End stage show ‘Speed-the-Plow' in 2014 and has shot scenes for British comedy series ‘Sick Note' which are due to air soon - isn't looking for a particular genre of movie and is willing to take her time with her comeback in order to attach herself to the ‘'right'' script and project.
She previously admitted she has ‘'found peace'' since leaving the US.
She said: ‘'Yeah, I miss Hollywood. [But] I think there's a lot of noise that we deal with, so I found a kind of peace in life working with children and helping other people that really interest me. I think it's important for us to see that all of this stuff is fun, but you have to take time for you.''
LAHORE - Petition against contaminated milk and water was the main case during the last week.
The Supreme Court (Lahore registry) expressed dismay over the poor performance of Punjab Food Authority, with directions to it to hold inspection of all dairies and water plants on a petition challenging the contaminated water and milk.
The Supreme Court issued notices to the firms playing havoc with the lives of citizens by selling toxic milk and water.
In their reports, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR), University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and University of Agriculture Faisalabad told the apex court that major dairies and water plants were not meeting standard and quality.
“Milk samples collected from different companies contain sugarcane juice, formalin (commonly known as methanal and is used for preserving dead bodies), and heavy metal components which are injurious to health,” the Supreme Court was reported.
A court-assigned commission and Punjab Food Authority also confirmed in their reports that major dairies and water distributors were committing criminal negligence.
The PCSIR labs submitted eleven reports - one on ultra high temperature (UHT) and 10 on pasteurised milk.
A report of the PCSIR, previously filed with the court, stated that except Haleeb Milk, all samples taken from UHT (ultra-high-temperature) standardised milk manufacturers were found fit for human consumption. While the report on pasteurised milk said all samples, except Prema milk, were found to be unfit for human consumption.
The UVAS reported: “Sugarcane quantity is present in UHT Haleeb Milk. As regards pasteurised milk, sugarcane quantity is found in Ashaa Milk, Adams Milk and Anhaar Milk while heavy metal components have been found in UHT standardised milk samples of Day Fresh, Good Milk, Haleeb Milk, Milk Pak and Nurpur.”
In its report, the UAF said: “Out of seven UHT samples, all were found fit for human consumption. As regards pasteurised milk of 10 companies, formalin and added sugar have been found in Adams and Ashaa Milk.”
The report filed by commission on water read: “None of the companies identified in the aforesaid order meet the licensing criteria laid down under the law/rules and certain deficiencies have also been pointed out along with photographs.”
Following the SC order, Punjab Food Authority also submitted its report in which it claimed that outlets of five dairies including Asha, Dalda dairies, Al-Fajar Dairy Foods, Al-Fazal Foods have been found violating the basic hygienic standard and quality.
At this, the SC issued notice to Jami water, Asana Mineral water, Royal Mineral water, Bahria Water, Abbeyar Water, Oasis Water Plant, Pharmagen water, Wajyan Pure Drinking Water, Cool Valley Water and Fatima Ultra Filtration Plant. The apex court also directed milk manufacturing companies and water plants to submit replies by next hearing.
Barrister Zafarullah Khan had moved the court against the sale of contaminated milk and water across the country.
During the week, the SC also sought assistance of attorney general of Pakistan and advocate general of Punjab on questions raised on Parks and Horticulture Authority's powers regarding installation of billboards/outdoor advertisements.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed was hearing a petition against issuance of no objection certificates (NOCs) for installation of publicity boards by Faisalabad district administration.
The bench observed that a previous order regarding removal of giant billboards in Karachi had changed the face of the city.
However, the bench said it was not going to pass any direct order in Faisalabad case and would hear the advertisement companies first.
Justice Saeed said it was astonishing that the government appeared to be afraid of action against the advertisement companies. The bench issued notices to the companies for next hearing.
The bench observed that the court wanted to know that as to how the billboards of such immense sizes, which endangered public life and property, were permitted to be installed at public places.
The bench directed the attorney general and advocate general to appear in person on next hearing and assist the court on powers of the PHA with regard to giving permission for installation of billboards.
Two unusual incidents of police' raid at the house of a judicial officer and torture on a judicial bailiff surprised everyone, especially the judicial authorities.
Jalalpur Bhattian police tortured a judicial bailiff when it reached there for recovery of ten detainees at the police station. They also snatched from them the court record. While in Rajanpur, the city of district Rahim Yar Khan, SHO and a sub-inspector conducted raid at the residence of a civil judge without warrants. Police also misbehaved with the family members of the judge, ransacked his house and threw out the luggage.
Lahore High Court Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, on the complaints of both incidents, took notice, ordered the registrar office to fix the matters before Justice Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi. The CJ directed the registrar office to convert the complaints into petitions. Justice Naqvi took up the matters and summoned the DPOs of both districts for January 2 (today) to explain as to how and why these incidents took place.
These incidents are awful, however, it was the authorities who took notice in time and sought explanation from the police, perhaps, because the victims were the officials of the judiciary. It reflects what may happen to a common citizen if police don't spare even a judicial officer and a bailiff working on the directions of a court.
Mian Muzaffar Ahmad, former ATC Judge and prosecutor, is quite pessimistic about reforms in police. He says that it is nutshell of his sixty years professional experience that reforms seem impossible in police.
He says that strict punishment to the police officials who are found guilty of professional dishonesty is the only way towards some change in police. Nobody cares when a common mortal is humiliated by police. However, it is not just police as many other state departments also do not work.
A man has filed a complaint against Saskatoon police saying he was picked up by two officers and dropped off outside city limits at night in the cold.
Ken Thomas, who is a marathon runner, said he stepped out of a bar on Saturday night to have a cigarette after attending a concert.
READ MORE: Agency clears Saskatoon police of starlight tour
He said two police officers came by who said he fit the description of someone who had been digging into vehicles.
Thomas said he was detained and then driven south of the city where he was dropped off.
He said he ran back home to keep warm.
The Saskatoon Police Service said that it is aware a complaint has been filed with Saskatchewan's Public Complaints Commission and considers such an allegation to be serious.
Thomas said he was humiliated and the experience has shaken his faith in the justice system.
“They detained me and drove me to the outskirts of town and drop me off and laughed as they drove away and then I ran home,” he wrote in a post on his Facebook page.
“I don't know why they would even drive me out there. That being said, my faith in the justice system is shaken and I wouldn't want that to happen to anybody else.”
Thomas competes in annual events such as the Summit Run in Prince Albert, Sask., and the Frank Dunn Triathlon. He also coaches for the Saskatoon Tribal Council.
Thomas said he never attempted to resist arrest or argue with the officers out of fear of being charged and possibly risking his opportunity to coach.
“I talk to youth who have negative feelings about police, and as a leader you are supposed to say everything is going to be OK, it's a phase, but now what am I supposed to tell them?”
WATCH: Dave Scott calls for review into Neil Stonechild inquiry
John Clarke, the commission's director, said the organization has received an online complaint from Thomas and is trying to arrange to have him interviewed by an investigator.
The commission investigates and reviews complaints against municipal police and reports to the province's Justice Ministry.
The Saskatoon Police Service said it will co-operate fully with the investigation.
“Part of that investigation will include the review of GPS logs that track the location of patrol vehicles at any given time, as well as the in-car camera video which is automatically activated when the back door of a patrol car is opened,” police said in a statement.
In 1990, the frozen body of 17-year-old Neil Stonechild was found outside Saskatoon city limits.
An RCMP inquiry into Stonechild's death showed the teen was in police custody before he died. Two officers involved were fired following the inquiry.
Not even two months after Sainsbury and Asda proposed a merger that could further consolidate an already concentrated UK grocery market, #1 Tesco today announces its intention to form a strategic alliance with France's Carrefour, France's #3 behind System A (Auchan/System U partnership) and Leclerc.
The aforementioned merger has understandably generated concern about how promised price cuts to benefit consumers can possibly be achieved without closing stores and/or making staff redundant. This is a real problem at a time when the UK retail sector is under extreme pressure, with high street shops closing every week, falling foul of online competition and high overheads.
The latter, however, should escape such scrutiny, focusing on a long-term strategic alliance (3yr operational framework) to cover global suppliers, joint purchasing of own brand products and goods not for sale. Each will continue to work with their own local and national suppliers – to appease any EU/domestic criticism no doubt – but will try to save more where they can in terms of more international procurement. This is essentially the pair bolstering their buying power to save money and protect margins.
The question now, in a similar vein to criticism of an SBRY-ASDA tie-up, is whether the consumer will actually benefit from efforts to buy more cheaply. Will prices fall? Will there be more choice? Will the product offering be more competitive?
The likelihood is that today's announcement is focused more on protecting wafer-thin margins than benefiting consumers, knowing that brand loyalty is strong. These are companies after all. And publicly listed. In which case fiduciary duty is to stakeholder/shareholders, rather than consumers.
The timing and geographical proximity of the parties involved, however, is not lost on us as the UK edges closer to what could prove a highly disruptive Brexit. It is highly likely that today's news is fuelled by fears of what Brexit might do to cross-channel trade and finely tuned supply chains, especially in terms of perishables like fresh food.

Football is again on its annual grand stage.
Millions around the world will watch the New England Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles, and watch multi-million-dollar commercials in between the action. Long runs, touchdown passes and acrobatic plays await.
Also included are the warriors of the trenches, the big uglies who battle to establish supreme leverage and position. In the game of inches, these increments are often the most important and influential in determining a winner. But rare are the offensive lines -- and those who play it -- considered sexy enough for spotlight attention during the lead up to the sport's biggest contest.
Not here.
As we've done all season, we not only appreciate but understand and explain what goes on with these large fellas. It's time again to go Behind The Offensive Line (PRESENTED BY FORD) for a Super Sunday edition. Let's explore how one offensive line's group matchup could determine what retailers love to call the Big Game.
New England's resistance
It's not difficult to find a coach or player describing how to beat Brady: You have to pressure him up in the middle and collapse the edges.
Von Miller talked about it in his Players' Tribune piece on Friday. Jacksonville had the personnel to do it but didn't follow through. It ended up burning them.
New England's offensive line isn't filled with the stalwarts of old -- Logan Mankins, Matt Light, Dan Koppen -- and allowed the most QB hits in the entire league in 2017, but as a group, did a solid job of giving Brady time to work on Conference Championship Weekend. It also surprisingly boasts some high-ranking linemen, per Pro Football Focus.
Left tackle Nate Solder doesn't lead this group. In fact, he's the lowest-rated member of the starting five, according to PFF's grading. Center David Andrews ranks sixth, right guard Shaq Mason ranks ninth, left tackle Joe Thuney is 13th, right tackle Cameron Fleming is 25th and Solder is 32nd.
So, in going back to that AFC title game between Jacksonville and New England, the grades shed some light on why the game unfolded how it did. The Jaguars owned a presumed interior advantage, in tackles Malik Jackson and Marcell Dareus. Early on -- especially when a rusher de-cleated Mason -- it looked like that would play in the favor of Jacksonville, who was pressuring New England up the middle early. All was going according to plan.
But New England adjusted, thanks to Mason, Andrews and Thuney. The middle rush became ineffective (especially for a defense that was on the field far too long in the second half), Brady had time to survey behind his trusty interior and we all know how that played out.
How does this group match up against an even better front four? Well...
There's good and bad news. Let's get the painful part over with first.
We know what the Patriots will get from their running backs, who excel in the running and passing games. Though Mason and Andrews are grading the best, New England is averaging a slightly better yards-per-carry average (4.56 yards) running off the left tackle (Solder), per Next Gen Stats. This is also boosted by a higher number of carries in that direction (152) as opposed to the right side (97). Combined, edge rushes are more productive for New England (249 carries for 1,111 yards) than runs inside the tackles (191 carries for 811 yards). When considering New England's personnel, which lacks a true inside-the-tackles hammer (Mike Gillislee is serviceable, but that true hammer is now playing for Philadelphia), this makes sense.
But as the edge gives, the edge also takes. We'll key on one crucial matchup: Solder vs. Philadelphia's Vinny Curry, who lines up on over the left tackle on 95.6 percent of plays.
Solder ranks 44th in the NFL among offensive tackles in pass blocking efficiency, allowing 51 pressures on the year. He's surrounded by tackles like Marshall Newhouse (the weakest part of Oakland's offensive line), and Carolina's Matt Kalil, but is also near effective tackles like Garrett Bolles, Pro Bowler Alejandro Villanueva, Cam Robinson and Super Bowl opponent Halapoulivaati Vaitai, who's done an admirable job in place of the injured Jason Peters. Kind of a confusing group, no?
Ranking by that total pressures metric plunges him to a tie for 49th, though, and his company -- Dallas' La'el Collins, Seattle's Germain Ifedi, Arizona's John Wetzel and Cleveland's Shon Coleman -- starts to reveal the caliber of his play. What's worse, he's facing an effective and relentless rusher in Curry, who's tied for 20th in pass rushing efficiency with the likes of Cameron Jordan, and one-tenth of a point behind Carlos Dunlap, two havoc-wreakers in this league. Solder is looking at a long day against a guy who's registered 47 total pressures, with 45 coming from Solder's side.
Time for the good news: Solder did well against a tough matchup in Jacksonville's variety of athletic edge rushers, earning an 82 grade from PFF. New England has a good counter in the interior, too. Andrews came out of that game with a 69.8 grade, which Thuney broke 74. In fact, Mason had the worst game, which didn't end up being all that damaging.
They'll need all three of their interior linemen to play well against Fletcher Cox, one of the most imposing, powerful and explosive interior linemen in the league (No. 2 in the NFL, per PFF). They're also facing the league's best defense in total pressures per game (16.9).
The kicker is what Miller mentioned is a must for a playoff win over New England: A defense must pressure Brady consistently with just a four-man rush. Philadelphia has the second-highest pressure rate with a four-man rush (38.1 percent) and has seven players with 20-plus pressures, led by Cox.
Expect more 21 personnel (two running backs, one tight end) to help in protection against this defense. Offensive lines own a numbers advantage against a four-man rush, and Brady isn't slow with his decision making, but he can get rattled by constant pressure and contact. A chip from a tight end or running back can go a long way toward keeping the contact to a minimum, and force Philadelphia to blitz. In the latter scenario, Brady thrives in what again becomes a simple numbers game. More blitzers, less in coverage.
But as described above, Philadelphia has the personnel -- we didn't even mention the play of Brandon Graham (No. 9 defensive end), who will match up against Fleming, and veteran reserve Chris Long (No. 28) -- to get to Brady without much of a blitz.
The chess match of rush numbers versus protection numbers will ensue as the game unfolds. Whoever gains an early advantage will likely also grab the early lead. Instead of following the ball to the skilled-position stars early in Super Bowl LII, watch the trenches. They'll tell you a lot about how the game will play out.
The Ministry of Interior on Tuesday decided that after suspension of landing permits, all foreigners entering Pakistan without valid visas or without completing immigration process, would be proceeded against under law, which could include arrest and prosecution.
The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Taking note of visa irregularities and breach of security protocols by advance teams and accompanying staff of various hunting parties, especially from the Middle East, Nisar directed the interior ministry, FIA and Civil Aviation Authority to put in place an effective system for streamlining and checking any breach of law.
He further directed the ministry to identify all airports and landing strips in the country where delegations arrive for hunting purpose, devise standing operating procedures (SOPs) for immigration and customs clearance at places lacking these facilities and also evolve a robust mechanism of information sharing among Immigration Department, Interior Ministry and Aviation Division.
The minister directed that the process be completed within one week time. He said FIA and Civil Aviation should ensure that no plane is allowed to land in the country without prior clearance of the Interior Ministry.
He directed the Aviation Division and FIA to also ensure that landing permission be only granted after ascertaining number of people on-board, their nationality and nature of their visas.
The minister reiterated his call that nobody should be allowed to enter Pakistan without completing immigration procedures.
Shares of Facebook Inc fell 2 percent on Tuesday, after a report that a federal probe on the data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica had been broadened and would include more government agencies.
Facebook shares were down 2 percent at $193.36 in early trading on the Nasdaq, erasing nearly $12 billion from the company's market valuation.
The stock lost about 18 percent of its value in the seven trading days after the data scandal broke, but has since gained about 27 percent to date.
Facebook has faced intense scrutiny around the Cambridge scandal, which saw millions of users' data improperly accessed by the political consultancy. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have joined the Department of Justice in its inquiries about the two companies and the sharing of personal information of 71 million Americans, the Washington Post reported citing five people.
A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters late on Monday that it is cooperating with officials in the US, UK and beyond.
“We've provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues,” the spokesperson said.
The questioning from federal investigators centers on what Facebook knew three years ago and why the company did not reveal it at the time to its users or investors, the Washington Post said.
One diver assisting in the rescue effort, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the boys would need to carry out a two-hour underwater dive in order to reach the cave's third chamber, where crews have established a makeshift command post stocked with food, oxygen and other equipment. From there it would be relatively less difficult to make their way back out of the cave the way they entered, officials say.

ST. LOUIS - A man accused of an attempted armed robbery overnight at a south St. Louis gas station, was confronted by an off-duty St. Louis police officer. When it was all over, the suspect was dead.
The shooting at the Shell gas station is the fourth fatal shooting involving a St. Louis city police officer with in the last five weeks. All of the shootings have happened in south St. Louis. St. Louis city police identified the suspect as 33-year-old Chazz Brown from Columbia.
Investigators say Brown entered the Shell gas station in the 1800 block Arsenal just across Interstate-55 from the AB-Inbev Brewery around midnight and announced a robbery. The officer in fear for the life of the clerk, identified himself and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. During the exchange of gunfire, the suspect was shot and killed.
There are still bullets holes in the windows at the gas station which is also a police substation.
Something the suspect might not have been aware of. Officers are regularly there.
The officer involved in the shooting had just gotten done with his shift and was inside the store along with two clerks and another customer. The officer, was in street clothes. Some customers who frequent the gas station are still in shock, “It's just a tragedy, I work by this gas station, so just for somebody to come in and could have kill everybody in here,” said Clover Slaughter.
Investigators say the suspect`s gun was recovered from the scene and there are no other injuries to report. “This is a police substation and this is in Benton Park. This is in the middle of the city. We are loving and caring, this community is safe. I'm surprised this happens at Shell,” said Dale Wohler.
Police say the shooting remains under investigation.

New details surrounding Chevrolet's worst-kept secret, the next-generation mid-engine Corvette, should be more than enough to perk up enthusiasts' ears.
The rather detailed information comes from a Car and Driver report, which pegs three engines for the sports car turned supercar. At launch, the C8 Corvette will receive an upgraded version of the current 6.2-liter LT1 V-8 found in the current Corvette Stingray. However, horsepower will allegedly increase from 460 to 500 to make up for some added weight.
Moving right along, we arrive at the juicier details. Chevrolet will reportedly stick a 5.5-liter DOHC flat-plane crank V-8 engine under the hood, and it will produce at least 600 hp. Expect a redline much higher than in past Corvettes. Soon thereafter, C/D reported, the same 5.5-liter V-8 engine will receive two turbos to send horsepower to about 800. We previously were treated to CAD images showing a twin-turbo V-8 engine for the mid-engine Corvette. Now, it seems quite likely we were staring at the 5.5-liter V-8 referenced in the latest report.

Not enough? No problem for Chevrolet and General Motors engineers. Sitting atop the engine hierarchy will be a 1,000 hp all-wheel-drive hybrid setup, according to C/D. The basis of the powertrain will remain the 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine, but a 200-hp electric motor will power the front wheels, while the internal-combustion engine will send power to the rear. That's where the 1,000 hp figures comes into play.

Despite all of the spectacular engineering work, the report claims Chevrolet will keep the mid-engine Corvette an everyman's sports car with supercar levels of performance. Thus, the C8 Corvette will likely be largely made of aluminum with various components made from magnesium and carbon fiber. Fiberglass will make up most of the body panels and total weight should come in around 3,500 pounds.
That all sounds like great news, but it appears there is bad news for the #giveashift crowd. According to C&D's intelligence, no manual transmission is planned. Instead, a new Tremec 8-speed dual-clutch will be the only transmission.
Before wrapping up the load of enlightening details, C&D also noted that we will likely see more of the car in the spring of 2019.

These days I find myself increasingly irritated, annoyed, and flat-out furious with men. They're voting for incompetent people, allegedly running the country and frankly, just pissing me the fuck off. I've been trying to soothe all this anger with country music. But not just any forlorn steel guitar stuff. I've been listening to Women Killing Bad Men. Seriously, if you can't kill Bad Men in country music, where can you kill ‘em?

This playlist opens with the epitome of the genre: “Goodbye Earl” by The Dixie Chicks. We all know the story of the best of friends all through their high school days, Mary Ann and Wanda, who had to kill him “because Earl had to die.” Luckily Mary Ann and Wanda aren't alone. Here's a playlist of women killing their cheating husbands and the men who beat them every night. It's a salve to all the men, government employees or otherwise, who are constantly insisting on ruining my days. Honorable mentions include property vandalism, threats of violence and lots of drinking in “Oh Henry” by The Civil Wars, “Before He Cheats” by Carrie Underwood, and “Sin For A Sin” by Miranda Lambert. But I promise that every other song includes the nasty death of at least one Bad Man. Happy Valentine's Day or whatever.

Python is an outstanding language for people learning to program, and perfect for anyone wanting to "get stuff done" and not spend heaps of time on boilerplate code. Arcade is a Python library for creating 2D video games that is easy to start using, and very capable as you gain experience. In this article, I will explain how to start using Python and Arcade to program video games.
I started development on Arcade after teaching students using the PyGame library. I taught in-person using PyGame for almost 10 years, and I developed ProgramArcadeGames.com to teach online. PyGame is great, but eventually I felt like I was wasting time having to cover for bugs that were never fixed.
I worried about teaching things like the event loop, which was no longer the way we code. I had a whole section in which I explained why the y-coordinates were reversed. Because PyGame was seldom updated and it is based on an old SDL 1 library, rather than something like more modern like OpenGL, I didn't hold a lot of hope for the future.
Installation
I wanted a library that was easier to use, more powerful, and used some of the new features of Python 3, like decorators and type-hinting. Arcade is it. And this is how to get started.
Arcade, like many other packages, is available via PyPi, which means you can install Arcade using the pip command (or the pipenv command). If you already have Python installed, you can likely just open up a command prompt on Windows and type:
pip install arcade
Or on macOS and Linux type:
pip3 install arcade
For more detailed installation instructions, you can refer to the Arcade installation documentation.
Simple drawing
You can open a window and create simple drawings with just a few lines of code. Let's create an example that draws a smiley face like the figure below:
The script below shows how you can use Arcade's drawing commands to do this. Note that you don't need to know how to use classes or even define functions. Programming with quick visual feedback is great for anyone who wants to start learning to program.
import arcade
# Set constants for the screen size
SCREEN_WIDTH = 600
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
# Open the window. Set the window title and dimensions (width and height)
arcade. open_window ( SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN_HEIGHT , "Drawing Example" )
# Set the background color to white.
# For a list of named colors see:
# http://arcade.academy/arcade.color.html
# Colors can also be specified in (red, green, blue) format and
# (red, green, blue, alpha) format.
arcade. set_background_color ( arcade. color . WHITE )
# Start the render process. This must be done before any drawing commands.
arcade. start_render ( )
# Draw the face
x = 300
y = 300
radius = 200
arcade. draw_circle_filled ( x , y , radius , arcade. color . YELLOW )
# Draw the right eye
x = 370
y = 350
radius = 20
arcade. draw_circle_filled ( x , y , radius , arcade. color . BLACK )
# Draw the left eye
x = 230
y = 350
radius = 20
arcade. draw_circle_filled ( x , y , radius , arcade. color . BLACK )
# Draw the smile
x = 300
y = 280
width = 120
height = 100
start_angle = 190
end_angle = 350
arcade. draw_arc_outline ( x , y , width , height , arcade. color . BLACK , start_angle , end_angle , 10 )
# Finish drawing and display the result
arcade. finish_render ( )
# Keep the window open until the user hits the 'close' button
arcade. run ( )
Using functions
Of course, writing code in the global context isn't good form. Thankfully improving your program by using functions is easy. Here we can see an example of a drawing a pine tree at a specific (x, y) location using a function:
def draw_pine_tree ( x , y ) :
""" This function draws a pine tree at the specified location. """
# Draw the triangle on top of the trunk.
# We need three x, y points for the triangle.
arcade. draw_triangle_filled ( x + 40 , y , # Point 1
x , y - 100 , # Point 2
x + 80 , y - 100 , # Point 3
arcade. color . DARK_GREEN )
# Draw the trunk
arcade. draw_lrtb_rectangle_filled ( x + 30 , x + 50 , y - 100 , y - 140 ,
arcade. color . DARK_BROWN )
For the full example, see drawing with functions.
The more experienced programmer will know that modern graphics programs first load drawing information onto the graphics card, and then ask the graphics card to draw it later as a batch. Arcade supports this as well. Drawing 10,000 rectangles individually takes about 0.800 seconds. Drawing them as a batch takes less that 0.001 seconds.
The Window class
Larger programs will typically derive from the Window class, or use decorators. This allows a programmer to write code to handle drawing, updating, and handling input from the user. A template for a starting a Window -based program is below.
import arcade
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
class MyGame ( arcade. Window ) :
""" Main application class. """
def __init__ ( self , width , height ) :
super ( ) . __init__ ( width , height )
arcade. set_background_color ( arcade. color . AMAZON )
def setup ( self ) :
# Set up your game here
pass
def on_draw ( self ) :
""" Render the screen. """
arcade. start_render ( )
# Your drawing code goes here
def update ( self , delta_time ) :
""" All the logic to move, and the game logic goes here. """
pass
def main ( ) :
game = MyGame ( SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN_HEIGHT )
game. setup ( )
arcade. run ( )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
main ( )
The Window class has several methods that your programs can override to provide functionality to the program. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:
on_draw : All the code to draw the screen goes here.
: All the code to draw the screen goes here. update : All the code to move your items and perform game logic goes here. This is called about 60 times per second.
: All the code to move your items and perform game logic goes here. This is called about 60 times per second. on_key_press : Handle events when a key is pressed, such as giving a player a speed.
: Handle events when a key is pressed, such as giving a player a speed. on_key_release : Handle when a key is released, here you might stop a player from moving.
: Handle when a key is released, here you might stop a player from moving. on_mouse_motion : This is called every time the mouse moves.
: This is called every time the mouse moves. on_mouse_press : Called when a mouse button is pressed.
: Called when a mouse button is pressed. set_viewport : This function is used in scrolling games, when you have a world much larger than what can be seen on one screen. Calling set_viewport allows a programmer to set what part of that world is currently visible.
Sprites
Sprites are an easy way to create a 2D bitmapped object in Arcade. Arcade has methods that make it easy to draw, move, and animate sprites. You can also easily use sprites to detect collisions between objects.
Creating a sprite
Creating an instance of Arcade's Sprite class out of a graphic is easy. A programmer only needs the file name of an image to base the sprite off of, and optionally a number to scale the image up or down. For example:
SPRITE_SCALING_COIN = 0.2
coin = arcade. Sprite ( "coin_01.png" , SPRITE_SCALING_COIN )
This code will create a sprite using the image stored in coin_01.png . The image will be scaled down to 20% of its original height and width.
Sprite lists
Sprites are normally organized into lists. These lists make it easier to manage the sprites. Sprites in a list will use OpenGL to batch-draw the sprites as a group. The code below sets up a game with a player, and a bunch of coins for the player to collect. We use two lists, one for the player and one for the coins.
def setup ( self ) :
""" Set up the game and initialize the variables. """
# Create the sprite lists
self . player_list = arcade. SpriteList ( )
self . coin_list = arcade. SpriteList ( )
# Score
self . score = 0
# Set up the player
# Character image from kenney.nl
self . player_sprite = arcade. Sprite ( "images/character.png" , SPRITE_SCALING_PLAYER )
self . player_sprite . center_x = 50 # Starting position
self . player_sprite . center_y = 50
self . player_list . append ( self . player_sprite )
# Create the coins
for i in range ( COIN_COUNT ) :
# Create the coin instance
# Coin image from kenney.nl
coin = arcade. Sprite ( "images/coin_01.png" , SPRITE_SCALING_COIN )
# Position the coin
coin. center_x = random . randrange ( SCREEN_WIDTH )
coin. center_y = random . randrange ( SCREEN_HEIGHT )
# Add the coin to the lists
self . coin_list . append ( coin )
We can easily draw all the coins in the coin lists:
def on_draw ( self ) :
""" Draw everything """
arcade. start_render ( )
self . coin_list . draw ( )
self . player_list . draw ( )
Detecting sprite collisions
The function check_for_collision_with_list allows us to see if a sprite runs into another sprite in a list. We can use this to see all the coins the player sprite is in contact with. Using a simple for loop, we can get rid of the coin from the game and increase our score.
def update ( self , delta_time ) :
# Generate a list of all coin sprites that collided with the player.
coins_hit_list = arcade. check_for_collision_with_list ( self . player_sprite , self . coin_list )
# Loop through each colliding sprite, remove it, and add to the score.
for coin in coins_hit_list:
coin. kill ( )
self . score + = 1
For the full example, see collect_coins.py.
Game physics
Many games include some kind of physics. The simplest are top-down programs that prevent the player from walking through walls. Platformers add more complexity with gravity and platforms that move. Some games use a full 2D physics engine with mass, friction, springs, and more.
Top-down games
For simple top-down based games, an Arcade program needs a list of walls that the player (or anything else) can't move through. I usually call this wall_list . Then a physics engine is created in the Window class's setup code with:
self . physics_engine = arcade. PhysicsEngineSimple ( self . player_sprite , self . wall_list )
The player_sprite is given a movement vector with its two attributes change_x and change_y . A simple example of doing this would be to have the player move with the keyboard. For example, this might be in the custom child of the Window class:
MOVEMENT_SPEED = 5
def on_key_press ( self , key , modifiers ) :
"""Called whenever a key is pressed. """
if key == arcade. key . UP :
self . player_sprite . change_y = MOVEMENT_SPEED
elif key == arcade. key . DOWN :
self . player_sprite . change_y = -MOVEMENT_SPEED
elif key == arcade. key . LEFT :
self . player_sprite . change_x = -MOVEMENT_SPEED
elif key == arcade. key . RIGHT :
self . player_sprite . change_x = MOVEMENT_SPEED
def on_key_release ( self , key , modifiers ) :
"""Called when the user releases a key. """
if key == arcade. key . UP or key == arcade. key . DOWN :
self . player_sprite . change_y = 0
elif key == arcade. key . LEFT or key == arcade. key . RIGHT :
self . player_sprite . change_x = 0
Although that code sets the player's speed, it doesn't move the player. In the update method of the Window class, calling physics_engine.update() will move the player, but not through walls.
def update ( self , delta_time ) :
""" Movement and game logic """
self . physics_engine . update ( )
For a full example see sprite_move_walls.py.
Platformers
Moving to a side view platformer is rather easy. A programmer just needs to switch the physics engine to PhysicsEnginePlatformer and add in the gravity constant.
self . physics_engine = arcade. PhysicsEnginePlatformer ( self . player_sprite ,
self . wall_list ,
gravity_constant = GRAVITY )
You can use a program like Tiled to lay the tiles/blocks that make up your level.
For an example, see sprite_tiled_map.py.
For full 2D physics you can integrate the PyMunk library.
Learn by example
One of the best ways to learn is by example. The Arcade library has a long list of example programs that a person can draw on to create games. These examples each show a game concept that students have asked for in my classes or online over the years.
Running any of these demos is easy once Arcade has been installed. Each of the samples has a comment at the beginning of the program with a command you can type on the command-line to run the sample, for example:
python -m arcade.examples.sprite_moving_platforms
Summary
Arcade lets you start programming graphics and games with easy-to-understand code. Many new programmers have created great games not long after getting started. Give it a try!

WARREN COUNTY — Warren County deputies and the Harveysburg Police Department were called to 5321 Harverysburg Road in Harveysburg for an infant not breathing at around 9:52 a.m. Tuesday. The infant was transported to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where the infant was later pronounced dead, according to the Warren County Sheriff's Office.
On Wednesday, an autopsy was performed by the Montgomery County Coroner's Office; preliminary results indicate no signs of foul play related to this infant death, according to a Wednesday afternoon press release from the sheriff's office.
The autopsy report will not be a finalized until after the toxicology report comes back.
The Warren County Sheriff's Office investigation is continuing.
The 2017 Rose Bowl will take place this afternoon when the No. 5 ranked Big Ten champion Penn State Nittany Lions face the No. 9 ranked USC Trojans. Both of these teams had fallen on hard times over the past decade or so, but it is great to see them back and climbing the Top 25 standings once again. Referred to as the “Granddaddy of them all,” the Rose Bowl turns 103 years-old today, and what better way to celebrate than with two teams like Penn State and USC, both of which are rich in tradition, and have been playing college football since the 1880's. That is a lot of history! According to a CBS Sports report, the Big Ten champion Nittany Lions finished the season with an 11-2 record, and some will argue that Penn State should have been in the college football playoffs instead of Ohio State. The Nittany Lions defeated Ohio State 24-21 back in October, which obviously would give Penn State the head-to-head advantage, but the CFP committee must not have seen things that way. One has to wonder if they feel different after OSU was smoked by Clemson on New Year's Eve? Head Coach James Franklin and the Nittany Lions celebrate their Big Ten title. [Image by Joe Robbins/Getty Images] While Penn State coach James Franklin wants all of his teams to focus on USC and only USC, the kids have to wonder about what could have been — it is just human nature. Here is some food for thought about the college football playoffs and an interesting fact. So far, in the three years of the current playoff format, Penn State was the first Power Five conference champion to be left out in favor of a non-divisional champ. So the million dollar question is, what if the Buckeyes had been a two-loss Big Ten champion with Penn State's resume? Would the Buckeyes have been left on the outside looking in? Probably not, but that is an argument for another day. Right now, all Penn State wants is to be the next Rose Bowl winner. Penn State trailed by a large margin in the Big Ten title game, 28-7 to be exact, but in the end, the Nittany Lions stormed back to earn the 38-31 win. That is the kind of positive energy head coach James Franklin wants his team to focus on and not whether they should have been in the NCAA playoffs. “Just how hard our guys play; that's something that is really, really important to me,” Penn State third-year coach James Franklin said. “There's no better compliment than when you go around recruiting and you see high school coaches and they say, ‘Coach, your guys play so hard.' That's what it starts with. You get guys playing hard and playing for each other, you have a chance. That is what I'm most proud of… And they're having fun. God forbid, you have fun while playing major college football.” If Penn State wants to head back to the great state of Pennsylvania winners, they will need to keep up that tremendous effort that got them to Pasadena when they face quarterback Sam Darnold and the high-powered USC offense. Quarterback Sam Darnold has been a leader for USC this season. [Image by Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images] Darnold has played beyond his years so far at Southern Cal, as he looks more like a sophomore or junior running the offense than a freshman. This kid is going to be something special at USC and he may shatter a few Trojan records along the way. Darnold is the best quarterback in the nation amongst freshman in almost every statistical category, including passing efficiency (161.0 rating), completion percentage (68.1) and touchdown passes (26). Twenty-six touchdown passes as a freshman? That is impressive. Las Vegas odds makers have USC listed as a 7 point favorite with the over/under number set at 59. The Rose Bowl is always like a road game for the Big Ten and a home tilt for the Pac-12, however, this spread seems a bit high. Penn State keeps proving they have a great team game after game, and they will have to do it once again this afternoon. Pick – Penn State +7 College football fans can catch every play of the USC vs Penn State Rose Bowl match-up nationally on ESPN. The game will also be streaming live for fans on the go through the Watch ESPN App. Game time is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET. [Featured Image by Harry How/Getty Images]

PANAJI: After studying the written opinion of Advocate General (AG) Saresh Lotlikar, Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar on Tuesday said that there is no question of convening an assembly session or recommending to the Governor for dissolution of the state legislative assembly.
Last week, the Chief Minister had sought legal opinion of the AG on the matter after the opposition parties had demanded that the Chief Minister either convene session or dissolve the assembly. Advocate General Lotlikar sent the concerned file with his opinion to the Chief Minister's office on Monday.
The AG has said that there is no need to either dissolve the assembly or convene an assembly session as polling for the state assembly has already taken place on February 4. The Chief Minister had sought the AG's legal opinion on whether he has to recommend to the Governor to summon the assembly or dissolve the House, as it would be more than six months since the last session by the time the new government is formed.
The AG, in his opinion given to the Chief Minister, has stated that the present legislative assembly can transact no business in view of the fact that polling has already taken place and in this situation not convening the legislative assembly session within six months cannot be considered as a breakdown of the constitutional machinery, adding that the status of the existing assembly can continue till the new assembly is put in place after declaration of the assembly results.
“In my opinion, there would not be any breach of article of the Constitution if no session of the legislative assembly is called before February 28, 2017. It is also not necessary for the cabinet to recommend to the Governor to dissolve the legislative assembly merely because in the existing situation the assembly session is not being called,” Lotlikar said in his opinion.
The AG further noted that the dissolution of the assembly under Article 174(2) (b) is not automatic upon non-compliance of Article 174(1) of the Constitution. In the given case, it may become necessary to recommend to the Governor to dissolve the assembly under Article 174(2)(b), but the present situation is not one which warrants such a recommendation, pointing out that, therefore, the status as existing today can continue till the new assembly is put in place after the declaration of the results.
While speaking to ‘The Navhind Times' on Tuesday, Parsekar said that he had time and again said that the elections have just been held, after which, ethically, it is not appropriate that the outgoing government convenes the assembly session, adding that the written opinion of the AG has endorsed the stand of the government.
Earlier, Parsekar had said that when there is no fault of his government, why he should seek dissolution of the assembly, maintaining that this situation has not been created by his government.
ESPN's Nick Wagoner says that "nothing is bigger for 2018 and beyond" than 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo's ability to make players around him better. (1:02)
HOUSTON -- For the first time under coach Kyle Shanahan and the first time since 2014, the San Francisco 49ers have won two games in a row.
After Sunday's 26-16 win against the Houston Texans, Shanahan was asked if he's allowed himself to think about what this season might have brought had Jimmy Garoppolo been at quarterback all along.
"I don't really think that way," Shanahan said. "You go through an offseason and stuff, you prepare him a lot more for the year and who knows? But it's not something I would think about very much."
While the past -- and that abysmal 0-9 start -- might already be water under the bridge, many 49ers and their fans aren't afraid to look to the future, a future that, with Garoppolo, looks much brighter than it did without him.
"It definitely just builds the confidence," fullback Kyle Juszczyk said. "[It] gets everyone excited. I mean, it feels like a whole new season here. It feels like we started last week. Especially, getting a win, we wish we had more games left. We wish we had a full season to do this thing with him."
What would a full season have looked like? We'll have to wait to get the answer, and we won't go through the exercise of trying to extrapolate his numbers from these past two starts over the course of a full 16-game season. There's still plenty to chew on, however.

Consider that Garoppolo's 627 passing yards are the most by a 49ers quarterback in his first two starts since the merger in 1970. He's also the third Niners quarterback to win each of his first two road starts and the fourth active quarterback to win his first four starts regardless of location.
In his two starts plus one three-play sequence against Seattle, Garoppolo is 48-of-72 for 645 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions for a passer rating of 92.7. His average of 9 yards per pass attempt would lead the NFL if he had thrown enough passes to qualify.
Beyond the box scores, Garoppolo already has ingratiated himself with his teammates. He's made it a point to spend time chatting with teammates from all corners of the locker room and already has earned the trust and respect of the group, a quality that's imperative for any quarterback.
"Jimmy is a great guy," receiver Marquise Goodwin said. "He's a leader. He's natural at it. He doesn't show [fear] at any point of the game. When you see that in the position that he's in, it gives you extreme confidence. When you look at him in the third quarter or in the second quarter and we're down by one or up by one, you feel that sense of hope. You feel that sense of 'I'm going to get the job done.' And at no point in the game do I ever feel like we're behind or we're slacking in that position, because he's led us the whole way from start to finish."
This is probably where we're supposed to insert the usual caveats about how it's been only two games with Garoppolo as the starter and though he put up big numbers and a pair of wins in those games, they were against a pair of teams in Chicago and Houston that are pretty far removed from playoff contention.
That's fair enough, and with three games to play, including matchups against stout defensive teams in the Jacksonville Jaguars and Los Angeles Rams, Garoppolo and the Niners will face far more difficult tests in the coming weeks.
When things go wrong in those games, and chances are they will, the 49ers seem to have reached a point where they aren't dwelling on their mistakes. Some of that can be attributed to a team that's starting to learn how to win, and some of it can be credited to the quarterback.
"When a ball is dropped or a play is missed or an interception is thrown, you really can't dwell on it," Goodwin said. "You have got to kind of have a short memory and move forward, because if you focus on that, you're just stuck in the past. This game moves so fast that you have to really just move on to the next play, whether it be a good or a bad play. So when we started out shaky like that, you've got a guy like Jimmy, who is like, ‘Hey, guys, it's all right, but we can't let it happen again.' Like, 'Let's go, let's get it going,' and he does a great job of managing the huddle and keeping everybody composed throughout the game."
For a team that has long since been eliminated from postseason contention, the Niners haven't approached any of their recent games like a team with nothing to play for. It's a credit to the job Shanahan has done, the hard work his team has put in and, of course, to their magnetic new quarterback.
The next three weeks figure to offer some ups and downs, but Garoppolo already has done enough in his first two starts to make one wonder just how high his ceiling can be when he gets a chance to fully absorb Shanahan's playbook and the Niners have a chance to add dynamic pieces around him.
"I've only been here for a short time, so I don't know exactly what's changed or what hasn't," Garoppolo said. "I think we've got a little bit of momentum with us right now and we just need to keep plucking away day by day and just keep getting better. That's what it's all about, especially this time of year. You know, we only have three games left now, so we just have to keep getting better and good things will happen."
There's a limit on just how good those things can be in 2017. But for the first time in a long time, Garoppolo has given the Niners and their fans a chance to dream big in 2018 and beyond.

Over the weekend, Michael Crabtree became a Raven , and more importantly, the latest member of the free crab cakes for life crew. Jimmy's Seafood restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland has been a part of the city since 1974 when Demetrios "Jimmy" Minadakis first started serving seafood lovers. However, in recent years, Jimmy's Seafood has been making sports headlines by offering athletes free crab cakes for life to sign with local teams.
Last offseason, when WR Jeremy Maclin was looking at suitors, Jimmy's Seafood stepped in with a crab cakes offer that would be hard to turn down.
Dear @jmac___19,
Free crab cakes for the length of your deal if you sign with the @Ravens.
Shake on it. ï¿½ï¿½ â Jimmy's Seafood (@JimmysSeafood) June 7, 2017
One day later, with no official word on Maclin signing, Jimmy's Seafood raised the stakes.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Maclin. We'll up the offer to free crab cakes for life. Now sign already! ï¿½ï¿½ pic.twitter.com/XVjwjwZhHS â Jimmy's Seafood (@JimmysSeafood) June 8, 2017
Less than a week later, Maclin signed a two-year, $11 million deal with the Ravens. This year, they made the same offer to Allen Robinson, but the WR opted to sign with the Bears instead. Maybe he's more of a deep dish guy?
Jimmy's connection to athletes hasn't always been related to free agency signings -- in 2016, Manny Machado got free steamed crab and crab cakes for life after charging the mound when Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura threw at him.
Free crab cakes, steamed crabs, and meal prep FOR LIFE for Manny Machado. Real man - definitely not SAWFT!!! pic.twitter.com/00Qq3JCV93 â Jimmy's Seafood (@JimmysSeafood) June 8, 2016
WWE's Roman Reigns got free crab cakes for life after eating a seven-pound lobster at the restaurant.
No deals for a writer who promotes, uh, I mean writes about these offers regularly? Even three times within the span of a week?

Oh, alright then. *Heads to Yelp and places an order for way more seafood than I can afford.*
Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior (MoI) said Monday that they have seized around 2,000 kgs of explosives that were kept inside a house and the militants were apparently using them in terrorist attacks.
The ministry further added that the operation was conducted in the vicinity of Char Asiab district of Kabul which resulted into the confiscation of the explosives.
MoI also added that an investigation is underway in this regard.
The Taliban insurgents mostly use the explosives of Ammonium Nitrate type to manufacture Improvised Explosive Devices which are mainly used in roadside bombings.
Roadside bombings are considered as the main cause of the casualties of the security forces, government employees, and the ordinary civilians.
This comes as the Afghan forces on Saturday foiled a plot by the anti-government armed militants to launch rockets on Kabul city.
At least ten rockets prepared for the attack was discovered and confiscated from the Khak-e-Jabar district o Kabul before the militants manage to fire them on the city.
The latest developments come as the anti-government armed militants are attempting to destabilize the key cities of the country including capital Kabul, a move which the insurgents often adopt as the weather gets warm.
CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday intensified efforts to rally Middle Eastern countries against U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, setting up talks with Arab leaders beginning in Cairo. FILE PHOTO: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/FilesAbbas will meet President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, which has been a key broker in past peace talks with Israel and between fighting Palestinian factions, before heading for Istanbul to give a speech, his office said. Arab states condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's Jerusalem decision last week, and vowed to press international bodies to take action against it. The Arab Parliament held an emergency meeting on the issue in Cairo on Monday, state news agency MENA reported. Sisi, after a separate meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the U.S. moving its Israel embassy to Jerusalem would have “dangerous effects on peace and security in the region”. Abbas met the head of the Arab League in Cairo on Monday, local media reported. Arab foreign ministers held an hours-long emergency meeting at the weekend and vowed to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution rejecting the U.S. move, but gave few details on other measures they would take. The Palestinians hope for concrete action. “Daring Palestinian and Arab decisions are required in the coming stage, which is very important,” Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah told Palestinian official news agency WAFA. World powers have said the U.S. move will impede peace efforts in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict as anger spreads across the region. The Trump administration says it is still committed to the peace process. Abbas will not meet Mike Pence during the U.S. Vice President's visit to the region later this month, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said on Saturday. Egypt's top Muslim and Christian religious leaders also said they would not meet Pence. Abbas is expected to make a statement after his meeting with Sisi, the Palestinian embassy in Cairo said, without giving details. Egypt, along with Jordan a key U.S. ally in the region which has helped broker past peace deals and has good relations with Israel, has said the Jerusalem move undermines efforts to end the conflict. It has also brokered reconciliation deals between Abbas's Fatah party and Gaza-based Islamist group Hamas, which called for a new uprising against Israel last week. The planned handover of control of Gaza to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority under the latest deal hit another delay on Sunday, with a Fatah official blaming “obstacles” without elaborating. Israel launched fresh air strikes in Gaza on Saturday in response to rocket fire from the enclave, where it fought a war in 2014 which killed more than 2,000 people, most of them civilians.

New Delhi: Project Sashakat endorsed by the Finance Ministry addresses some of the practical challenges and will promote faster resolution of non-performing assets, analysts said.
Independent asset management companies (AMCs) and steering committees would be set up for faster resolution of bad loans in the banking system under the five-pronged strategy endorsed by the Finance Ministry on Monday.
A panel, headed by PNB non-executive chairman Sunil Mehta, recommended an asset management company/alternative investment fund (AIF)-led resolution approach under the five-pronged strategy to deal with NPA cases of more than Rs 500 crore.
It outlines the solution customized to complexity involved, addresses some of the practical challenges seen thus far such as 100 percent alignment of all lenders' which is now proposed to be dealt through inter-creditor arrangement and resolution led by lead bank to be agreed by 66 percent of lenders' in line with Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, KPMG said in a statement.
"The recommendations also recognize the fact that we need to attract foreign capital to address this challenge and thus provides framework/structures to attract this capital," Manish Aggarwal (Partner and Head) resolutions & restructuring KPMG said.
According to Anil Gupta, financial sector ratings head at ICRA, the proposed steering committees which will formulate and validate the schemes for resolution of stressed accounts over Rs 50 crore is a positive step, given that such resolution schemes have to be completed within 90 days.
"Many of these borrowers may be facing temporary stress which may be facing cash flow mismatch or liquidity issues and can be resolved with additional/temporary funding. Hence proposal to resolve such cases through a non-discretionary templatised approach for resolution of these accounts transparently is positive," Gupta said.
Resolution of stressed assets is equally important as the recognition of the stressed assets is, he said, adding, with recognition of the large portion of stressed assets and gross NPAs of banking sector reaching 11.7 percent as on 31 March, 2018, the resolution and recovery against these NPAs has to pick up the pace.
"While large accounts are being resolved through the Insolvency and bankruptcy code, the proposed mechanism to resolve the smaller accounts through steering committee process in time bound manner will fasten the resolution process and prevent further losses for the banks and will be in the interest of all stakeholders," he said.
The committee has also suggested an asset trading platform for both performing and non-performing assets.
The committee did not recommend setting up a 'bad bank' to deal with the mounting NPAs in state-own banks.
Under the SME Resolution Approach (SRA), loans up to Rs 50 crore would be dealt using a template approach supported by a steering committee.
The panel has recommended that the resolution should be non-discretionary and completed in a time-bound manner within 90 days.

Thirty-nine reporters and editors at HuffPost were laid off Wednesday in connection with Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of Yahoo Inc., according to the union representing the website's editorial staffers.
The union members who were laid off from HuffPost — the news website formerly known as Huffington Post — “will receive a collectively-bargained severance package that includes two months' salary plus a week of pay for each year of service and continued health benefits for that entire period,” Writer's Guild of America, East, said in a statement.
Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo's core Internet business was finalized Tuesday. Yahoo and Verizon's AOL unit merged to create Oath, which includes HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, Makers, Tumblr, Build Studios, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Mail.
Verizon is counting on the combination of Yahoo and AOL to build a strong third alternative in a rapidly growing digital advertising market that is currently dominated by Google and Facebook.
About 2,000 Yahoo and AOL workers are expected to lose their jobs as Verizon trims expenses and eliminates overlapping positions.
An Oath representative declined to comment on the layoffs beyond mentioning “impacts” of 15%, globally, and saying that the new company could not break down job cuts by unit.
HuffPost editorial staffers ratified their first union contract with the Writer's Guild of America, East in January. The union said at the time that the collective bargaining agreement included gains in pay and protections of journalistic integrity.
The Associated Press was used in compiling this report.

This Development Studies seminar titled "Transformative Politics and the Solidarity Economy" was given by Professor Michelle Williams and Dr Vishwas Satgar (School of Social Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa) on 2 February 2016 at SOAS University of London.
The talk draws on a book manuscript that Satgar and Williams are currently working on based on six years of fieldwork with visits to 15 countries to study worker cooperatives, worker cooperative-led economic networks and a new theoretical approach to transformative politics.
Professor Michelle Williams' work relates to debates around social movements and alternative economic and political systems. Most notably, her analysis of the development of participatory democratic practice in South Africa and Kerala, India in her book The Roots of Participatory Democracy, provides a provocative comparison of the role of solidarity economies, labour and social movements connecting India and South Africa. She was a member of the Centre for Indian Studies in Africa between 2007 and 2011, and is now the chairperson for the Global Labour University Programme (GLU) at the University of Witwaterstand, South Africa, where she is also a senior lecturer.
Vishwas Satgar is currently the executive director of the Cooperative and Policy Alternative Centre (COPAC) and a senior lecturer at the University of Witwaterstand. His work as a grassroots activist in South Africa for the past three decades has ranged across issues including the improvement of township communities, food sovereignty campaigns, and campaigns around climate jobs and defending popular democracy in South Africa. Williams and Satgar are currently working on a book project on the solidarity economy through an analysis of the linkages between producer cooperatives and consumer markets.

Chelsea's mouthwatering tie with five-time European champions Barcelona is the standout fixture for English clubs in the Champions League last-16 as the Premier League sides scent blood.
Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea all progressed from the group stage, making England the first country to have so many sides through to the knockout phase.
That quintet suffered just three defeats between them in the group stage and scored 80 goals in total, while reigning English champions Chelsea were the only team not to win their group.
The first legs will be played on 13/14 and 20/21 February, with the second legs on 6/7 and 13/14 March.
Basel vs Manchester City
Runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City will not be losing too much sleep over the prospect of a clash with Swiss side Basel, who finished second in Manchester United's qualifying group.
Champions League favourites City, who have never won the competition, are on a 14-match winning streak in the Premier League and they were only denied a perfect record in the group stage when a much-changed side lost 2-1 at Shakhtar Donetsk in their final match.
Chelsea vs Barcelona
Antonio Conte's Chelsea will face Spanish league leaders Barcelona for the sixth time in the knockout stages of Europe's elite club competition.
The Blues were the only English club not to progress to the last-16 as group winners and, currently third in the Premier League, are struggling to find the consistency that took them to the league title last year.
Barça have lost some of their lustre with the departure to Paris Saint-Germain of Neymar but they still boast the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in attack and will be formidable opponents.
The La Liga club has progressed from six of their past seven Champions League knockout ties against English opposition -- the exception being their 2012 semi-final defeat by Chelsea, when the London club went on to lift the trophy.
Juventus vs Tottenham
Tottenham have been handed a tough tie against last season's beaten finalists Juventus after topping a challenging group that included reigning champions Real Madrid.
The Italian side will approach the tie with trepidation, having been eliminated in each of their past five European knockout ties with English teams.
Spurs have endured a tricky recent spell in the Premier League but their performances in Europe this season suggests they have matured under manager Mauricio Pochettino after the disappointment of crashing out in the group stage last year.
Porto vs Liverpool
Five-time European champions Liverpool sealed top spot in their qualifying group with a 7-0 win against Spartak Moscow in which all of their "Fab Four" frontmen found the net.
Jurgen Klopp's men stuttered earlier in the season but have hit their stride in the Premier League and the Champions League, with Philippe Coutinho, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane dazzling in front of goal.
Too far off the pace to realistically challenge in the Premier League, Liverpool -- who qualified from the group phase for the first time since the 2008-2009 season -- will be confident of overcoming the Portuguese league leaders
Sevilla vs Manchester United
Manchester United, who have won the competition three time, will face Sevilla for the first time in a competitive fixture with manager Jose Mourinho gunning for his third Champions League trophy.
United are second in the Premier League but are a whopping 11 points behind City and know despite the heavyweight teams left in the competition, the Champions League is probably a more realistic chance of silverware.
Greater Bryant Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Todd Rhoden has announced he is resigning.
Rhoden said the decision to resign came after he and his family planned to relocate to California to be closer to family members. He has also been selected to serve and the president and CEO of the Palm Desert Area Chamber of Commerce in southern California.
“My new career will allow us to be within hours of Lorianne's (wife) entire family and our three-year-old son, Micah, the chance to grow up around close loved ones," Rhoden told the Board. "It has been an honor to serve this community and I appreciate the relationship we have shared over the past two years."
Rhoden, who joined the chamber in May 2016, will continue to work with the organization until June 1.
David Hannah, chair for the chamber's board of directors, announced that the board met to accept his resignation and has formed a committee to search for his replacement. The committee will include Tracey Elliott, Suzanne Passmore, and Hannah.
According to a release about Rhoden's resignation, Hannah thanked Rhoden for his high energy and credited the successful rebranding that he has accomplished for the Bryant Chamber and this great community.
During this interim time, Hannah said he has complete confidence in the chamber's staff to continue the great work for our members while the board conducts a search. He said he feels confident that the search committee and board will find the perfect fit for the Bryant Chamber leadership role.
More information about the position will be available on the Bryant Chamber website soon.
When Jack Clarke was 8 years old, doctors told his parents that he'd likely never walk or talk again.
On Sunday, he walked across the Drake Knapp Center stage to accept his diploma during the Valley High School graduation ceremony.
One of those cheering him on was Valley Principal Tim Miller. The principal and the student have been eating lunch together off and on for six years — since their time together at Stilwell Junior High.
"He is just such an amazing young guy and has a great love of life," Miller said last week. "He's got such a positive outlook on everything he does and transfers that joy to others."
Clarke's medical problems arose in elementary school after a shunt used to drain excess fluid from around his brain — he was born with a condition called hydrocephalus — became infected.
"Everything that could go wrong went wrong," said his mother, Melissa Clarke-Wharff.
Clarke had six strokes in two weeks and spent a month in a coma.
The second half of his third-grade year was spent at an inpatient medical facility. He doesn't remember much of that time, but he does remember the physical therapy he had to endure while attending fourth-grade classes part-time.
"It about emotionally about broke me," his mother said. "I got my motivation and strength from Jack. I saw he was working for this as well. I just didn't believe that he wasn't going to be able to walk."
He eventually had 38 leg surgeries to help him regain mobility.
When is been time for Clarke to move to junior high, his family met with Miller, who was principal of Stilwell at the time.
"I saw Tim's commitment to Jack. He said, 'This kid's got it, and we're going to bring it out of him,'" Clarke-Wharff said
That's when Miller and Clarke first began spending their lunch period together.
"Every lunch, he was there," Clarke said. "I didn't really know anybody else besides him. He would mingle with the students. I just found that so cool how he was able to do that."
Miller was transferred to Valley High during Clarke's eighth-grade year. But the friendship and lunches resumed two years later on Clarke's first day at Valley High.
The principal said he sits in the cafeteria each day to be accessible to students. He wasn't in the lunchroom just for Clarke, but Clarke was the bonus, he said.
"All the credit goes to Jack," Miller said. "He has a magnetism about him. Anything that people have done to help him, they've done because of the way he is."
That help — from family, friends, teachers and doctors — went a long way to getting Clarke to Sunday's graduation ceremony.
The Valley graduate is heading to Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny next fall.
And he's already got some lunch dates planned this summer with Miller, who is retiring at the end of June.
"We'll see each other one way or another," the principal said. "We said we were going out together."

YEREVAN (Reuters) - The Armenian opposition leader who helped force the country's prime minister to resign called on supporters to stage a rally on Wednesday after planned talks with the ruling Republican Party were cancelled.
Serzh Sarksyan, who previously served as Armenia's president for a decade, resigned as prime minister on Monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power.
"The Republican Party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan's resignation and wants to keep power," opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan said in a video appeal posted on his Facebook page after he led thousands of people on a march on Tuesday.
"We can't agree on the appointment of this party's representative as prime minister and we can't allow this corrupted system to continue to exist," he said, urging supporters "to come to the square and finish the velvet revolution."
Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sarksyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released. He had been set to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday.
Sarksyan was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.
Acting Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of the ousted Sarksyan, called on the president to organise another meeting, where all political forces could participate.
"Being concerned by the current situation. ... I'm calling on the president to organise the meeting ... with the participation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary political forces," Karapetyan said in a statement posted on his website.
Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the ex-premier, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament.
Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post.
The opposition and ruling party could not agree on an agenda or format for Wednesday's meeting, although Karapetyan said one of the topics at a rescheduled session could be holding early parliamentary elections, something Pashinyan was insisting on.
'READY TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER'
In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia's closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said on Tuesday he was ready to be the country's next premier and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change.
"If people put this responsibility on me, I'm ready to become the prime minister," Pashinyan, wearing his trademark black baseball cap and military-style T-shirt, told reporters.
The 42-year-old politician said the velvet revolution he had helped bring about was not over and that the next step would be the election of a new prime minister by parliament and the holding of an early parliamentary election.
If elected, Pashinyan said he would try to maintain a balance in foreign policy, but ruled out challenging the presence of Russian military bases in Armenia or the country's membership in Russia-led military and economic alliances.
"We are not going to make any sharp geopolitical moves," he said.
Many experts said it was too early to predict what lies ahead.
"What is needed is a sober power-sharing reconfiguration," said Richard Giragosian, a director of the Yerevan-based Regional Studies Centre.
"Yet such consensus and compromise seems very far away, and with mounting expectations and anger dangerously high, the real challenge of governance is only just beginning."

Cardiff: Pakistan Sarfraz Ahmed on Wednesday credited the support staff for keeping the team in good spirits after heavy loss against India, following which the side staged a sensational turnaround to reach the Champions Trophy final.
"Credit goes to the bowlers. We really bowled well. Mohammad Amir did not play but Rumman Raees came and bowled really well," said Sarfraz after Pakistan stunned England in the first semifinal on Wednesday.
What led to the turnaround after the India game?
"After India, every game was a knockout game, I said to the players to just play your game. The team management also kept motivating us," he said.
Asked about a possible re-match in the final on Sunday, Sarfraz said: "Both teams (India and Bangladesh) are playing well, so we will play whoever gets through."
He was all praise for pacer Hasan Ali, who took a three wicket haul for the third time in a row.
"He's very impressive, hopefully he will do that in the final. Whenever he comes on he's getting wickets."
England captain Eoin Morgan said his team did not simply adapt to the conditions.
"We did not adapt to conditions. Pakistan outplayed us. It was a used pitch but you should be able to play on all kinds of surface at this level."
"Pakistan did that well and played better. We did prepare, Pakistan bowled well but we didn't adjust and 200 isn't competitive, 250-270 would be a good score."
Whether used pitch was a factor in the unexpected loss, Morgan said: "It's a test... There wasn't too much wrong. We bowled okay but 200 was well under par."
"We continue to learn, everything we did was calculated, but Pakistan had played on the wicket previously and that helped. You have to adapt in knockout cricket, so it's an important lesson."

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15, (APP): Adviser to Prime Minister on National History and Literary Heritage (NHLH), Irfan Siddiqui Wednesday in a meeting held here formally approved the proposal submitted by National Book Foundation (NBF) to arrange a three-day annual National Book Fair on April 22 this year.
The meeting was held in the premises of NHLH Division and attended by Secretary NHLH Division, Aamir Hasan, Joint Secretary, Mashhood Mirza, Deputy Secretary (Heritage), Nazir Ahmad, Managing Director NBF, Dr. Inam ul Haq Javed and other officials.
The meeting was held to discuss the arrangements for the three-day National Book Fair which is the part of the NHLH Division' activities to mark National Book Day on April 22.
Adviser to Prime Minister, Irfan Siddiqui said the efforts of NBF for arranging National Book Fair annually were appreciable and National Book Day would be marked with a renewed spirit and zeal this year.
Emphasizing the promotion of book reading culture among younger generation, he said the societies which ignored the importance of books could not achieve progress and development and always lack human and civilizational values.

Losing to the Jaguars.
Seattle became the latest club to do it, and they weren't thrilled with the feeling of Sunday's 30-24 defeat in Jacksonville.
The rough-and-tumble loss for Seattle ended with Seahawks defenders Michael Bennett and Sheldon Richardson sparking an on-field fight and defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson being tossed from the game as the final seconds ticked away.
"Teams aren't used to getting beat by the Jags," Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles said after the win, per Brian Chojnacki of First Coast News. "We beat the crap out of them for 60 minutes."
The Seahawks fought back from a 27-10 deficit with another dose of fourth-quarter magic from quarterback Russell Wilson, who dialed up a pair of long touchdown strikes to keep his team alive. This time, though, it wasn't enough as Bortles countered with mistake-free football to pass for 268 yards and two big-time scoring throws of his own against a banged-up Seahawks defense.
The win moved Jacksonville to 9-4 on the year -- all alone atop the AFC South -- a newfound view for this longtime punching bag.
"I haven't been to the playoffs yet, but I have been there in Madden," Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey said. "Today was kind of like that."
Said defensive lineman Malik Jackson: "I came here to the Jaguars at the perfect time. I saw it when it was ugly to where we are now."
Where they are now, make no mistake, is on the threshold of a powerful playoff spot. With games left against the Texans and 49ers, it's entirely possible Jacksonville rolls into their regular-season finale against the Titans with a chance to go 12-4.
Record aside, this team looms as a massive headache for opponents when Bortles is staying away from game-crushing errors. Toss in one of the better defenses we've seen in many moons and Jacksonville has the chance to do much more than frustrate Seattle down the stretch.
