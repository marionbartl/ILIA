Well, it's a new year, and if you're Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna, that it's a brand-new opportunity to repeat the exact same mistakes you made in 2016!
As you may recall, ChyRo ended the year with a bang when Blac left Rob and took the couple's one-month old baby, Dream, just one week before Christmas.
Rob and Blac had broken up several times in the past, but this time it seemed as though they were really done for good – until New Year's Eve, when they were spotted partying together like nothing ever happened:
Yes, in the video above, Rob can be seen sporting their formal black t-shirt and baseball cap as they and Blac ring in 2017 like two people who aren't constantly on the verge of murdering one another.
Proving once again that they might be the most dramatic couple on reality TV, Rob and Blac reportedly reunited in an LA-area hospital when they were admitted for a diabetes flare-up last week.
Sources say the troubled 29-year-old had been binge-eating and drinking heavily in the wake of their and Blac's latest breakup, and they rushed to the emergency room when they …read more

OTTAWA — A Liberal MP who is facing an allegation of assault after a weekend visit to a Halifax bar is speaking out, calling the whole thing a case of mistaken identity.
Francis Drouin, who represents the eastern Ontario riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, has issued a statement detailing their version of what happened in Halifax in the early hours of Saturday morning.
In it, Drouin — who was in Halifax for the federal Liberal policy convention — says that while they were chatting with friends, they heard a woman shouting from another part of the bar.
"While I was standing facing the bar, with my credit card in hand, I heard what I believed to be a woman's voice coming from another area of the establishment behind me, yelling that their buttocks had been grabbed," the statement says.
"Her comments were clearly not directed towards me."
Drouin says they then shouted for the alleged perpetrator to be evicted from the bar, paid for their drink with their credit card and proceeded with their friends to another area of the establishment.
That's when they say a woman with a cellphone "mistakenly" tried to connect them to the alleged incident.
"We told them that they were mistaken. We left the establishment shortly thereafter."
Drouin says they proactively informed the Prime Minister's Office and the government whip's office, and has been co-operating fully with a police investigation into the matter. A number of witness interviews have been gathered, they added.
They reiterated statements they made over the weekend stressing the importance of ensuring individuals are supported in a safe way when they come forward with allegations — but insists that in this case, it was all just a big misunderstanding.
Rebellion, publisher of the “Sniper Elite” series, announced new VR game “Arca's Path” on Wednesday morning and released a teaser trailer.
“Arca's Path” follows a young girl who must make their way out of the dangerous labyrinth of Arca to find their way home. They must use skill and intuition to tear down the walls of the enchanting world of Arca. The intuitive play style of “Arca's Path” will not rely on using a controller.
The teaser trailer shows off the colorful and abstract world of Arca, but doesn't reveal much about gameplay.
Publisher Rebellion has released PC, console, mobile and online titles. “Arca's Path” looks to be a bit of a departure from the studio's usual fare. As the publisher of “Aliens Vs. Predator” and the “Zombie Army Trilogy,” they usually aim to thrill with their titles.
Rebellion's newest title is being developed by Dream Reality Interactive. The London-based developer is best known for “PlayStation VR Worlds” and the augmented reality mobile game “Orbu.” They also developed the AR interactive book series “Wonderbook.”
“Arca's Path” will be demoed at E3 next month in Los Angeles, and will be coming to PlayStation VR, Steam VR, Oculus Rift, Oculus Go and Gear VR at an unspecified date later this year.
Rebellion and Dream Reality Interactive are just two of many studios set to demo new titles at E3 this year, which runs from June 12 to June 14.

Jaguar I-Pace concept, 2016 Los Angeles auto show Enlarge Photo
Jaguar is poised to trump its German rivals in the mainstream electric car race by launching the new I-Pace electric SUV this year.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz won't have their electric SUVs, the production versions of the respective e-tron Quattro and Generation EQ concepts, ready until 2018. BMW is even further behind as its offering, an electric X3, isn't due until 2020.
Production of the I-Pace is already underway at independent vehicle manufacturer Magna Steyr's plant in Austria and the first examples are due in showrooms in Europe this year, most likely following a debut at the 2017 Frankfurt auto show in September.

Jaguar has previously confirmed that the I-Pace will reach showrooms in the United States in the second half of 2018, meaning we'll likely see it arrive as a 2019 model.
Speaking with Automotive News (subscription required), Magna Steyr's president of vehicle technology and engineering, Karl-Friedrich Stracke, who previously worked for General Motors, explained that the I-Pace's swift transition from concept to production was made possible due to the manufacturing team being involved in the project early on.
“[Magna Steyr] were invited very early in the product development time frame in order to provide our process and manufacturing engineering proposals,” they said.

This is made all the more impressive when you consider the I-Pace is based on a dedicated platform for electric cars and features an aluminum body constructed using several new joining methods. It will have a 90-kilowatt-hour battery, 220-mile range, and a motor for each axle delivering a combined 400 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.
While we know Jaguar developed its own lithium-ion batteries, which use pouch cells for their energy density and efficiency, what isn't clear is where the automaker will source them.
A production-ready I-Pace was spotted in May in undisguised form. It had some minor differences compared to the concept such as larger side mirrors and a toned-down front bumper design.
WWE SmackDown Live Results 14th February 2017, Latest SmackDown Live winners, review and video highlights
A massive triple threat WWE Championship match and more.
@pratyayghSK by Pratyay Ghosh Report 15 Feb 2017, 08:23 IST
The first episode of SmackDown Live after Elimination Chamber came to us from Anaheim, California. The show was stacked as usual and headline by a massive WWE Championship match. Without delay, let's get straight to what happened on the show.
Bray Wyatt comes out for the first time as WWE Champion
Bray Wyatt came out to chants of “You deserve it”. They came out and addressed the crowd saying that they knew that this day would come – the day they would be WWE Champion. They then added that at this moment they had the whole world in their hand. The crowd replied by singing “He's got the whole world in their hands”.
Wyatt went on to say that too much power could be scary but not for him. They told the fans that if they walked by their side, he'd lead them to paradise but if they stood in their way, they'd burn before finishing off by welcoming the fans to the ‘era of Wyatt'.
John Cena's music hits. They come out and says that Bray brainwashed the fans into getting behind them but no one deserved anything and they had to earn everything. Cena added that the title was a target on Wyatt's back and then reminded Wyatt of the fact that they had a title match when AJ Styles' music hit.
Styles said that Cena may have gotten to skip lines everywhere but not when it came to their title rematch. Styles then reminded Cena that he'd beat them several times before adding that they knew that they could beat Wyatt too. AJ then demanded a one-on-one match with Bray Wyatt for the WWE Championship when Daniel Bryan's music hit.
The first thing Daniel Bryan did after coming out was congratulating Bray Wyatt on winning the WWE Championship. They said that since both Cena and Styles were owed a rematch, they would face Wyatt in a triple threat match in the main event for the WWE Championship.
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States appears to have shelved an “all or nothing” approach to North Korean denuclearization as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to head back to North Korea this week hoping to agree a roadmap for its nuclear disarmament.

Pompeo will spend a day and a half in North Korea on Friday and Saturday on what will be their third trip to the country this year, and their first since an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12.
It will be Pompeo's first overnight stop in the country, with which the United States had remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.
At the Singapore summit, Kim made a broad commitment to “work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” but has made no mention of how or when Pyongyang might give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States and its allies.
U.S. officials have since been trying to flesh out an agreement critics say is short on substance and map a route to a deal that might live up to Trump's enthusiastic portrayal of the summit outcome.
But U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had been no sign of a breakthrough and little progress towards even defining the keys terms of any agreement.
What has been seen instead is an apparent softening in the Trump administration's approach, in spite of what U.S. officials say are intelligence assessments saying that North Korea is continuing to deceive Washington about its weapons programs.
The U.S. administration has previously demanded that North Korea agree to abandon its entire nuclear program before it could expect any relief from tough international sanctions. Ahead of the Singapore summit, Pompeo said Trump would reject anything short of “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.”
But following talks on Sunday between U.S. envoy Sung Kim and North Korean counterparts to set up Pompeo's latest Pyongyang visit, this “CVID” mantra appears suddenly to have disappeared from the State Department lexicon.
It says pressure will remain until North Korea denuclearizes, but in statements this week, has redefined the U.S. goal as “the final, fully verified denuclearization of (North Korea) as agreed to by Chairman Kim.”
STEP BACK
Two U.S. officials said the Trump administration had stepped back from its CVID demand on South Korea's advice.
The South Koreans, who have been pursuing their own talks with North Korea, argued that step-by-step negotiations were more likely to be successful than insisting Pyongyang yield to all U.S. demands before any concessions.
There was also a realization, one official said, that maintaining Chinese and Russian cooperation over North Korea would be “more problematic if the U.S. stuck to an all-or-nothing posture.”
The official said that the North Koreans had largely refused in talks with Sung Kim to respond to attempts to define the key terms of an eventual agreement, including the words complete, verifiable and irreversible.
“The choice was either bend it or break it,” one of the officials said.
A senior South Korean official told U.S. officials in a meeting in Washington last month that the U.S. side should stop pressing for CVID, which North Korea saw as a recipe for unilateral disarmament that would leave it vulnerable to regime change, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
The South Korean official suggested that the U.S. instead refer to “mutual threat reduction,” the source said.
The official also argued that it would be difficult to inspect North Korean nuclear and missile facilities in a conventional way involving “hundreds” of international investigators, as Pyongyang would be unlikely to accept.
Patrick Cronin of the Center for a New American Security, an Asia expert in close touch with U.S. and South Korean officials, said the thinking seemed to be that although Kim would not want to give up their entire nuclear program anytime soon, they might be willing to dismantle major portions of it.
“The U.S. may be exploring the degree to which they will dismantle major programs within the coming months, and if dropping some language to do this is required, Washington seems willing to do that at this point,” they said.
“Because verified denuclearization of the main elements of a nuclear and missile program is the best that can be hoped for, Washington has quietly begun emphasizing final, fully verified denuclearization,” they said.
“Ambiguity in language may open up space for agreement despite the fact that interlocutors have different goals in mind. This is what is occurring right now as Washington and Pyongyang engage in talks to determine whether a workable deal is possible.”
White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Sunday the bulk of North Korea's weapons programs could be dismantled within a year - “if they have the strategic decision already made to do that.”
On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert declined give a timeframe for North Korea's denuclearization.
“I know some individuals have given timelines; we're not going to provide a timeline for that,” they said. “A lot of work is left to be done, certainly. We go into these eyes wide open.”
The hospital at police line headquarters Islamabad has been upgraded along with enhancement of beds capacity and provision of modern medical machinery there. Basic facilities like X-ray, ECG, Diabetes Clinic and others have been provided there while two air-conditioned general medical wards have been step up along with capacity of ten beds each there. Moreover, an officer ward of four beds will be also operational while sample collection center for medical tests has been also set up, police source said on Wednesday.—APP

A short-term debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that is meant for investments of about 1-3 years, though it works well even if you wish to invest for up to four years.
A short-term debt fund comes with a reasonable amount of risk and aims to give relatively stable returns. It is like an alternative for your fixed deposits (FDs) of equivalent tenures. However, if you hold a short-term debt fund for at least three years, it becomes more tax-efficient than an FD, though the funds are also riskier.
Some short-term funds were more volatile earlier because they used to invest in higher duration scrips. The good news is that new rules for the mutual fund industry don't allow a short-term fund to take undue risks as it can only invest in scrips that have a duration of 1-3 years. While short-term debt funds can't take excessive interest rate risks anymore, some of them can take credit risks.
During an asset allocation exercise for your portfolio, a short-term debt fund generally works well as a proxy for your debt component. Financial planners recommend that investors can take their share of risks in equity investments, but for debt allocation, low-risk instruments work well. So, a short-term debt fund fits in.
Stephen and Maura Caldwell both use the phrase “things I can't unsee.” When their son William was diagnosed with heart issues before they were born, the Caldwells — both musicians and music teachers — entered a world they'd never even imagined. They saw their son turn blue because their heart wasn't pumping properly. They saw them come out of open-heart surgery battered and bloody. And they saw other parents in the cardiac ICU deal with the loss of their babies.
They're still living in a world they never expected, but it's easier now. Now it's seven days a week of physical, occupational, speech and feeding therapies. It's helping William, who is 19 months old, learn to eat by mouth instead of being fed through a tube into their stomach. It's knowing they face more surgeries and being ever vigilant for telltale signs that their heart might not be functioning properly. But it's also watching proudly as they coo and gurgles and tries to talk, as they take their first steps, as they bang on the piano and laughs.
Heart defects are the most common of all birth defects, affecting one in every 100 children, says Stephen Caldwell, who is director of choral activities at the University of Arkansas. “Some of them don't need any surgeries at all, and other kids are born with defects that are incompatible with life,” they say. Not only did they find very few people were aware of issues like William's, but even fewer realized what their birth might mean to their parents.
“That's the untold story,” they say. “Parents get very little support — emotional, financial, whatever. I thought it was important to tell some of William's story from that perspective.”
As a composer, Caldwell naturally turned to music. The result — almost a year in the making — is “Pre-Existing Condition,” debuting March 15 with the voices of the UA's premiere vocal group, Schola Cantorum, along with students on piano, flute, marimba, vibraphone/glockenspiel and drum. Spending the summer of 2017 writing it was, they say, “cathartic.”
“Now that's they stable and healthy and growing and developing, now I can look back and kind of comment and tell the story for my own sake,” they say. “At the time, we didn't have the choice to be a wreck. I was trying to keep my job. They were in Little Rock in the hospital for months. Maura was with him. I was commuting almost daily — and trying to maintain our house and feed the cat and grade these papers — and now I can talk about that — about the anger and the fear and the frustration. It certainly was a way to have dealt with some of those emotions — but not something I could have written at the time.”
William's story started in the seventh month of pregnancy as “the quintessential prenatal ultrasound where everybody was chatting and everything was routine — and then the technician got very quiet,” Caldwell remembers. The next day, they and Maura were at a specialist, and the next day at another specialist — where the nurse followed the doctor in with a box of tissues — then in Little Rock, where William was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot, a cluster of four heart defects. When they were born at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia — the area both Stephen and Maura are from — they were whisked away immediately and diagnosed with not four but seven heart issues.
Caldwell's composition starts with that moment during the ultrasound when they knew something was horribly wrong and includes movements about all the medical terminology they didn't understand, the roller coaster ride of the next few months and the “Scars” — both the physical ones William has and the emotional ones their parents never expected.
“I never imagined a heart ward for babies,” Maura Caldwell says, “let alone one in every big city in every state. One in 100 babies. That's a lot of babies going through this — and they have all sorts of different abilities and disabilities and developmental delays. Once you're in that world, there's no unseeing it. And I had no idea it even existed.”
“I hope listeners can kind of experience that journey and find in it a greater compassion,” Stephen concludes.

Amanda Bynes is staying silent no more over a series of bizarre claims being made by an impersonator. The "Easy A" starlet went back to Twitter to deny claims over a Twitter user impersonating them saying that they are pregnant and getting married.
In a series of tweets, Twitter user @persianla27 has reportedly been impersonating Amanda Bynes. The account even tweeted a photo of a woman that looks like the actor with a caption greeting its followers with a "Happy Valentine's Day." According to E! News, the Amanda Bynes impersonator even said that they are going to the doctor to confirm their pregnancy after testing positive on a home kit.
Amanda Bynes took to Twitter again after 6 months of hiatus to shut down the rumors. The former child star wrote on their account and tagged the impersonator stating that they are not pregnant and getting married. It seems they have also reported the fraudulent account as they expressed their frustration over why Twitter has not taken it down. As of this writing, the account claiming to be Amanda Bynes is still in operation.

Following their performance for the 34th annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. event at the Marcus Center for Performing Arts, the local dance company ONFYAH celebrated their third birthday in time to go on tour.
“A lot of these shows they did last year were a lot of community organizations, grassroots, said Co-Founder and Director of ONFYAH, Akinyomi Courtney. “This year, you can look at the names and say, ‘hey there must be some contracts.'”
ONFYAH (Our Nation For Youth Arts and Healing) was created in 2016 by Courtney and Jo'Niece Monk, who have created a second family for children ages three to 19 and their parents within the community.
ONFYAH will be performing around college campuses such as UW-Milwaukee, Carroll University, and St. Norbert College, as well as other community centers and schools, adding up to 15 major performances in February alone.
“They get more excited for this than anything else,” Courtney said about the semi-annual shows the children participate in. Last year, the ONFYAH Company performed in 18 shows over the course of 28 days.
The company will be joined by hip-hop dancer, Chris Gilbert as well as members from the community to help support the children during the second half of the scheduled events.
ONFYAH stepped up into a new world after booking the Marcus Center's Martin Luther King Jr. celebration. Courtney said their troop has had multiple bookings in only a short amount of time.
“It's been call after call and it's like, finally!” Courtney said. “This is our third year now and we have done over a hundred shows.”
ONFYAH had the chance to perform in front of a crowd of thousands for Bernie Sander's Madison and Milwaukee rallies back in 2016, as well as events that take them to Washington D.C. to perform.
“It just shows you how much of our culture people are enjoying,” Courtney said about the positivity surrounding ONFYAH and its African dance roots.
The dance company during it's first year started out with the children preforming at local churches in the area, which Courtney said many of the churches wouldn't have allowed such performances when they were younger.
“Last year, I was in a culture shock in my own culture [because] all the black churches wanted us now, and I was like ‘wow, this is such a turn around,'” Courtney said.
ONFYAH had been preparing for their tour, which started on the first of February, by finding transportation for the group to travel to and from events as far as De Pere.
“Our kids are so professional and so on point,” Courtney said. “It's awesome having a professional children's company.”
On Feb. 1, the company performed at the County Courthouse, as well as UWM and G.E and United Healthcare.
“Honestly, I just love the kids, I am just genuine with them. I listen to them and they listen to me.” Courtney said.

Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series "Game of Thrones," the Associated Press reported on Sunday.
The hackers, who broke into HBO's computer network and have released stolen information for several weeks, provided more unaired episodes, including the popular show "Curb Your Enthusiasm, " which returns in October.
They also leaked episodes of "Insecure," "Ballers" and "The Deuce," according to the Associated Press.
Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) HBO said Sunday in an emailed statement that it was "not in communication with the hacker, and we're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released."
"It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO," it said. "The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. That's a game we're not going to participate in."
HBO acknowledged the hack earlier this summer. It said the thieves had been leaking stolen materials and asking for a multi-million-dollar ransom.
The hack came at a sensitive time for HBO parent Time Warner as it awaits regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T Inc (T.N) in a $85.4 billion deal announced in October.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  A lawsuit over restrictions on talk about homosexuality in Utah classrooms has been settled after the state changed the law in a case that sets the stage for challenges to similar measures in other states, LGBT-rights groups said Friday.
Attorneys said the rules banning "advocacy of homosexuality" created a culture of silence for LGBT students, making them feel like they weren't worthy of respect or discussion.
"This is going to make the climate in Utah schools so much better," National Center for Lesbian Rights attorney Christopher Stoll said.
The Utah Attorney General's Office said state attorneys were pleased to work with the group Equality Utah and settle the case in a way that makes sure Utah public-school students aren't discriminated against, said spokesperson Dan Burton in a statement.

Several other states still have similar measures on the books, including Arizona, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas, Stoll said.
The Utah law passed in 2001 was originally aimed at sex-education classes, but it had also been cited in other cases, like when a book about lesbian mothers was pulled from a school-library shelf in 2013.
The plaintiffs also said the rules blocked teachers from protecting a 7-year-old boy from bullies who beat them and burned them on a hot slide because they sometimes wore girls' clothes. The boy's mother was told school staff couldn't tell other kids it was OK to be gay or wear girl's clothes, according to the lawsuit filed last fall.
The settlement includes a safety plan for that child and policy changes at Weber County schools, as well as unspecified cash compensation, Stoll said.
Lawmakers voted in March to change the law to ban "advocacy of premarital or extramarital sexual activity," rather than homosexuality. Republican leaders in the conservative state said the change lets LGBT students know they are welcome while still making it clear teachers should not promote sex outside marriage.
The legal settlement was finalized after the Utah State Board of Education also changed its policies.
Clifford Rosky with Equality Utah, which was also a plaintiff, said in a statement those changes make it clear "every student in Utah public schools is entitled to an education free from all manner of bullying or discrimination."
DETROIT (AP)  Detroit police say two officers have been wounded in a shooting while responding to a reported burglary on the citys west side.
Chief James Craig says several calls were made to police Sunday about a possible burglary and when officers responded about 11:45 p.m. a 19-year-old man fired a shotgun from inside the home. Craig says an officer was shot in the face and the other was wounded in the arm.
The officer shot in the face was in critical condition and the other, who may have been hit by shrapnel, was expected to be OK.
They were outside when they were fired upon. Craig says the shooter may not have realized police were at the door. Craig says the man, their mother and a sibling were taken into custody.

By ABC News – Lexi and Danny Reed of Terre Haute, Indiana, have lost a collective 400 pounds together in two years.
“Doing this as a couple has helped us in so many ways,” Lexi Reed, 27, told ABC News. “On days when we were unmotivated, we pushed each other to go to the gym. We also started meal-prepping together, setting goals, and day by day or pound by pound we grew closer throughout our journey.”
What started as a New Year's resolution has led to a viral Instagram account, @fatgirlfedup, documenting their inspiring weight loss journey together with a whopping 463,000 followers.
When the couple started their mission to shed the weight, Lexi Reed was 485 pounds and Danny Reed was 280 pounds.
“I went from a size 28 to a size 10,” said Lexi Reed.
“I went from a 46 all the way down to a 32,” Danny Reed, 29, added.
Lexi Reed said they “were fed up with the life [they] were living” so they set out to make a change, hitting the gym, eating healthy and documenting it all on their Instagram account.
“I never expected to have such an impact,” they said. “I just wanted to get healthy.”
Fitness experts say one key to success is having someone else to lean on.
“A workout partner is key. Accountability is everything,” celebrity fitness trainer Latreal Mitchell told ABC News. “Not every day you're going to want to go out there and give it your all. At least you'll have someone to say, ‘Come on. Today is my day to uplift you and vice versa.'”
Danny Reed now weighs 191 pounds and Lexi is down to 182, but they said this was no easy feat.
“The hardest part of our journey was changing our relationship with food,” said Lexi Reed. “When I was 485 pounds, I never cooked. My husband and I would go out to eat for almost every single meal and if we did cook at home, it was frozen pizza or anything else unhealthy. We found that by meal-prepping instead of relying on fast food, we were able to stick with our goals when we were at work. And by learning to cook our own meals we were in charge of what we were eating. We were willing to learn every single day of our journey and we also started using the gym as therapy instead of food. By changing our minds, habits and emotional triggers, we changed our lives.”
The happy couple is excited to head into 2018 being the healthiest versions of themselves.
“There are no words to explain the feeling of saving your own life,” said Lexi Reed. “Going into 2018 I have nothing but a newfound happiness for this life I am living. I no longer am a prisoner in my own body and instead of just existing in my own life, I'm finally alive. Every day I wake up is a blessing.”
I flipped on the TV earlier today to watch some golf you know since it's US Open week and well, I watch golf everyday, and the TV was left on CBS from the night before and the first thing I see is that there was a shooting in VA! First thought was, ‘Oh God no. Not another terrorist shooting.' (It's sad that the thought is something that would even occur.)

DHAKA - More than 100 alleged drug dealers have been killed and thousands detained in Bangladesh in the past fortnight in a Philippines-style narcotics crackdown that has raised concerns about extrajudicial killings.
Police said ten more alleged traffickers were gunned down in the early hours of Tuesday, some in shootouts with police and others in so-called gang wars between dealers.
A total of 102 suspected traffickers have been killed since Bangladesh launched an aggressive war on drugs in mid-May to smash the surging trade in yaba, a cheap pill combining methamphetamine and caffeine.
“We are saying that this war will continue until we bring it under complete control,” Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told AFP.
Around 12,000 accused dealers have been arrested and tried in special courts since the crackdown began on May 15, with many handed jail sentences of seven days to six months, they added.
Khan said there was “no question” that those killed were drug dealers, despite allegations by rights groups that innocent people had died.
“Most of those who were killed had guns. They opened fire as soon as they saw the police,” they said. “They are not good people. There are 10 to 12 (criminal) cases against each of them.”
But the National Human Rights Commission this week expressed “grave concern” at the mounting death toll and sounded the alarm over alleged extrajudicial killings.
The Rapid Action Battalion, an elite police unit in charge of the sweep, said all 24 people killed by its forces were “top drug traders” but provided no evidence.
One of those killed was a councillor from Teknaf whom supporters say had no involvement with drugs. The rest died in late-night shootouts with police or shootouts among themselves over turf and drugs, officials said.
Among those killed Tuesday were two alleged kingpins apparently found dead by police after a so-called drugs war in Jessore district, local police chief A.K.M Ajmal Huda told AFP.
“We found the bodies after the gunfight between two rival groups of drug traders,” they said.
Bangladesh has struggled to contain the trade in “yaba”, with hundreds of millions of pills entering the country from Myanmar.
Authorities last year seized a record 40 million pills but said an estimated 250-300 million others entered the market.
The fearsome Chicago four-piece Melkbelly released their debut album, Nothing Valley, last fall, and they've been on the road since then, opening for the likes of the Breeders, Bully, and Protomartyr. They're about to embark on some more dates, but before they do they're sharing this excellent cover of Basement Jaxx's “Where's Your Head At.”
It's a curious choice for a cover, especially from this band, but the early '00s British dance track adapts surprisingly well to the group's frantic energy. Their version is just as busy and frenzied, but all that is channeled through the band's pent-up blend of noise and pop; a switch halfway through the track layers on the distortion and disorientation even more. Miranda Winters' vocals are more detached and streamlined than the samples that pepper the original, creating an atmosphere that's both intimidating and a lot of fun.
The band had this to say about the cover: “A great way to combat the current bleakness of life is with loud music that you can yell and jump around to. This song is that. It also reminds us that anyone can get mentally/emotionally exhausted so check in with yourself and call your friends!”

Lahore - At least 10 people were injured in Spin Bolduk district of Afghanistan, near Chaman border, as reports of explosions at a military depot emerged late Monday.
People on Pakistani side of the border reported loud back-to-back blasts and high flames across the border around 2am, according to TV channel reports.
The security forces on Pakistan side were put on high alert, and it was unclear what caused the explosions at the Afghan depot – amid fears of a militant attack.
The reported injured were civilians who got hurt by the rockets flying from the under-fire depot and landing at nearby civilian population.
There was immediately no official word about the toll of Afghan soldiers posted at the depot till the filing of this report.
The Afghan Army had blocked access to the burning depot, from where rockets continued flying out in the darkness of the night.
Reportedly, alert was sounded in the Chaman hospital – anticipating a request by the Afghan authorities for provision of medical aid.
Spin Bolduk district is in Qandhar province which is well-known for its history of militancy.
The incidents come only days after the US dropped a massive bomb on IS positions in Nangarhar province, which also borders Pakistan.
At least 30 militants were killed immediately by the GBU-43/B, dubbed the “Mother Of All Bombs”. The toll surged to 90 within a couple of days. The unprecedented attack triggered global shockwaves, with some condemning the use of Afghanistan as what they called a testing ground for the weapon, and against a militant group that is not considered a threat as big as the resurgent Taliban.
The Chaman border, along with Torkhan crossing, was closed for almost a month following a string of terrorist attacks in Pakistan - which the officials claimed were planed and launched from Afghanistan. The border was opened on March 20, but Chaman crossing was closed again on April 1 after clashes between border personnel and travellers, who lost patience at slow process of biometric verification - introduced to check militants' cross-border movement.

The financial woes of Sears Canada and Hudson's Bay have highlighted a painful trend for the department stores that once dominated Canada's retail landscape — it's best to avoid the “mushy middle.”The rise of online shopping and a widening wealth gap are seen as factors squeezing midline retailers that try to be all things to all people, with customers now favouring either luxury retailers, such as Nordstrom or Saks Fifth Avenue, or discount shops like profit-machine Dollarama.“Department stores have been suffering challenges for some time now,” said Marty Weintraub, who leads Deloitte's national retail consulting practice for Canada.Sears Canada, for instance, has seen its store count sink over the last few years. In January 2011, it had 181 department, Sears Home and outlet shops. By April of this year, that figure was down to 127.The retailer, along with the Bay, is the survivors of a business model with an entrenched history in Canada. Simpsons, Woodward's and Eaton's are just a few of the chains on a growing list of companies that have come and gone.Article Continued BelowBetween 2012 and 2017, department store revenue fell by an annualized rate of 0.1 per cent to $28.1 billion, according to a report by market-research firm IBISWorld. Over the next five years, the revenue decline is expected to accelerate by an annualized rate of 0.4 per cent, the report said.Weintraub said the woes facing traditional department stores are due to consumers shopping online more and choosing specialty boutiques over one-stop shops.“The notion of the mushy middle, which is tried to be everything to everybody, is what folks are moving away from,” they said.

Masai Ujiri is very good at waiting, which not everyone can do. It's like how some actors used to smoke in movies so they would have something to do with their hands when they weren't doing anything else. It's a skill, being convincing without doing too much at all. Last week, with the Raptors in an extended skid, the idea running through the front office was, maybe we should just let this team get healthy, and prove itself. See if it could beat Boston or Washington or Atlanta or whoever in the first or second round. See if the Raptors could hack a path through to Cleveland again. Let it ride, and reap whatever whirlwind at the end. Then Ujiri waited it out, and things changed. And on Tuesday the Raptors traded eternal what-if Terrence Ross and a low first-round pick to the flailing Orlando Magic for power forward Serge Ibaka. It is the most consequential acquisition of Ujiri's career with the Raptors. It is a declaration, a signal of intent: We are serious. Let's go. “I also think with where we are as a team . . . the coaches, where Kyle and DeMar are, our organization, fans, I think it's a good boost for us to have to see if we can bring us some good momentum,” said Ujiri, “and see where it takes us.” For Ujiri, this is a departure. They have nipped and tucked, but aside from a Kyle Lowry trade to New York in 2013 that fell apart at the other end, they almost always deferred the big ideas to the future. The franchise's owners love him; they have a new contract. There was no organizational pressure, not really. Ujiri could wait, if need be.
Article Continued Below
But Ujiri always keeps their options open. It wasn't Kevin Love's knee surgery in Cleveland that pushed this move. It wasn't Lowry, who entered Tuesday night tied for first in the NBA in minutes played per game, telling reporters after the Detroit collapse Sunday night that something had to change. Yes, Sunday night exhumed Lowry's old battles with coach Dwane Casey. Yes, the notion that this offence relies too little on ball movement and too much on isolation, and especially the tunnel vision of DeMar DeRozan, returned. But these Raptors had been playing all season with a one-legged DeMarre Carroll and a collection of young big men that made Patrick Patterson indispensable, and Ujiri decided that the team deserved a shot at success, at an acceptable price. At the draft Oklahoma City had asked for the No. 9 pick, Norman Powell, Cory Joseph and Patterson for Ibaka. The Raptors passed. As the teams talked last week, Orlando's price looked similar to what Atlanta wanted for Paul Millsap last month: Patterson, Ross, a first-round pick and a young player. The Raptors weren't interested. They waited. And with Ross and Powell to choose from, and an extra first-rounder from the Clippers, the path opened up. The Raptors can now roll out a lineup of Lowry and DeRozan, a suddenly sharpshooting Carroll, Ibaka — shooting 38 per cent from three-point range this year — and Jonas Valanciunas. And when teams go small, Ibaka can play centre and switch pick-and-rolls, the way Bismack Biyombo did last season.
It is, within Ujiri's range of options, an acceptable risk. Ibaka isn't in their prime. Their rebounding and especially their shot-blocking numbers have been declining for the past few years: They blocked 5.0 and 4.1 shots per 100 possessions in 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively; that number the past three seasons has been 3.7, 2.9, and 2.6.  They are listed at 27 years old, but people around the league have long speculated the Congolese big man is older than that.  They are not the monster rim defender they were a few years ago, even if he's still better than anything the Raptors have. But the genius of this is, Ujiri's options are still open. This is the biggest risk they have taken, yes. Re-signing Lowry and Ibaka — who have the same agent, Andy Miller — would send the Raptors into the expensive luxury-tax territory, before Patterson's free agency factors in. And it's still unlikely to be enough to topple LeBron James this season, even if the chances have improved. But the pressure isn't on Ujiri: it's on their team. Ujiri has enough political capital that if this team flops, they could still decide on a radical new direction: blow up the top end, hand the team to the youngsters, hope to rise again when LeBron falls. The Raptors intend to re-sign Ibaka and Lowry. But things can change. “We're happy to have the rights to these players,” said Ujiri, referring to the ability to exceed the salary cap for all three, “and we'll see what it brings us.” No, what Masai Ujiri did was remove the excuses. Now DeRozan has shooters to find, and it's up to them to find them. Now Casey has forwards, and it's up to them to meld them. Now Lowry has help, and it's up to them to make it work. Ujiri could have waited, but decided to give this team — the team that has accomplished more than any team in franchise history, flaws and all — a chance, with no guarantees. The rest, between now and the hazy future of the summer, is up to them.

Chris Pratt accepts the award for choice sci-fi movie actor for “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” at the Teen Choice Awards at the Galen Center Sunday in Los Angeles. (Photo: Phil McCarten / Invision/AP)
Los Angeles — The Teen Choice Awards, always a bubble of teenage celebration, took time out during Sunday night's ceremony to consider the world its young audience will inherit.
Hashtags, surfboards and loud shrieks dominated the Teen Choice Awards, as usual, with YouTube star Jake Paul presiding over a show designed to be tweeted, Snapchatted and put on Instagram. But with the two-hour broadcast coming a day after the violence at a rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, some winners pleaded for teen viewers to do better than their elders.
“With all the injustice and the hatred and everything that's happened not only in the world but in our country right now, I need for you young people, I need you guys to be educated. I need you to listen. I need you to pay attention,” said “Spider-Man: Homecoming” actor Zendaya, accepting an award for best summer movie actor.
“You are the future presidents, the future senators,” they added, clutching the show's trademark surfboard award. “You guys are the ones who are going to make this world better.”
The music performance-stuffed show, broadcast live on Fox from Los Angeles, followed a three-hour “Teen Fest” concert in downtown Los Angeles that was streamed on YouTube.
Miley Cyrus, an 18-time Teen Choice award winner, was to receive the ceremony's highest honor, the Ultimate Choice Award. But they were announced as a last-minute cancellation early in the ceremony. “I know,” said presenter Victoria Justice. “It's a bummer.” (Cyrus apologized on Twitter saying they created “an unrealistic schedule for myself.”)
Many of the other biggest names either sent video acceptances (Bruno Mars, Gal Gadot) or were merely announced as winners (Beyonce, Zac Efron, Ariana Grande). One notable exception was Chris Pratt, who dropped by to accept their two movie awards. Pratt and their wife, Anna Farris, recently announced their separation.
That still left many teen idols for the crowd to cheer, including the cast of the CW drama series “Riverdale” (winner of seven awards) and the group Fifth Harmony, the winner of the best music group and song.
“In light of recent events, we just wanted to say to all of the young ones at home watching, no matter who you are, where you come from or what you look like, you are beautiful and you are important,” said the group's Lauren Jauregui. “So keep spreading love and positivity.”
The prominent role for Paul was a big moment for him, too. In late July Paul departed the Disney Channel series “Bizaardvark” after reports that they were feuding with their West Hollywood, California, neighbors.
“The past few months have humbled me quite a bit. I had to be more mindful of my words and actions and how they impact others,” said Paul while accepting their own pair of awards for best YouTuber and web star. “The next step for me is to forget all the bad press, drama, negativity.”
Rock band Maroon 5 was honored with the decade award. Other winners included Dwayne Johnson for “Moana,” Lucy Hale for “Pretty Little Liars” and Ed Sheeran for best male song.

Sand Devil Varsity Wrestlers traveling to Payson for tomorrow's DIVISION 3 / SECTION 4 WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS at Payson High School's Wilson Dome. Weigh In starts at 8am Coaches Meet at 9:00AM. Doors Open at 9:00AM. Wrestling Starts at 10:00 AM.
SAN FRANCISCO: The mega-extravaganza of the tech world in Las Vegas is showcasing an array of new devices that get smarts from computer chips, sensors and artificial intelligence, but go further by opening doors to augmented or virtual realities.
The Consumer Electronics Show, which begins with a series of media events Tuesday will offer trade professionals a look at new robotics, connected cars and a dizzying assortment of gizmos from connected sneakers to drones.
This year´s show will see results of a boost in computing power from artificial intelligence, which can help power things like autonomous cars, and deliver new experiences such as augmented or virtual reality.
"Virtual reality is changing the game for a variety of industries including health care, agriculture, manufacturing and business," said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association that organizes the annual show, in a Reddit chat.
"Doctors are using VR to enhance traditional therapies, architects use VR to design stronger buildings and travel agencies are using it to simplify vacation planning."
CES will celebrate its 50th anniversary at the gathering, and organizers promised it would have the largest showcase of VR technology ever.
One CES panel discussion will examine how virtual reality is transforming television, movies and even news with immersive forms of video.
A host of virtual reality experiences will entice attendees at the trade-only show.
Cars will feature virtual reality displays to provide a better sense of the environment around them, while similar technologies will be showcased for smart glasses, medicine and beauty makeovers.
- Enhancing reality -
Robin Raskin, who heads the Living in Digital Times center of the show, said augmented reality is catching on with try-and-see beauty apps, in-store virtual mirrors and toys.
Augmented reality, they said, "lets us look at the real world and add valuable, entertaining and immersive information to it."
Analyst Jack Gold at J. Gold Associates said that despite the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality in business or industry, "gaming is where it is going to take off first," because that´s where people are spending money.
"The issue is not whether it has the potential to transform things, but whether you can put it into a space where consumers can afford it and give enough additional information so people are able to use it," Gold said.
CES is among the world´s biggest trade shows, and last year drew 177,000 attendees over exhibit space of 2.47 million square feet (230,000 square meters). This year, 150 countries will be represented.
It will include big industry names such as Sony, LG and Samsung in electronics, with the perennial battle to have the sleekest most gorgeous television screen.
Meanwhile, in attendance will be more than 600 startups from 33 countries, including first-time participants -- the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Ukraine.
Auto-industry titans including Ford and BMW are increasingly using CES to show off technology packed into vehicles for efficiency, safety, entertainment and navigation.
- Race for autonomy -
The show will feature demonstrations of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, including one from Japan´s Honda said to be equipped with an artificial intelligence "emotion engine" that aims to better understand its occupants.
Electric car startup Faraday Future, one of several manufacturers taking on Tesla, is expected to unveil its first production car a year after showing a prototype.
Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn has promised to discuss "a major technological breakthrough in the realization of a zero-emission, zero-fatality world for everyone," according to a statement from CES organizers.
- Humanoid robots -
The show is also expected to feature advances in robotics, with more human-like robots and the public debut of "Professor Einstein" from Hanson Robotics.
Getting a boost from artificial intelligence, some new robots at the show will keep an eye on the kids, play chess or help with homework.
Gold said they expect to see a large number of drones looking for a slice of a surging market.
"This is really the year of the drone, and everybody is trying to get into this market," they said.
But they added that the strongest potential for drones may be with businesses, with uses including aerial photography.
On the smartphone front, South Korea´s LG will show a range of new "mid-range" handsets and China´s Huawei has a smartphone event scheduled. TCL, the Chinese firm which owns the Alcatel brand, will unveil new BlackBerry handsets following its deal for the troubled Canadian brand.
The show floor will see a host of new and improved connected home technologies that manage everything from light bulbs to refrigerators.
"We´re pretty close on things like the smart home, where we´re going to get up one day and everybody is going to speak to their refrigerators," said NPD analyst Stephen Baker.
Carolina Milanesi of the consultancy Creative Strategies said 2016 "has seen material progress" in some new technologies that will result in products hitting the marketplace, even though not all will be hits.
"In some cases, it´s because the consumers weren´t really asking for it," they said.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A federal judge has thrown out one of the charges against a Kansas man accused of plotting to attack Somali immigrants in the meatpacking town of Garden City.
U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren granted a defense motion to dismiss a firearms charge against Curtis Allen. The decision comes in the wake of a 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal panel's ruling in May in an unrelated case that found that a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic battery under a city ordinance can legally carry a gun.
Allen and co-defendants Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright still face charges of conspiring to detonate truck bombs at an apartment complex where Somali immigrants live.
All three men have pleaded not guilty.
Their trial is set for Feb. 20.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Inasf (PTI) leader Shireen Mazari demanded ‘action' from the Chief of Staff in place of just ‘words' after recent US Drone strike in Hangu.
In series of tweets, Mazari criticizes the Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa for calling drone strike merely ‘counterproductive'.
We don't expect COAS to simply term US Drone strike on Hangu as "counterproductive" - and that too after 3 days of silence. — Shireen Mazari (@ShireenMazari1) June 15, 2017
They stated that Pakistan expects the military to defend country's territory against every kind of attacks and intrusions including US drone strikes.
“Action, not words, needed!” they wrote.
We expect our military to defend our territory against all attacks/intrusions incl by US drones on our territory. Action, not words, needed! https://t.co/Bm1vkdnvcz — Shireen Mazari (@ShireenMazari1) June 15, 2017
Mazari also criticised COAS for reacting rather late on the drone strike stating that they commented the strike after three days of silence.
Mazari added that PTI Chairman Imran Khan is a political figure and they can only condemn it but COAS has to do more than just condemning the strike.
IK's condemnation principled & consistent as that is what a pol ldr can do! But COAS expected to act not just condemn 3 days after attack! https://t.co/jZo87KI9gu — Shireen Mazari (@ShireenMazari1) June 15, 2017
On June 13, Two militants including an alleged commander of Haqqani network were killed when a US drone hit their hideout at Speen Tal area of Orakzai Agency in early hours.
According to details, it was at Sehri time when the US drone fired missiles at a suspected militants' compound, as a result of which, a commander of Haqqani network identified as Abu Bakar along with their companion were killed in the strike.

Today I want to share a recipe that I ran in a column several years ago. I have had so many people stop me and ask if this recipe really works, and I always tell them, “Yes!”, and they are really as good as any yeast rolls you can make.
So if you remember this column, sit back and enjoy it again.
Most cooks associate dinner rolls with a special or holiday meal, mostly because of the difficult prep or time needed to prepare.
With the recipe that I am sharing, you will find that you can have them anytime you want them.
As a former 4-H'er, I learned to make yeast and quick breads in my early teens. Since yeast breads are not always the easiest thing to make, it is a project that you complete after you have been cooking for a while.
Yeast breads are not really hard — they are just more time consuming than quick breads. For those of you who have not ventured into baking breads of any kind, let me explain the difference.
Quick breads are usually made with a “sweet” batter and are usually made with fruit or vegetables like carrots or zucchini and often nuts. In fact, my mother used to make the best nut bread you have ever tasted.
The “leavening” agent (ingredient used to cause the dough to rise) for quick breads is either baking powder, baking soda or sometimes both. The nut bread was made with baking powder and a pinch of salt. I always add vanilla to my quick breads as it really gives them a great flavor.
Quick breads are just what the title says — quick. They are a mix and bake recipe and are usually dense and very moist.
Today I will talk about my fabulous CAKE MIX DINNER ROLLS. Yes, you read that right, dinner rolls that are made from a cake mix!
This is a recipe that I have had in my recipe file for several years, saving it for the next time I was entertaining. Then when the time came, I would skip over it thinking that it might not be a good idea to serve them until I had made them first for my taste-test approval.
Unfortunately, history kept repeating itself and I wouldn't pull it out until I was planning dinner for guests again.
A few weeks ago, I was searching for a favorite old recipe and came upon the one for these dinner rolls. I had plenty of time, an extra yellow cake mix and nothing to lose.
Well, I can now officially pass along the instructions for one of the best and easiest recipes I have ever made.
As you can figure out for yourself, yeast breads are made with yeast rather than baking powder and are not usually sweet in flavor (with the exception of sweet doughs used in making coffee cakes, doughnuts and cinnamon rolls). Because you are using yeast to leaven the dough, the outcome will be much lighter bread with the taste of yeast in each bite.
Unlike quick breads, this dough requires several steps before it can be baked. It is mixed with a mixer, kneaded and then allowed to rise or expand at least 2 times before it is baked. Kneading is not difficult but does take a little practice and is essential to start the chemical process that yields a light as air result.
In a large bowl, mix the batter per directions, allow it to rise and then divide it into half. I shape half of it, preparing it for baking and placed the remainder of the dough (covered) in the refrigerator for use in the next couple of days.
Without a question, these are the best dinner rolls I have ever tasted. They were light and sweet, somewhat like the Hawaiian Bread brand available in food stores.
The next day I roll out the remaining dough, spread it with butter, plenty of cinnamon and sugar creating awesome cinnamon rolls. Another time when I made them, I used the second half of the dough and made doughnuts rolled in powdered sugar. Krispy Kreme, eat your heart out!
Now here is the recipe and I am going to tell you just how to turn the dough into great tasting bread recipes.
CAKE MIX DINNER ROLLS
1 pkg. active dry yeast
1 ½ Cup very warm water
3 ¼ Cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
½ package yellow cake mix*
½ stick butter, melted
* Measure the contents of an 18 oz box of cake mix and use half of it and place the remainder in a Ziploc bag for a future recipe of dough.
Measure water in a 2 cup measuring cup making sure it is warm, but not hot. Sprinkle yeast over water and then stir. Let set. In large bowl, mix flour salt and cake mix. Stir the yeast water again and then pour into flour mixture. With a mixer, mix until well blended and all of the flour and cake mix is completely merged. Place in large greased bowl. Cover and let rise until double. (45-60 min). Remove from bowl and place on counter top covered with flour. Lightly roll into a rectangle 11” x 14”. Cut into 4 pieces long ways and 8 pieces wide, giving you 32 rectangle pieces. Place on greased cookie sheet. Brush top of rolls liberally with melted butter. Spray a piece of waxed paper with Pam and cover rolls. Let rise until double again (45-60 min). Remove paper and place on middle shelf of preheated oven (350 degrees) for 15-20 min. or until lightly brown and firm to the touch. Remove and brush with more melted butter. Serve hot with butter!
NOTE: These can made into pan rolls or individual ones, baked in a muffin tin.
For Cinnamon Rolls
After rolling dough into a 10” x 16” rectangle, spread with 4 Tablespoon softened butter. Sprinkle with a mixture of ½ Cup sugar and 3-4 Tablespoon cinnamon. Starting at narrow end, roll into a log and then seal edges with water. Cut in 1” slices and place in oblong greased baking dish. Let rise until double. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and spread with icing made of 3 Tablespoon soft butter, 1 Tablespoon cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla and enough powdered sugar to form a spreading consistency.
For Doughnuts
Working with half of the dough, roll dough to large circle ½” thick using minimal amount of flour. Cut with 4” doughnut cutter (or a use a large biscuit cutter for outer circle and a 1” plastic cap from a water bottle for inner circle). Let doughnuts rise until double. Heat canola oil over medium high heat, in large deep skillet and place 4 doughnuts at a time in oil to fry. Turn till golden brown and remove when evenly cooked. Be careful that the oil does not get too hot! If it does the doughnuts will get brown before they are done inside. Remove and drain on paper towels. When slightly cooled roll in powdered or granulated sugar. Eat Hot!!!!!
After reading these great recipes I hope you are ready to make some rolls. Hope you enjoy them as much as we do! — Sheryl

The Jasper County Sheriff's Department is asking for the public's help in identifying who's responsible for opening some fire hydrants in Reasnor and near Prairie City that led to the loss of thousands of gallons of water.
Sheriff John Halferty says someone tampered with four fire hydrants, and although there were fires in both Sulley Saturday at 11 p.m., and in Prarie City at 1:30 Sunday morning — they don't think the fire and tampering are related.
They say they believe the water sources were tampered with during the same time frame as the fires, but they say the two things appear to be a coincidence. Three of the opened hydrants were in Reasnor, and one hydrant was near the Central Iowa Water Association Water Tower east of Prairie City. Central Iowa Water Association estimates approximately 300,000 gallons of water was lost due to the tampering. Sheriff Halferty also notes one of the tampered with hydrants was damaged and unusable.
“Because a hydrant wrench was not used, I suspect that's why the one hydrant in Reasnor was damaged. You can break the part of the hydrant that actually opens up the water flow, and I believe what happened to the hydrant in Reasnor,” Halferty says. The Sheriff says the hydrant openings did not impact the water supply of local fire departments during the two structure fires. But they said it did create a dangerous situation if the water had been needed.
“It's extremely dangerous, number one the fire departments usually have preplanning in place and know what water sources they are going to go to,” Halferty explains. “An if they arrive and they are not able to utilize that or it has been tampered with and they have to go to a backup plan…it delays their ability to fight the fire and protect not only the citizens, but their property as well.” Anyone with information pertaining to the person or persons responsible for tampering with these fire hydrants is asked to contact the sheriff's office at 641-792-5912.

Taking care of a cut or scrape usually means swapping out the bandage a few times, and maybe putting a little healing cream or hydrogel on there. But what if the dressing could dispense that stuff on its own? That's the idea behind a smart bandage now being tested by engineers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Harvard and MIT.
Instead of plain sterile cotton or other fibers, this dressing is made of “composite fibers with a core electrical heater covered by a layer of hydrogel containing thermoresponsive drug carriers,” which really says it all.
It acts as a regular bandage, protecting the injury from exposure and so on, but attached to it is a stamp-sized microcontroller. When prompted by an app (or an onboard timer, or conceivably sensors woven into the bandage), the microcontroller sends a voltage through certain of the fibers, warming them and activating the medications lying dormant in the hydrogel.
Those medications could be anything from topical anesthetics to antibiotics to more sophisticated things like growth hormones that accelerate healing. More voltage, more medication — and each fiber can carry a different one.
“This is the first bandage that is capable of dose-dependent drug release,” said UN-L's Ali Tamayol in a news release. “You can release multiple drugs with different release profiles. That's a big advantage in comparison with other systems.”
In a paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the team documents how in tests, critters (not humans — those tests come later) healed better when given the active bandage. They also made sure that the heat didn't affect the healing process or the medication.
For ordinary scrapes a normal bandage (or plaster, for our friends across the pond) is probably still more than sufficient — this is for people whose healing processes are inhibited, or for whom frequent dressing changes are impossible or inconvenient.
Next up, in addition to further testing to satisfy the FDA, is investigating how to integrate sensors with the fibers, to measure blood glucose levels, pH and other indicators of how the healing process is going. Maybe soon your bandage will even include a progress bar.

* Tough sanctions, laws cause headaches for S.Korean officials
* Permission needed for flights between North and South
* Perks such as high-end phones, equipment might breach sanctions
* For multimedia coverage: www.reuters.com/north-korea/
By Hyunjoo Jin and Christine Kim
SEOUL, Feb 2 (Reuters) - All of the almost 3,000 athletes competing at the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are set to get perks including the latest $1,100 Samsung smartphones, top of the range new equipment to take home and sleek Nike uniforms.
All except perhaps the 22 athletes from North Korea.
Tough international sanctions including travel restrictions and a ban on the sale of luxury goods and sports gear have complicated South Korean Olympic organisers' efforts to provide their northern neighbors with the same benefits available to other Olympians.
For months, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has sought North Korea's participation in the hopes it will ease tensions between the still officially warring nations and prevent the kind of violent incidents which have plagued previous major events hosted by the South.
Officials have rolled out the red carpet and are keen to make sure the visits go off without a hitch.
North Korean female ice hockey players and their South Korean teammates, who will compete as one nation in the Games for the first time, have been living and training together this week, even sharing a birthday cake.
Other members of the North Korean delegation, such as the cheer squad, will be housed in luxury hotels.
Overshadowing those efforts, however, are a host of U.S. and U.N. Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang over its efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.
At almost every turn, South Korea has had to go great lengths to make sure its hospitalities don't run afoul of sanctions or other laws, according to several South Korean officials.
Just raising the North Korean flag alongside other national banners in the Olympic Villages required an exemption from South Korean laws banning praise of the North Korea regime, a Pyeongchang organizing committee official told Reuters.
The officials all declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter.
NO GALAXY NOTE 8, NO NIKE?
Samsung Electronics, an official sponsor of the Winter Games, is offering 4,000 Galaxy Note 8 smartphones specially designed for the Olympics to “all” of the participating athletes.
The International Olympic Committee will distribute them, a Samsung Electronics spokesperson told Reuters.
But South Korea is not sure if North Korean athletes will be eligible for the treats because of U.N. Security Council sanctions, an Olympics organiser told Reuters.
The official declined to elaborate, but experts say providing the $1,100 Samsung phone could violate U.N. sanctions that ban the sale of luxury items and electronics with a potential “dual” commercial and military use.
Meanwhile, the joint women's hockey team will wear uniforms made by a Finnish company instead of official sponsor Nike, because of concerns about U.S. sanctions, another South Korean government official told Reuters.
Unilateral U.S. sanctions go far beyond the U.N. sanctions, effectively banning U.S. companies and individuals from trading with North Korea.
“We are trying to figure out ways to live up to the sanctions,” the official said.
Nike did not immediately respond to request for comments.
North Korean athletes will also have to return Finnish hockey sticks, skates and other equipment “rented” for them when they leave South Korea, the official said.
FLIGHT RISK
South Korea's unification ministry said it had sought and received temporary permission from the United States to fly an airliner to North Korea this week.
The flight took South Korean athletes for training in a ski resort in the North on Wednesday, and brought North Korean athletes to the South on Thursday.
Any aircraft or ship visiting North Korea is banned for 180 days from entering the United States. The exemption granted this week only applies to the latest flight, meaning U.S. approval is needed any time North Korean officials visit during the Olympics by airplane or ferry.
A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Washington was in “close contact with the Republic of Korea on our unified response to North Korea.”
A U.S. Treasury official said the department evaluates applications “for certain prohibited transactions and activities, which can include those related to the upcoming Olympics”, without giving more detail.
For this week's flight, an Airbus aircraft was used rather than one made by U.S. Boeing due to stricter U.S. sanctions, South Korean broadcaster Channel A reported. Asiana Airlines, who operated the plane, declined to comment.
To comply with South Korean military rules, the airliner had to fly some distance out to sea to avoid flying over the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone, the unification ministry said.
FIVE-STAR HOTEL
The North Korean Olympians are staying at the athletes' village in Gangneung with athletes from other countries. The Olympics organising committee was unable to say whether they are being given any special treatment, such as beefed up protection.
North Korea's 230-member cheering squad is expected to stay at Inje Speedium, according to a unification ministry official, a four-star hotel surrounded by forest. Rooms there cost 242,000 won ($226) to 715,000 won per night.
Its taekwondo performance team will stay at the five-star Grand Walkerhill in Seoul, which overlooks the Han River and previously hosted American stars such as Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton.
The spending is not unprecedented. When North Koreans visited the South for the Asian Games in 2002, the Seoul government spent 1.3 billion won hosting them.
But now, even paying for routine things such as medical treatment or providing souvenirs can run into problems, said Yoo Ho-yeol, a professor at Korea University in Seoul.
“Benefits provided to North Korean delegation, which were in the past were not subject to sanctions, can now become a controversy, since sanctions have become much more comprehensive in recent years,” they said.

Fans of the original "Top Gear" cast may vaguely recall an incident from a promotion for their new Amazon show in which Jeremy Clarkson dropped on a piano from a crane onto a small black sedan.
You likely forgot the sedan, but remembered the piano. And the results.
The hapless British car was actually a 1980 Morris Marina, and through an unusual chain of circumstances, it's now for sale midway through a restoration.
The hard parts have been done: The entire roof, or what was left of it, was sliced off and replaced with the roof from another Marina, one that had not had a piano dropped on it.
The car is now up for auction on eBay UK, ending this Sunday at roughly 3:30 pm Eastern time.
1980 Morris Marina 1700HL onto which Jeremy Clarkson dropped a piano from a crane Enlarge Photo
Seller Kate-Lidesign of Birmingham bought the car intending to take it to auto shows with the piano on it.
But it was otherwise in such good condition that a restoration was called for, complete with the replacement of the entire roof on a body jig to ensure it all stayed straight.
The body was prepped and painted in the original black, but has been lately been sitting idle due to the owner's ill health. The windshield and rear window remain to be installed, along with lights, bumpers, and the complete interior.
This 1980 Marina 1700HL was the only one ordered in black that year. Before the piano incident, it had been extensively rebuilt and restored in 2008, and was well-known among Marina fans.
Then Amazon bought it to promote the "Clarkson, Hammond and May Live" exhibition in 2015 ... and the video above shows what happened.

From 1973 to 1975, the Marina was briefly sold in the U.S. as an Austin, earning fame as the subject of a dumping case by the U.S. government against British Leyland and infamy for its disastrous build quality and evident unreliability.
Now, if you want to own a unique piece of Clarkson and May history, this Marina remains one of a kind.
Still, out of respect for the rarity of restored Marinas in the U.K. or anywhere else, we'd suggest you agree to refrain from dropping another piano onto it.

ISLAMABAD : The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has recovered Rs 285 billion since its inception and deposited in national exchequer, according to NAB spokesperson.
The spokesperson said, “The figures are indicative of the hard work being put in by all ranks of NAB staff in an atmosphere of renewed energy and dynamism, where fight against corruption is being taken as a national duty.”
They said, “NAB under the leadership of Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, Chairman NAB has chalked out a comprehensive National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS) for eradication of corruption and corrupt practices throughout the country.”
“NAB works according to National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) 1999, which empowers it to act against those who are involved in the corruption and corrupt practices,” they added.
They said, “Corruption is an insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies and it undermines development and rule of law and is breeding ground for organized crimes in the society, perpetuates inefficiencies in the system and therefore spearheads regress.”
They further said, “Corruption was affecting the country just like a cancer.”
“Awareness and prevention of corruption is a challenging task and as a Pakistanis it is our moral duty to spread awareness regarding the ill effects of the menace all the segments of the society should play an active role for the eradication of corruption from the country,” they said.
They said, “Increase in the number of complaints also reflects enhanced public trusted in the NAB.”
“The PILDAT report for the last year also supports the position stated above as 42% people trusted NAB against 30 % for police and 29 % for government officials,” they added.
They said, “The recent reports of Transparency International also rated Pakistan in Corruption Perception Index (CPI) from 175 to 126 in 2014 and in 2015 and Corruption Perception Index (CPI) decreased from 126 to 117. The World Economic Forum has also rated Pakistan from 126 to 122 in its competitive Report of 2016-17 which is a great achievement for Pakistan due to NAB's efforts.”
“To create Awareness against the ill effects of corruption among the youth of Pakistan, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in collaboration with Higher Education Commission (HEC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU),” they said.
“Over 42000 Character Building Societies (CBSs) have been established by NAB in universities, colleges and schools to create awareness against corruption as youths are considered a vanguard in this fight,” they said.
The NAB spokesperson said, “On the directions of Chairman NAB, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has already been devised to rationalize the workload and timelines have been prescribed for efficient, effective and expeditious disposal of cases putting a maximum limit of 10 months- from complaint verification-to-inquiry-to-investigation and finally to a reference in the Accountability Court.”
“In order to ensure uniformity and standardization, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in vogue were revised after a gap of 10 years to make these responsive to the needs of changed economic, social and technological realities along with goals and targets for smooth conduct of operational activities in accordance with Law and to bring further improvements in the performance of NAB Regional Bureaus,” they said.
‘The performance Evaluation of all NAB's Regional Bureaus is being done under Party Quantified Grading System at prescribed criteria and NAB has developed Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System catering the needs of all concerned having salient features of maintenance of data at each stage including complaint entry, complaint verification, inquiry, investigation, prosecution stage and record preservation of Regional Board Meetings and Executive Board Meetings including case brief, decisions made and list of participants attended the meeting with time and date and setting up of an effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System and ability to analyze data in qualitative and quantitative form having warnings and alarms system for violators,” they said.
They said, “NAB with improved infrastructure and rationalized workload, timelines have been prescribed for efficient, effective and expeditious disposal of case putting a maximum limit of 10 months- from complaint verification-to-inquiry-to investigation and finally to a reference in Accountability Court.”
They said, “NAB has devised a centralized monitoring mechanism to ensure compliance with the SOP's and prescribed timelines.”
“The meeting reviewed the performance of NAB's field formations and expressed satisfaction that the schedule and timelines were being observed and it also evaluated the efficacy of the concept of CIT and observed that the CIT had indeed improved the quality of investigations as well as the professional capacity of Investigation officers (IOs),” they said and added that the Internal Accountability Mechanism (IAM) recently devised will ensure quick and effective monitoring and evaluation of all levels of work force in NAB.
According to details NAB has approved Internal Accountability Mechanism (IAM) within NAB with a view to weed out such elements that for reasons of inefficiency, misconduct, malpractice and violation of laid down SOPs/Rules and bring a bad name to the organization. Chairman NAB has directed Senior Member Chairman Inspection and Monitoring Team (CI&MT) to issue policy guidelines to all Regional Bureaus of NAB for implementation and application.
“In line with Chairman NAB's firm resolve and commitment to eradicate corruption and corrupt practices from the country, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) have decided created a Joint Task Force comprising of senior level officers of NAB and SECP in order to work expeditiously on the corruption cases referred by SECP to NAB,” the spokesperson said.
“The Joint Task Force will inquire/investigate all corruption cases related to fraud, embezzlement, corrupt practices and cheating public at large by the sponsors, directors and management of brokerage houses of the stock exchanges referred by SECP on top priority basis with the intention to recover investor's hard earned money which has been misappropriated for personal benefits of the sponsors and Directors of the Brokerage Houses,” they added.
For greater cohesion in the professional work and the constitution of Joint Task Force at NAB Headquarters, two senior level officers/experts from SECP (one each from legal and operation side) and senior level officers of NAB from Financial Crimes Investigation Wing, Operation and Prosecution wings will be part of Joint Task Force.
The spokesperson said, “NAB has established its first Forensic Science Lab (FSL) in NAB Rawalpindi/Islamabad. The Forensic Science Lab has facilities of Digital Forensics, Questioned Documents and Fingerprint Analysis.”
They said, “NAB had organized a seminar of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries on Anti-Corruption in September 2016 in which NAB has become first Chairman of SAARC Anti-Corruption forum for collaborative efforts for eradication of corruption on the basis of best practices.”
“NAB has proposed Ministry of Law and Justice that Whistle Blowing Protection Act is imperative for the country under the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), legislation on Whistle Blowing is an obligation on Pakistan,” they said.
They said, “Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Federal Cabinet have approved Whistle Blower Protection Bill which will now be sent to National Assembly of Pakistan for further necessary action. NAB has trained 104 investigation officers at Police Training College Sihala on modern lines and it has also planned establishment of NAB's Anti-Corruption Academy at Islamabad for capacity building of NAB officers/Officials.”
They said, “NAB has proposed State Bank of Pakistan that all ATM machines and cheques display/carry NAB message ‘Say No to Corruption' across the country in order to aware people about the ill effects of corruption and it has organized a national Seminar on World Anti-Corruption Day at Aiwan Sadr, Islamabad which was chaired by the President of Pakistan.”
The Chairman NAB said, “NAB strongly believes in Zero Tolerance Policy against Corruption. NAB's Anti-corruption campaign is carried widely for awareness and prevention of corruption besides Enforcement across the board.”
“NAB hopes that joint efforts of all stakeholders can collaborate to check corruption and corrupt practices before happening with the help of all stakeholders, civil society, media and people at large and bring sustainable systematic changes to the governance structure of our country,” the chairperson said.

Project Fi, Google's wireless service, is getting support for a number of new phones today. Until now, if you wanted to switch to Fi, the only officially supported phones were Google's own Pixel and Pixel 2 phones, the Nexus 5X and 6P, as well as the Moto X4 and its Android One variant. Today, Google is adding to this list the Moto G6, as well as LG's G7 ThinQ and V35 ThinQ phones.
Since Google's network is a bit different from its competitors, thanks to Fi's ability to switch between the networks of T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular to provide users access to the strongest signal in a given area, the company has always taken a very strict approach as to which phones it officially supported.
If you want to make the switch to Fi, which also recently introduced its own take on its competitors' flat-rate plans, then the 32GB version of the 5.7-inch Moto G6 is now available for $199 (discounted from $249). The two LG phones will be coming to Fi next month for their standard retail prices of $899 for the V35 and $749 for the G7. While Google isn't offering any major outright discount for the LG phones, those who pre-order one will get a $50 Fi credit.
It's worth noting that the V35, LG's new six-inch flagship phone, only launched today and is essentially a G7 with more RAM, a different display and larger battery. The phone was originally rumored to be an AT&T exclusive, but I guess we can put that idea to rest now.
Both the G7 and Moto G6 have generally received favorable reviews. Google also currently offers the Moto X4 for a heavily discounted $249, but that still makes the G6 the most affordable option for Fi. This may create a bit of confusion for potential users, though, as those are quite similar and it's hard to figure out which one to pick (just like choosing between the G7 and V35). At the same time, though, it's nice to see Google add more options for its Project Fi customers.

DELPHI, Ind. (AP)  Authorities suspect foul play after two bodies were found along a northern Indiana creek amid a search for two missing 13-year-old girls, police said Tuesday.
The bodies were found along Deer Creek about 1 mile east of Delphi, Indiana State Police Sgt. Kim Riley told a news conference.
"We are investigating this as a crime scene," Riley said. "We suspect foul play."
Riley said authorities haven't yet positively identified the bodies. They declined to comment on any injuries they might have suffered or to discuss the ages of the victims, but they said the search for the two missing girls had been scaled back significantly.

Riley says the bodies were found Tuesday on the edge of the creek about three-quarters of a mile from an abandoned railroad bridge where the two girls, Liberty German and Abigail Williams, had been dropped off to go hiking Monday. They were reported missing hours later after they did not appear at a predetermined meeting place.
Search parties scoured the base of the bridge, known locally as the Monon High Bridge, and surrounding trails Monday night, but darkness made it nearly impossible, Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said.
Riley declined to disclose who found the bodies.
Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullins said the discovery of the bodies and search for the girls has shocked the community about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
"I know it's had a terrible effect on our people and we are grieved this sort of thing would happen here in our community," Mullins told the news conference.

285 killed during Myanmar's water festival
2017-04-18 07:46 | www.trend.az | 1
Nearly 300 people were killed during the New Year water festival, official media said Tuesday, Anadolu reported.
The state-run newspaper on Tuesday reported 285 people were killed and 1,073 others injured as 1,200 crimes and accidents occurred across the country during the four-day annual Thingyan Water Festival.
“Compared to last year's figures of 967 crimes, 272 deaths and 1,086 injured cases, 233 more cases and 13 more deaths occurred in this year's water festival,” said the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
The commercial capital, Yangon, had 44 fatalities, followed by the Bago region with 37 and the country's second city, Mandalay, had 36 deaths.
The Yangon region recorded the highest number of accidents with 223.
Eight people died the first day of the festival last Thursday, after a wooden boat carrying 61 Buddhist pilgrims sank after a fishing net wrapped around the vessel's propeller in a river near Kyauktaw in western Rakhine state.
The water festival was celebrated April 13-16 to welcome the traditional New Year.
“For me it's cool to see them there but at the same time, that's supposed to be me out there,” they said on Monday. “It's a little bit of a back and forth.”
But a guy such as Chris Rowley, who made their Major League Baseball debut last Saturday as a member of Toronto's starting staff , poses something of a conundrum for the 25-year-old. Rowley is out there in part because Sanchez can't be; Toronto's potential ace has been sidelined for all but 36 innings this year with nagging blister issues.
Aaron Sanchez is the kind of guy who likes counselling new faces in the clubhouse; it wasn't so long ago that they were a new guy himself.
That is a few steps ahead of where Sanchez's progress is at right now, though. First, they have to make sure no part of their middle right finger is bothering him. Then, it's about making sure that they can throw without anything flaring up. Next, there is throwing for an extended period of time without problems. Only then will Sanchez look at figuring out what is the best way to make their comeback.
Sanchez hopes they will be back on the mound this year. But with fewer than seven weeks left in the regular season, and with the minor leagues coming to a close about a month earlier, it is still up in the air if they can make that happen, let alone as a starter. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons suggested over the weekend that should Sanchez be ready for a return before October, it could come out of the bullpen.
If coming out of the bullpen is the quickest way for Sanchez to get back in the game, he's willing to consider it.
“I don't know if that's set in stone,” they said. “It's an idea; we've all kind of thrown it off each other in here but like I said, I just want to make sure that I'm out there and I can throw and I'm healthy first. That's step one for me.”
Much of this season has been a waiting game for Sanchez, who has been placed on the disabled list four times; waiting for the nail to get healthy and strong, for the skin around it to clear up. On Monday, they were hopeful they are “almost” back.
“The only thing that was going to fix that was time. I think I'm over the hump so I should be playing catch in the next few days,” they said. “Which day, I don't know. But I'm close.”
In the meantime, they have focused on controlling the things that they are able to control — such as keeping their body in shape — instead of getting caught up in one blister issue leading to another, and so on and so forth.
“Anything I can control to just make sure I stay on top of my game, whether I do come back as a starter, I do come back as a reliever,” they said. “Whatever it may be, I'm ready to go. Things are kind of shaping up for us to be in this (the American League wild card race) so I feel like I'm going to be needed at this time and I want to be that person for them to lean on.”
Part of that is being a teammate newcomer such as the 26-year-old Rowley — who is scheduled make their second start for the Blue Jays on Thursday against Tampa Bay Rays' Chris Archer — can turn to while getting a feel for The Show.
“It's just kind of keeping their feet on the ground and letting them know that confidence here is one of the main things and you're here for a reason so just go out there and do your thing.”

The next generation of Ford's Focus Sedan has been spotted, and the car is almost completely devoid of camouflage gear. That means the reveal must be coming up very soon.
McLaren over the weekend showed the latest addition to its flagship Ultimate Series range. The car is called the Senna, and it's a bare-knuckled track car that you can also drive on the streets.
Volkswagen will finally renew its aging Jetta next year. We've just spent some time with a prototype and so far are quite pleased with what we've experienced.

(Reuters) - Connecticut state regulators said Dominion Energy Inc should offer evidence that its Millstone nuclear power plant is in danger of closing before participating in a state power procurement process that could boost its profits.
The regulators said in a report Thursday that the company has not yet shown Millstone is in need of financial help, but noted the plant is critical to the state and the New England region in terms of fuel security and meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets.
“Dominion has not yet released verifiable data related to the fiscal health of Millstone,” Robert Klee, commissioner of the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said, noting the report concluded the plant would remain profitable through 2035.
In handing the report to the state legislature, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority concluded the procurement process for zero-carbon emissions resources, like Millstone, should go forward.
The regulators, however, recommended an additional step to the procurement process that would allow interested resources to demonstrate they are at risk of retirement.
Dominion has not said it wants to retire Millstone, but has warned it was “assessing” its investment in the plant.
“The final appraisal is clear. Millstone is vital for Connecticut to meet its cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy goals and aggressive carbon goals,” Paul Koonce, chief executive officer of Dominion Energy Power Generation Group, said in a statement.
The Connecticut General Assembly will review the report for possible action by March 1. If the legislature does nothing, Dominion said the state will proceed to a procurement that will need to begin by May 1.
The U.S. nuclear industry has been suffering for years as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations has depressed power prices, making it uneconomic for many reactors to continue operating.
Connecticut is one of several states exploring rules to keep reactors in service to preserve carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and a diverse resource mix. Other states looking at similar rules are Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors in 2016.
Opponents of state support for Millstone said the plant does not need any help.
“Giving an extremely profitable nuclear plant the same status as true renewables makes Dominion a winner and everyone else, especially ratepayers, losers,” said Dave Gaier, a spokesperson at NRG Energy Inc, which owns gas-fired and other plants that could earn less revenue if the state subsidizes the reactors.
BOSTON -- When Boston Red Sox President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski first arrived in Boston in 2015, they saw a high ceiling for then-rookie starter Eduardo Rodriguez.
"He's got a chance to be a No. 1-type pitcher," Dombrowski said in their introductory press conference.
Since then, Rodriguez's road to stardom has hit just about every road block it could. They have been frequently injured, shown inconsistency on the mound and even had an issue with tipping pitches at one point. But now, four years into their major league career, Rodriguez is finding their rhythm.
The left-hander has a 2.25 ERA over their last five starts, having allowed three or fewer earned runs in each of those outings. In two of those outings, they allowed two or fewer runs.
Wednesday was among their best performances of the year. They tied their season-best 6 2/3 innings pitched, and did not allow a baserunner through the first 13 hitters. They finished with seven strikeouts while allowing just two runs on three hits -- the result of two consecutive mistakes in the top of the sixth inning.
Still, Rodriguez was brilliant Wednesday, and manager Alex Cora knows it.
"Outstanding," Cora said. "A lot of swings and misses with the fastball, not too many foul balls today, which was good. Good changeup, cutter, sinker, they were great."
One of the things Rodriguez did particularly well was throw first-pitch strikes. They threw first-pitch strikes to 17 of the first 18 batters they faced, which helped them get ahead in counts and finish off batters quickly. In the past, Rodriguez has tried to be a bit too perfect with their pitches, which has resulted in high pitch counts and plenty of walks. Wednesday, they only walked one batter and got through four innings on just 45 pitches.
"I tried to throw all of my pitches for strikes because I know they swing a lot," Rodriguez said. "If I could just get a quick out or strike one then they're working."
At this point of the season, Rodriguez has been the Red Sox' third best starter, only behind Chris Sale and Rick Porcello.  They are 6-1 with a 3.88 ERA through 11 starts, and is one of just three pitchers to start the season with six-plus wins and no more than one loss, joining Astros pitcher Charlie Morton and Yankees starter Luis Severino.
Boston is 10-1 when Rodriguez takes the mound at this point. In a rotation that features two former Cy Young winners (none of which are named Chris Sale) and four former All-Stars (none of which are named Steven Wright), Rodriguez can be ignored at times. They shouldn't be.
"He's been huge," J.D. Martinez said. "Eddy has been pitching great for us all year. I think they get overlooked in this pitching staff. For them to be able to do what he's been doing has been really fun to watch."
Rodriguez is just 25 years old, which makes them the youngest pitcher in the Red Sox rotation by four years. They have pitched in the big leagues for four years already, but they have not reached their full potential yet.
With starts like Wednesday's becoming more and more common for him, perhaps Rodriguez is closer to their prime than many realized. That's great news for the Red Sox.
Covers Products: Coconut, Strawberry
Since we first took a look at B'More Organic back in 2011, the brand, as well as the drinkable yogurt category it lives in, have evolved quite a bit.
On the former, the most noticeable change for B'More is the product's branding. It has a much more vibrant and clean look, starting with the block font used for the logo. From there, they've arranged the key attributes into different panels and this helps with the readability of the product. However, one thing that we think they could evolve is the messaging, which doesn't include “drinkable yogurt.” We'd argue that this would catch a whole lot more eyeballs than skyr, which, despite growing awareness, is still not something that we'd call mainstream. Furthermore, calling out the probiotic content certainly wouldn't hurt either.
As for the flavors, we sampled two varieties for this review: Coconut and Strawberry. Strawberry is much more of a “staple” flavor as far as yogurt is concerned. Using stevia and the sugars from the added fruit as the sweeteners, the product has a mild, “tad sweet” flavor profile. As we mentioned back in 2011, there's a bitter flavor to the product, which will definitely take some getting used to. Still, it's not a bad tradeoff when you consider that the product has 100 calories, 16g of protein, and only 7g of sugar per 8oz serving. And we really think they nailed the viscosity on this one -- it's thick but not too thick. The Coconut variety, on the other hand, is very viscous to the point where you'll really have to coax it out of the bottle. Coconut cream, which is the source of the coconut flavor, is the likely culprit, but it does impart a nice coconut note to the product's body. However, thinning it out would certainly be helpful.
In the end, we think B'More has a lot of potential and, with this latest effort, is continuing to inch closer towards it. The concept of a low sugar high protein drinkable yogurt is very much on trend and they've made the product look a lot more modern and visually appealing. Now, there's just some refinement that's needed, both in the formulation and how they communicate their value proposition.
A newly released draft of the United Nations' masterplan to transition the internet to IPv6 has met a furious and despairing response from internet engineers.
"Utterly, utterly, broken. It has no redeeming or worthwhile qualities at all," commented one engineer to an dedicated IPv6 working group at Europe's regional internet registry, RIPE.
Others called the draft "fundamentally flawed," "ill-conceived," "awful," and "pointless to the degree of being self-destructive."
With one day left before RIPE is due to provide formal comments, there is not a single positive sentence, and the general consensus appears to be that the entire document should be binned.
So what is this draft that attracted so much ire from the internet community and why is it so flawed?
IPv6 growth is slowing and no one knows why. Let's see if El Reg can address what's going on READ MORE
The recommendation [PDF] has been produced by a study group (SG 20) within the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and was shared for the first time last month with RIPE after the organization specifically requested to see what the group had been working on.
The aim of the recommendation is, in its own words, to "ease the adoption and transition to IPv6 by end-users in developing countries and to reduce the risks of a digital divide in terms of IPv6 adoption."
And to that end, the document paints a picture of advanced Western economies that are slowly moving to 128-bit IPv6 addresses from the traditional and overcrowded 32-bit network address space of IPv4 – while emerging economies remain almost entirely reliant on IPv4 addresses that are in increasingly short supply.
It therefore aims to provide a "reference model" for such countries to help them get to IPv6 faster and more efficiently, with a specific focus on the "internet of things" (IoT) which will require huge numbers of fresh IP addresses to properly function.
So, um, no
The problem that the internet engineers immediately identified, however, is the document's main proposed solution: that IPv4 addresses be mapped to IPv6 addresses, one-to-one.
The document argues: "To enable mapping between and consistency between IPv4 and IPv6 subnet addressing plans, a dual strategy is proposed, with part of the IPv6 subnet addressing plan designed to map corresponding IPv4 addresses, with the possibility to extend the IPv6 subnet addressing plan and benefit from its scalability where this constraint is not required."
That may seem like a logical approach – basically moving everything step-by-step from IPv4 to IPv6 and then expanding once done – but internet backbone engineers who actually build out real-world networks are horrified. One guru broke down their concerns into five bullet points:
The model is inapplicable to real-world networks. The model will dramatically hinder any further evolution of all IP based networking. The model carries all legacy problems from IPv4 into the IPv6 era. The model precludes the application of several of the most basic security measures considered best practice by todays standards. The model shortens the expected usable lifetime of IPv6 by at least 25 per cent, or 42-plus years at the current internet growth.
Basically what the ITU is proposing would not only pull over many of the problems associated with IPv4, but would also chew up valuable space making sure that the 1:1 mapping worked. In effect, it would downgrade IPv6 into IPv4+, with the plus simply being more addresses.
Living in the past
"This document seems to have been written with a world view from 2012-2014," complained another engineer who noted that references to transition technologies like 6to4 and Teredo was already out of date.
Another chimed in: "IPv4 suffers from potentially crippling shortages and address allocation optimization requirements for IPv4 bear no relation to sensible and relevant optimization strategies for IPv6. It is extraordinary to see the two conflated in a document like this."
And another: "This plan seems too far removed from operational reality to be really usable. It looks like an academic exercise without operational experience."
Others pointed to a broad range of errors in the document from how address allocation actually works to mistakes made in protocol names and references.
"There are a number of explicit misunderstandings in the document, and they are not small misunderstandings. They will (not might) create operational issues if implemented as explained," warned another.
On top of which, the approach goes directly against fundamental principles decided on by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) several years ago – a key one of which is even quoted in the document – that future network standards "assume the use of IPv6, and be written so they do not require IPv4."
In effect, the ITU is arguing that because the roads are bad in some countries, every car – from old bangers to modern sports motors – should have their engines pulled out, wheels taken off, and replaced with tractor engines and tires. That way, they will all be able to drive on the road. The engineers, on the other hand, want to lay down new tarmac.

PanARMENIAN.Net - A rare masterpiece by the German painter Georg Baselitz (estimated £6.5m-8.5m) is set to break the record for the artist at auction when offered at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Evening Auction in London on 8 March 2017. Mit Roter Fahne (With Red Flag), 1965, from the artist's ground-breaking ‘Heroes' series, is a painting that cemented the artist's reputation as one of the most provocative and compelling voices of the post-war era, Art Daily said.
Baselitz's striking canvas is one of an outstanding group of 17 works by German artists to feature in Sotheby's flagship contemporary auction in London, representing around a quarter of lots on offer. Further highlights include Gerhard Richter's desolately beautiful Eisberg (estimate: £8-12m; dedicated release available here), Anselm Kiefer's monumental Athanor (estimate: £1.5-2.5m), Sigmar Polke's Pop-inspired Die Schmiede (estimate: £1-1.5 million), a major painting by Martin Kippenberger (estimate: £3-4 million), alongside key works by Wolfgang Tillmans, Albert Oehlen, Thomas Schütte, Günther Förg, Günther Uecker and Michael Krebber.
Alex Branczik, Sotheby's Head of Contemporary Art, Europe said “Seismic moments of social and political change in history have always created seismic changes in art, something we undoubtedly see in post-war Germany. Many of these artists tackled challenging; some might say profound, subject matter, while at the same time creating new visual languages which redefined European art history.”
The Growth of German Contemporary The market for German contemporary art has gone from strength to strength in recent years, led by the £30.4m ($46.3m) achieved for Gerhard Richter's Abstraktes Bild at Sotheby's London in 2015, a record for any living European artist. Richter is just one from a wave of German post-war masters defining today's contemporary art market.
• Over the last 5 years there has been a 31% increase in the number of bidders on German Contemporary Art at Sotheby's auctions worldwide.
• In Sotheby's flagship Evening London contemporary sales in 2016, around 20% of the works offered were by German artists.
• At Sotheby's October 2016 ‘Frieze Week' sales in London, the 9 works offered by German artists accounted for 43.3% (£20.76m) of the overall sale total.
• In the last two years alone, new auction records have been set for Wolfgang Tilmans, Gerhard Richter, Albert Oehlen, Thomas Schütte, Georg Baselitz, Martin Kippenberger, Günther Uecker, Sigmar Polke, Michael Krebber and Günther Förg.

ISLAMABAD - The United States does not have any favourites among the top political parties contesting the July 25 elections in Pakistan, diplomatic sources said.
Speaking to The Nation, US Embassy Spokesperson Richard Snelsire said: “We believe it is up to the people of Pakistan to decide.”
They said Washington obviously had no favourites - among the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf.
Earlier, US State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said the US supported free, transparent and responsible election in Pakistan.
Nauert said that Pakistan recently passed electoral reforms law and “we hope that the new comprehensive legal framework will be helpful in the transfer of power to the new democratic government.”
They said US wanted that global observers to monitor the upcoming elections in Pakistan.
Pak-US ties have been frosty for several months. In January, the US suspended security assistance to Pakistan targeting the Coalition Support Fund. State Department said the US was suspending ‘security assistance only' to Pakistan. Washington said Pakistan will be able to receive the suspended funding if it took ‘decisive actions' against the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban.
Pakistan said it was not dependent on US aid for its war on terror. The foreign ministry said Pakistan had fought the war against terrorism largely from its own resources “which has cost over $120 billion in 15 years.”
Pakistan said the money it had received from the US was mainly reimbursements for supporting US-led coalition forces after they invaded Afghanistan in 2001.
This month President Mamnoon Hussain called general elections on July 25. The Election Commission of Pakistan has made it clear that general elections will be held on the fixed date as there was no reason for any reason. “We are bound to hold elections within 60 days of the completion of a government's tenure,” said one official.
The ECP yesterday summoned assets details of caretaker Prime Minister-designate Nasirul Mulk and their family members. The Commission directed to provide assets details within the three days after taking office. The details would be provided on ECP's Form-B.
For the new-elected government, improving ties with the US will be a big challenge. Pakistan in the recent past has shown more tilt towards Russia and China amid the US snub.
This month, the two countries imposed restrictions on the movement of the diplomats. A letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the embassy of the United States said the US diplomatic cargo at Pakistani airports and ports will be strictly treated in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which does not provide for an exemption from scanning.
The decision was taken reciprocating to travel permission regime introduced by the US government on Pakistani diplomats and officials. Under the fresh directives, the US embassy and consulates in Pakistan will no longer avail facilities of using tainted glass on official vehicles and rented transport, non-diplomatic number plates on official vehicles, diplomatic number plates on unspecified and rented vehicles; and the facility of biometrically unverified or unregistered cell phone SIMs.
SHAFQAT ALI
PanARMENIAN.Net - The Kremlin would not draw parallels between what is happening in Armenia and the coup d'état in Ukraine, press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday, April 24.
According to him, the situation is completely different, and the comparison is inappropriate.
“Of course, we still have to analyze the situation, and I repeat: we are closely following the developments,” Peskov was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
“But now I can say that it's inappropriate to draw any kind of comparison with Ukraine,” Peskov said in response to a question whether the events in Armenia can be considered a coup d'état, as similar events in Ukraine were also carried out "under pressure from street.”
Serzh Sargsyan resigned as Armenia's prime minister under pressure from mass civil unrest, led mainly by young people, in the capital, Yerevan, on Tuesday, April 23.
LAHORE, Apr 24 (APP):Director Development and Domestic, Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), former hockey Olympian Naveed Alam has reiterated that the three phase process of Inter Club Competition, Club's Scrutiny
and Elections will go a long way in putting the domestic hockey structure at right place and thus help reinvigorate Pakistan's national sport.
They were addressing a press conference at the National Hockey Stadium here on Tuesday.
“PHF desires that the genuine hockey clubs and players as well as game's true lovers and patrons get due recognition and representation,” they said adding “PHF is committed to streamlining hockey affairs in the larger interest of the game and these efforts are part of it.”
The inter-club competition is being organised in all 144 districts of Pakistan and it will serve as an effective medium to unearth wide range of hockey talent to expand the base of the game, they added.
“It has already started at several places and will hopefully finish by the end of this month,” they said adding “However, considering the enormity of the task, it may be extended for a few days.”
These inter-club competitions will be conducted under the supervision of the PHF and will include technical delegates, observers and district sports officers.
“We will ensure that club championship is organised in a way in which genuine clubs take part,” they said.
Once, the inter club is over, the scrutiny process will start and the entire process will be conducted in a transparent manner, said the PHF official.
The teams will be photographed. Each club must have its own ground with a minimum of 14 active players. All the matches are to be video recorded. This will help to judge if the club has genuine players. The club is restricted to have a maximum of three departmental players.
“The players' CNIC/B Forms will be authenticated and they will be registered only at the place of their domicile,” they added.
The former Olympian said the scrutiny committees have almost been finalised and will be announced soon by the Chief Election Commissioner whose name will be announced in a few days.
“The last phase of the Elections will be held the same day in all the districts throughout the country. Only the clubs identified as genuine will be allowed to participate in the elections,” they said.
The districts' elections will be followed by the divisional, provincial and national elections in that sequence.
To a question, they said, PHF President Brigadier (retd) Khalid Sajjad Khokhar has emphasised that the whole process should be transparent with full implementation of the laid down procedures.
Answering a question, Director Development and Domestic agreed that many people will get unhappy during this process, “You can't satisfy everyone when conducting an exercise to get rid of bogus clubs and people with self interests, who are least bothered by Pakistan hockey's
decline”.
“All this process has been approved by the PHF Congress and Executive Board,” they added.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Four Arab countries that imposed sanctions on Qatar have told the United States that U.S. companies doing business with them would not be punished for also working with Doha, four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Foreign firms have become increasingly cautious on their cross border dealings over concerns they could fall foul of the region's biggest diplomatic crisis in years.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in July reassuring them that U.S. companies would not be discriminated against as part of the boycott, according to sources with knowledge of the letter.
The European Union has been given similar "official ... verbal assurances" by the UAE, the EU Delegation to the UAE told Reuters.
In the letter to Tillerson, the four countries said that they valued and intended to maintain their relationships with U.S. companies and that those ties would not be affected by the boycott, according to a source who has seen the letter.
The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi declined to comment on the letter. The four Arab states did not immediately respond to Reuters questions on the letter.
Tillerson made a four-day visit to the region in July where they met both sides of the dispute and made proposals to help end the crisis.
The four Arab countries cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas and the home to the region's biggest U.S. military base.
BIG CONTRACTS TO BE WON
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on July 17 that the UAE would not ask foreign companies to choose between doing business with it or Qatar.
That followed comments from the UAE Ambassador to Russia Omar Ghobash to Britain's Guardian newspaper on June 28 that companies could be made to choose as part of a new round of sanctions on Qatar.
Top U.S. companies have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute and there are big contracts to be won in wealthy Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, signed business deals worth tens of billions of dollars with U.S. companies during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Riyadh in May.
State-owned airlines in the UAE and Qatar are leading customers of U.S. planemaker Boeing, and Doha, which will host the 2022 World Cup, is seeking partners to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production.
Some companies have taken steps to restructure their Middle East operations so that Qatar no longer reports to their regional headquarters, often located in Dubai, in a bid to avoid any conflict.
One of the sources said that there have been no known incidents of a U.S. company being discriminated against by the four Arab countries because of the dispute with Qatar.

The Department of Health is issuing an advisory after high levels of bacteria were detected in waters off Waikiki.
Officials report an increase in enterococci that exceeds water quality standards off Royal Moana Beach.
That stretch of beach is right in front of the Moana Surfrider in the center of Waikiki.
Officials say contact with water in this area could make you sick. More tests will be done until bacteria levels drop.
The levels are likely tied to the recent storm, as a brown water advisory remains in effect for the entire island of Oahu.
Rain can cause runoff containing bacteria, debris, and more to reach the ocean.

The 28-year-old, who began their career at Trinity, rejoined the club on a two-year deal in November last year from Huddersfield and impressed during their 25 appearances as Wakefield finished fifth.
Wood, who is now tied to the club until the end of the 2020 season, told wakefieldtrinity.com: “I am really happy with the new deal. We had a pretty good season last year, a couple of players have signed here again and I want to be a part of the club.
“We can definitely build on what we did last year and have an even better season.”
Trinity head coach Chris Chester is delighted to keep hold of one of their most influential players at Belle Vue.
They said: “I am thrilled that Kyle has extended their stay with us for a further three years. They had an exceptional season for us last year.
“I am looking forward to watching them build a partnership with Tyler (Randell) over next season and see them go from strength to strength.”
RWD Record Back-up Plan: Porsche 911 GT3 RS Cracks ‘ring in 6:56.4
Porsche has a thing with the legendary Nürburgring. After the 911 GT2 RS demolished the record for rear-wheel-drive production cars with a 6:47.3 late last year, the 911 GT3 RS has now set a 6:56.4 – 0.6 of a second quicker than even the 918 hybrid hypercar managed.
The new Porsche 911 GT3 RS promises to elevate the GT3 experience by giving something as close to a Cup Racer as possible, and with agility of this sort, that promise doesn't seem too far fetched at all. With a fair bit of hardware from the more mental GT2 RS, the GT3 RS packs a wallop. The 4.0-litre naturally-aspirated boxer-six makes 520 PS, allowing a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 3.2 seconds, and a top speed of 312 km/h – the focus, of course, is on agility and cornering speed rather than outright top-end pace. The car was fit with the latest generation Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tyres – 265/35 ZR 20 front and 325/30 ZR 21 rear. Optimised for track-day use, these tyres are fully compliant with US and EU regulations and can soon be ordered at every Porsche Centre and selected tyre dealers for your 911 GT3 RS and 911 GT2 RS.
Kévin Estre, Porsche works racing driver, set a lap time in 6:56.4 with the 911 GT3 RS. This time was 24 seconds faster than the best time achieved with the previous-generation GT3 RS. Porsche development driver Lars Kern shared driving duties with Estre.
Estre, 29, began the record lap at 11:40 am with a 14°Celsius ambient and 18°C track temperature. After the run, they commented, “This lap was a sensational experience for me. Through the fast corners and on the brakes in particular, the GT3 RS is unbelievably close to our racing car GT3 R. This is also thanks to the new generation of tyres for road going sports cars. I like the engine of the GT3 RS a lot. Up to 9,000 revs per minute from a six-cylinder engine just feels fantastic. The sound is a dream and the torque is massive.”
The new 911 GT3 RS is the third production Porsche sports car, after the 918 and the 911 GT2 RS, with a notarised lap time of under seven minutes at the “Green Hell”, the world's most demanding race track with its 20.6-km lap. It is available to order for Rs 2.75 crore (base price, before tax) in India. You may also personalise your car to suit you specific taste using the Porsche Car Configurator.

California's drought is now over, but these maps show the major effects it caused across the state.
After six years, the California drought is officially over. The National Drought Mitigation Center has determined that just 9.3% of the state is considered to be in "moderate drought" or worse than of April 11. California governor Jerry Brown lifted the state of emergency (pdf) regarding the drought in all but four counties on April 7.
An influx of moisture over the last few months has caused growth in flora all over the state, even in the deserts where typically brown mountains have turned green with vegetation.
Superficially, this can be seen in the color of the state. Satellite imagery compiled by Quartz show California, and especially the agriculture-heavy Central Valley, as a deeper shade of green now than at any other time since the beginning of the drought.
The drought caused tough times for industry and agriculture, which, facing local water-use restrictions, began having to truck in water from elsewhere or drill deeper wells. In other states these restrictions might only have local or regional effects, but in California the repercussions spread far and wide. The state produces 11% of the US's agricultural output and grows 51% of the US's fruits and vegetables by value, as of the most recent USDA agricultural census conducted in 2012.
Let's take a look at the three factors scientists have been using to evaluate California's drought and how they've changed over the last six years.
Snow Pack
The snow that covers the Sierra Nevada and Trinity mountain ranges are a store of moisture for the whole state. Snow that falls in the winter melts through the spring and summer, seeping into the ground or flowing into rivers. The majority of California's drinking water comes from the Sierra Mountains' snowpack.
On April 1, 2017 the California snowpack was at 164% of normal. That's well above the totals from previous years. It has been six years since officials measured above-average snowpack on April 1.
Surface water
Melting snow and falling rain ends up in rivers, which feed reservoirs that store water for use all year. As of March 2017, 51% of stream gauges in the state show water flowing at or above their long-term average level. At the same time in 2014, that figure was just 11%.
California has been exceptionally rainy this year with many locations around the state experiencing floods. Six months into the current October-to-September water year, the state has received 144% of its average annual precipitation. The season is currently California's wettest on record.
Another measure of surface water is the levels of reservoirs. During the drought, those sank to dire levels.
Reservoirs around the state are full again. Ten of California's 12 major reservoirs are above their historic average. In December 2015 all were at less than 50% of their historical average.
Researchers at the US Geological Survey found that parts of the Central Valley was sinking two inches a month during the drought as farmers and others pumped water out of the ground faster than it was replenished. Continued change in ground level could wreak havoc on existing infrastructure. Roads, pipelines, and canals could all fail as the land beneath them shifts.
Already, the ground has sunk enough that operators of the California Aqueduct must reduce flow in certain areas by 20% to account for grade changes.
Recently, farmers have started to be more proactive about trying to replenish groundwater. Some have taken to flooding their fields with stormwater with the hope that as the water seeps into the ground it will recharge the aquifer beneath.
For now things are looking up. 2017 will be the first year since 2006 that farmers in the Central Valley will be granted a full water allotment by the federal Bureau of Reclamation.
But the outlook for California's water future is uncertain. While the drought emergency has been declared over, many of the restrictions on water use remain in place, and with the unpredictable weather patterns brought on by climate change, California could end up back in a new drought as soon as next year.
Are you a fan of those movie nights where, rather than choosing something award-winning or long-beloved, you instead decide on something unimaginably old and cheesy, so that you can have fun relentlessly bashing it? Then you're in luck, because so is Joel Hodgson, who just revived a classic series through Netflix based on that exact premise.
“Mystery Science Theatre 3000: The Return,” which just premiered its first season on Netflix last Friday, April 14, is a revival of the original MST3K show that became a cult classic on Comedy Central during the 90s.
As with the original, the show centers around an average lab worker who ends up trapped on the moon, subjected by evil villains to the torture of having to watch horrible B-movies. In order to keep their sanity, they invent robots that make fun of the movies with him. Hilarity ensues.
Each episode runs about 90 minutes and features an entire movie, with running witty commentary from lab worker Jonah Heston (played by Hodgson) and their robot companions Crow and Tom Servo, who have remained from the original. It's essentially just like having a cheesy movie night with your friends, but having all the work of making jokes done for you.
Hodgson's revival thankfully proves to be just as funny as the original, allaying many old-school fans' fears.
With movies as awful as “Reptillicus,” about the reign of a terribly made paper-mache Danish Godzilla, and “Starcrash,” a 1970's Star Wars knock-off starring David Hasselhoff, the work is essentially cut out for the writers. Even so, the jokes remain smart, well-timed and delightfully absurd.
While 2010s topical humor occasionally comes off as forced (though mishaps are understandable when considering the task of filling a 90-minute movie with jokes), when it's on, it's perfect. Mentions of Twitter seem obligatory, but a well-placed Kickstarter joke is always welcome.
In a good move by Hodgson, the campy brand of humor from the original has remained intact, with the same cheesy theme song, commercial breaks and animations. Although it doesn't feel quite the same without the grainy 90s VHS quality, it shows signs of a faithful adaptation and lends a warm, positive, family-friendly vibe to the show.
The only major misstep in the adaptation comes in the skits that display the behind-the-scenes lore of the show. While Jonah's interactions with their robot pals are usually quite funny, the antics of their captors Kinga Forrester and Max (evil moon business tycoons who replace the protagonists' enslaving employers from the original) are decidedly not.
Felicia Day, who plays Kinga, tries far too hard with the campy dialogue that they are given and doesn't seem to understand the nature of the humor, and the hysterical Patton Oswalt is very underutilized in the role of Max. It's bad enough to necessitate bringing on a fake-mustache wearing Jerry Seinfeld to play a space venture capitalist later in the season.
These missteps aside though, MST3K is a hilarious, faithful and original piece of comedy that will make for a great night's entertainment, and thankfully, 14 nights worth of it is currently available on Netflix.

Below is Sami Zayn talking to Dasha Fuentes after they teamed with Shinsuke Nakamura and AJ Styles to defeat WWE United States Champion Kevin Owens, Baron Corbin and Dolph Ziggler in the main event of last night's SmackDown. Sami says the win was a big one. Sami says he's had a lot of come-from-behind victories in their career but that was one of the biggest ever.
Sami says no one expected them to come back and win after the beating they took on SmackDown – the same way no one expects them to win the Money In the Bank Ladder Match on Sunday. Sami says the “Underdog of the Underground” label has been put on them and they sometimes wish it wasn't. On the other hand, he's glad they do have the label because people underestimate them and the win on SmackDown is what happens when people underestimate him. Sami says people can go ahead and count them out but they shouldn't be surprised when they win.

CALGARY—Harvie Passage, a stretch of whitewater rapids on the Bow River downstream of the Calgary Zoo, used to be known as a death trap. Now, after two attempts at a rebuild — the first was ruined by the 2013 flood — the passage has reopened as a space safe for public enjoyment, with a series of artificial pools and rapids for paddlers. Though its official opening was delayed, the waterway has been open to the public since June 28.

“The reviews have been really good,” said Chuck Lee of the Alberta Whitewater Association. “We've got lots of people who are eager to try paddling.” Harvie Passage used to be the site of a weir — a low dam — originally built in 1904. The province built a new one in 1975, which diverted river water into an irrigation canal system.

However, the structure had an unfortunate side effect: a hydraulic wave with an often-fatal undertow. The weir was responsible for more than a dozen deaths over three decades, many of them wayward rafters who ignored the warning signs. “Every few years, there'd be another drowning,” said Lee. The weir also blocked fish from passing through — flocks of pelicans would gather nearby and feast on the easy prey. A redesigned Harvie Passage was opened in 2012, with whitewater features for paddlers. The project, which cost $16 million, also split the river into two channels with different difficulty levels. But it only lasted a few months. The 2013 flood not only damaged the newly built structures, but also altered the flow of the channel itself. Harvie Passage had been closed ever since, with an $8-million repair effort funded by the Federal Disaster Recovery Program.
“There's a ton of people who've been waiting patiently and not so patiently to get into the passage,” said Calgary city Councillor Gian-Carlo Carra, whose ward includes Harvie Passage. Now, the passage has been redesigned to withstand a similar size flood. It's also friendlier to wildlife than the 1975 version, allowing fish to pass through. Lee said a few hundred paddlers have already been out on the water in the channel.

The area isn't risk-proof — the province is reminding boaters that life-jackets are still required and the rapids are for paddlers, not rafters. But it's no longer a “killing machine,” said Carra. “They've put it back in place better than before,” said Carra. “I fully expect it to pick up where it left off.” However, the work isn't done. Though Harvie Passage is essentially a recreational facility — Lee compares it to a hockey rink or a swimming pool — it lacks infrastructure such as changing rooms and washrooms. “We now need to get the city to make a plan,” Lee said. Carra said the city could look at such amenities, which would likely fit with its general plans for that section of the Bow River. However, it'll be dictated by demand, they added. “It's going to take years to get it all in place,” Carra said. “It starts with being able to get back into the river and have a love affair with it, as I know Calgarians do.”

Inn Out of the Cold may need a new name if it is expanded to provide accommodation during all four seasons.
On Wednesday county council will decide whether they will provide the funding that will enable the homeless shelter to operate on a year-round basis.
“It's been known for the last 14 years that homelessness doesn't end when it's not cold out,” said Paul Beaton, director of human services for the county. “It's not a weather-related condition. It's an affordable housing issue”
Operation Sharing has operated the shelter, currently located in Old St Paul's Church, for the past 13 years.
Chaplain Stephen Giuliano, executive director of Operation Sharing, said in the past they “was not a big fan of a year-round homeless shelter.”
“I was hoping the community, in the short term, could hold the tension at having (a year-round shelter) and be motivated to come up with something more progressive and dignified in terms of individual dwellings,” they said. “But having said that -- we have a serious problem with the issue of homelessness in the county -- the numbers are up.”
Giuliano said recently they have had up to 12 people a night, with marked increase in the number of women, people who need supports and working poor utilizing the facility.
As well, they said, the shelter has been renovated and improved over the years and now includes showers and laundry facilities.
“It's far more dignified for people who need to stay there than it was in the past,” they said.
Despite being located in Woodstock, the shelter has been proven to be a county-wide service, Beaton said.
Currently the county provides about $90,000 in funding to the shelter, which would increase to roughly $150,000, largely used to pay salaries.
Inn Out of the Cold currently operates from November to April from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
According to a report going before council Wednesday, people experiencing homelessness have historically attended the local homeless shelter for the months of November to April. From May until October they utilized shelters in other communities.
“A critically low vacancy rate and high average market rent contribute to homelessness,” reads the report going before council Wednesday.
Vacancy rates in Oxford County as reported by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation are 2.6 per cent. The average price of one-bedroom apartment is $908 per month.
“These two data points contribute to homelessness in Oxford County when one considers the average Ontario Works cheque is $721 per months for a single person for shelter and basic needs,” the report read.
Shelters operating year-round in neighbouring communities such as London, Brantford and Waterloo are denying access to Oxford clientele.
“As a result Operation Sharing has expressed a willingness to operate on a yearlong basis,” the report read.
Inn Out of the Cold also provides access to addiction services, as well as programs offered by Operation Sharing, and referrals to other community programs.

Nina LARSON - With the nuclear threat at its most acute in decades, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize, is urgently pressing to consign the bomb to history.
The Geneva-based organisation, known by the acronym ICAN, has for the past decade been sounding the alarm over the massive dangers posed by nuclear weapons and campaigning for a global ban.
It secured a significant victory in July this year when the United Nations adopted a new treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. But with actual disarmament of the world's nuclear arsenal likely still far off, ICAN is not resting on its laurels.
"We're not done yet... The job isn't done until nuclear weapons are gone," ICAN chief Beatrice Fihn told AFP this week.
Pointing to the current nuclear standoff between Washington and Pyongyang as "a wake-up call", they insisted on the urgent need to disarm the world's 15,000 or so nuclear weapons.
"Nuclear weapons have the risk of literally ending the world," added the Swedish national, who took charge of ICAN in 2014. "As long as they exist, the risk will be there, and eventually our luck will run out."
'Landmark achievement'
Founded in Vienna in 2007 on the fringes of an international conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, ICAN has tirelessly mobilised campaigners and celebrities alike in its cause.
From its offices in the buildings of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, ICAN works with 468 non-governmental organisations across 101 countries, including rights, development, environmental and peace groups.
A decade ago, the anti-nuclear movement was fragmented, Fihn said, explaining that ICAN was created to help a vast array of groups pushes for a ban similar to the global agreements forbidding the use of biological and chemical weapons, landmines and cluster munitions.
Those efforts paid off in July this year, when 122 countries at the UN adopted the new treaty banning nuclear weapons, despite harsh opposition from the United States and other nuclear powers.
"It is really a landmark achievement," Fihn said, acknowledging though that the adoption of the treaty was merely "a starting point".
None of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons - the United States, Russia, Britain, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel - took part in the negotiations. And the treaty will only enter into force when 50 countries have signed and ratified it, a process that could take months or years. But while there is no way as of yet to force nuclear powers to disarm, Fihn voiced optimism that the treaty declaring them illegal would help stigmatise them.
"The more countries we can rally to reject nuclear weapons and the more public opinion changes to think that this is unacceptable, the harder it is going to be for the nuclear-armed states to justify it," they said.
'On the way out'
"Once it is prohibited, these weapons are on the way out," they added.
ICAN argues that any use of nuclear weapons would lead to catastrophic consequences for which there could be no effective humanitarian response, and so eliminating them is the only way to prevent their use.
The organisation points out that, given the power that has been added to these weapons, "a single nuclear warhead, if detonated on a large city, could kill millions of people, with the effects persisting for decades."
Spending on nuclear weapons across the nine states that have them exceeds $105 billion a year - money that ICAN says would be better far spent on healthcare, education and disaster relief.
The organisation today gets by on an annual budget of around $1 million and is funded by private donations as well as the European Union and countries including Norway, Switzerland, Germany and the Vatican. But while it may not have a lot of resources at its disposal, ICAN does have many of the world's famous and powerful championing its cause.
The Dalai Lama, Yoko Ono and Desmond Tutu are among those voicing support for the organisation's mission on its website. "I can imagine a world without nuclear weapons, and I support ICAN," the Dalai Lama declares.
Actor and activist Martin Sheen meanwhile suggests in their quote that "if Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr were alive today, they would be part of ICAN."
Iowans are being reminded about the risks of inner tubing after an Omaha 15-year-old died Monday while tubing at Lake Manawa in Council Bluffs.
Todd Robertson, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, says with heat indices soaring lately, even though you're surrounded by water, you still need to drink plenty of fluids while tubing.
“You have to drink enough water because heat exhaustion can come onto you,” Robertson says. “Even though you're relaxing in a tube and just floating down the river, if that's what you're doing, it still takes a little bit of energy and plus you've got the sun beating down on you, so you have to stay hydrated.”
Robertson says inner tubes can be difficult to control, especially with all of the recent rain and the swift-moving water. “You have your hands and you have your feet, you don't have a paddle, so you're basically at the mercy of the current when you're in a tube,” they say. “Some of these rivers that are really high in the state right now, you have no business being on anyway, and if you're on a tube, chances are you're gonna end up in some of that debris.”
Robertson says higher water levels often hide downed trees and branches. They say river users can enjoy the scenery but need to keep an eye downstream to avoid any hazardous surprises. They also suggest bringing along a buddy and letting those at home know where you're going.

A pensioner who drove their car into the back of another man's legs has been banned from driving and ordered to take an extended test before getting their licence back.
Barry Arundell pleaded not guilty at Warwick Crown Court to assaulting their victim Michael Miles, causing them actual bodily harm, but guilty to dangerous driving.
Arundell, 72, of Grenfell Close, Leamington, was given a conditional discharge for 12 months, disqualified for 12 months, after which they will have to take an extended test, and ordered to pay £340 costs.
Prosecutor Graham Russell said the two men had previously been friends until they fell out some years ago – but Arundell lived in the same street as Mr Miles's girlfriend.
On July 5 last year Mr Miles was taking their girlfriend's dogs for a walk, and they were off their leads when they heard a car ‘coming at some speed.'
Mr Miles stood in the road and signalled to the driver, Arundell, to stop so they could speak to them about their speed.
“The defendant didn't stop, but continued travelling at slow speed towards him, and collided at very low speed with Mr Miles's leg,” said Mr Russell.
A CCTV recording from a camera at a nearby house showed Mr Miles turning away before being struck by Arundell's Renault, causing them to stumble onto the bonnet.
Mr Miles walked away, and continued walking the dogs, but on their return they contacted the police and photographs were taken of the bruising to their legs.
When Arundell was arrested, they said they had been driving at 14mph, and claimed that Mr Miles had been moving away from them but kicking out at the car.
And they denied driving at him, claiming Mr Miles had been trying to set them up, added Mr Russell.
Addressing Arundell's barrister, Judge Sally Hancox commented: “Whatever the difficulty between these two men, what on earth was they thinking?
“Looking at the bruising in the pictures, it's bad enough – but it could have been much worse.”
Delroy Henry, defending, said: “It really is sad when friends fall out.”
But the judge responded: “This was still an assault, and whatever Mr Arundell said to the police, he's been sensible to accept their wrong-doing today.”
Mr Henry added that Arundell is married with two adult children, and they and their wife are due to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary this month.
They pointed out that the mandatory disqualification will cause difficulties for Arundell, who has health problems including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – and the car they were driving was their Motability vehicle.
Sentencing Arundell, Judge Hancox told him: “Whatever had passed between you two gentlemen in the past, what on earth were you thinking, even at such a low speed, and even when one man was standing in front of another man's car?
“The courts frequently refer to cars being used as a weapon – and that is exactly what you have done.
“You were in a car, and no matter how slowly you were driving, you continued to go forward at low speed, and it's clear you made contact with the back of their legs and knees.
“I have seen photographs of the bruising. They thankfully have suffered no further injury as a result of what you did.
“Had you pleaded not guilty and had a trial, a judge would have had to consider whether a term of custody should be considered. But this matter could have properly been dealt with before the magistrates.”
And they added: “Hopefully you and they will be able to behave towards each-other with a little more dignity in the future.”
PESHAWAR - Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police chief Salahuddin Khan Mehsud Monday said no evidence of blasphemy was found against lynched university student.
A mob murdered journalism student Mashal Khan at Abdul Wali Khan University in the conservative northwestern town of Mardan last week.
The deceased was stripped, beaten and shot before being thrown from the second floor of their hostel for allegedly committing blasphemy.
The Supreme Court has taken suo moto notice of this brutal act while high-ups, including Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and KP-ruling PTI chief Imran Khan, vowed to bring the culprits to justice.
"There are no evidence with police against Mashal, their friends Abdullah and Zubair to implicate them in any blasphemous act,” the IGP told the media.
The IGP said Zubair, a friend of Mashal, had recorded their statement and they categorically rejected these allegations.
The top cop said the police would submit the detailed report to the Supreme Court today (Tuesday).
They said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has also been requested to identify the fake account in the name of Mashal Khan.
“Police have arrested 22 persons, including six staff members of the university,” they said, adding that before the brutal killing, news was circulated in the university against Mashal to provoke the mob.
They added 16 persons were arrested after their nomination in the first information report (FIR) while six other persons were arrested through various videos.
They said police person who is visible in the video was a DSP who took the Mashal's body out of the university. They promised stern action would be taken against culprits.
The IGP said the Maltoon Town DSP recovered Abdullah from an admin room they were locked in to save them from the mob.
They said when the administration and police were searching Mashal to save them from the mob, a gunfire was heard in the hostel 1, some 800 yards away from the administration block.
They informed the media that after the incident, police reached the site and dispersed the mobsters through baton-charge and arrested 59 persons on the spot.
They said there was nothing substantial against Mashal, Adbullah and Zubair.
Survivor records statement
Abdullah said in their statement before a Mardan magistrate that they belonged to a religious family and strongly believed in the religion of Islam and Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They said they had no affiliation with any political party.
“Mashal Khan was a talented and brilliant student having a kind heart. On April 13, at around 11am, one of my friends, namely Muhammad Abbas, called me on my cellular phone and told me to come to the journalism department. Abbas was a conspirator,” the statement read.
It adds: “Upon their call, I proceeded to the journalism department and saw Mudassir Bashir (the class representative), the actual perpetrator, along with other students who there and then, charged me and Mashal Khan with blasphemy and all of them alleged that we have deviated from the right path along with Zubair.”
They said that in response to that, they had bluntly refused and narrated Kalma Taiba. They said they were later forced to say against Mashal and falsely implicate them in blasphemy allegations but they refused to do so.
They were locked in a bathroom by “teacher Idress, Farooq and Zia Hamdard to save them from the mob”.
They said some students broke the window and tortured them but police rescued them and shifted them to hospital.
They said they heard about the brutal murder of Mashal in hospital. They alleged that university administration was against Mashal for their interview in which they had criticised the administration for mismanagement and loopholes in the system.
Suspect'S statement
Dawn reported on its website that a student arrested in the Mashal Khan lynching case claimed that the university administration asked them to testify against him.
The accused, Wajahat, claimed in the statement given to the police that Mashal Khan had “anti-Islamic views since the start, whereas, Abdullah and Zubair followed him".
"I used to snub Mashal Khan for their discourteous attitude towards Islam and advised them to abstain from such nefarious and devilish designs but they always lent deaf ears to," Wajahat stated.
They admitted that they were part of the mob which lynched the 23-year-old Mardan university student.
Wajahat claimed in their statement that on April 13 they were called to the chairperson's office by class representative Mudassir Bashir, who asked them to testify against Mashal before the university administration.
"Some 15 to 20 people, including university officials were present at the chairperson's office.
"The administration had convened the meeting to decide the case of Mashal Khan and Bashir had called me to be a witness regarding the blasphemous ideas of Mashal Khan," said the accused.
They also alleged that the security in-charge of the university, Bilal Baksh, said those that step forward to protect Mashal and their supporters would be dealt with "an iron hand".
Baksh, according to Wajahat, further said that they would kill Mashal.
"Hearing this, the congress turned into a violent mob and rushed towards the hostel," said Wajahat.
In the statement, Wajahat has said that if they had known what the administration was conspiring against Mashal, they would have never come to the university on that day.

Authorities say a Summerville police officer and their K-9 partner were not seriously injured after a drunk driver crashed into their vehicle.
It happened Thursday night when the officer was conducting a traffic stop on a car on North Main Street NB near E. 9th N. St.
According to a report, while the Summerville PD officer was seated in their patrol vehicle, their cruiser was struck from behind by an intoxicated driver which pushed their vehicle forward and into the rear of the car they originally stopped.
"Our police officer's vehicle was sandwiched between the two other vehicles," SPD officials said."Obviously the collision was violent and it jolted both the police officer and their K-9 partner, but both were not injured seriously."
The officer was transported to Summerville Medical Center for treatment, and they were later released. Their K-9 partner was uninjured.
"The driver of the [stopped] vehicle was uninjured and was released at the scene," authorities said.
According to police, the South Carolina Highway Patrol responded to the scene to investigate the collision and determined there was sufficient probable cause to arrest the driver of the vehicle who struck the police officer's cruiser.
The suspect was charged with DUI and transported to jail where police say they submitted to a breath test which rendered a return BAC of .18%.
"This incident should serve as a valuable reminder to all of us that DUI is not a victimless crime," Summerville police said in a statement."Our agency was blessed not to have lost our 2 Police Officers, or experienced any deaths. The Summerville Police Department remains vigilant by enforcing South Carolina's DUI laws and prosecuting offenders to the fullest extent of the law. We would also like to remind drivers to move over when they see emergency vehicles in the function of their official duties to help keep our public safety officials, roadway workers and tow truck drivers safe while they attempt to do their jobs and go home safely to their families."
"The Summerville Police Department would like to thank all of the citizens who stopped to check on our Police Officer, the Summerville Fire and Rescue and Dorchester County EMS for their response," police said."We would also like to thank the nurses, doctors and staff at the Summerville Medical Center for their kindness."

ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Wednesday that they saw little chances of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan becoming the next prime minister but added that in case they are voted to power, they would tolerate them like they endured Pervez Musharraf's 10 years.
Addressing a press conference to highlight their government's achievements in oil and gas sector, the premier said that the petroleum sector during last five years had witnessed an exceptional growth as the government introduced solid measures to bridge the demand and supply gap.
Responding to questions, the prime minister said that the demeanour adopted by the superior judiciary and the National Accountability Bureau made it impossible for the government to function and stressed the need that all state institutions must work within their constitutional domain.
PM Abbasi said that in case of a complaint against any government servant,, the NAB instead of harassing them or her, or playing the matter in the media, should adopt a proper procedure to approach the ministry concerned for initiation of legal action.
To another question, the prime minister said that they were taking measures to get out of the Financial Action Task Force(FATF) gray list and hoped that they would convince them with their narrative and steps taken so far to satisfy them.
When asked about disproportionate financial assets of their party leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Abbasi said the assets of the Sharif family were rooted in pre-partition and stressed that no scandal of monetary corruption surfaced during the last five years.
They said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz would go to the upcoming general election with renewed determination and on the basis of its performance. They emphasized that the elections are required to be held within 60 days and added that even a delay of a single-day would tantamount to violation of the Constitution and could invoke Article 6 of the Constitution.
Giving details about their government's achievements in the petroleum sector during its five-year term, they said that enhanced local gas production, import of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) at lowest rates and the cross-country pipelines from Iran and Turkmenistan were among the steps taken to meet the energy needs.
The prime minister, who also holds the charge of the Ministry of Petroleum, said the country's total energy consumption stood at 80 million tons of oil equivalent in 2017 and witnessed an increase of 23 percent since 2013.
They mentioned that the domestic gas sector experienced a nominal increase in rates from Rs106 to Rs110 in years 2013 and 2018 respectively.
They said that the agreement reached with consensus by Council of Common Interests paved way for issuance of 46 new licenses and 51 new leases, while 73 facilities were converted to new policies.
They said that 116 new discoveries were made over the past five years which added up 35,000 barrel oil, adding that the biggest long-term achievement in the country's history was the production of an additional quantity of gas which was used during last five years.
The prime minister said that drilling of 445 new wells was a record, of which 221 were of exploratory nature and added that earlier no such discoveries were made in last 30 years.
They regretted that in the past, the follow-up processing of explored gas was ignored and instead ‘wet' gas was added to the mainstream, which put a negative effect on the system.
They said in lieu of gas development surcharge, the federal government gave Rs30 billion to provinces in 2013 and Rs73 billion in 2017.
They said that with an expense of Rs200 billion, a 1700-kilometre-long transmission line was made operational, while work on North-South line with Russia and another with China was in progress. In addition, a 25,000-km distribution line was also being laid.
The prime minister said the number of gas connections had swelled from five to seven million and assured that not a single connection out of two million was given out-of-turn.
They said the government had overcome the severe gas shortage experienced during last few years and now the commodity was available to all domestic and industrial sectors. They said with cheaper rates, import of LNG was a success story which was acknowledged by the world and mentioned that temporary third-party access rules were also made. They said 176 vessels carrying fuel had reached Pakistan in short period, which was a record.
To a question, they dismissed the criticism on LNG project and said the details of the agreement with Qatar were available on the website of Pakistan State Oil, which was the cheapest contract.
Abbasi said the PML-N government in contrast with the previous governments annulled the quota distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
They said that the previous quota was a big scandal with the minting of Rs13,000 on every 1,600 tonnes of LPG daily. They said instead, the government set up air mix plants at every district headquarters of Balochistan and in areas of Chitral, Gilgit, Skardu and Swat.
They said the government also regulated the price of LPG cylinder from Rs2,500 to Rs1,200.
The prime minister said the government introduced import of Euro-2 petrol of international standard having 92 RON as compared to the previous poor quality product having sulfur elements. They said fuel marker was also being introduced to keep a vigil on supply of high-quality petrol.
They said the petrol transmission pipeline from Karachi to Multan to be completed by 2019 would replace the existing fragile supply chain of fuel through trucks and tankers.
They said that Pakistan had become the second largest user of furnace oil in the world, however, the government ceased its import in view of the world standards of environmentally friendly fuel.
Abbasi said in addition to the county's old hydroskimming refineries, work was in progress on a deep conversion refinery being set up by the joint collaboration of PARCO, United Arab Emirates and Austria. They said the five billion dollar refinery would become the country's biggest industrial project.
They also said that a 0.3 million barrel refinery would be set up between Karachi and Lahore with an expense of six to seven billion dollars, adding that these new refineries would ensure energy security.
To a question, the prime minister agreed that the phenomenon of gas theft was a reality and unfortunately was being carried out under the supervision of administration and police. They said Karak in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was a clear example in this regard.

(Reuters) - Vasyl Lomachenko retained their WBO super-featherweight title with a sixth round technical knockout of Guillermo Rigondeaux in New York City on Saturday, the impressive Ukrainian handing the Cuban-born American their first professional defeat.
The highly-anticipated duel between a pair of double Olympic champions resulted in an anti-climatic finish, however, when Rigondeaux, citing a hand and wrist injury, told the referee that they did not want to continue prior to the seventh round.
All three judges had Rigondeaux, who moved up two weight divisions for the bout, behind when they quit in front of a disappointed Madison Square Garden crowd, making it the fourth consecutive Lomachenko fight in which their opponent has retired.
Lomachenko, the 29-year-old heavy pre-fight favourite, defended their title for a fourth time and improved their career record to 10-1 (eight TKOs), including seven knockouts.
The 37-year-old Rigondeaux (17-1), who was warned by the referee several times for foul play, began telling their trainer after the third round that their left hand and wrist hurt.
“This is not their weight so it's not a big win for me,” Lomachenko, who won gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics, told reporters. “But he's a good fighter, he's got great skills. I adjusted to their style, low blows and all.”
Novak Djokovic says they had a "small medical intervention" on their bothersome right elbow.
The 12-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1-ranked player wrote on Instagram on Friday: "It seems like I am on the good road now to full recovery."
Djokovic sat out the last half of 2017 because of problems with their racket-swinging right arm, saying it had been bothering them for more than a year.
The 30-year-old Serb made a late decision to enter the Australian Open last month, and then was clearly hampered by the elbow in a straight-set loss to Hyeon Chung of South Korea in the fourth round. Djokovic winced and grimaced throughout and took a medical timeout to have their elbow massaged.
South Aiken storms past Orangeburg Wilkinson
AIKEN, S.C. (WOLO) — Orangeburg Wilkinson fell on the road to South Aiken tonight, 42-0.
OBW has now lost four of their last five and fall to 3-4 this season.
London Perrantes scored a season-high 25 points, and No. 19 Virginia beat Clemson 77-73 on Saturday for its sixth straight win against the Tigers.
The Cavaliers (13-3, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) shot 58 percent from the field in their second straight win since dropping two in a row to Pittsburgh and Florida State. Marial Shayok tied their career high with 17 points, and Isaiah Wilkins finished with eight points and 13 rebounds.
Virginia blew a nine-point lead in the second half, but Perrantes stepped up for the Cavaliers down the stretch. After Clemson tied it at 70 on Jaron Blossomgame's three-point play with 2:18 left, Perrantes made their fourth 3-pointer to put Virginia back in front.

ISLAMABAD: Afghan Deputy Head of Mission (DHM), Syed Abdul Nasir Yousafi Wednesday was called-in to the Foreign Office by Additional Secretary (UN&EC) for registering concern over terrorist attacks in Pakistan by Jumaat-ul-Ahrar from Afghanistan, Foreign Office said in a statement.
The Afghan DHM was conveyed the grave concern of Pakistan about the continuing terrorist attacks on its soil by the terrorist outfit, Jumaat-ul-Ahrar's (JuA) sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Attention of the DHM was also drawn to the earlier actionable intelligence shared by Pakistan's authorities with the Afghan side.
Afghanistan was urged to take urgent measures to eliminate the terrorists and their sanctuaries, financiers and handlers operating from its territory.
An Aide-Memoire containing details of the terrorist attacks and supporting information was also shared with the Afghan Deputy Head of Mission.
An El Nino Watch is being issued by the Climate Prediction Center, as conditions become favorable for the development of another round of Pacific Ocean warming.
Meteorologist Dennis Todey, director of the USDA's Midwest Climate Hub, based in Ames, says we'll likely feel the impact in a few months.
“We could see an El Nino occur probably into the fall, is what I would guess we're looking at,” Todey says. “There is a fairly decent pool of warm water in the subsurface in the equatorial Pacific. When you start seeing that and the computer models all line up I'd say, yeah, we're probably headed that way.”
Farmers across Iowa will need to take particular note as the weather pattern often shifts the region's climate. Todey says the impacts of the developing El Nino will be felt late this year into next.
“We have an increased chance of being warmer during the wintertime with El Nino,” they say. “The storm track moves up a little bit further north, you may have more mixed-precipitation-types of storms with the warmer temperatures than overall snowfalls.”
Todey says they are also watching the current warming trend across the Northern Plains.
“Even if you've got decent soil moisture, warmer temperatures start to extract more water from the soil because of higher atmospheric demand,” Todey says. “We're getting to that time of year where corn is starting to use more water anyway. That's a more immediate concern and then it becomes how much more precipitation are we really going to get, and that's been a tough call so far this year.”
Todey says a La Nina — or cooling of the ocean — ended last year and we've been in a neutral phase since then.

At least one person was killed and 30 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia when white nationalists protesting plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general clashed with counter-demonstrators and a car plowed into a crowd.
KATHMANDU - At least 175 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal, India and Bangladesh, officials said Monday, warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear.
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 80 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh.
Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains.
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels.
Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster.
All trains to the northeast have been suspended until Wednesday, with sections of the track completely submerged in water, Indian railway spokesperson Anil Saxena told AFP.
In Nepal, police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods.
As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 36 people were missing, presumed dead, revising down an earlier count after more bodies were found.
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of safe drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.
“In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards,” spokesperson Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP.
“Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment.”
A local volunteer in Saptari district - one of the worst affected areas - said the water level was receding but most residents were still stranded on higher ground.
“Water level has decreased a little bit but families still cannot return home. They are taking shelter in sheds. What people need now is clean drinking water and food,” volunteer Dipak Kumar Yadav told AFP.
In India, emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh.
In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand - which also borders Nepal - three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP.
Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country, where flooding has killed 22 people.
Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain.
“We've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988,” they said, referring to the worst-hit district.
“The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water, submerging most of the main town.”
The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours, raising fears the flooding could spread.
In Nepal, the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai, the country's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture.
“We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated,” said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government.
“Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage.”
Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June.
The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from a vulnerable western district.
Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September.

A driver blocked in by "selfish and stupid" parking issued a car owner a £385 invoice after claiming they lost a day's wages.
Stuart Barber slammed recently installed yellow lines and a lack of council parking permits which they said already make life on their street is an “absolute nightmare”.
However, they were further enraged when they left for work last Wednesday morning to find a car parked in a "stupid and selfish manner" just inches away from their van, sandwiching them in, reports the Hertfordshire Mercury .
Deciding to take matters into their own hands, Stuart, from Bishop's Stortford, drew up a DIY invoice demanding payment of £385 — reduced to £192.50 if paid within seven days — and posted it on the car's windscreen.
“I put it on there a bit of tongue in cheek and I didn't expect anyone to pay it but you get to the point where you have to start making a stand,” they explained.
“We just have a really serious parking problem on Rhodes Avenue. Every other road within one mile of the town centre has parking permits for residents and we've got nothing.
“Every morning is an absolute rat race with idiot commuters and office workers in Stortford and people going to Stansted on their holidays.

“You come out in the morning and you've got people sat there waiting, flashing their lights at you to move.
“I've had people parking across the bottom of my drive blocking me in for days while they've gone on holiday. It's madness."
The 50-year-old said they had purposefully parked close to the car behind them — which belongs to their son, who was away at the time — in order to give another person space to park in front of him, before the yellow lines begin.
But despite this they said the “inconsiderate” driver chose to park nose-to-nose with him, leaving a gap of up to four feet behind them.
After calling the police — a move they said they often have to resort to — to report that they had been blocked in, Stuart was left further dismayed by their response.
They said: “Normally the police are cool, they ask the registration number and then call them up and say ‘you are blocking someone, you need to move'.
“This time they called me up and said ‘sorry we can't find a number for the person' which is fine.
(Image: hertfordshiremercury.co.uk)
“But then I get a phone call from a PCSO and they were fuming. They said I can't invoice people for parking and that it was my fault for backing up against my son, and they removed the invoice.
“I want to know why they took the invoice away because I haven't done anything wrong and I will be asking the chief constable why that has happened.”
According to Stuart, residents frequently suffer verbal abuse by drivers keen to bag themselves a spot for the day.
Some taxi drivers, they continued, leave their personal vehicles or taxis there at all times swapping them at the start and end of each day, while workers from construction sites in the town centre park their vans in dangerous locations, causing a hazard to oncoming traffic.
They continued: “People come home, they have their kids, they have their shopping, and there's nowhere to park and it's just frustrating.
“There are old people in this street who are isolated now. They don't receive visits from family or friends because there's nowhere to park and they don't want to walk all the way in from town.
“We accept the fact that we are in an area without controlled parking but when people park like d**** there's no excuse.
“You just think ‘I wouldn't dream of doing that'.
“People are so selfish and extremely rude — the amount of residents who have had mouthfuls off them is ridiculous.
“I've been told to f*** off a number of times, and my partner has been sworn at too.
“The lack of support or empathy from the council and the police just makes it worse.”
A spokesperson for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: "Police were called at 12.16pm on Wednesday, April 18 to reports of a parking dispute in Rhodes Avenue, Bishop's Stortford.
"It was reported that a silver Dodge Caliber had parked in such a position that a resident was unable to move their vehicle.
"An officer attended to speak to the reporting party and standard checks were carried out.
"It was established that no vehicles were parked illegally or dangerously and as such there was no lawful reason for police to remove the vehicle.
"Police can only intervene with regards to parking issues if a vehicle has caused an obstruction that is considered to be a hazard to other road users or pedestrians.
"For example, a vehicle may have been parked on a bend on the carriageway or at a junction, creating a safety hazard to other users; it may have been parked across a footway blocking free passage to pedestrians, particularly those using mobility scooters or with push chairs; or a vehicle may have been parked in front of a driveway blocking access to private or public property.
"However the enforcement of yellow lines, time-limited waiting and other parking restrictions in Hertfordshire are entirely the responsibility of the local authorities and their civil enforcement officers."
Vietnam's death toll from dengue fever has risen to 24, officials say.
Dengue fever has claimed 24 lives in Vietnam this year, as an unseasonal outbreak of the disease continues to sweep the country.
Some 80,500 people have been infected, up 33.5 per cent from the same time last year, said Tran Dac Phu, director of the Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine Department.
Vietnam Television also reported on Monday that a woman had suffered a miscarriage attributed to dengue at a Hanoi hospital.
Dengue fever season usually begins in September, but this year it started in May, Deputy Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long told a conference in July, according to the Tuoi Tre newspaper.
The illness is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms include fever, headaches, vomiting, muscle and joint pains and a characteristic skin rash.
ISLAMABAD - Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will be more rigorous during 2017 in enforcement and there will be a record number of inspections of regulated entities across all sectors and entities, from insurance companies to stock brokers.
“A Sharia governance framework is being developed to meet the regulatory needs of Islamic finance across all sectors regulated by the SECP,” stated by the SECP Chairman Zafarul Haq Hijazi while outlining the SECP's achievements of the outgoing year and announcing the future course of action.
The year 2017 shall see the SECP build upon these achievements to further enhance investor confidence for the progress of the country's economy, they said while addressing to the SECP officers. Enumerating the outstanding achievements of the outgoing year, they said that Pakistan's three stock exchanges were successfully demutualised and integrated into the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) to the benefit of investors, listed companies, and market intermediaries. The PSX has been making progress by leaps and bounds. Today it is considered Asia's best performing stock exchange. Pakistan has re-entered the MSCI Emerging Market Index, a sign of international recognition of the developments in the capital market and wider economy.
In an unprecedented development for the entire region, a consortium of Chinese exchanges and local financial institutions have acquired 40% of shares and management control of the PSX, laying the foundation of sustainable modernisation of Pakistan's capital market, they added.
While highlighting the second achievement, they said that steps were taken to strengthen protection of investors through various laws that were put into effect, which are being rigorously enforced. The SECP Act, 1997, that established the organisation, has been amended, enhancing the role and powers of the organisation. In addition, new legislation, including the Futures Market Act, 2016, Corporate Restructuring Companies Act, 2016, and many different rules and regulations covering various sectors from insurance to modaraba has been introduced.
They said that in order to protect investors' interests and augment their confidence, a record number of show-cause notices were concluded through regulatory orders and an unprecedented number of investor complaints were redressed. The SECP's efforts for investor education and awareness reached new heights under its ‘Jamapunji' campaign. Now it has become the largest national campaign for the awareness of all investors to inform them as to how they can benefit from investing in the corporate sector.
Regarding the third big achievement, the chairperson said that the SECP established itself as a high performance and knowledge-based organisation. Speaking of the priorities for the year 2017, Hijazi said that the main priorities will be more rigorous enforcement, building upon the legal accomplishments and working on ease of doing business.
Keeping these priorities in view, the organisation will make even greater effort to increase the number of cases taken up, speed up the processing, and strengthen the mechanisms used against non-compliance. There will be a record number of inspections of regulated entities across all sectors and entities, from insurance companies to stock brokers. The entities receiving disproportionately high number of investors complaints compared to their peer groups will be held accountable and will have to demonstrate improvement in their track record.
Elaborating on the priorities, the chairperson said the organisation will continue to build upon the legal accomplishments of 2016. They said that the legal framework for the development of corporate sector and protection of investors will be strengthened. The Companies Bill is in the process of replacing the Companies Ordinance, 1984, and it will be a game changer for the advancement of the corporate sector. The Draft Insurance Bill, 2016, is undergoing public consultations, which has incorporated many improvements to better protect the policy-holders and to meet the needs of insurance companies. A Sharia governance framework is being developed to meet the regulatory needs of Islamic finance across all sectors regulated by the SECP.
They said the SECP would continue to work on ease of doing business and capital formation through the capital market. They emphasized the need for increasing quality listings on both equity and debt and expanding the investor base. At the same time, the country is presented with exciting new opportunities such as publicly offered sukuk, financing the projects under the CPEC, enabling Pakistanis to directly participate in the development of the country. In 2017, the SECP will be putting even greater emphasis on reaching out to the corporate sector to better understand and address the challenges facing capital formation.
The chairperson hoped that 2017 would see the SECP achieve even more than it achieved in 2016. However, such achievements inevitably depend on support of the government, the SECP's Policy Board, stakeholders, and other government departments. The year 2017 shall witness the SECP doing its utmost to contribute in the growth of national economy, they expressed.
The bright light with a large, glowing tail that slowly moved across the early morning sky Tuesday, seen from the East Bay to the Peninsula, was a Navy missile test, a military spokesperson said.
Navy Strategic Systems Programs spokesperson John Daniels said an Ohio-class submarine off the coast of California, south of the Bay Area, launched two Trident II D-5 missiles, one at 3:30 a.m. and another at 6:20 a.m. The latter was seen by many around the region.
“It was part of a routine missile test that has been planned for a couple of years,” Daniels said. “This was not in response to any ongoing world activities.”
At 6:20 a.m., the object appeared in the sky for at least 45 seconds, moving slowly, and some witnesses said it changed trajectories.
Daniels said such tests are done to provide training and maintain the reliability of the missile system.
“At all times, it was flying over the sea. We don't fly those over inhabited areas,” Daniels said.
The Trident II is a three-stage missile with a 4,000-mile range. Daniels said Bay Area residents likely saw stage one, which lasts about a minute, and possibly part of stage two. By stage three, the missile is well-beyond what the naked eye can see, they said.
Bay Area residents snapped photos and took videos of the strange sight, and others on social media soon began sharing their experiences.
A Bay Area News Group reporter watched the object for at least 20 seconds, initially thinking it was a plane with a light shining from it on the crystal-clear morning.
The National Weather Service in the Bay Area tweeted what appeared to be vapor trails from a possible rocket launch.
Ryan Orosco was taking out the garbage Tuesday morning in Menlo Park when they spotted the object out of the corner of their eye.
“I thought it was a bright star. But when I looked, I saw a mist of light trailing below it,” they said. “I was seeing the object through some tree branches, so I walked 15 yards to get a better view.”
They pulled their phone out and tried to take a video, but only managed to take one photo.
“After the bright light faded out, there was a residual green glow for a few seconds,” Orosco said.
David Torre, a Half Moon Bay technical business consultant, was leaving their house for work.
“A bit of an astronomy enthusiast, the first thing I do when I walk outside is look upward to see which stars are out,” they said. “This morning was certainly different than most, as I noticed a radiant white ball of light streaming across the early morning sky with an impressive vapor trail in tow.”

Jeff Henderson, of Laguna Hills, was driving to work in Orange County this morning when they spotted the strange light.
“At first I thought it was a helicopter, but then I saw the mist trail that made it look like a comet, but I knew it couldn't be that and it was too slow to be a meteor,” Henderson said. “The weird thing is that I live in Orange County way south from you, but the pictures that were posted look exactly like what I saw.”
Six people were taken to area hospitals after a mechanical system malfunction caused some breathing problems at a research facility in Tualatin Tuesday morning.
Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue crews responded to the scene around 4 a.m. at Lam Research at 11355 Southwest Leveton Drive.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes suffered their worst week in two years as bond yields soared and renewed fears of inflation gripped investors.
But amid the selloff, corporate earnings forecasts keep improving.
Forecasts for earnings, one of the fundamental factors that drives stock prices, are rising fast as analysts factor in benefits from the U.S. tax overhaul.
Optimism over forecasts has caught the attention of anxious investors, who hope that strong earnings can support lofty stock valuations and offset the concerns over rising bond yields and the pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Rising interest rates in general mean higher borrowing costs for companies.
This week, fears of higher rates overwhelmed the upbeat profit picture as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell 3.9 percent and raised some concern about a deeper pullback.
“This uptick in bond rates has everybody nervous obviously,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
“But we step back and look, and so far earnings have been awful good. Even though you have seen rates move up some here, they are still very low, inflation is still low,” they said.
With half of the S&P 500 index companies still to report fourth-quarter results and potentially give guidance on 2018, profit estimates are likely to increase further.
Even after the selloff this week, the S&P 500 is up 3.3 percent for this year and that is on top of a 19.4-percent gain for 2017. Whether this week's downturn in global equity markets continues will depend in part on upcoming earnings reports.
Reports from both Apple and Google parent Alphabet late Thursday disappointed investors, as did Friday's results from ExxonMobil and Chevron , but fourth-quarter S&P 500 company results overall have been much stronger than expected.
Among changes to the tax law, the corporate income tax rate drops to 21 percent from 35 percent, so earnings estimates for the first quarter and all of 2018 have jumped.
First-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies is now estimated at 17.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 11.7 percent on Dec. 20, when both houses of Congress approved the tax revamp. Earnings growth for 2018 is now forecast at 18.2 percent, up from 11.5 percent on Dec. 20.
Typically, expectations decline as the earnings reporting season for the quarter approaches. On average, profit growth expectations fall by four percentage points from the start of the quarter to the start of earnings season, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.
This January, revisions to S&P 500 2018 earnings estimates were 4.3 times more positive than negative, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The one-month ratio of upward to downward revisions was the highest since at least 1986, as far back as the bank's data goes.
All of the S&P 500 companies together are expected to show earnings of about $155 per share this year in aggregate, up about $9 since Dec. 20, Thomson Reuters' estimates show.
The tax reform benefit is estimated to add more than that, however, a full $13, which suggests there “there is more room to run,” BofA-ML strategists said in a note.
In addition to the tax law, U.S. companies' earnings are benefiting from improving global economic growth and the weaker U.S. dollar, which helps U.S. multinationals exports sales, said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Those factors could help to underpin U.S. earnings even after the tax benefit is priced in.
“Stocks may have been overbought, but some of that was alleviated this week, and global growth and profit growth are still intact,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Among companies due to report next week are Walt Disney, General Motors, several biotech companies including Gilead and restaurants including Chipotle Mexican Grill.
PESHAWAR - Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak has said that the people of the subcontinent offered tremendous sacrifices for the creation of Pakistan. They were addressing different functions in connection with the Independence Day celebrations on Monday.
They called upon the younger generation to understand the essence of the philosophy of the creation of Pakistan.
The main event was conducted for the hoisting of the National flag at the lawn of the Civil Secretariat, Peshawar.
They also inaugurated Jinnah Degree College and Sports Stadium in Pabbi and District Council Hall in Nowshera.
The main event was organised by the District Government Peshawar for the flag hoisting which was attended by the KP Deputy Speaker, Dr Mehar Taj Roghani, MNA Dr Imran Khattak, MPAs Shaukat Yousafzai, Mian Khaleequr Rehman, Arbab Jehandad Khan, District Nazim Peshawar Arbab Asim, Chief Secretary Abid Saeed, IGP and elite of Peshawar city including women and children.
The inaugural functions of the Jinnah Degree College and Sports Stadium Pabbi and District Council Hall Nowshera were attended by the provincial Minister for Excise & Taxation Mian Jamsheduddin Kakakhel, Nazim Liaqat Khattak, MNA Dr Imran Khattak, MPA Khaleequr Rehman and Naib Nazim Ashfaq Khattak.
The chief minister underlined the need to understand the philosophy behind the creation of Pakistan, adding that the 70 years history of the country was replete with loot and plunder.
Institutions were politicised and police and Patwar were the most obedient servants of the ruling elite. The heads of institutions were sycophants serving the interest of the dishonest rulers, they added.
The rights of the people were usurped and the poor used to suffer. The country was run at the dictates of the foreign masters, they said.
Corruption was rampant and there was no justice even Thanas and Patwars were at a sale but that was the past and became the history.
They said now their government was out to work as per vision of Imran Khan who directed to work for the elimination of corruption and depoliticising police, Patwar and other institutions so that the people's rights could be protected and they could be given justice.
Their government has re-tracked the working of institutions, dedicated them to the real objectives for which these institutions were created.
They said because of these efforts the future was bright and their government was on target as per vision of Imran Khan.
They reminded that the youth voted the PTI for the change of system. They said the youth were right when they keep on asking about the achievements of objectives for which Pakistan was created.
A mere throwing the yoke of slavery is no durable freedom but it is when people start getting justice when they see the upholding of merit and where no one could transgress the rights of others.
All this could become possible when the institutions were strong and stable having an inbuilt mechanism for grievances redressal.
Their government, they added, had a few dozen enactments in order to give relief to the people, eliminate corruption, provide justice, uphold merit and realize the people they are the equal shareholder in the system.
Pervez Khattak said that this country needed an honest leader like Imran Khan who thinks about the poor and always guides their government to give relief to the people.
The CM added that education and health were the priority areas of their government because they wanted a healthy and educated nation. They called upon the people to contribute beyond their capacity.
They were taken aback by the reality that this country had all the requirements that were required for the development of a country but still Pakistan lagged behind therefore they called upon the people to stay committed to their responsibilities and contribute towards the collective goals of the nation.
They said the KP government worked on upholding of merit, providing equal playing fields to all so that the deserving could get vertical mobility within the system.
They advised the elected people to work for the development and prosperity of their respective areas, adding that they have the responsibility to raise the awareness level of the people against corruption and commission.
They also advised them to stay against the miss use of resources and should be committed to the public service. They warned that the corrupt would never get space in the PTI.
Earlier, they performed the flag hoisting in the Civil Secretariat Peshawar and congratulated the people of Pakistan in general and those of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in particular on the Independence Day celebrations.
The gathering also prayed for the integrity, solidarity, prosperity and development of the country.

The Charleston Battery lost, 3-2, to Atlanta United (MLS) at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw, Georgia Wednesday night.
The Battery overcame several obstacles, including a two hour and forty-minute lightning delay, to come within a whisker of sending the match against their MLS affiliate into extra time. In addition to playing on the road and the lengthy delay, Charleston were without their three most prolific attacking players; Romario Williams, Justin Portillo, and Ataulla Guerra were all unavailable.
With Portillo, Guerra, and Williams' attacking prowess missing, the Battery looked elsewhere for goals and found one through Forrest Lasso in the fourth minute. Charleston pressed high up the field to earn a throw in deep in Atlanta's defensive third. O'Brian Woodbine launched the throw into the penalty area and Lasso rose up to flick it in at Alec Kann's back post. The goal was Lasso's sixth of the season and second in the U.S. Open Cup.
United responded well and began to threaten the Odisnel Cooper's goal following Lasso's early opener. After several good attacking moves, Kevin Kratz finally scored an equalizer in the 31st minute. The ball fell to Kratz after a long serve into the box following a corner kick and the midfielder made no mistake, hammering it past Cooper.
Dante Marini put the Battery back in front immediately after Kratz's equalizer. Marini picked up the ball in midfield and let a long-range effort fly from about 25 yards out. Marini's shot took a wicked deflection, which caught Kann out of position. Charleston went into the break leading 2-1.
Atlanta erased the one-goal deficit shortly after the second half whistle through Josef Martinez. The hosts enjoyed a good spell of possession that ended with Brandon Vazquez serving the ball towards the back post where Martinez rose up to nod it in.
United continued to press following their second equalizer of the night. Vazquez scored the eventual game-winner in the 72nd minute, tapping in a Mikey Ambrose cutback. With the win Atlanta advance to the Round of 16 of the U.S. Open Cup.
“I thought we did a lot of things well tonight,” said Battery Head Coach Mike Anhaeuser. “We started really well with the early goal, but we knew they'd find a rhythm eventually. We had them on their heels a bit at times, but they started to knock the ball around on us and finished their chances. This is a tough one for us, but we can take a lot of positives from tonight into the remainder of the USL season.”
The Battery continue league play this Saturday against FC Cincinnati at Nippert Stadium. FCC defeated Columbus Crew SC (MLS), 1-0, in the Open Cup Wednesday night. Kickoff for Saturday's match is scheduled for 7:00 PM.

Mortgage rates ease for Tuesday
Posted: 9 am ET
wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.com
Several benchmark mortgage rates receded today. The average rates on 30-year fixed and 15-year fixed mortgages both decreased. Meanwhile, the average rate on 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages also tapered off.
RATE SEARCH: Compare mortgage rates in your area now.
30-year fixed mortgages
The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate is 3.98 percent, down 5 basis points
over the last week. A month ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was higher, at 4.04 percent.
At the current average rate, you'll pay a combined $476.26 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 you borrow. That's a decline of $2.89 from last week.
You can use Bankrate's mortgage calculator to figure out your monthly payments and see what the effects of making extra payments would be. It will also help you calculate how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.
15-year fixed mortgages
The average 15-year fixed-mortgage rate is 3.15 percent, down 2 basis points
from a week ago.
Monthly payments on a 15-year fixed mortgage at that rate will cost around $698 per $100,000 borrowed. The bigger payment may be a little more difficult to find room for in your monthly budget than a 30-year mortgage payment would, but it comes with some big advantages: You'll save thousands of dollars over the life of the loan in total interest paid and build equity much faster.
5/1 ARMs
The average rate on a 5/1 ARM is 3.13 percent, falling 1 basis points from a week ago.
These types of loans are best for those who expect to sell or refinance before the first or second adjustment. Rates could be substantially higher when the loan first adjusts, and thereafter.
Monthly payments on a 5/1 ARM at 3.13 percent would cost about $429 for each $100,000 borrowed over the initial five years, but could climb hundreds of dollars higher afterward, depending on the loan's terms.

Second Body Found In Collapsed Kenyan Building – Red Cross
A second body has been found in the wreckage of a collapsed residential building in Kenya's capital, the Red Cross said.
Emergency crews made the discovery on Tuesday night, the agency said on Twitter, around 24 hours after the seven-storey block fell down in Nairobi's poor southern Pipeline Estate.
Most of the residents had fled after cracks appeared in the building on Monday. But one woman was found a day later and died from their injuries in hospital. The second body was found dead in the rubble.
Forty-nine people died last year when another building collapsed during a heavy nighttime downpour in a poor neighbourhood.
The government ordered the demolition of many buildings after that incident, including the block that collapsed on Monday.
The Red Cross said another missing person it had been searching for had been found alive. Two children were pulled out alive on Tuesday evening.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Panthers coach Ron Rivera says Cam Newton's apology for a sexist remark to a female reporter was "something that was needed to be said."
"I think it was well said and well put," Rivera said Friday. "I think it was well said and well put. I just it something we can move forward .. and start again. It's a tough set of circumstances and hopefully this can settle things so we can go forward."
Newton made their remarks during a news conference Wednesday when Charlotte Observer reporter Jourdan Rodrigue asked the 2015 NFL MVP about wide receiver Devin Funchess' route running. The quarterback laughed and said, "It's funny to hear a female talk about routes. It's funny."
Newton issued a nearly two-minute apology on Twitter Thursday night, saying, "What I did was extremely unacceptable" and that they have "really learned a valuable lesson from this."
They haven't directly apologized to Rodrigue, who is a beat reporter others say has a high knowledge of the game.
The NFL had issued a statement Wednesday night calling Newton's comments at the news conference "just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalist who cover the league."
Newton issued their apology more than 24 hours after making their remarks, during which time they lost an endorsement deal when Dannon severed ties with him.
"After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women," the Panthers quarterback said. "To be honest, that was not my intentions. And if you are a person who took offence to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you."
In the video, Newton said he's a man who strives to be a positive role model in the community and who tries to use their platform to inspire others.
They also said they take ownership to everything that comes with that.
If I offered you Dh100 with no strings attached, or the chance of winning Dh200 with the flip of a coin, which would you choose? The obvious choice would be the Dh200 option since you would have nothing to lose, yet many people would opt for the safe bet and accept the Dh100.
Here's why: with a decision comes the very real possibility of making the wrong one. What if I chose the chance of winning Dh200 and lost? I could've had Dh100 yet instead got nothing. In reality, however, I would not really be losing anything, because I would have been starting with zero. Simply put, we're willing to leave a lot of money on the table to avoid the possibility of losing. Now, consider this scenario: I'm going to flip a coin and if it's tails, you'll have to pay me Dh10,000. How much should heads be worth for this to be acceptable to you? When I ask executives, their answers range from Dh20,000 (which is the statistical average) all the way up to Dh100,000. Since most people prefer avoiding losses to making gains, the yes needs to be worth at least two times the loss if they are to view it as chance worth taking. Status quo If you ever start to say no primarily to avoid a possible loss, the chances are, your rationale is this: sticking with the status quo feels much better, even if we know it's costing us money. Adherents to this philosophy feel safe, but rarely experience the thrill of winning. Of course, all this is not to say that “no” is always the wrong choice. On the contrary, it can often be a good call. The Apple design chief, Jony Ive, reminisces about Steve Jobs, “He would try to help me improve my focus by asking me, ‘How many times did you say no today?'” To have extreme, laserlike focus, Jobs was always willing to reject a lot of opportunities, even if they sounded great. In their opinion, the more “no” responses, the better. Ive says that at Apple, “There are a thousand nos for every yes.” But crucially, the no is in order to say yes. When you say yes too frequently, it hinders focus. Prioritising In another example, Warren Buffett reportedly gave Mike Flint, their personal pilot for 10 years, a simple lesson on prioritising. While talking with Flint about their career priorities, Buffet said, “You must have dreams greater than flying me around.” Flint confessed, “Of course.” Here's the exercise Buffet gave to their pilot: first, make a list of 25 career goals. Second, do some soul-searching and circle the five highest-priority goals. Just five. After Flint made their list and circled their top five, Buffett asked them “And what about the ones you didn't circle?” Flint replied, “Well, the top five are my primary focus, but the other 20 come in a close second. They are still important to me, so I'll work on those intermittently as I see fit. They are not as urgent, but I still plan to give them a dedicated effort.” “Say ‘no' to them. Avoid them at all costs.” Buffet urged Flint. They're what will distract you from the goals that really matter. The relationship between yes and no can be confusing and dichotomous. Prematurely saying no shuts down opportunity, yet unlimited yes answers may distract you from your path to achievement. Say no ... so you can say yes. But be sure you're saying no in order to focus, not to avoid a loss. The writer is a CEO coach and author of “Leadership Dubai Style”. Contact them at tsw@tommyweir.com.

Activist and election candidate, Jibran Nasir's manhandling by one of the security official in the VIP motorcade of a Judge of Sind High Court (SHC) is nothing but a crude demonstration of how VIP culture operates in this country. Their manhandling was one of many tragic instances where citizens had bored the brunt of VIP protocols. Officials and government representative enjoying VIP protocols do not think of the difficulties that ordinary people face whenever they decide to commute.
What is beyond comprehension is that Jibran Nasir was manhandled by the security staff of a Judge of the higher judiciary that had reprimanded the officials and elected representative for their VIP protocols as a cause of inconvenience to ordinary people. If the law requires that a Judge or any official shall be enjoying VIP protocol, rather than manhandling a person, the citizen should be informed of such rules and orders. The reason that one of the security officials relied on brute force was that they thought that being a security staff of a high court judge they could get away with anything they did to an ordinary man. It is this mentality of violating the dignity of a common man that is a by-product of the VIP culture.
What else can be said of the VIP culture but that the idea frequently violates the dignity of a person and equality of citizens. This culture makes some citizens inferior to other. The VIP protocols that holders of certain government offices enjoy create an unhealthy subculture, as it comes at the cost of the dignity of an ordinary citizen. Jibran was certainly not making an offence when they wanted to inquire about the law that would treat people differently. He, as a citizen of this country, has a right to know the logic behind red beacons atop vehicles and protocol squads, a logic that is beyond the comprehension of all of us.

Investors need to take all of today's employment report with a big grain of salt. That includes the negative news on jobs and the positive news on wages. And that goes for next month's report, as well, when we should see a big reversal in these numbers, with a surge in payrolls and relative weakness in hourly wage growth.
The numbers on job growth were downright whacky. Nonfarm payrolls dropped 33,000. If this holds up through revisions, it'll be the first decline since 2010 and was much weaker than the consensus expected. However, civilian employment, an alternative measure of jobs that includes small-business start-ups, rose 906,000 in September.
Our first guess would be that the unusually large gap between the two surveys is due to the timing of Hurricane Irma, which hit the U.S. right at the beginning of the payroll survey week. But the civilian-employment report also says that 1.47 million workers missed work due to weather, the most for any month since the double-whammy of massive East Coast snowstorms in January 1996. In other words, the civilian employment report apparently did get affected by the storms and still rose sharply!
The surge in civilian employment helped drive the jobless rate to 4.2 percent, the lowest since 2001. Perhaps the best news for September was that average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent and are up 2.9 percent versus a year ago. However, with payrolls dropping the most for relatively low-wage workers (restaurants and bars), the surge in wage growth should unwind next month.
The one measure we follow closely that should not have been affected by the storms is total earnings, which combines the total number of hours worked (which were held down by the storms) and average hourly earnings (which were boosted by the storm). Total earnings rose a healthy 0.4 percent in September and are up 4.3 percent from a year ago, signaling plenty of growth in consumer purchasing power.
A month ago, the market's odds of a December rate hike were about one-in-three. At the time, we said we thought the odds should be more like 75 percent. Today, the market's odds are up to 80 percent and we think that's about right. And if the economy keeps growing at the recent pace, the odds of a December rate hike will only go higher. That's especially true if Washington gets its act together and finds a way to quickly pass tax cuts or tax reform.

THE public are being reminded to consider the conditions before a mountain climb after a female needed rescuing after breaking their leg in treacherous conditions.
Police, ambulance and volunteer rescue personnel climbed Mt Warning in Murwillumbah at midday yesterday after the 18-year-old female had fallen and injured their leg.
The patient was almost at the top of the mountain when located, and was taken to hospital for treatment.
The rescue took about four hours.
After GoDaddy told the Daily Stormer to get lost, the neo-Nazi news site chose Google as a new home for its controversial domain. Now, Google too has given the site the boot.
“We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. At the time of writing, Google was still listed at the domain registrar in a whois search for the Daily Stormer, which is best known for espousing a violence-tinged anti-Semitic and white supremacist worldview.
The self-described “World's Most Genocidal Republican Website” made mainstream headlines over the weekend, first for GoDaddy's decision and then again when the site appeared to be hacked by Anonymous. Today, the Anonymous-affiliated Twitter account @YourAnonNews accounts claimed that the hack was actually faked in an effort to drive traffic to the site's content, which remained online.
And all the old content is left up by a "UNITED FORCE OF ELITE HACKERS" on a shit post site "UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANONYMOUS." Doubtful. https://t.co/FNYRCYWEDx — Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) August 14, 2017
On Sunday, GoDaddy cancelled the infamous hate site's domain after it posted a story brutalizing Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer. “Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service,” the company explained in a statement accompanying the decision.

VANCOUVER — While the estimated jobs created by the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion range from 15,000 to 800,000, industry leaders in British Columbia and Alberta stake opposing views on the economic impacts of the project. In B.C., Mike Rowlands, president of consulting firm Junxion, questions the $4.5 billion purchase of the pipeline by the federal government, which said it was doing so to “create and protect jobs” in B.C. and Alberta.

Rowlands, who spearheaded a petition containing signatures from over 700 businesses and entrepreneurs opposing the pipeline expansion project, said many in the business community would rather see government invest in “high-growth” sectors such as green energy, technology and media production. “Not doubling down on industries that are clearly in sunset.” The number of estimated jobs the expansion project will create in Alberta and B.C. varies between Kinder Morgan and the federal government. According to Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain website, out of the total number of 800,000 direct, indirect and “induced person-years” of employment over 20 years of the pipeline operation estimated by the Conference Board of Canada, most will be in Alberta.

A total of 441,000 jobs would be generated and, out of those, 14,600 would be construction jobs, 13,340 are in pipeline operations, and 11,200 jobs will be generated by “dividend payments from oil producers.” Meanwhile, the company calculates another 400,600 jobs would be created “related to additional investments. On the same website, the company also stated that B.C. would get an estimated 189,000 “person-years” including 36,000 during project development and 39,000 during operations. However, back in November 2016 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the approval of the pipeline expansion project, they said it would create 15,000 “middle-class jobs” mostly in the trades. Todd Banks, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce in Sherwood Park — the central Alberta suburb where the Trans Mountain pipeline begins — said they were distressed it took the federal government stepping in to buy the pipeline to get the approved project built, but they're “very appreciative” of the result. Banks said every job created directly related to oil, whether through an upgrader or refinery, means approximately six more spinoff jobs created in the surrounding area. “That could be a grocery store clerk, it could be extra staff at a hotel, there are many different ways jobs are increased as volume of sale increased at any retail outlet or service provider,” Banks said.
Those spinoff jobs will be vital to the economic recovery of Alberta, Banks said. Another pipeline supporter is Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, who said the decision is a “win-win” for Canadians who now have “a piece of the energy pie for themselves.”

On the issue of the pipeline and its economic impact, the BC Federation of Labour has decided to remain quiet on the purchase, saying it doesn't have “a formal position” because its member organizations have vastly opposing views. McGowan explained that public opinion in B.C. and Alberta are very different and understands why their colleagues in the B.C. labour movement are “treading more carefully.” “There are a few dissenting voices here in Alberta,” McGowan said. “But the vast majority of Albertans both within the labour movement and outside of it are fully supportive of the pipeline in general and we're even more supportive of the decision to buy the pipeline outright.” They added the thousands of jobs, not the 800,000 “exaggeration” by Kinder Morgan, are “enough to justify support for the project.” Independent economist Robyn Allan, who offered their expert testimony during hearings for the Trans Mountain pipeline, said Kinder Morgan “inappropriately massaged” the already-inflated job numbers from consultant Conference Board of Canada. Kinder Morgan initially told the National Energy Board in 2013 the expansion would create 2,500 temporary construction jobs over two years with 90 permanent jobs. Even that number is high, Allan said, with several jobs already held by people who work on the existing pipeline. “They're very extensively exaggerated,” Allan said. Werner Antweiler, economist and associate professor at UBC's Sauder School of Business, called the government's job creation numbers “minor.” “They won't make or break the B.C. economy,” they said. “Construction jobs are limited in time and scope, and pipelines don't bring long-term employment. Once the pipeline is built, the maintenance and operation actually require very few people, so you get this small kick during the construction phase in terms of employment that will, of course, not turn into long-term jobs and high-quality jobs that are essential for the economy.” Rowlands argued the pipeline could even put existing jobs at risk. “Businesses are going to be damaged when a major pipeline burst happens, or a ship begins to leak. We're not talking about run-of-mill petroleum products here, we're talking about bitumen. The stuff that is proven to be highly toxic to humans, and we don't have a clear understanding of how to clean up.” Jenny Peng is a Vancouver-based reporter covering business.

There aren't many fans of a lengthy commute, but Vicky Pattison ­reckons their 300-mile trek to the office is the secret to staying happy.
The'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! winner ­relocated back to their ­hometown, Newcastle, with business person fiance John Noble last year, having settled in Essex – close to pal Ferne McCann – for a year.
The couple built their dream home together, but after a difficult time feeling “isolated” in their new digs in the North East, Vicky, 30, spends a few days every week down in London for work.

“I was living out of suitcases, living in hotels, working hard and defining myself by having a career for five years,” they explain.
“To go from that to a woman who lives in Newcastle, who doesn't drive, who is stuck at home on my little estate waiting for John to finish work has been a real adjustment.
“I haven't dealt with it very well. I got ­restless and I struggled with the transition. You can't go from aggressive pursuit of your career to loafing overnight.”

Now, Vicky divides their time in the South for work – napping on the three-hour journey. “Now I work in London a couple of days a week, so when I go back I appreciate it. We'll go for a nice meal, talk about our week and watch a film.
“I just need to keep one foot in the hustle and bustle that is London. That's where my job is, that's where my career is. I haven't worked as hard as I have to abandon it.
“I love John with all my heart, and I'm so proud of the life we're cultivating for ourselves in the North, but I need to keep my finger on the pulse down in London. Not just for me, but for my future self, and whatever family I might have.

“I don't want to have daughters and tell them I met a man and gave it all up.”
Vicky, who enlisted Say Yes to the Dress's David Emanuel to help them choose THREE wedding dresses for their big day next year – says the pair hope to hear the pitter-patter of tiny paws.
“We've been discussing getting a dog,” they say. “John wants to start a family in the next few years but I want a dog first. Puppy steps.”
Dongsanqi village is the latest community to be demolished under a municipal campaign to dismantle what the city authority says are unsafe dwellings following years of "disorderly" development.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an air strike killed 15 children and two women sheltering in the basement of a school in the Syrian rebel-held town of Arbin in eastern Ghouta on Monday.
There was no immediate comment from Damascus, which says its forces only target militants and accuses the Ghouta factions of holding civilians against their will - a charge rebels deny.
The British-based monitoring group said the strike wounded more than 50 people in the enclave, where an offensive by the government and its allies has seized much of the insurgent territory.
“The Oath,” the L.A.-set crime drama from executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, is returning for a second season on Sony's Crackle streaming network.
According to Sony, “The Oath” season 1 — which premiered March 8 with the bingeable release of all 10 episodes — has been Crackle's most-watched original series ever and currently has the highest viewer-retention rate. Sony didn't release specific metrics, however.
The series was created by Joe Halpin, who worked as an L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. deputy in South Central for 17 years. The first-year student season of the show stars Ryan Kwanten (“True Blood”), Sean Bean (“Game of Thrones”), Cory Hardrict (“American Sniper”), Arlen Escarpeta (“The Magicians”), Katrina Law (“Training Day”), and J.J. Soria (“Animal Kingdom”).
“The Oath” explores the secret underworld of gang crime rings — in which the members who make the cut take a pledge to do whatever it takes to protect each other from their enemies. Season 1 of “The Oath” was shot in Puerto Rico over three months last year, interrupted by the devastation of Hurricane Maria.
“Our audience has truly responded to this authentic, raw, and compelling series,” Eric Berger, Crackle GM and chief digital officer of Sony Pictures Television Networks, said at Crackle's upfront presentation for advertisers Tuesday in New York.
“The Oath” is executive produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and their G-Unit Film & Television Inc., along with Halpin, Dennis Kim, Todd Hoffman, and Anne Clements.
“We have so much more story to tell, and I can't wait to get started,” said Halpin, whose TV credits include “Hawaii Five-O” and “Secrets and Lies.”
Other original series on Crackle, Sony's free, ad-supported video service available in 21 countries, include an adaptation of Guy Ritchie's gangster film “Snatch,” tech thriller “StartUp” and Bryan Cranston's animated “SuperMansion.”

London: Firefighters have not been able to conduct a comprehensive search of the 24-storey block of flats in west London that went up in flames because it is not safe for them to walk to the edges of the building, the fire brigade chief said on Thursday.
Authorities have confirmed 12 people died in the fire, which engulfed the Grenfell Tower at 1 a.m. on Wednesday, but the death toll is expected to rise.
"Some of the internal structures are not regarded as safe at the moment, however the central core is, so my firefighters have been up to the top floor last night, they have done the initial brief search from the doorways," London fire chief Dany Cotton told ITV.
"So although we`ve been up there we haven`t managed to do a comprehensive search and until we can make the building safe then I really don`t want to risk the safety of my firefighters at this moment in time," they said.
Cotton said structural surveyors and urban search and rescue specialists would inspect the building on Thursday and once it was declared safe a full search would take place.
(Adds reaction from bondholders)
By Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Popular could have been worth more than a billion euros when it was sold to larger rival Santander for just one euro in June, the independent valuation used by authorities to inform the sale showed on Friday.
Saddled with bad debt and facing a run on its deposits, Popular became the first bank to be wound down using new European rules aimed at avoiding bailouts by taxpayers.
But its sale for a nominal one euro, orchestrated by the European Union's Single Resolution Board (SRB), was contested by investors who lost 850 million euros ($1.1 billion) as a result and demand compensation.
In a confidential report sent to the SRB at the time and published on Friday, consultancy firm Deloitte valued Popular's equity at 1.3 billion euros in its most optimistic scenario, or “best case”.
The publication of Deloitte's report, in which Popular is referred to using to code-name Hippocrates, marks a victory for investors who had been asking for more information about the SRB's decision.
In its “worst case” and base estimates, which were made public by authorities after the sale, Deloitte put Popular's value several billion euros less than zero.
Deloitte's report cautioned its estimates were “highly uncertain” because they were put together in just 12 days and with patchy information, adding the real value of the bank was best determined through an open and competitive sale process.
“The best offer received following such a sale process is likely to be the best and most reliable indication of the value of the bank,” the firm's consultants, whose name was redacted, said in the report dated June 6, a day before Popular's sale.
Some key information, such as Deloitte's estimate of how much money creditors could have recouped if the bank had been put into insolvency rather than sold, was blanked out in the document published by the SRB on Friday.
Law firm Quinn Emanuel, which represents a group of bondholders whose assets were wiped out in the process, criticised the speed the report was put together and the limited access the SRB had to critical information.
“It is now obvious why the SRB didn't want to disclose this report as it clearly shows the absence of any real analysis and proper valuation,” lead partner Richard East said in a statement.
European Union rules state that creditors should not be left worse off after a bank is wound down using new “bail-in” arrangements than they would be if the firm had simply gone into insolvency.
The consultants highlighted some missing data and incorrect property valuations.
“Most of the inconsistencies identified are due to the inadequate consideration of the ECO rules,” Deloitte said, referring to Spanish regulations on the valuation of real estate assets.
The Spanish High Court is investigating the role of former Popular chairpeople Angel Ron and Emilio Saracho in Popular's collapse following complaints by shareholders. The former directors have denied any wrongdoing.
The court is looking at allegations of false financial statements, investor fraud, market manipulation, and possible insider trading at Popular, according to Quinn Emanuel.
Launched in 2014 to end an era of bank bailouts, the SRB came under fire last year for deciding not to intervene in two failing Italian banks, weeks after forcing losses on Popular investors.
Changes to Child, Family and Community Service Act could connect MCFD, Indigenous communities
The B.C. government has proposed changes to the Child, Family and Community Service Act that would get rid of barriers for social workers and Indigenous communities when making decisions on a child's welfare.
Introduced in the legislature Tuesday, Minister of Children and Family Development Katrine Conroy said the proposed changes share the goal of keeping children out of government care and in their communities when possible.
Under current legislation, the Ministry of Children and Family Development can only reach out to a child's Indigenous community with the parent's consent or to ensure the child's safety and well-being.
. #BCGov has announced proposed changes to improve Indigenous child welfare re: Child, Family and Community Service Act. Here are the specifics #bcpoli pic.twitter.com/Xnc7JDnOvX — Ashley Wadhwani (@ashwadhwani) April 24, 2018
New changes would negate this barrier between social workers and community members by allowing information to be shared the moment a file is started on a child.
If passed, social workers will also be able to refer child-protection reports to an Indigenous government that has child protection laws, according to the ministry.
Other amendments would include required annual reviews of a child in custody-ordered care to include members of the child's Indigenous community. The “best interest of a child test,” which is used by courts and the ministry when making any decisions around a child would also have to consider Indigenous traditions, customs and language.
Indigenous children currently make up 63 per cent of the total number of children in the province's care, despite being less than 10 per cent of B.C.'s child population.
Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation Scott Fraser called the proposed bill “core to reconciliation.”

Multi-State Manhunt
Authorities in multiple states are actively searching for the Ohio man accused of murder and posting the act online.
The hunt is on for 37-year-old Steve Stephens. On Easter Sunday police say Stephens attacked 74-year-old Robert Godwin senior -seemingly at random- in Cleveland, Ohio. They say Stephens fatally shot Godwin then posted video of it on Facebook. Godwin's family now says they forgive Stephens. At one point Sunday police were able to reach Stephens on their cell phone and encouraged them to turn themselves in. Stephens claims they have killed more people, however, police are only confirming mister Godwin's murder. Authorities are warning people across the Midwest and Northeast to be vigilant and are offering a fifty-thousand dollar reward for information leading to Stephens' arrest.

WASHINGTON (AP)  Weighing U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord, President Donald Trump declared on Tuesday that if the Iranians restart their nuclear program, they will have bigger problems than theyve ever had before.
Trump issued their warning alongside French President Emmanuel Macron in the Oval Office, where the two allies discussed the multinational nuclear agreement, the war in Syria and trade issues during a day of meetings at the White House.
Speaking at a joint news conference Tuesday, Trump appeared to be more in line with Macrons push for a longer-term U.S. presence in Syria. Trump, who announced weeks ago that they would withdraw American troops, said Macron reinforced the idea of a potential Iranian takeover of territory liberated from the Islamic State group.
Well be coming home, Trump said, but we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint.

Macron told Trump that together the U.S. and France would defeat terrorism, curtail weapons of mass destruction in North Korea and Iran and act together on behalf of the planet, a reference to Macrons work to revive a U.S. role in the Paris climate accord.
As for Iran, Trump was asked by reporters if they might be willing to stay in the Iran agreement. They replied, People know my views on the Iran deal. ... Its insane, its ridiculous. It should have never been made.
One of Macrons main objectives during their three-day visit to Washington is to persuade Trump to stay in the accord, which is aimed at restricting Irans development of nuclear weapons. Trump, skeptical of the pacts effectiveness, has been eager to pull out as a May 12 deadline nears.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned the Trump administration Tuesday that pulling out would undermine Americas talks with North Korea by proving the U.S. reneges on its promises.
They told The Associated Press in an interview that if Trump withdraws, Iran would most likely abandon the deal as well. Speaking before Trumps comments with Macron, Zarif added that Iran would no longer be bound by the deals international obligations. That would free Iran to resume enrichment activity beyond the limits imposed by the 2015 accord.
Trump remains publicly undecided on the deal, saying Tuesday no one knows what hell do at the deadline they set to determine Americas position. But they reminded their French counterpart of what they see as flaws in the agreement, which they said fails to address ballistic missiles or Irans activities in Yemen or Syria.
Macron told reporters that they and Trump would look at the Iran deal in a wider regional context, taking into account the situation in Syria. We have a common objective, we want to make sure theres no escalation and no nuclear proliferation in the region. We now need to find the right path forward, Macron said.
Trump suggested they were open to doing something on the Iran agreement as long as it was done strongly. They told Macron, We could have at least an agreement among ourselves very quickly. But when they were asked by reporters what that agreement would be, Trump said, Youll find out.
During the press conference, Macron added that they and Trump discussed pursuing a new agreement with Iran on the broader regional concerns, including Syria. But it was not clear whether Trump would be willing to keep the U.S. in the current deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in the meantime.
U.S. military and intelligence officials have urged Trump not to pull out of the agreement, arguing it has halted Irans nuclear program.
Trump also informed Macron that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un wanted to meet as soon as possible. The president, who once derided Kim as Little Rocket Man, said the North Korean dictator had been very open and very honorable so far.
Domestic concerns were also near the surface for Trump. They refused to answer a reporters question as to whether they are considering a pardon for their personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, whose office was raided by the FBI. Trump called it a stupid question. Cohen has not been charged in the case.
As Trump hosted the French president for the first official state visit of their administration, they and Macron lavished praise  and even a pair of kisses  on one another Tuesday. Its an honor to call you my friend, Trump said, after predicting Macron would be a historic leader of France.

In a lighter moment, Trump and Macron demonstrated some of the chemistry that has marked their relationship. The U.S. president brushed something off Macrons suit jacket, saying, We have a very special relationship, in fact Ill get that little piece of dandruff off. Trump added, We have to make them perfect  they are perfect.
The meetings followed a pomp-filled welcome ceremony on the South Lawn. Trump said before an audience of U.S. soldiers and members of their Cabinet that the relationship they forged with Macron at the start of their presidency was a testament to the enduring friendship that binds our two nations. They thanked the French leader for their steadfast partnership in the recent missile strike in response to the chemical attack in Syria.
Macron said, History is calling us. It is urging our people to find the fortitude that has guided us in the most difficult of times. France and with it, Europe, and the United States have an appointment with history.
The social highlight of Macrons visit comes Tuesday night with a lavish state dinner at the White House. About 150 guests are expected to dine on rack of lamb and nectarine tart and enjoy an after-dinner performance by the Washington National Opera. On Monday night, the leaders took a helicopter tour of Washington landmarks and had dinner at the Potomac River home of George Washington in Mount Vernon, Virginia.
Tuesdays meetings follow the collaboration by the U.S., France and Britain in missile strikes in Syria earlier this month to respond to the alleged chemical weapons attack. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria assisting local Arab and Kurdish fighters against IS, though Trump has resisted a deeper U.S. involvement and is eager to withdraw completely from Syria.
Macrons three-day visit to Washington underscores the importance that both sides attach to the relationship: Macron, who calls Trump often, has emerged as something of a Trump whisperer at a time when the American presidents relationships with other European leaders are more strained. Trump, who attaches great importance to the optics of pageantry and ceremony, chose to honor Macron with the first state visit of their administration as they woo the French president.
Trump ended their first year in office without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, the first president in nearly 100 years to fail to do so. They were Macrons guest last July at the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris. Macron and their wife also took Trump and first lady Melania Trump on a tour of Napoleons tomb and whisked them up in the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light.
Macron was welcomed back to the White House on Tuesday with a traditional arrival ceremony featuring nearly 500 members of the U.S. military and a booming 21-gun salute. They were also attending a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence.

“The idea for Monterey Pop, a model for subsequent rock music festivals from Woodstock to Bonnaroo, emerged from a conversation in early 1967 among Paul McCartney, the record producer Lou Adler and the folk rock band the Mamas and the Papas. They weren't thinking of the war; they were thinking of music — in particular, why rock wasn't considered an art form alongside the likes of jazz.”
I am trying to summon up my arguments in support of the mass-market luxury cruise, and against the snarky sub-genre of travel writing about mass-market luxury cruises, a snarkiness best exemplified by David Foster Wallace's classic 1997 essay “A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,” a piece that is hilarious and insightful and brilliant. And also wrong.
It's the final day of this seven-night cruise, and I am sitting in my moderately messy balcony stateroom aboard the Celebrity Summit finishing the last bites of a room service cheeseburger, bags as yet unpacked for tomorrow morning's disembarkation, the vast undulating North Atlantic just over my starboard shoulder.
This is my fifth Caribbean cruise, sometimes with my family, sometimes without. My first was when the rock band Train invited me to be the comedian on their annual fan cruise. Their invitation came via email from my agent with an accompanying message: “You don't want to do this, do you?”
Onboard, all music is easy listening. All food is easy eating. The decor is easy and soft hued in the style of a recently renovated Ramada. The nightly entertainment, too, is easy and bright and mindless. Everything about the weeklong Caribbean cruise is meant to buff life's unpleasant edges into sea glass. If it sounds like I am making fun, I am not. I love it. I love all of it.
It's wrong because they till every square inch of the surreal journalistic soil available to them during their own seven-day Caribbean cruise aboard the now decommissioned Celebrity Zenith (which they redubs the Nadir), but after 98 exhaustive pages of skeet shooting, conga dancing, fruit eating and existential despair falling, they fail to unearth what I believe is the flowering root of the widespread appeal of cruises: their unapologetic, gleaming banality.
But cruising's simple sincerity never sat well with Wallace and the generation of cruise writers who followed on their sea legs. Dan Saltzstein, an editor at The New York Times Travel section, wrote in a recent article about taking a Disney cruise with their wife and daughter, “I've been a travel editor for nearly a decade, and yet this was my first cruise.” The reason they hadn't yet participated in America's most popular vacation choice? “It hadn't seemed like my bag.” Your “bag”? My dude, it's a Disney cruise, not Burning Man.
The other three were similar: performing as part of a themed cruise. I always had a great time, but thought I would never take an off-the-rack cruise like this one, believing them to be too hokey for a cool guy like me to enjoy. I was wrong. As it happens, I had it exactly backward: All the stuff I thought would be hokey, the simple sincerity of the experience, was what I enjoyed the most.
Over the years, across countless articles and essays, writers have deployed battalions of irony to mock a tradition immune to mockery. They are using fire to fight applesauce.
A megaship, by its nature, fosters a kind of cultural detente among the various tribes within its hull. There is no other way to enjoyably commingle in tight quarters with so many people. And when you do that, when you suspend all judgment, when you ease into the easy, a cruise can be the best vacation deal going.
For the cost of a good hotel room (on a per-person, per-night basis), you get a mostly all-inclusive break from our whirling hyper-culture. It unspools you to the sea. You are still attached to the world, yes, but barely so. It's a kind of magical-thinking aquamarine summer suburbia, a dreamy distillation of middle-class Americana, minus the drudgery of lawn mowing and dish washing. It is the pleasure of the familiar with just enough variety to feel, in the vaguest possible sense, adventurous.
The arms-length ironic detachment with which so many of us (OK, me) lead our day-to-day land lives simply doesn't work when surrounded by a thousand fleshy strangers in swimsuits. Accommodation to imperfections, those of others and ourselves, must be made. Out there in the balmy breezes, where the average age is far north of Madison Avenue's desirable demographics, coolness falls away, as unnecessary and cumbersome as a poolside leather jacket.
Nothing is cool on the Summit. How could it be? Cool feels phoney while self-assembling tacos under the “Mexican Corner” sign at the Oceanview Cafe. Cool requires a certain snootiness, which may be appropriate when weighing whether to watch The Big Bang Theory or Atlanta, but doesn't do much good when deciding between playing bingo or Baggo (a beanbag-tossing game). Both are equally uncool. In fact, every activity in the ship's daily circular reads like the itinerary of a well-meaning but dorky youth minister: “11:00 a.m. Scrapbooking Session With the Cruise Director Staff”? The 2:15 “Port vs. Starboard Pool Volleyball” match? “Foyer Jams With Chris Hawks” running until 8:45? All decidedly uncool-sounding. But I went to two of these events, foyer jams and volleyball (as a spectator, not a participant), and they were fun. Not supposedly so. Just fun.
In their essay, Wallace complained about (among other things), feeling infantilized aboard the Nadir, about being “pampered,” which they compared to “a certain other consumer product” (actual Pampers, that is). He's right in their description, but wrong in their conclusion. Yes, the cruise is set up as a deeply maternal experience, a place of nurturing, even coddling. It dispenses care with the gentleness of a mom tending to a kid with a sore throat. Ice cream, for example, is available, in multiple locations. But where Wallace felt infantilized, I feel gratitude. A lot of us need care. Not just the many wobbly older passengers, but the younger ones, too. The harried parents, the cop from North Carolina, the New Jersey couple explaining to some first-timers why they cruise: “You're forced to do nothin.'”
My cruise was filled with couples of every age, race and gender configuration, some with kids, most without. A lot of couples seemed to be cruising with friends. A bunch of triple-generation families were travelling together, and there was one large Filipino family reunion of about 15 or 16: I know because they wore matching (decidedly uncool) teal T-shirts. Also on board was a group of veterans of Vietnam and other foreign wars, and it was touching to watch these older guys sitting beside comrades in arms in baseball caps naming their service branches and their wars.
Until I met another solo traveller while waiting to clear customs after the cruise, I thought I was the only person on the whole ship travelling alone. Turns out the other solo passenger is an accomplished Washington-based legislative aide and occasional guided history tour operator who gives “talks to drunk guys about John Adams.” I asked if they were able to avoid work while onboard. No, they said, with a sigh. Calls still needed returning, emails needed responses. But they preferred to do it from a deck chair, alone.
Wallace was alone, too, which probably enhanced their despair. Cruising is an activity of togetherness. One goes to be with people. You can certainly spend plenty of time alone on a cruise liner, as I did, napping (daily) in my stateroom, or sitting by myself staring out the Rendezvous' windows toward the horizon in what I hoped was a sexy, forlorn way. But aloneness on a cruise ship is something one has to make efforts to achieve; it is not the natural state.
All week long, people leaned in to each other, touched each other and talked. Most of the conversations I overheard (that is, blatantly eavesdropped on) involved the food: a conversation about the exact viscosity of an egg yolk; an older woman with swollen legs and Velcro-strapped black sneakers emitting actual, full-throated moans of joy to their husband upon sampling their dinner, sound gurgling out of their like bubbles in a mud spring. “Uuaaggghhh! My God, it's delicious,” they said. “This pork loin is delicious. Uuaaggghhh.”
But sometimes the talk turned a bit more introspective. As I ate my morning cereal midway through the cruise, I listened to two women in their 60s seated together, huddled over their breakfast plates, reminiscing about past marriages:
“You didn't want kids?”
“I did. They didn't.”
“But that was unfair to you.”
They shrugged. “I wouldn't have gotten involved, but I was 35 ...”
Oatmeal with a side of O. Henry. There were a lot of conversations like that, the kinds of intimate talks that only happen when people are relaxed enough to let the words fall where they may. Whether the subject was pork loin or marriage, the topic at hand seemed less important than the state of togetherness.
Close quarters among guests and crew demand constant interaction, which results in one of the best qualities of a leisure cruise: civility. For a week, I never heard a single argument. I never even heard a raised voice. People treated each other well, and I can't count the number of times I heard guests asking crew members questions about their lives: their time at sea, their families, their adventures ashore. Everybody seemed to care.
The crew, for their part, was polite and attentive without ever crossing into obsequiousness. One server, a Jamaican guy named Donovan, roamed the Oceanview Cafe every morning during breakfast hours singing made-up songs about coffee. Sample lyrics: “Coffee is bubbling/I'm coming/I'm coming with your coffee-o/So please hold up your cup-o.” Uncool? Yes. Off-key and maybe inching a little too close to cultural stereotype? You bet. But also wonderful.
Those who object to cruises often do so for reasons that extend beyond their lack of street cred. The cruise industry gets knocked around for the long hours and often hectic conditions of the people in its employ. I can't speak to that other than to say I spent some time patrolling message boards for Celebrity employees. Reviews seem about as mixed as you would find at any high-stress place of employment. Honestly, I was expecting worse.
As for the cruise industry's woeful environmental record, I ignored that for the duration of my cruise because I am a monster, but for the record, Celebrity received an overall grade of D+ from the Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy organization, in 2016. Not good. The green-nosers at Disney got the highest grade, an A-.
All this onboard civility is probably not an accident. Perhaps it is even a low-key necessity. No matter how much you dress up a boat, it is still, in the end, a boat, and as we all know, boats are vulnerable vessels. At our mandatory pre-cruise evacuation drill, a chipper fire marshal reminds us that even a megaship is only one misplaced cigarette butt from disaster. As such, each of the five cruises I've been on over the years shared a pervasive spirit of co-operation. People are perhaps a little kinder to one another when they know their vacation could end in a cramped lifeboat fighting over pelican scraps.
That's not to say there aren't moments of conflict. On my cruise, I heard an unconfirmed tale of a woman caught in another guest's room in what I understood to be a case of unappreciated seduction. The woman was promptly remanded to the ship's onboard brig. Much speculation was given to how they managed to sneak into a room without a key card, known on Celebrity as a SeaPass. The theory was that they somehow entered from the outside balcony slider, which would have necessitated some kind of Spider-Woman-level scaling of the ship's exterior. Which, I'm sorry, is kind of awesome.
If I had one objection to life aboard the Summit it's the endless upselling. The weeklong cruise cost $1,915.50 U.S. (plus airfare to San Juan, Puerto Rico); at every turn, somebody was offering the opportunity to spend more. During each meal, for example, servers would swing by to ask if I wanted to purchase the “beverage package.” When I declined, they would tip over my table's large, prominent drink menu, as if they were knocking over my king after a game of chess.
Also available for purchase: spa treatments, acupuncture, Raymond Weil watches with faces “celebrating the iconic Beatles,” lots and lots of tanzanite jewelry, on-demand movies, dockside photos, studio photographic portraits, all manner of sundries, terrible “art gallery” art, specialty dining options and, oddly, Apple computers.
The worst deal on the ship, though, is the Wi-Fi package, which runs $259 for the week. What kind of sucker spends that kind of money to browse Twitter? Me, apparently. In my defence, in addition to tweeting, I also wanted to be able to FaceTime with my wife and kids, and, once purchased, the internet was surprisingly reliable and fast. The upside of this absurd cost is that most people refrained, keeping noses away from iPhones and, instead, buried in books. I will be a snob about this one thing: I like seeing people read.
Did I mention ports of call? I did not. The destinations along the way are not the point. At least, not for me. But if you must know, we stopped in St. Thomas, St. Maarten and Bermuda. I barely got off the boat. I don't like the beach and had no desire to Jet Ski or wander tourist stalls, but I did spend a mesmeric half-hour on my balcony in St. Maarten watching cranes stack and unstack shipping containers on the pier. Guilt compelled me to do some shopping in Bermuda for the asupervisorstioned wife and kids, who were unable to cruise with me due to school or whatever it is they do when I am relaxing at sea.
Our vacation lives are often a frenetic extension of our work lives. So many of us have come to view our scant downtime as a call to action, an opportunity for challenge and growth instead of a moment of rest. A recent article in Travel + Leisure offered the 50 best options for people looking for “heart-stopping adventure, a close-up look at history, or the perfect meal.” All three of those options stress me out. Between my son's SAT prep and my daughter's hectic field hockey schedule, I have enough adventure.
And I don't want the “perfect” meal. I want a cheeseburger. Simple, banal, uncool. Cheeseburgers are delicious. I think a lot of people just want a cheeseburger.

The Minnesota Twins halted Ervin Santana's rehab assignment because the veteran right-hander has ongoing discomfort in their right middle finger and is unable to properly grip the ball.
Santana, who had surgery on the finger in February, will see a specialist.
The Twins had been hopeful that they could return in late May or early June, but this news is likely to push back that timeline. Santana, 35, struggled badly with command Tuesday and did not have much velocity on their fastball.
The Twins also put center fielder Byron Buxton back on the disabled list with a fractured left big toe.
Buxton fractured the toe in April when they were on a rehab assignment to deal with migraines. They returned May 10 but has struggled, batting .156 with no home runs and four RBIs.

JAKARTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to file a case against the U.S. Department of Commerce at the U.S. Court of International Trade over anti-subsidy duties slapped on Indonesian biodiesel shipments, a Trade Ministry official said on Friday.
The Indonesian government is also planning to bring a complaint to the World Trade Organization, Pradnyawati, director of trade security at Indonesia's Trade Ministry, told Reuters. They did not give a timetable.
Paulus Tjakrawan, vice chairperson of Indonesia's Biodiesel Producers Association, said the case at the U.S. Court of International Trade would be filed immediately to meet a Feb. 3 deadline.
The U.S. Commerce Department set final countervailing duties over alleged subsidies ranging from 34.45 percent to 64.73 percent for Indonesian biodiesel in November.
Anti-subsidy and anti-dumping investigations were launched against Argentine and Indonesian biodiesels last year following a spike in biodiesel imports to the United States.
The Commerce Department is expected to set the final duty soon following its anti-dumping investigation.
“The government of Indonesia is even ready to defend the interest of Indonesian industry at the WTO. Just as the government has done against the EU and we won,” Pradnyawati said.
The WTO ruled in favours of several challenges by Indonesia to anti-dumping duties imposed on its biodiesel exports to the European Union. (Reporting by Bernadette Christina Munthe; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Ed Davies and Alison Williams)

Dothan police are searching for two suspects wanted for an armed robbery at a restaurant late Tuesday evening.
Investigators say the suspects entered Larry's Real Pit Bar-B-Q on Ross Clark Circle around 9 p.m. and held the assistant manager at gunpoint before shooting him. The victim was later taken to an area hospital where they were treated for injuries and are expected to recover.
"From what we can tell so far the individual inside the business, the assistant manager was cooperating and was doing everything they were told to do so at this point we're not sure if the suspects simply became impatient and shot the subject or something else happened," said Lieutenant Will Glover with the Dothan Police Department.
Police spent the night canvassing the area, searching for the suspects. Police say the suspects attempted to take money from the safe but aren't discussing what or if anything was taken.
Wednesday morning, investigators released surveillance photos of the pair, as well as the potential getaway vehicle.
Police are asking for any help from the community that may lead to the identity of the robbers, who should be considered armed and dangerous.
"They have no problem pulling a trigger on a firearm so we are highly concerned for everyone's safety and it's of the utmost importance that we catch these individuals and get them in jail," said Glover.
Anyone with information should call the Dothan Police Department at 334-615-3000.

The crown prince is behind measures such as lifting a ban on women driving next year and bringing back concerts and other forms of entertainment to satiate the desires of the country's majority young population.
Despite decades of ultraconservative dogma, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has sought to ram through a number of major social reforms with support from their father, King Salman.
It's the latest stark reversal in a county where movie theatres were shut down in the 1980's during a wave of ultraconservatism in the country. Many of Saudi Arabia's clerics view Western movies and even Arabic films made in Egypt and Lebanon as sinful.
RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA—Saudi Arabia announced on Monday it will allow movie theatres to open in the conservative kingdom next year, for the first time in more than 35 years, in the latest social push by the country's young crown prince.
Many Saudis took to Twitter to express their joy at the news, posting images of buckets of movie theatre popcorn and moving graphics of people dancing, fainting and crying.
According to Monday's announcement, a resolution was passed paving the way for licenses to be granted to commercial movie theatres, with the first cinemas expected to open in March 2018.
The 32-year-old heir to the throne's social push is part of their so-called Vision 2030, a blueprint for the country that aims to boost local spending and create jobs amid sustained lower oil prices.
“It's spectacular news. We are in a state of shock,” said Saudi actor and producer, Hisham Fageeh.
Fageeh starred in and co-produced the Saudi film Barakah Meets Barakah by director Mahmoud Sabbagh, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February. The movie, which has been called the kingdom's first romantic comedy, tells the story of a civil servant who falls for a Saudi girl whose Instagram posts have made them a local celebrity.
“We are essentially pioneers because we all took risks to work in this industry,” they said. “We were super lucky, because luck is always a factor of whether we make it or not.”
Even with the decades-long ban on movie theatres, Saudi filmmakers and movie buffs were able to circumvent traditional censors by streaming movies online and watching films on satellite TV. Many also travel to neighbouring countries like Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to go to movie theatres.
Despite there being no movie theatres in Saudi Arabia, young Saudi filmmakers have received government support and recognition in recent years.
The government has backed a Saudi film festival that's taken place for the past few years in the eastern city of Dhahran. This year, some 60 Saudi films were screened.
The film Wadjda made history in 2013 by becoming the first Academy Award entry for Saudi Arabia, though it wasn't nominated for the Oscars. The movie follows the story of a 10-year-old girl who dreams of having a bicycle, just like boys have in their ultraconservative neighbourhood where men and women are strictly segregated and where boys and girls attend separate schools. The film was written and directed by Saudi female director Haifaa al-Mansour, who shot the film entirely in the kingdom.
That film and Barakah meets Barakah, though four years apart, tackle the issue of gender segregation in Saudi Arabia, which remains largely enforced.
It was not immediately clear if movie theatres would have family-only sections, segregating women and families from male-only audiences. Another unknown was whether most major Hollywood, Bollywood and Arabic movie releases would be shown in theatres and how heavily edited the content will be.
The Ministry of Culture and Information said there are no additional details available at this time, responding to a query from The Associated Press. The government said it will announce regulations in the coming weeks.
Fageeh said that while he's concerned with the censorship rules that might be in place, he's also concerned that scenes of violence are typically permitted on screens across the Arab world, but “any kind of intimacy and love is considered taboo and a moral violation.”
“It's a global conversation we need to have,” they said.
The Saudi government says the opening of movie theatres will contribute more than $30.8 billion to the economy and create more than 30,000 jobs by 2030. The kingdom says there will be 300 cinemas with around 2,000 screens built in the country by 2030.
Fageeh said it's important the government provides even greater support to local filmmakers now that international films will dominate theatres.
“There needs to be an effort to be cognizant and inclusive for this element of local films or we will be completely flushed out because of the nature of capitalism and will be operating in the margins,” they said.

President Mamnoon Hussain has formally assented to the 31st constitutional amendment bill, earlier passed by the Parliament and endorsed by the KP Assembly, perpetually removing the term ‘tribal area' from the national lexicon of Pakistan. The constitutional and legal jurisdiction of all the organs of the government- the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary- now extends to the erstwhile federally and provincially administrated tribal areas in line with the other settled areas in the country. Thus Pakistan has reached an important milestone in its constitutional path to statehood. Constitutionally, there is longer any extra-territorial territory inside Pakistan where the country's laws don't apply. It is indeed a moment of immense pleasure for the long-deprived people of tribal areas who will now get their legal and political rights guaranteed by the Constitution. There has been no significant political opposition to the implementation of FATA reforms plan. All the major and mainstream political parties fully supported the constitutional amendment process in the Parliament to give effect to this constitutional reforms plan in the tribal areas. However, due to obvious reasons, only two small political parties (JUI-F and PkMAP) opposed the implementation of FATA reforms to preserve political and administrative status quo there. But luckily, the people of FATA, by and large, have welcomed these long-awaited constitutional reforms to their area.
The role of outgoing PML-N government in initiating and concluding the integration of tribal areas is really commendable. Indeed, a strong political will was required to perform this Herculean task. A six-member FATA Reforms Committee, chaired by Sartaj Aziz, was formed “to propose a concrete way forward for the political mainstreaming of FATA areas” in November 2015. This committee visited the FATA and consulted all the stakeholders before finalizing its recommendations. These carefully devised recommendations just paved the way for the political mainstreaming and integration of the FATA. Spanning over a transition period of 5 years, this Committee recommended the gradual merger of FATA with the KP province. Moreover, the political allies of PML-N like JUI-F and PkMAP also strongly opposed the immediate FATA-KP merger, so the PML-N government just postponed it. This delay bred dissatisfaction and unrest among the disillusioned tribesmen of FATA. PTI also strongly protested against this delay. On the other hand, the so-called Pushtun nationalist movement PTM also portrayed this delay as a deliberate attempt on the part of government to deprive FATA tribesmen of their due political and constitutional rights. The military leadership eventually intervened to ensure the immediate implementation of FATA reforms plan. So the Parliament passed the 31st constitutional amendment as soon as the FATA-KP merger plan got the nod from the National Security Committee (NSC) this month.
The repealed article 247 of the constitution provided that no Act of Parliament would apply to FATA area besides specifically barring the jurisdiction of the superior courts to this area. Therefore, it has been rather a paradoxical situation that FATA was given adequate representation in the Parliament but, at the same time, no Act of the same Parliament applied to this area. Now this constitutional anomaly has been rectified through the recent constitutional amendment. To effectively safeguard the vital security and strategic interests of the colonial state in this region, the British masters treated these tribal areas as a buffer zone between British India and Afghanistan. For this purpose, they introduced a set of special laws called the FCR (Frontier Crime Regulations) in this area in 1901. Instead of the welfare of the people, the primary objective of these regulations was to consolidate the British rule in this area. It is quite unfortunate that Pakistan has been governing this area through these more-than-a-century old regulations for 70 years. Not only did the FCR deprive the people of FATA their fundamental rights but also has taken away their basic legal rights like ‘Appeal, Wakeel and Daleel'. The Late Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice A R Cornelius, in a judgment, has observed that the FCR is ‘obnoxious to all recognized modern principle governing the dispensation of justice.'
The very global concept of extraterritoriality necessarily relates to certain sensitive places like the foreign embassies, military bases of foreign countries and the offices of the United Nations. Under International law, these buildings and premises are exempted from the jurisdiction of the municipal law in any country. However, according an extraterritorial status to part of its own territory, as Pakistan had done to FATA, was quite unprecedented in the contemporary world. Similarly, the word ‘tribal' is commonly used for some small and scattered nomadic or cannibal clans living in the forests of Sub-Saharan Africa and Amazon. Presently, there is no such thing as ‘tribal' in the political lexicon in the civilized world. The cost of abandoning and neglecting the FATA has also been pretty high for Pakistan. The FATA virtually became a ‘state within a state'. Commonly known as the Ilaqa Ghair (the lawless land), this area became a focal point for many major illegal activities ranging from narcotics and contraband trade to the sale of illegal weapons and stolen vehicles. Similarly, after the US invasion in Afghanistan, this area rapidly turned into a potential hide-out for the militants and extremists from all over the world.
At present, FATA is most deprived and least-developed area in Pakistan. With the lowest per capita income in the country, two third of its population simply lives below the poverty line. The literacy rate is as low as only 17% among males and only 3% among females. Currently, almost half population has no access to clean drinking water. So far, no substantial endeavor has been made to promote the socio-economic wellbeing of the people in FATA. The much-advertised plan of the US to establish certain Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ's), as an instrument to contain extremism in FATA, has never materialized in reality. The standard of living in the provincial tribal areas in Pakistan is by no means better than that of FATA people.
The 31st constitutional amendment alone would hardly help set things right in the tribal areas. As a matter of fact, this constitutional amendment is the first, and probably the most significant, step towards improving things in the erstwhile FATA and PATA. However, a lot of work will have to be done to bring these areas at par with the settled and developed areas in the country. A lot of pecuniary resources are required to properly execute the reform plan in these areas. We will have to build adequate number of government facilities, courts, police stations, schools, colleges, hospitals etc. in these areas. We will have to improve the dilapidated state of communications infra-structure there. We will have to uplift the socio-economic status of deprived and neglected tribesmen. Similarly, the complete rehabilitation of the IDP's of North Waziristan is still another challenge for the government.
At this stage, the primary focus of development and reforms in tribal areas should be on three important things- improving the state of education, generating employment through extensive economic activity, and adequately maintaining the law and order. It is education which can help tribesmen assimilate and integrate with rest of Pakistanis after shedding their traditional mindset. In addition to mining and tourism, there should be a focus on the specialized industrialization to trigger economic activities in these areas. No sort of black economy should be allowed to flourish in FATA any longer. Pakistan Army has cleared FATA of militants and extremists after successfully conducting a number of military operations there. Now the civilian law enforcement agencies should take a hold of the FATA to keep peace and order in this area. Pakistan will have to be vigilant and cautious to stop its tribal areas from again falling prey to militancy and extremism.

It's three expos in one!
The 14th Annual Oh Baby! Family Expo 2017 “Hawaii's Largest Baby and Kids Expo” will feature over 150 vendors showcasing their latest products and services for Hawaii's prenatal to families with children 12 and under.
This morning on Wake Up 2day, one of the vendors, Sarah Millar, co-owner of Elly Lu Organics joined us in studio.
Millar says they make organic and eco-friendly stuffed toys made with GOTS certified organic fabric, dyed with non-toxic and eco-friendly dyes, and filled with organic cotton and organic buckwheat hulls. They also donate $1 per item purchased to different non-profits and charities that correspond with the toy. For example, for every “Makana the Hawaiian monk seal” toy sold, we give $1 to the Ke Kai Ola Hawaiian monk seal Hospital in Kona.
Millar says they and their sister-in-law had a dream of making organic toys starting about 5 years ago. We got busy with different things and never really pursued it. After I moved to Hawaii, that dream came alive again. The types of toys we do and even our logo are all inspired by Hawaii. Our line of endangered stuffed animals started with the Hawaiian monk seal. A friend of ours who lived in Hawaii much longer than us brought us to a secluded beach on the Big Island. As we walked down to the beach, we noticed a large grey animal sitting in the shallow water. I was shocked and turned to ask my friend if it was a seal and they were in tears. They explained that monk seals are very rare and that we were lucky to see one. That moment really stuck out to me, and the more I learned about Hawaiian monk seals, the more I fell in love and wanted to do something to help. So we're hoping our cute little monk seal can bring awareness to the endangered status of the animal and shed light on Ke Kai Ola and all of the amazing people and volunteers that are committed to protect and rehabilitate these beautiful animals. We also have a new book about a narwhal named Norman who finds a warm current that leads south to Hawaii. They experience the Aloha spirit of Hawaii, makes new friends, and tries new and exciting things. The book is set up to teach fun and scientific facts as well as some Hawaiian words and phrases. All of our books are printed on recycled paper with soy-based inks, and all of the characters in the story are toys of ours available for sale.
Millar will be selling them at our booth this weekend at the Oh Baby Family Expo. You can also find our items for sale online at our website www.ellyluorganics.com.
The 14th annual Oh Baby! Family Expo, Toy & Game and Party Expo Saturday and Sunday, October 7 & 8, 2017, 10am-5pm at the Neal Blaisdell Exhibition Hall.
General admission is $5.50, children 5 and under are free at the Neal Blaisdell Center. For more information go to: www.ohbabyfamilyexpo.com.

Rose McGowan says a "new chapter" has begun now that Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on two sets of rape charges and a sex crime charge.
The 'Charmed' actor - who has accused the disgraced producer of rape - is celebrating after Weinstein was formally charged with first and third-degree rape, and a first-degree criminal sexual act.
They wrote on Instagram: "INDICTED. FINALLY. I've been indicted by the media he's bought out for years to trash me. Now it is a new chapter for both of us."
In the lengthy post, Rose also insisted they have "changed the world" and was willing to risk everything to speak out.
They added: "Here's what many do not know about me. I have a light spirit. I have compassion. I have adventure. I have a playful side. I am MORE than anger. Or sadness. I have more than they've shown. I am all of the colors, just like you. That's why I made the show Citizen Rose with E! But because of how I've been sold in the media- many of the people polled about the show say that they are on the fence about supporting it "someone like me". Someone. Like. Me.
"Suddenly though- now that the Monster aka Harvey Weinstein- has turned themselves in I'm "validated." I have always spoken the truth. I know what I have achieved to change the world. I am facing time in jail because I wanted a better, freer society. I have lived a harder life than most could withstand. I know my truth. And now.... for the FINAL episode of Citizen Rose, a show that took blood, sweat and many tears, to simply show what trauma looks like and how we can survive it. I know what I've done to change the world. How about you? #weROSEtogether #socialexperiment #womeninbiz #human #CitizenRose #rosearmy #inspiration #justwannahavefun (sic)"
INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indianapolis Colts arrived for practice Wednesday in T-shirts supporting a suburban Indianapolis community rocked by last week's school shooting.
Players and coaches wore the "Noblesville strong" shirts throughout their workout. Team employees pitched in by wearing them around the team complex.
Two people were injured in the shooting, including Jason Seaman, a teacher and former FCS football player who stopped the alleged shooter at Noblesville Middle School. Colts offensive lineman Joe Haeg said they knew Seaman because they squared off in conference play.
Seaman attended Southern Illinois and their college number, 91, was on the shirts. Haeg attended FCS power North Dakota State.
The team says proceeds from shirt sales will be donated to Seaman and Ella Whistler, who was also injured.
Having already missed two games, Sam Powell-Pepper will miss one more match through suspension.
Having already missed two games, Sam Powell-Pepper will miss one more match through suspension.
THE AFL has slapped Port Adelaide star Sam Powell-Pepper with a three-match ban following an investigation into an incident at a nightclub in the South Australian capital.
Powell-Pepper has already missed two games since the controversy, so will miss one more match before they are made available for senior selection again.
"The AFL has determined ... Powell-Pepper engaged in inappropriate behaviour that is unbecoming for an AFL player by being intoxicated in a public place and by making inappropriate contact with a female," a statement released by the AFL said.
"Given media commentary and other reporting in this matter, the AFL also note that it has made no other findings in this matter.
"The AFL has further determined that, taking into account Powell-Pepper has missed the last two Port Adelaide AFL matches in Rounds 4 and 5 while the investigation was ongoing, Powell-Pepper will be suspended for a further one week from the AFL competition."
Earlier this week Port Adelaide chairperson David Koch publicly vented their frustrations with the AFL as Powell-Pepper's playing future remained in limbo.
The 20-year-old served a one-match club-imposed suspension in round four and missed last week's loss to Geelong after they ruled themselves out as the AFL investigation continued.
Koch revealed on Monday that the integrity unit's investigation was actually completed last week.
Club officials had seen a summary but, at the time Koch spoke, had not been allowed to view a copy of the completed report.
Sam Powell-Pepper's future is clearer.
"We have been asking to see that report and it still hasn't come a week later," Koch said on Adelaide radio station FiveAA on Monday.
"Our view is the report does not reflect properly what actually went on at the nightclub. We have video of the entire night at the club and our view of that video doesn't match the findings of the integrity unit's report.
"We are backing our player. We think the allegations, particularly some of the media allegations against Sam - on our evidence - are completely misleading.
"That's why we want to see the report, to see what other evidence that report contains, if any."
Port didn't debate Powell-Pepper broke team rules by being drunk in a public place and out past curfew, but Koch was standing firm in the face of any further sanctions given the lack of evidence and was bewildered by the AFL's decision not to make the report available.
"We are stumped by that. We are frustrated by that ... so frustrated because it is putting enormous pressure on this young man," they said.
"If there's evidence of any serious sexual abuse then we would throw the book at any player.
"(But) our vision of what happened on the night bears no resemblance to any of that.
"They're alleging inappropriate behaviour. We don't even think it goes that far."

Ever since the Buffalo Sabres were selected as the winners of the 2018 NHL Draft Lottery, speculation has run rampant regarding what fans should expect from the team's young core in 2018-19. With a certain generational Swedish defenseman presumably in the fold, some expectations have become particularly lofty.
The sky is the limit for players like Casey Mittlestadt, Brendan Guhle and of course, Jack Eichel. However, it's important to put things into perspective. The team still has a few glaring holes on the wing, and while the top of the defense looks a bit more formidable, it still isn't a particularly deep group.
Let's take a look at a few of the youngsters who are expected to see significant playing time in Western New York, and what to expect from them in terms of overall production next season.
Jack Eichel
Will the Sabres just make this kid the captain already? After being the only player on the team who performed night-in and night-out last season, they seem to have matured a great deal. As the undisputed face of the franchise, the time has come for them to lead this young roster forward. With “sweeping changes” supposedly coming to the Sabres' roster, they will play a big role in keeping their teammates on the right path.
After posting 64 points in 67 games last season (on a team with very little offensive support on the wing) they will once again hover somewhere around a point-per-game pace even with a lack of complementary players on the Sabres' roster. If Phil Housley leaves Sam Reinhart on Eichel's right side, and if Jason Botterill finds them a viable option on the left, they could see a significant leap in production.
Even without an offseason addition in the top-six, fans should expect the 21-year-old to lead the team in points for the third consecutive year. If their ankles hold up, allowing them to play a full season, they should find themselves in the 80-90 point range in 2018-19.
Sam Reinhart
Nobody in the NHL had a more “Jekyll-and-Hyde” season than Reinhart did in 2017-18. After starting the year with 11 points in their first 38 games, their production exploded in the second half, where they posted 37 points over another stretch of 38 games. If Housley hadn't wasted so much time trying to force Reinhart into a role as a center to start the season, they probably wouldn't have struggled so badly.
The 22-year-old is set to become a restricted free agent on July 1; however, the Sabres would be wise to lock them into a short-term bridge-deal beforehand. There is always the possibility that Botterill tries to use Reinhart's big second half as a way to bolster a potential return via trade, but that seems unlikely given the team's distinct lack of talent on the wing.
During their end-of-the-year press conference, Botterill mentioned that they had yet to discuss an extension with Reinhart's agent, but planned to in the near future.
If the coaching staff in Buffalo does the right thing by leaving them with Eichel on the first line, Reinhart just might post career bests next season. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 65-70 points isn't out of the question.

Casey Mittlestadt
In what quickly became a very dreary campaign for the blue-and-gold last year, fans took solace in the fact that 2017 eighth overall pick Casey Mittlestadt was taking the junior world by storm. Since being named as the most valuable player in the 2018 World Junior Championship, the 18-year-old was the talk of the town after being widely ridiculed for not being able to complete a chin-up at the NHL combine the previous summer.
Perhaps never has a fan base gone from being vehemently against a draft pick to crowning them as a franchise cornerstone so quickly. Toward the end of the 2017-18 season, Mittlestadt spent the last six games of the season with the big club, notching five points. Though there were certainly times where they appeared to be a bit overwhelmed by the speed of the NHL game, they acquitted themselves nicely in limited action.
Barring something catastrophic, they will spend the entire year with the Sabres next season. Though fans will set incredibly high expectations for the young phenom, there is still a lot of growing to do before we see the type of production they had in college, and on the international junior stage. Assuming they stay healthy, expect them to land in the 50-55 point range.
Brendan Guhle
The anticipated addition of Rasmus Dahlin in the draft this summer will be a huge help for Guhle's development. Instead of forcing them into a top-four role like the Sabres have done with so many other promising prospects in the past, with more talent ahead of him, they can continue to hone their craft against lesser opponents on the third pairing.
In their 18 games in Buffalo last season, they only produced five points. That said, the competence they displayed in their own zone was a breath of fresh air. Not only is they an elite puck-carrier, but their astounding foot speed makes them a threat at both ends of the ice. They should fit right into the system Housley intends to implement in Buffalo.
Though they will likely never be an offensive juggernaut on the blue line, Guhle plays a responsible two-way game, something the Sabres have been missing. Their development next year will be gauged less by their point total, and more by their ability to help in transition. They should land somewhere between 25-30 points next season.
Linus Ullmark
After watching Robin Lehner struggle for the better part of their three-year stint with the Sabres, fans have anxiously awaited Ullmark's emergence as an NHL regular. Last year, they posted a .922 save percentage with the Rochester Amerks, earning them a spot in the AHL All-Star Game. Though they struggled mightily in the playoffs, there is no doubt that they are ready for the big league.
Whether or not Ullmark will be the Sabres' starter next season remains to be seen. If they do indeed win the job, they will need a very strong backup to ensure that they don't see too heavy a workload in their rookie season. Ideally, they would be called upon to start 50-55 games while they adjust to being an NHL regular.
Fans must keep in mind that goalies take a bit more time to develop, and regardless of whether they are the starter or a backup next season, there will be bumps in the road. That being said, they have improved every year since the Sabres selected them in the sixth round of the 2012 NHL Draft, and it won't take long for them to surpass their predecessor.
Rasmus Dahlin
Yes, we know they aren't technically a Sabre yet, but barring something completely insane, he'll be wearing blue and gold next season. Just last week Housley gushed over their elite potential and awe-inspiring highlight reel.
“What a cornerstone for us to get Rasmus Dahlin,” they said. “It really gives us hope. All of the things that have happened in the past, this is one bright spot to look forward to heading into the draft that can change a franchise.”
The Sabres have finished last in three of the past six seasons, but until last month, had yet to select first overall. With the current state of the franchise, a lottery win couldn't have come at a better time.  They are the best defenseman the draft has seen in well over a decade. If Housley cannot run their “system” even with Dahlin in the fold, their seat will get warm very quickly.
So what should Sabres fans expect from them in terms of offensive production in their inaugural season? It isn't crazy to think that the 18-year-old is already as skilled (if not more) than Rasmus Ristolainen. If they are given ample time on the power play, and the organization doesn't force them to match up against other team's first lines right out of the gate, they could reasonably land in the 50-60 point range.
No, it's not hype. He's really that good.

Sydney-A team of Australian and international scientists, led by Professor Rebecca Johnson, Director of the Australian Museum Research Institute and Professor Katherine Belov, University of Sydney, have made a significant break-through successfully sequencing the full koala genome, with the findings published today in Nature Genetics. Considered to be the most complete marsupial genome sequenced to date, it is in terms of quality, on par with the human genome. The highly accurate genomic data will provide scientists with new information that will inform conservation efforts, aid in the treatment of diseases, and help to ensure the koala's long-term survival. “The Koala Genome Consortium has been an ambitious journey affording us great insights into the genetic building blocks that make up a koala-one of Australia's, as well as the world's, most charismatic and iconic mammals,” Professor Johnson said.
“This milestone has come from our vision to use genomics to conserve this species. The genetic blueprint has not only unearthed a wealth of data regarding the koalas unusual and highly specialised diet of eucalyptus leaves, but also provides important insights into their immune system, population diversity and the evolution of koalas,” they said.
Co-lead author at the University of Sydney, Professor of Comparative Genomics, Katherine Belov said:
“The genome provides a springboard for the conservation of this biologically unique species.”
The Australian led consortium of scientists comprised 54 scientists from 29 different institutions across seven countries. They have sequenced over 3.4 billion base pairs and more than 26,000 genes in the Koala genome-which makes it slightly larger than the human genome. Unlocking the genomic sequence gives scientists unprecedented insights into the unique biology of the koala.
Professor Johnson said the uneven response of koala populations throughout their range was one of the major challenges facing broad scale management of the species.
“The genome enables a holistic and scientifically grounded approach to koala conservation,” they said. “Australia has the highest mammal extinction record of any country during the Anthropocene.
“Koala numbers have plummeted in northern parts of its range since European settlement, but have increased in some southern parts, notably in Victoria and South Australia.”
Director and CEO, Australian Museum, Kim McKay, AO congratulated Professor Johnson and the team on this achievement.
“Today we celebrate the completion of the highest quality, marsupial genome sequencing undertaken to date. This work was brought about through the meticulous efforts not only of Professor Johnson and Professor Belov, but also the contributions from many other Australian Museum scientists, as well as scientists from around the nation and the world. It will usher in a new era in our understanding and conservation of the iconic koala,” they said.
Professor Jennifer Graves, AO, Distinguished Professor of Genetics, La Trobe University and winner of the 2017 PM's Prize for Science, said: “We could never have imagined, when we were pioneering koala genetics in the 1980s, that one day we'd have the entire koala genome sequence. This opens up all sort of ways we can monitor the genetic health of koala populations.”
The Koala Genome Consortium announced the establishment of the project in 2013 with its first unassembled draft genome. The collective aim was to steer their research towards ensuring the long-term survival of this important marsupial while simultaneously increasing Australia's genomics capability.
Since then, researchers have worked tirelessly to assemble this genome into the most complete and accurate marsupial genome to date and annotate its 26,000 genes for analysis. The koala genome has been sequenced to an accuracy of 95.1%, which is comparable to that of the human genome.
The 3.4 billion base pairs of the published Koala genome were sequenced at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics, at the University of New South Wales, using new sequencing technology.
“We then assembled the genome with supercomputers, allowing the Consortium to then study the >20,000 genes of this unique species,” said Professor Marc Wilkins, Director, Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics, UNSW.
Consortium members from the Earlham Institute (EI), (Norwich, UK) identified that koalas have two large expansions in a gene family known to be integral to detoxification, the Cytochrome P450 gene family of metabolic enzymes. They found these genes to be expressed in many koala tissues, particularly in the liver; indicating they have a very important function in detoxification and likely allowed koalas to become dietary specialists.
As Professor Johnson explains, “this probably helped them to find their niche to survive, as they could rely on a food source that would have less competition from other species who were not able to detoxify as effectively.”
Dr. Will Nash in the Haerty Group at Earlham Institute, said: “Gene duplication can lead to copies of genes associated with specific functions being retained in the genome. In the Koala, the largest group of retained copies make an enzyme that breaks down toxins. This means the Koala has evolved an excellent toolkit to deal with eating highly toxic eucalypts, one made up of lots of copies of the same (or very similar) tools.”
In the third period of the Washington Capitals 5-3 win over the Philadephia Flyers Wednesday, T.J. Oshie felt all the weight come off their shoulders, their arms up in the air as they celebrated their first goal in 13 games with their teammates.
“It's pretty nice, pretty relieving getting that goal, hopefully, the floodgates open up here for me,” Oshie said. “You want to be able to help the team, and sometimes, you need a little confirmation by putting one in the back of the net.”
It had been a long time coming for the 31-year-old winger, who has been struggling to produce since returning to the lineup after sitting out six games with a concussion in December. He's played in 16 games since coming back from injury, but has just two goals and seven points over that span; however, they have six points in their last nine games and appears to be turning their game around.
According to Oshie, he's been making adjustments to their game, which include longer time on the ice at practices and different tape jobs, in order to try and ignite a spark to improve their play.
“I've been working on my game a bit, doing different things here and there,” Oshie said. “When you're struggling a little bit to put the puck in the net, you do whatever works.”
Searching for a Spark
In an effort to help Oshie overcome their scoring woes, head coach Barry Trotz put them on the third line with Lars Eller and Brett Connolly, two players who provide a lot of grit and drive, and also have tremendous chemistry. And, that ultimately seemed to do the trick, as Oshie found themselves not only clicking with their new linemates but finding their speed and momentum, which helped them drive the net, crash the crease and create more scoring chances.
According to winger Brett Connolly, Oshie brought a lot to the line, and their energy and ability were prominent with their shift to the third line.
“[Oshie's] obviously a very good player, one of the better offensive players in the league, and when you get a guy like that to come down and play with you, they make your line that much better,” Connolly said. “He's got a lot of compete in their game, a lot of skill, a lot of smart plays… they definitely bring a different element for sure.”
Trotz first put Oshie on the third line in a Jan. 7 against the St. Louis Blues in hopes to ignite offense throughout the lineup. Almost immediately, Oshie responded and found themselves playing with more energy and getting more scoring opportunities. They finished the game with two assists to snap a frustrating five-game point drought. Since then, he's brought a lot more speed to the table and has spent a lot of time playing with that line and hitting their stride, which ultimately carried them back to the top six.
Now, he's playing alongside Nicklas Backstrom and Andre Burakovsky, a line that they believe can click well, especially because of Backstrom's versatility and ability to play with pretty much anyone.
“Sometimes it's instant, sometimes you can't really find it,” Oshie said. “There are a couple of guys I feel like it doesn't matter whether you've played with them or not, you're going to have success. I think [Backstrom] is one of those guys.”
With 32 games left on the schedule, the Capitals are not only looking to maintain a commanding lead over the Metropolitan Division but to also maintain a lot of scoring depth so that they can have a strong playoff run come April. And, according to Trotz, Wednesday's victory, which saw Oshie, Burakovsky and Chandler Stephenson all ending lengthy scoring droughts, proved that Washington has a lot of depth and scoring on their forward lines.
“I think it builds some confidence, because we've had some guys who've been a little dry,” Trotz said. “Obviously I was happy for [Burakovsky], I was happy for [Oshie], it's been a while. I think that's the key, is getting contributions right through your lineup. When we're getting that, we're usually pretty dangerous.

SA is a tinderbox, and the mining sector are no angels. Politicking, lobbying and conniving with corrupt officials does not give the sector long-term stability. Neither will dishing out thousands of exploratory licences to new miners in a high-risk environment transform the sector. We need to do things differently. We need to find the courage to stand up, we need to listen to the people and their needs. We cannot allow another decade of declining mining output.
On 16 August, 2012, the mining sector drilled into the heart of our humanity, and into the hearts of scores of families when 44 miners were slaughtered at Marikana, the very ones that slave at the coal face to pay for the extravagant lifestyle the shareholders enjoy. The Marikana Massacre was the breaking point of this critical sector that employs close to half a million jobs and has been the backbone of our economy for the past 150 years.
It was the day when a nexus of corrupt interests of state and corporate, in a post-apartheid democracy, attempted to assassinate our dream of transforming a sector that has brutalised generations of black lives, poured billions of dollars into hands of white elites, and left many mining communities broken and poor.
What did we learn?
The Platinum belt offered us a unique opportunity to reimagine mining in South Africa. To change apartheid spatial planning and to create the new democratic and integrated cities that would be our future. All of this collapsed in an avalanche of human greed which has taken us back to the dark days of our past that we thought we had left behind forever.
State capture is a reality. Many of our Ministers, including the one, responsible for this important sector of mining, are more accountable to a cabal of corrupt oligarchic families that resemble the robber barons of yesteryear rather than our people.
And as this illicit relationship of money and politics tightened its noose around the economy, an abusive establishment of middlemen emerged – a criminal horde of brutal shock troops who unabashedly corrupt some of the most senior levels of the state from local to national.
SA is a tinderbox. There is deep anger, hostility and restlessness in the land. Tribal and racial tensions and xenophobic violence are skin deep. It does not take too much demagoguery to inflame emotions that spill over into loss of lives and property.
At the same time, we are not unique in the world. We see the rise of fascism in the United States, where an emotionally underdeveloped President has their finger not just to rant on their Twitter line but also the ability to press a red button and start a nuclear wall that will incinerate the world. In Europe, we see the rise of rightwing populism. And here in our beloved country, the syndrome of the ‘God President' since Mandela.
How do we go forward understanding that the conflict of the Platinum Belt is in many ways a microcosm of our country?
Well. A good start is listened to the People. The *Mining Dialogues process revealed these deep insights.
“I have 40 years staying around this area: 10 years in Wonderkop and 30 years in Skierlik. I am now 60 years old, not working and without any hope to get a job. There is no electricity, and no accessible roads in this place. The land belongs to a certain landlord. When it rains, it is so muddy, there is mud inside [the shack] and mud outside. There is dirty water everywhere ... and shit ... our children live in filth. We don't have even one street light in the settlement ... it is dangerous ... miners are robbed and women are raped.”
What do the People want?
They all say the same thing. They want the mine-owners to work with them, and so must the government. In fact, the local government ignores their very existence. They want to be united, to stand up, to grow food, build houses, roads and create their own jobs through a public works programme. And all of them say: “We want to change our lives.”
They want to rebuild trust with the mining companies but “the mines keep their books secret but talk about losing money”, said one miner. “And they don't tell us how much they give the local Bapo Tribal Authority, so how can it be accountable?”
In essence, the people want legitimate projects, and work. The huge corporate social investment (CSI) spending of the mining houses can help deliver the ‘better life' we promised our people in 1994 if we work around a common vision. The community asks if the mines can pool this budget in a “Development Fund” that partners with state agencies and civil society in pursuit of a coherent and sustainable social development strategy? This fund could be a joint effort between mining houses and the State, managed by independent professionals with social development expertise.
Is anyone in the mining companies, government, unions and community organisations listening?
Everything we need to build a social compact from bottom up is there. It requires political will. We need to ensure that we navigate around self-appointed gatekeepers and talk directly to legitimate community organisations that represent the people.
It will take serious and honest commitment on all sides to rebuild the trust that has been shattered. And that involves us all as citizens. There are no shortcuts or simplistic solutions.
It is clear that 1994, our first liberation was about politics, deracialising our country and creating a Constitutional democracy. We succeeded but at the heart of which was a recognition of the legacy of apartheid, and the means to redress those wounds. We had to deal with issues of economic transformation, land, hunger and access to quality housing, health and education.
That dream has been deferred. Fourteen million people will go to bed hungry tonight. Fifty-five million South Africans are poor and one in three are jobless, many surviving on a minimal social grant. Our leaders during the last 23 years have forgotten that they are there to serve the People. They have disembowelled our soul to feed their personal greed.
And many of you in the private sector have been complicit in the looting of public resources. Companies like KPMG, Bell Pottinger and McKinsey have broken their code of ethics and been party to the stealing of billions from our national fiscus and weakening our democratic foundations.
The mining sector has not been the angel you try to paint. They need to genuinely embrace the principles of transparency and especially listen to the people digging up the wealth you benefit from kilometres underground.
Is this easy? Hell no. But we need to do things differently. We need to find the courage to stand up. We cannot allow another decade of declining mining output.
It's clear that politicking, lobbying, conniving with corrupt officials does not give the sector long term stability. Neither will dishing out thousands of exploratory licences to new miners in a high-risk environment transform the sector. Clearly, initiatives like the *Mining Phakisa and *Mining Dialogues are important starting points. How do we understand the ‘upstream' opportunities for communities in producing food and inputs that a mine needs and ‘downstream' opportunities of beneficiation?
This new vision, approach and strategy has to leave no-one behind, ensure a genuine empowerment from bottom up and build painstakingly and patiently the trust between the stakeholders especially mining companies, communities and government.
As Mandela wisely said. “It always seems impossible until its done.” We live in a beautiful country, with beautiful and generous people. We have walked away from the precipice before. We can find the COURAGE to do so again. And in our beautiful journey of life COURAGE IS FREE. DM
* Mining Dialogues is a process convened under the auspices of Kgosi Leruo Molotlhegi from the Royal Bafokeng to provide a platform for mining communities, mining houses, unions and civil society. Mining Phakisa is a process convened by government of stakeholders in the sector to work out a plan.

Before Dusty Baker's son, Darren, was drafted by the Nationals in 2017, they were being saved by J.T. Snow at home plate in the 2002 World Series. (0:37)
WASHINGTON -- The Washington Nationals drafted the son of manager Dusty Baker and the cousin of Redskins quarterbacks Kirk Cousins on Wednesday.
The Nationals announced they had selected Darren Baker in the 27th round of the MLB draft. An 18-year old shortstop out of Jesuit High School in Sacramento, California, Baker is already committed to play collegiately at Cal and is not expected to sign with the Nationals.

The younger Baker first hit the national radar during the 2002 World Series. Acting as bat boy for their father's Giants team, the then-3-year-old Darren was infamously swept away from home plate by San Francisco first baseman J.T. Snow on a scoring play in Game 5.
Darren is currently in Washington D.C. with their father and the first-place Nationals. They were selected one round later than their dad, who was taken exactly 50 years ago in the 26th round of the 1967 draft by the Atlanta Braves.
Meanwhile, Cousins was thrilled with the prospect of their cousin joining them in D.C.

Jake Cousins, a 23-year old right-handed pitcher out of the University of Pennsylvania, went 7-2 with a 3.15 ERA as a senior for the Quakers. The unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection, who is 6-foot-4, was taken by the Nationals in the 20th round.
The Tendele mining company is blasting for coal near the eastern boundary of the historic Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve. Now another company is searching for coal, directly on the reserve fence-line. Picture: Tony Carnie
There is a creature known in Zulu as the imvukuzane. It lives underground, has sharp claws and long teeth, but its face is rarely seen. It digs big holes and leaves quite a lot of mess behind on the surface. Daily Maverick picked up the scent of one poking its nose around on the boundaries of one of Africa's oldest game reserves and followed the sooty footprints of this mysterious creature – all the way back to Fredman Towers in Sandton, where it seems to have concealed itself in the offices of a coal mining company with links to a Chinese energy group and two former government mining officials.
Imvukuzane is the isiZulu word for a species of blind mole with long claws that burrows energetically underground, leaving a trail of molehills above the surface.
It is also the name of a hitherto unknown mining company that aims to blast coal on the doorstep of one of Africa's oldest game reserves and wilderness areas – disrupting tourism and wildlife and possibly displacing hundreds of rural people from their homes.
Six weeks ago on 22 May, Imvukuzane Resources (Pty) Ltd requested environmental approval from government to prospect for coal and other minerals and to dig 275 test boreholes in the Fuleni area, directly adjacent to the southern boundary of the flagship Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal.
The two reserves were proclaimed in 1895, and later joined together to protect the last surviving population of Africa's southern white rhinos and a host of other wildlife species.
Previous attempts to mine at Fuleni have been strongly opposed by local community groups and the provincial nature conservation agency, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.
In a background document on the latest prospecting venture, Imvukuzane listed a postal address, but no details about the company's ownership or history.
Initial requests for more company information were noted by Imvukuzane environmental consultant Christine Fouche but when no details were forthcoming, Daily Maverick did a company records search which suggests that Imvukuzane was only set up in April and currently has a single director (a 33-year-old Pretoria attorney).
Though the company's prospecting application included a Johannesburg telephone number, the receptionist said they had no knowledge of Imvukuzane Resources.
But further investigation has revealed that this telephone number belongs in fact to Canyon Coal, a Sandton-based company established by Turkish-born entrepreneur Vuslat Bayoglu.
Canyon Coal board members and shareholders include Beijing-based energy trader Jason (Jianyun) Sun, along with Alan Gillespie, Rudzani Mudogwa, Pandelani Magudamani and Mehboob Kamaloodien.
Sun is the chief investment officer (Asia) of Mercuria Energy and helped to develop new metal, coal, gas and oil businesses in China, while Gillespie is managing director of Mercuria Energy Trading, South Africa.
Mudogwa and Magudamani were both previous employees of the Department of Mineral Resources, while Kamaloodienis involved in coal, limestone and quarry operations in Mpumalanga and North West provinces.
Responding to written questions, Bayogulu's communications team denied that Imvukuzane was a subsidiary of Canyon Coal.
Canyon said Bayoglu planned to participate as a director and managing director of Imvukuzane along with “other interested parties”. They said Sun, Gillespie, Mudogwa, Magudamani and Kamaloodien would not be directors.
On why Canyon and Imvkuzane share the same telephone number, Canyon said some of its employees were requested to provide expertise and consulting services to Imvukuzane.
The company strongly denied suggestions that Canyon was attempting to conceal its interests in prospecting or mining at Fuleni by applying through the back door via an unknown company.
“There is no reason to conceal anything. Any person or company is free to apply for prospecting and mining rights subject to legislation. As you are surely aware and as pointed out above, the process to apply for a prospecting right involves public participation, and all of the documents are made available to the public for their input.
“There can be no applying ‘through the back door' and in any event is there no need to do so. There will be an open and transparent process which is overseen by the Department of Mineral Resources . . . . It is this kind of suggestion, as you put it, that amounts to sensation seeking when the facts clearly show a different scenario,” Canyon stated.
Asked whether Canyon and its partners were aware of substantial opposition to previous attempts to mine coal in close proximity to Africa's oldest game reserve and wilderness area, the company said:
“As far as we know, no mining is currently taking place in the area. The only application currently pending is for a prospecting right. The right has not been granted. As part of the process, interested and affected parties are given the opportunity to give comments and inputs.”
A separate company, Ibutho Coal, also applied for mining rights in Fuleni about four years ago, but seems to have abandoned the project following strong opposition from Ezemvelo and local community groups.
Previous studies commissioned by Ibutho to mine the same area suggested that several hundred people would have to abandon their houses, businesses, farming plots and ancestral graveyards if the project went ahead.
An environmental impact report on the Ibutho project suggested there more than 6,000 people in the Fuleni area – 1,900 at Ocilwane, 1,640 at Ntuthunga 1 village, 1,503 at Ntuthunga 2 village and about 1,245 at Novunala.
The direct impacts (blasting vibration, dust, noise and floodlights) would be felt 24 hours a day for seven days a week for over 30 years.
Apart from the blasting to loosen anthracite coal from the bedrock, the Jacana environmental consultancy suggested that noise from up to 200 coal trucks a day would radiate out to distances of around 1.5km during the day and about 3.5km at night.
These noise impacts would affect the tranquillity of the nearby iMfolozi wilderness area, a specially protected 32,000ha zone established through the efforts of the late conservationist Dr Ian Player. Wilderness areas cover less than 1% of the country's surface area.
The report said the Ibutho mine would need up to 2,190 megawatt hours of electricity and 105-million litres of water a month, although the neighbouring iMfolozi River was already considered water-stressed.
Surface and groundwater in the vicinity of the mine could be poisoned from acidic mine drainage and other contaminants from mining, while underground mining could also cause the ground to subside.

Source: . . . Mugabe angrily tells VP off – The Zimbabwe Independent October 6, 2017
INFIGHTING in Zanu PF reached fever pitch yesterday when Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa dug in their heels, maintaining that they had fallen ill due to poisoning despite an earlier dismissal of these claims by Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko.
Elias Mambo/Tinashe Kairiza/Bernard Mpofu
Mnangagwa, currently feeling the heat from a rival faction within the ruling party, recently fell ill during a rally, fuelling speculation that they had been poisoned. Their sympathisers claimed they had been poisoned through ice cream made by President Robert Mugabe's Gushungo Dairies. They dismissed these allegations, but subtly insists they had been poisoned.
Mnangagwa is leading a faction angling to succeed Mugabe, while Mphoko is backing a group coalescing around First Lady Grace Mugabe.
Mnangagwa told the media in the capital during a press briefing, where private media journalists were barred, that their medical doctors, in the presence of Mugabe, had confirmed that they had been poisoned, not food poisoned.
“During the Ordinary Session of the Politburo held on September 6 2017 and the Ordinary Session of the Central Committee held on September 8 2017, I informed the meetings that my doctors had said that I was not food poisoned. I did not state that poison had been ruled out. It is most disappointing that a person at the level of my colleague, Vice-President Cde R .P Mphoko would misunderstand and misrepresent the statements made by their Excellency, the President R.G Mugabe and myself,” Mnangagwa said in a statement which was later broadcast on state-controlled television.
“During the briefing with Their Excellency, the President Robert Mugabe, the medical doctors who attended to me ruled out food poisoning, but confirmed that indeed poisoning had occurred and that investigations were underway,” they said.
Mnangagwa added yesterday: “It is further disconcerting that the statement is littered with subjective falsehoods, mischievous perceptions and malicious innuendos written in a language and tone which is disrespectful and contemptuous to my person and indeed, to the office I occupy, that of Vice-President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Party Zanu PF.”
On Tuesday, Mphoko castigated their counterpart in government and party, following remarks delivered by Mnangagwa while presiding at the memorial service of the late Masvingo provincial affairs minister Shuvai Mahofa.
Meanwhile, Mugabe reportedly publicly clashed with their deputy Mnangagwa at the Harare International Airport upon their return from a state visit in neighbouring South Africa.
The public spat emanated from remarks Mnangagwa made in Masvingo while attending Mahofa's memorial service.
“Mnangagwa questioned why Mphoko had to issue a public statement concerning their health when they could have called them to discuss the issue,” the source said.
“Mnangagwa also wanted to know why Mphoko suggested that they had undermined the authority of the president when the issue of their illness was well-known by the president after doctors gave them an hour-long briefing.
“The heated exchange subsided when Mugabe arrived. However, Mnangagwa went straight to Mugabe to register their displeasure.
“The president did not want Mnangagwa to explain their issue, but instead questioned them the motive of their Masvingo utterances,” said the source, adding: “when Mnangagwa wanted to explain how the Mahofa issue came in, Mugabe did not want to listen.
“While Mnangagwa was explaining their reference to Mahofa, Mugabe, who had lost their temper, saying ‘nonsense, nonsense' until they got to their vehicle. Mugabe then stopped at their vehicle and gave Mnangagwa a chance.”
Sources said Mnangagwa told Mugabe that they were waiting for their permission to respond and publicise their medical and toxicological reports
“It was at this point that Mugabe said it was not necessary to continue fighting in public. Mugabe told Mnangagwa that such an issue needed to be resolved amicably and not in the public.”
While addressing the Mahofa family and Zanu PF supporters, Mnangagwa opened up on their food poisoning scare, saying they experienced what Mahofa at a Zanu PF conference in 2015 experienced when they were taken ill after a poison scare in Victoria Falls.
“I have come to tell you that what happened to Mai Mahofa in Victoria Falls is what also happened to me. I am making tremendous recovery. Those who wished me dead will be ashamed because when God's time for one to die is not up, they will not die. I still have many years to live and the truth will come out,” Mnangagwa said.
However, Mphoko on Tuesday night, while they were acting president, responded to Mnangagwa with a scathing statement, accusing their counterpart of lying and undermining Mugabe's authority.
In a statement, Mphoko alleged that Mnangagwa was also using their poisoning saga to cause tribal divisions for political expedience within Zanu PF. They added that Mnangagwa's claim was a “calculated” challenge to Mugabe's “public account that Mnangagwa's medical doctor ruled out poisoning
“There's now little doubt, if there ever was any, that there appears to be an agenda to undermine the authority of President Mugabe and to destabilise the country by using lies to fan ethnic tensions for political purposes,” Mphoko said.
In August, Mnangagwa was airlifted to South Africa for urgent medical attention following the poisoning scare at Zanu PF's youth interface rally in Gwanda.
Mnangagwa last month dismissed speculative reports that they had eaten poisoned ice cream from the First Family's Gushungo Dairies, although they did not dispute the poisoning narrative.
Meanwhile, in Harare last night, Grace launched an acerbic attack on Mnangagwa, saying the vice-president had crossed the line by accusing the First Family of attempting to poison him.
Grace also said they would not bow down to Mnangagwa's allies threatening to stage a coup if Mugabe chooses another candidate to succeed him.
“Even these days when false claims are being peddled by politicians, you hear some saying someone has been poisoned by ice cream from Alpha Omega. It's unfair. That is unfair to say that. Can I prepare just one cup for Mnangagwa, to kill Mnangagwa? I'm the wife of the president. Who is Mnangagwa? Who is he? Who would kill who here?” Grace said during the launch of Empower Bank last night.
“My husband is someone who is very disciplined when it comes to women.  They are not a bambazonke (grab everything) type, never ever. They keep me and me alone. Why would I want to kill someone who was appointed by my husband? It is nonsensical. If politics gets to this stage, it means you have run out of ideas. If you have run out of ideas, go home and retire. It is not proper to say you like the President yet you hate their wife, it's not possible. I asked you in the Midlands whether the President erred by appointing you.”
Mugabe's wife also warned the military against using coercion to drum up support for Mnangagwa. “We don't like people who go around threatening people that if their preferred candidate or Mnangagwa is not elevated to the presidency, we will shoot you. Kill if you can, why aren't you? We must all agree if the President says they want to resign. We must all agree as a party over who shall take over. We say no to those who threaten to use bazookas. We are being threatened night and day that if so and so is not appointed (president), we will shoot you. We will not bow down to that pressure, never. You will have to arrest all of us for you to rule,” Grace said.
“We don't want people who intimidate us. Don't force people to vote you by threatening. If you choose to stage a coup, no one will recognise you. The AU doesn't recognise such a government and don't even dare talk about it. You have to be grateful that President Mugabe is a good man, otherwise some people would have been serving time now. Don't take that tolerance too far.”
Go-go — Washington D.C.'s regional twist on funk — reigned in the DMV during the 1980s, and one of the scene's signature acts was Trouble Funk. More than 30 years later, the collective — led by Big Tony Fisher — still fills sold-out venues with heavyweight percussion and call-and-response lyrics. Trouble Funk concerts are bona fide jam sessions, so I was determined to squeeze their unrelenting rhythms behind the Tiny Desk.
With 12 members sandwiched into a cramped space, the electricity was almost tangible as they launched into the 1982 banger, "Pump Me Up", a song sampled in Public Enemy's protest anthem "Fight the Power" and M/A/R/R/S's dance classic "Pump Up The Volume." The drums break here are definitive go-go and it was hard to discern who was having more fun: the band or the audience. On "Grip It," buoyant and staccato horn melodies propelled the song forward, while "Let's Get Small" featured Trouble Funk's classic call-and-response chants. "Drop the Bomb," another notable gem from their lengthy discography keep the energy level high and "Don't Touch That Stereo" was all raw, unencumbered funk. To conclude the set, they segued into "E Flat Boogie," their first hit in 1979, with Big Tony's vocals front and center.
While the late Chuck Brown is often acknowledged as the godfather of go-go (and you can see why during their Tiny Desk), Trouble Funk was a key part of the sound's second wave. In a city often interrupted by the transient revolving door of government officials and federal staffers, the funky artform is woven into the fabric of this city and inspires a spirit of dance, rhythm and sheer joy.

KARACHI - Beggars from suburban areas have rushed to financial capital of the country with the onset of holy month of Ramazan.
Worship places, traffic signals, squares, shops and even doorsteps are swarmed with ‘seasonal' beggars as every Muslim tries to show generosity to seek mercy of the Almighty in this month of blessing.
Up to 200,000 ‘seasonal' beggars of all ages are reported to have been in action the port of city since the onset of Ramazan.
They operate in a well-organised manner. A contractor chooses them from suburbs and deputes them in ‘selected' points to do business.
Their bosses have ordered them to work within the limits of assigned area.
These beggars, out of which mostly from South Punjab and brought to Karachi, are provided pick and drop service. The beggars may be changed but their points remain the same as these were leased out.
Many of these beggars are also involved criminal activities such as peddling.
A woman beggar who sits in front of KMC's workshop in Sohrab Goth was involved in drug-dealing.
A teen begging at Karachi's Burns Road said that they were doing it to look after their family, adding that the people of this city are very kind and use to give in the name of Allah.
Asked about the contractor, they said every area is leased out and no one can do business if the person does not give share to contractor.
Although citizens made a litany of complaints but to no avail as action against such a business is rare insight.
The person can be awarded an imprisonment of up to three years, if found guilty of begging or facilitating it in any manner as the offence is punishable under sections of Pakistan Penal Code.
A woman who used to go to market for purchasing commodities said that they (beggars) have increased considerably in Ramazan. They said that in these circumstances, this is very difficult for them and other women to go out for shopping as the beggars keep on troubling them. “The beggars keep asking for money and use different tactics till we are forced to give some amount to them”.
The administration seemed to have shut their eyes on the issue as neither provincial nor city government was willing to get Karachiites rid of this issue.
When contacted, Karachi Commissioner spokesperson stated Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has a special department to tackle the problem but KMC spokesperson Ali Hassan Sajid rejected the statement.
“KMC has no such department to check this issue but Sindh government's social welfare department is mandated to fix it,” the official said.
When contacted, representative of social welfare department was unavailable.

The STOXX 600 is down around 1.8 percent so far this week, set for its biggest weekly loss since November Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) ***** DEUTSCHE BANK POSTS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED LOSS (0643 GMT) Banks, recently buoyed by rising bond yields and optimism about economic growth, could be in focus today after the DAX-listed heavyweight lender disappointed analyst expectations with a 2017 loss of 497 million euros in 2017. (Danilo Masoni) ***** MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO EXTEND LOSING STREAK (0630 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. Rising bond yields and a stronger euro are likely to put European shares under pressure for a fifth day in a row, one day after the export oriented German DAX index fell 1.4 percent - its biggest one-day loss since early November. Over in Asia, the euro neared multi-year peaks as talk of policy tightening in Europe and expectations that inflation is set to gear higher drove up borrowing costs globally, a move that sparked a sell-off in Asian equities. Later in the day the focus will be the U.S. payrolls report. "Anticipation is elevated after a hawkish FOMC meeting... A strong number may increase the probability of four rate hikes this year," says Credit Suisse in its investment daily note. We'll also be keeping an eye on tech stocks here in Europe after results from big internet companies in the US. "Some anxiety is fuelled by a trend for companies that miss estimates to be penalized... Facebook bucked the trend, forecasting rising ad sales despite a dip in usage. Apple reported record quarterly revenue and profits after the bell, Amazon's results easily beat expectations, but Alphabet disappointed," adds Credit Suisse.

n Sunday, April 16, 2017, we virtually met Steve Stephens. The 37-year-old brutally gunned down 74-year-old Robert Godwin, Sr. as they walked down a Cleveland street on Easter Sunday.
If the crime wasn't tragic enough, Stephens recorded the last moments of Mr. Godwin's life and uploaded the video to their Facebook profile for the world to see. Millions clicked. Millions opted not to watch. Either way, we were all affected.
Mr. Godwin was described by family members as a “good guy” who would “give you the shirt off their back.” Their final minutes of life were spent in utter fear and confusion, as Stephens took out their unaddressed rage on an innocent bystander.
“Found me somebody I'm about to kill …this old dude,” Stephens can be heard in the graphic video before approaching Godwin.
They then proceeds to ask the elderly father of nine to say their ex-girlfriend, Joy Lane's, name to the camera before telling Godwin that “she's the reason this is about to happen to you.”
Stephens can then be seen pointing a handgun at the man, who frighteningly attempts to shield themselves with a plastic bag before being shot in the head. They fall to the ground and blood pours from their face down onto the pavement.

PARIS-Mamoudou Gassama, the 22-year-old Malian “Spider-Man” feted for saving a child hanging from a balcony, took their first step toward French citizenship Tuesday and joined the fire brigade as accolades continued to pour in over their daring rescue.
Video footage of Gassama scaling four storeys of the building with their bare hands has catapulted the young man to global fame, and earned them the promise of citizenship from President Emmanuel Macron.
Wearing white sweatpants and a black cap, the hero of a rescue video viewed by millions of people appeared slightly overwhelmed by the media furore as they filed their application for legal residency in the Paris suburb of Bobigny. Hailing the bravery of the youth who had been living in France illegally, the head of the local authority, Pierre-Andre Durand said: “How can anyone fail to be impressed by what they did, not admire it?
“He helped someone in danger, which is not such a common thing in our society.” Gassama became an overnight sensation after the video of them plucking a four-year-old boy to safety Saturday went viral. On Monday they were honoured by President Emmanuel Macron with a medal for bravery, the promise of citizenship and the offer of a job with the fire service. Gassama arrived in France via Italy and the perilous Mediterranean migrant route.
Their official permit allowing them to work will arrive within a month, and their citizenship papers in about three months, officials said Tuesday.
The athletic Malian also visited a fire station to sign up for a 10-month internship with the Paris fire and rescue services, expected to pay close to 600 euros ($690) a month.
The family of the young boy they saved thanked them Tuesday for their quick thinking.
The boy's paternal grandmother, who like their mother lives in Reunion, told RMC radio Tuesday that they were “very moved” by the images of the rescue and sent “huge thanks” to Gassama.
“He's really a hero,” they said. “He did not stand by and watch, they saved my little sweetpea.”
The boy's father, who had been living alone with them in Paris, had left them alone to go out to the shops and then remained on the street to play Pokémon Go, according to French investigators.
They were arrested on charges of neglecting their parental duties but released again on Monday.
The Paris prosecutor's office said they had admitted their guilt and expressed “profound regret”.
The boy's mother learned the news of the rescue on Reunion Island - the French Indian Ocean territory where they and the father were born and where they still live.
Reacting to Gassama's intervention on Antenne Reunion radio they said: “We can only thank them and thank heaven they were so reactive.”
“Things could have turned out much worse so I am relieved,” they said, adding that they were impatient to be reunited with their son and husband.
Gassama told Macron during a visit on Monday that they “did not think twice” before springing into action.
Lawmakers are debating a controversial bill that would speed up the deportation of economic migrants and failed asylum-seekers, thousands of whom live in squalid camps in the capital.
“There's a bit of hypocrisy or cynicism,” added Claire Rodier of the GISTI association which supports immigrants. They saw a contrast between the treatment of Gassama and “the repressive policy of this government against migrants and those without documents.”
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz
Sharif has congratulated the Pakistan Cricket Team and the
entire nation over superb victory against England in Champions
Trophy Semi Final on Wednesday, eventually making it to the
finals.
The entire team demonstrated extraordinary resilience
and courage in the match under the captaincy of Sarfraz Ahmad
for which all the players deserve immense appreciation, they

Pakistani officials say a retired army officer was lured to Nepal with a job prospect before being seized by Indian intelligence, which hopes to use them to secure the release of an Indian agent sentenced to death by Pakistan.
Two senior security officials said Tuesday that Indian agents abducted Lt Col Mohammad Habib, who went missing on April 6 after arriving in Nepal.
They say the abduction is aimed at pressuring Pakistan to release Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian naval officer convicted of espionage who was sentenced to death on April 10.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief reporters about the sensitive matter.
Indian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OTTAWA—The federal privacy watchdog says he's concerned about the possibility that the personal information of Facebook users was harvested for political purposes.
Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says their office will contact Facebook to find out whether the personal information of Canadians was affected by a major data leak involving the global social media platform.
A Canadian data expert named Christopher Wylie has exposed the breach in media interviews, saying they helped found a data analytics company that helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically on private Facebook information.

Google announced this afternoon it's adding new features to both Google Search and Google Play Newsstand that will help people keep up with their favorite teams and their standings during the NBA and the NHL playoffs. In Search, you'll now find Knowledge Panels with information directly from the teams, like highlights, photos or GIFs, for NHL, NBA as well as MLB teams. Meanwhile, Newsstand will also offer top headlines, scores, analysis and videos.
The Search feature is taking advantage of Google's recently expanded “Posts on Google” product, which allows organizations to share status updates and other information directly on Google's Search result pages, where they appear as widgets placed among the blue links. Effectively, it turns Google itself into a variation on Twitter – but one where only approved organizations can share their news.
The feature was originally developed for the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, allowing candidates to post updates to Google Search results pages. Last month, Google said it would open up this program more broadly, to organizations like museums, sports teams, sports leagues and movie studios, for example.
The addition of the sports updates is one of the first high-profile launches for Posts on Google, following the March announcement.
You can trigger these search results by entering in specific queries, like “Stanley Cup Playoffs” or a team's name.
Google tells us these posts can be anything, from photos to GIFs or even call-outs to fans.
NHL and NBA updates are available in both Search and Newsstand, but MLB was only mentioned as being integrated into Search.
The real-time updates will also make their way to Google Play Newsstand's app, which is available online at newsstand.google.com, or as a standalone mobile app on iOS or Android. The app will feature special NBA and Stanley Cup Playoffs sections, with the latest news, scores, analysis, and videos, in addition to the real-time posts (which are linked to Google Search).
These features are rolling out now globally in English, but the team information will appear for those in the U.S. and Canada.
ISLAMABAD - National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq fell short of accepting the opposition's demand to resign amid ministers and treasury members' absence on Monday but did “quit” their chair for Murtaza Javed Abbasi.
As they walked out, Sadiq smilingly said: “I am lodging my protest” – and the house burst into laughter.
The National Assembly (NA) echoed with opposition members' slogans as they incited the speaker to quit honourably rather than leading a deserted house.
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) legislator Aijaz Hussain Jakhrani was the first to start the debate on ministers' absence when the session resumed after a two-day break. They praised Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani for threatening to resign, if the ministers did not attend the Upper House proceedings.
“Raza Rabbani's warning worked. The ministers are in the Senate now. Can you please also follow them so that we can also enjoy their (ministers) presence,” Jakhrani said.
They mocked that some “innocent” parliamentary secretaries were being tested by the ministers to answer lawmakers' questions.
“These poor souls don't know anything. And the ministers have made a habit to avoid the parliament. Only you (the speaker) can lodge a strong protest like Raza Rabbani. Otherwise this trend will continue,” Jakhrani contended.
In the background the opposition members laughed satirically.
Embarrassed by the opposition's onslaught, the speaker asked how they could walk out.
“Please don't try to provoke me. I can't walk out. I have however, asked the ministers to make sure they answer your questions. On Mondays and Fridays we do have a problem as (the National Assembly session) time clashes with the Senate,” they justified.
But the opposition was unstoppable.
They chanted slogans: “Move forward Ayaz Sadiq, we will follow you.”
Awami Muslim League (AML) Chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed went to the extent of offering to resign if Sadiq decided to quit.
Government ally Naeema Kishawar, from the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-Fazl), was also critical of the ministers' behaviour.
They said that it was a joke that not a single minister was present during the question hour.
Shireen Mazari from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) blamed the “leniency” of the speaker for the “negligence” of the ministers.
Not being able to take it anymore, Sadiq left the chair to make way for Deputy Speaker Murtaza Javed Abbasi. Before leaving, in a lighter vein they said it was a sort of protest.
Opposition leader Khurshid Shah, speaking on a point of order, said killings in the name of religion should be stopped.
They recalled that 65 people had been killed since 1990 on charges of blasphemy but not a single person had been hanged.
Shah asked the government to bring a resolution against lynching of a student of Abdul Wali Khan University in Mardan to discourage mob violence.
Shireen Mazari supported Shah on the issue.
They criticised the government for ignoring the parliament despite opposition's hue and cry.
“Quorum has been pointed out more than 200 times and around 120 times the proceedings have been suspended [in four years]. Is this the way to run a house,” Shah questioned.
The PPP later staged a walkout over the issue of missing persons in Sindh and increased power load-shedding.
PPP's Ramesh Lal pointed out the quorum and the house was not found in order.
The proceedings were suspended for some time.
Minutes later, the inevitable happened.
The government failed to find lawmakers in the corridors and despite Murtaza Javed Abbasi's best efforts to delay adjournment, they finally had to say: “The house is not in order.”
There were indication, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) will try to pull in maximum of its lawmakers on April 18th (today) to avoid further embarrassment.
ISLAMABAD - Khalid Iqbal Malik, President Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has called upon the National Database & Registration Authority (NADRA) to provide unconditional cooperation to FBR in identifying potential taxpayers as it was a national responsibility. They said it was encouraging that NADRA has shown its willingness to share a list of around 795,000 potential taxpayers who are not on the tax role with FBR. However, they said NADRA should not ask for any specific percentage of tax collected from these cases as its share because it was its national responsibility to help in efforts aimed at identifying new taxpayers in the country. They said NADRA's support in such efforts would contribute positively in improving tax revenue and exports of the country.
They said according to FBR's own report, active taxpayers for the year 2015 were only 1.20 million out of which almost half was salaried class. They said Pakistan could not achieve better economic development without bringing more people into the tax net. They said no serious efforts were made in Pakistan to enhance the tax base due to which burden on existing taxpayers was increasing and this state of affairs was not proving conducive for the country. They said it was high time that FBR should focus on expanding tax net instead of putting more burden on the existing taxpayers.
Khalid Iqbal Malik said that according to FBR's own analysis, Pakistan has the potential to collect Rs.5500 to Rs.6000 billion tax revenue. However, they wondered why the FBR was not making strong efforts to exploit this huge tax potential for the betterment the country. They said the prevailing complicated tax system was one of the major hurdles in promoting tax culture. They urged that FBR should focus on simplification of tax system to make it fair and just.
They said electricity, gas and telephone departments could also help FBR in identifying potential taxpayers in the country and emphasized that FBR should develop strong liaison with these departments to broaden the tax base. They said that zero-rated tax sectors should not be made to deposit tax and then claim refunds as it was a time-consuming exercise. They said zero-rated sectors should be free of such difficult procedures.
ICCI President said that FBR should make complicated tax procedures easier, reduce high tax rates, focus on direct tax collection and develop a transparent tax system that would go a long way in improving tax revenue of the country.
Budget failed to revive confidence
of investors, exporters: PEW
The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) on Wednesday said economic managers have pushed the country to the brink of default as the export-import gap has jumped to the unprecedented 30 billion dollars. The situation is worsening by the passage of every day but the government seems to be more interested in politics, it said.
In the current economic scenario, getting loans from the banks is not sustainable as it continues to burden exchequer and it is not a substitute to the exports, said Dr. Murtaza Mughal, President PEW.
They said that budget has failed to address the concerns of important sectors as the textile, overseas investors, construction, stock exchange, corporate sector, multinationals and various chambers of commerce have rejected the budget and started protests.
Dr. Murtaza Mughal said that government has failed to restore the confidence of exporters and investors in the budget which will further worsen the situation.
The largest export earning sector of textile is sailing in troubled waters which must be bailed out.
FBR has also failed to broaden the tax net and it will try to squeeze the existing taxpayers as it has been given an unrealistic target, they said, adding that this institution will not help to revive investors' confidence. They said that reduced oil prices have saved the country from landing into a serious balance of payment crisis coupled with eroded currency due to the incompetence of the authorities concerned and sliding export sector.
Export refunds should be paid immediately, the issues of the textile sector should be resolved, provision of dependable energy be ensured and the tax system should be improved otherwise country will not be able to avoid another IMF loan on harsh conditions, they warned.

Accra, April 24, GNA - The Ghana National Education Campaign Coalition (GNECC), has called for an end to the politicisation of educational issues in the country.
Mr Bright Appiah, the Chairman of GNECC, said the excessive politicisation of education issues must stop because in the end it was the child who suffered and not the politicians playing their games.
They noted that the best interest of the child must be the key consideration in the formulation and implementation of policies and not political tactics.
Speaking at the national launch of the Global Action Week for Education (GAWE) 2018, Mr Appiah said the Ministry of Education (MoE) needed to be more accountable for the formulation of effective policies and overseeing their proper implementation.
The weeklong celebration, which is being organised by the GNECC is on the theme; “Strengthening Citizen Participation and Accountability in Education Management: A Milestone for Achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Four”.
The GAWE is an annual advocacy campaign organized to raise awareness about critical issues in education that require priority attention, and to advocate for urgent action and commitment of targeted resources to address such issues.
Mr Appiah said the Ghana Education Service (GES), National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, National Teaching Council and other agencies under the MoE must be strengthened to undertake their mandate effectively and should be held to account for the responsibilities they have been charged with.
They said even though access to basic education had increased considerable there were still a lot of challenges – inadequate resources, unsafe school environments, poor leadership, to mention a few – which needed to be tackled with a sense of urgency.
Mr Appiah said: “We believe that in order to achieve the SDGs, there is a need for more openness and accountability among all stakeholders - the international community, government, teachers, schools, parents, students, civil society and businesses - because education is a shared society endeavour and a shared responsibility”.
They said the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Ministry of Finance all had critical roles to play in the delivery of quality education and must be held accountable for their roles.
They said teachers and other education workers who were in direct contact with students were critical stakeholders in the sector,” indeed without their hard work and sacrifice they would all not be here.
“It is important that teachers and other education workers are accountable because if a teacher does not show up or refuses to teach when children are in school, it constitutes a violation of the child's rights, and a waste of scarce resources, which could have been applied to other productive uses.
“Resources allocated to the education sector have to be used more effectively and efficiently in order to justify the significant amount of resources that is being invested into education annually,” they said.
They said civil society remains a driving force for transparent monitoring of and reporting on education, including financing, helping to ensure that financial resources were used efficiently and equitably.
They said nonetheless, NGOs, CSOs, religious bodies, private institutions and other non-state actors must also be accountable for their contributions to education development in Ghana.
They said the situation at the pre-tertiary level was currently chaotic; declaring that “either there are no regulations or enforcement is so weak leaving room for exploitation when education is recognized as a fundamental human right by the 1992 constitution”.
Mr Appiah said the GNECC was working with the MoE to address the issue of duplication and inadequate accountability within the CSO space.
“It is our expectation that efforts to restore sanity within the sector will be extended to other areas as soon as possible,” they said.
Dr Esther Ofei-Aboagye, a former Director of the Institute of Local Government Studies, who chaired the function, urged the Government to ensure that the councils and governing boards for colleges of education in the country were constituted.

ST. LOUIS — The St. Louis Blues become the 23rd team to play in an outdoor game Monday. They'll face the Chicago Blackhawks, who always seem to be a part of the outdoor festivities, but are a perfect rival for the Blues after St. Louis eliminated them from the 2016 playoffs.
With the looming specter of rain at St. Louis's Busch Stadium and plenty of hoopla surrounding the event, both teams are attempting to remain focused.
But rain was a hot topic during Sunday's practices, with both teams preparing mentally for what it would mean to face a delay. “I think for us players, we aren't trying to think about that too much,” said Patrick Kane after Tuesday's practice. “Hopefully, we hear about it early in the day, whether it's going to be a 12:05 game or 3:00 or 7:00. But if it gets delayed and we're supposed to play at noon and it ends up getting delayed, you know, you just maybe relax in here, maybe grab a bite to eat and just kind of enjoy the whole process.”
GAME ON! The #WinterClassic is set to begin at noon as originally scheduled. Doors open at Busch Stadium beginning at 10 a.m. #stlblues pic.twitter.com/NFDRgeu22w — St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) January 2, 2017
Monday morning the rain paused and the NHL announced they plan to proceed with noon central start time.
“I think both teams are ready for anything,” said coach Ken Hitchcock on Sunday. “I think the one thing we probably aren't used to is if we come here and there's a three or four-hour delay, that would take something, you'd have to have some experience to go through it before. That might be a bit of an advantage to Chicago. They've gone through some delays before. We're hoping that if the delay is on, then it's a long one. Otherwise, we start on time. But if it's a short delay, we'll have to figure out what to do because we haven't experienced that part of it.”

Game Notes
1) Chicago has played 16 of their last 84 games — including playoff and preseason games — against St. Louis. That's more than any other two teams.
They'll face each other again on Feb. 26.
2) There are a couple question marks in the Blues lineup. The team has been plagued by a bug in recent weeks. Jaden Schwartz and Nail Yakupov are the latest victims. They missed Sunday's outdoor practice and family day because of the illness. That they weren't on the ice for family day, said Hitchcock, “gives you an idea of how sick they are.” They also added, “We're hoping that both Schwartz and Yak make it in tomorrow.”
For what it's worth, the Blues are listing Schwartz in the game-day lineup and not Yakupov.
3) Despite the national attention the Winter Classic generates, both teams emphasized that it's really just a two-point game against a division rival. With the Minnesota Wild 12-1-1 over their last 14 games, both teams are feeling the pressure of the Division.
Chicago's stranglehold on the top spot in the Central isn't firm anymore and the Blues see themselves receding in the rearview mirror of Minnesota. Chicago is just one point up on the Wild and they've played three more games. The Blues are seven back and have played one more game than the second-place Wild.
Meanwhile, Dallas and Nashville have both garnered more points than the Blues over their last 10 games and sit just four and five points back of St. Louis, respectively.
4) Both Vladimir Tarasenko and Robby Fabbri are players to watch for the Blues. Though they have just one assist in the last four games, Tarasenko ranks fourth in points league-wide. Meanwhile, Fabbri is just one game removed from a hat trick and a December that saw them tally six goals and seven assists in 14 games.
On the other side, Jonathan Toews has picked up the production lately while playing on a line with rookies Ryan Hartman and Vinnie Hinostroza. He's put up two goals, four points and 15 shots over the last four games. “We've kind of been clicking a little bit better I think,” said Hartman. “We've had a lot of puck possession and the more [Toews] has the puck the more plays he's going to make.”
ISLAMABAD - Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl(JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday discussed overall political situation in the country with main focus on addressing the concerns of former on host of issues, including some legislative matters.

Ishaq Dar said that the government considered JUI-F as its valued coalition partner and that was the reason JUI-F Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman's views and suggestions were seriously taken by the Prime Minister.
Sources in JUI-F informed that their party was having serious differences with the government on host of issues especially the extension of military courts, flaws in the implementation on National Action Plan, FATA reforms and other related issues.
These sources said that JUI-F chief was also annoyed over government's failure in fulfilling the commitment made with them at the time of joining the coalition government.
Overall political situation in the country was also discussed on the occasion.
Meanwhile, the Press release issued by the Ministry of Finance stated that in the meeting both sides had detailed discussion on the process of legislation in the Parliament.
There was also exchange of views between Dar and Maulana Fazlur Rehman on the electoral reforms.
JUI Chief lauded the efforts of Dar to carry out hectic electoral reforms process with sincerity of purpose and full dedication.
Both leaders agreed that the reforms would go a long way in improving electoral system in the country and invariably strengthen democratic norms.

Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, are not immune to the large rise in suicides and attempted suicides we hear about almost every day. Suicide rates in Wisconsin are up nearly 26 percent from 1999 to 2016, according to new data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, there is hope. Milwaukee County offers numerous services to citizens or loved ones who are thinking about suicide. The Milwaukee County Behavioral Health Division (BHD) connects individuals to the appropriate resources if they are facing a mental health crisis. One of BHD's resources is a 24/7 crisis line. A mental health professional will help assist and de-escalate any situation through the crisis line, which can be reached at 414-257-7222.
Dr. Sara Coleman, a clinical psychologist with BHD, said that one of the best things others can do for those who might be struggling with suicide is to “take someone seriously.” They said the Great Recession or the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks might be to blame for the increase of suicide rates.
“When someone brings up that topic it can often make people anxious,” said Coleman. “There's also a belief that if they talk about it, that they won't do it, but that's not true. When someone starts talking about it, that should be a lightbulb moment where you should say ‘I should take this seriously.'”
Dr. Coleman said that if someone is suicidal in the moment, it is best to call 911 right away. They also said that doing something as simple as locking up a gun in your home can be important as well, as “securing any means” for a suicide attempt can be an important step to saving someone's life.
Milwaukee also has two crisis resource centers, located at 5409 W. Villard St. and 2057 S. 14th St. These centers are designed to “provide assessment, stabilization, supportive, and recovery services,” according to their website. Milwaukee also offers a Crisis Assessment Response Team (CART) where a clinician and police officer respond to a situation where intervention may be needed.
In 2017 alone, “CART responded to more than 1,200 calls for service that led to more than 600 direct interactions. From those interactions, 89.6% of people were able to get connected to resources voluntarily, avoiding emergency detention or hospitalization,” according to the BHD. Almost all Milwaukee Police Officers are now trained in CIT Training as well, or Crisis Intervention Training, according to Dr. Coleman.
The BHD made it very clear that they will turn no one away, regarding financial status. Dr. Coleman often sees patients who have already attempted suicide. “All of my cases are success stories,” they said.
“Very few have gone on to try it again in the end. These thoughts are very often only a temporary thought.”
Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif has said Punjab Agriculture, Food and Drug Authority will prove to be a milestone in provision of high standard medicines and hygienic edible items to the masses.
They stated this while chairing a high level meeting in Lahore today to review the matters regarding establishment of Punjab Agriculture, Food and Drug Authority.
The Chief Minister said PAFDA will become functional during the current year.
The Proteas' team management have looked towards the future by appointing 23-year old batsman Aiden Markram to captain South Africa for the remainder of the ODI series against India.
They will lead the Proteas team in the remaining matches to take place in Centurion on Sunday and in Cape Town‚ Johannesburg‚ Port Elizabeth and again in Pretoria over the next two weeks.
Markram‚ who has only played two ODIs against Bangladesh and India‚ takes over from Faf du Plessis who has been ruled out for six weeks due to a finger injury they sustained in Durban on Thursday.
In explaining the decision‚ Cricket South Africa (CSA) convenor of selectors Linda Zondi said they went for Markram because they want to expand a pool of leaders in the team in accordance with their Vision 2019.
“Part of our plan is to make sure that we look at Vision 2019 where we want to develop young leaders and Aiden fits exactly in what we are trying to achieve‚” Zondi said.
“He is new to our setup but they have always been in our plans since they were the Under-19 captain right up to South Africa A.
“There will be pressure in terms of understanding their role and performing as a player‚ but we want to see if they can take that pressure.”
Markram‚ who is establishing themselves as opening partner to Dean Elgar in the Test side‚ said they would rely on advice from senior players like Hashim Amla‚ JP Duminy David Milller and Morne Morkel dealing with the inevitable pressure.
“It's a big honour‚ as a little boy you dream captaining your country‚” Markram said.
“Unfortunately Faf will not be playing and that is a huge blow for us.
“On Friday night I got the sense that the decision was leaning towards me to take the team forward in this series and I was officially told on Saturday morning.
“It is something you can't take for granted but I really enjoy captaining.”
Captaincy is about taking tough decisions and one of the key decisions facing Markram will be how to fill the void left by Du Plessis in the batting lineup‚ whether to give Khaya Zondo their ODI debut and whether to use spinner Tabraiz Shamsi.
“It will make sense for myself to go up to three where Faf usually plays because I have spent most of my career opening the batting‚ but from there onwards we are not sure yet‚” the new captain said.
“It is a temptation to use Tabraiz because has been good on the domestic scene and that's a discussion that will take place during the selection meeting. It is there and something to talk about for sure.”
Indian top order batsman Anjikya Rahane said the travelling team have put their impressive victory over South Africa on Thursday in Durban behind them and are looking ahead at this clash.
“We are confident and we want to start from zero because whatever happened in Durban is in the past and we live in the present‚” they said.
“Teams like South Africa‚ Australia and New Zealand have a good attack in world cricket and I enjoy facing the challenges from their fast bowlers.
“When you play in South Africa against this type of attack you know that you are up against it‚ and we are not taking them lightly because they will want to come back very strong in the second match.”
The rocky first few weeks of Donald Trump's presidency may have gone more smoothly with the help of a proofreader.
Even before they officially assumed the nation's highest office, President Trump was making iconic spelling blunders like their use of “unpresidented” in a tweet where they accused China of stealing a U.S. Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea. But that wasn't the end of misspellings that have been plaguing their White House their first month in office.
Within the past few days, a number of typos (that any college student should have caught) have been linked to the Trump Administration, making some further question the legitimacy of the office.
One recent #TrumpTypo that caught fire appeared in bright white font on Trump's official inauguration poster, which is marketed through the Library of Congress. The poster incorrectly used “to” instead of “too” in part of a quote by the president:
“No dream is too big, no challenge is to great.”
Apparently, correct spelling was too great a challenge.

Oops. The typo on Trump's official inauguration is "to great" https://t.co/9j5fXbsrl2 — USA TODAY (@USATODAY) February 13, 2017
The Library of Congress has since taken the poster down from their website and said in a statement Monday they will refund anyone who purchased the erroneous version of the poster.
“The Library regrets that its staff did not catch the error in the marketing materials for the poster, which were provided by the third-party vendor that created the product,” the statement says.
While the typo may not be caused by Trump directly, it comes right after a series of grammar mistakes that were directly caused by Trump's administration. In the last week, for example, a White House list of 78 terrorist attacks that had allegedly gone underreported in the media misspells numerous words such as “attaker” (instead of “attacker”) and “San Bernadino” (instead of “San Bernardino”), according to the Washington Post.
And then there was the Department of Education's Twitter misstep on Sunday, when they spelled W.E.B. Du Bois' name incorrectly, issuing an apology tweet 30 minutes later.
Education must not simply teach work – it must teach life. – W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA — US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017
And when you think it can't get worse — it does. In the apology tweet, the Department of Education made yet another spelling error.
The Department of Education just tweeted "our deepest apologizes for the earlier typo." Seriously. https://t.co/3louBmImKt pic.twitter.com/wuMkZ31pv4 — Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) February 12, 2017

The Department of Education has been in the public eye since the last week, as the Senate narrowly confirmed DeVos last Tuesday through a historic tie-breaker vote by Vice President Mike Pence. The confirmation hearings came amid numerous complaints about DeVos lacking qualifications for the position.
Can you spot the multiple typos here?

The USA TODAY review turned up at least five instances in which the text of an executive order sent to the Federal Registrar — the version that is legally valid and enforceable — does not match the corresponding text of the White House online version. According to the review, some discrepancies including minor grammar errors while other, more significantly, included “inaccurate or non-existent provisions of law.”
Some have taken to Twitter to reflect on what all these careless errors mean.

Whatever one's opinion, it's clear that while some minor grammatical errors may be trivial in a college essay, they can have a much bigger impact when committed by #POTUS, or in connection with the presidency. What do you think about the #TrumpTypos?

IN THE CLEAR: Nationals Federal Member for Cowper Luke Hartsuyker said they were eligible to sit in parliament after allowing their Dutch citizenship to lapse.
Labor calls on Hartsuyker to prove their eligibility as an MP
NATIONALS Federal Member for Cowper Luke Hartsuyker declared they are no longer a Dutch national and is eligible to sit in Federal Parliament.
"Under Dutch law you may be regarded a national until the age of 28," the Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister Mr Hartsuyker said.
"I was older than 28 when I got into parliament, I was 43."
Mr Hartsuyker said the Dutch Embassy in Canberra advised them they were no longer a Dutch National "weeks ago" after taking no action to renew their Dutch nationality.
According to the Government of the Netherlands, Dutch citizens with multiple nationalities who live outside of the Europeans Union for more than 10 years and don't apply for a Dutch passport can automatically lose their Dutch nationality.
Mr Hartsuyker said there was "no documentation" needed to allow their Dutch nationality to lapse.
They said they did not visit the Netherlands until they were 30.
In Mr Hartsuyker's first speech in parliament, they reflected on their Dutch heritage in a comment about the "egalitarian nature" of Australia on February 13, 2002.
"I am the son of a Dutch migrant who came to this country alone at the age of 17 in 1951 with £25 in their pocket, an old guitar and all their other possessions in a toolbox," they said.
"It is a story common to many who have succeeded through self-reliance and hard work.
"Half a century later, they are sitting with my mother, a fourth-generation Australian, in the gallery as I present this speech to the House.
"There are few countries around the world that would provide the same types of opportunities."

There have been a number of occasions during this season when Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask has left a few fans wondering, “Is they still our guy?”
I, admittedly, am one of those fans. As a die-hard Boston fan, I've watched as many Bruins games as possible this year. Whether it's Rask or fellow goalie Anton Khudobin in the net, the goaltending situation for the Bruins has felt somewhat like a roller coaster. For an outsider, this might not make much sense considering Boston is currently the third best team in the NHL at 45-17-8 with 98 points.
But if you watch the Bruins on a regular basis, then you've noticed that the biggest reason why they've been so successful this year is because of their energetic offense and their ability to score a lot of goals. It has not been because of lights-out goaltending. For instance, prior to Saturday's game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Bruins had allowed three or more goals in four consecutive games, and also in nine of their last 10.
On Saturday, it was a different story though. Against the No. 1 team in the Eastern Conference, the Bruins buckled down on defense to keep the Lightning in check, and Rask showed why fans should keep their faith in them by turning away 23 shots for a 3-0 win.
Heading into the Stanley Cup playoffs, which begin in less than a month, Rask is the guy that the Bruins and their fans are going to want to mind the net.
Don't Forget About the Rask Past
When a player is going through a rough stretch, it can be easy to dismiss the success they've had in the past. As a Bruins fan, I'm guilty of this, but I've forced myself to look back on everything Rask has done during their tenure with the Bruins.
During the 2009-10 season, the 22-year-old Rask surpassed Vezina Trophy winner Tim Thomas as Boston's starting goalie. They were the only goalie with a GAA of less than 2.00, as well as the only goalie with a save percentage of higher than .930. Having this success so early in their career all but confirmed that Rask was going to be the main goaltender in Boston for many years to come.
Even though Thomas returned to form and helped the Bruins win the 2011 Stanley Cup, it wasn't long before Rask reclaimed the starting spot from Thomas, and soon after led the Bruins back to the Stanley Cup Finals again in 2013. In that year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins — a four-game sweep — Rask faced 136 shots and only allowed two goals for a GAA of 0.50 and a save percentage of .985. One season later, Rask won the Vezina Trophy while the Bruins claimed the Presidents' Trophy.
In recent seasons, Rask has experienced a few dry spells here and there, which may have caused some fans to wonder if they have lost their “edge” (again, myself included). But he's always been more than capable of being a shutdown goalie that can lead a team deep into the playoffs. He's done it before, and they can do it again.
Prime Rask on Full Display
Watching the Bruins vanquish the Lightning on the road on Saturday was a great reminder of why this team is a contender with Rask minding the net. They made 23 saves for a 3-0 shutout to notch their 30th win of the year, increasing their record to 30-11-4, and becoming the first goaltender in Bruins history to record five 30-win seasons. That is no small accomplishment.
“Thirty wins is pretty good,” Rask said after the game. “I always try to get there, and fortunate enough to play on some good teams, and then you'll be able to get those wins.”
Fortunately for Rask, the 2017-18 Bruins are a very good team. They've proven that all year behind their young players who are hungry for a deep playoff run, and their relentless goal-scoring offense. But no competitive hockey team is complete without a confident goalie who also has the confidence of their teammates.
Rask is still that guy for the Bruins, and Saturday's game was a prime example of that.
SALT LAKE CITY—It isn't often that an operatic tenor faces a composer to ask him, “Are you happy with me growling the notes?” To which Jake Heggie reportedly replied to Stratford's Roger Honeywell, “You have to make the role your own.” And so they did last month in Salt Lake City, taking on the role premiered by another Canadian tenor, Ben Heppner, in Dallas back in 2010: Captain Ahab in Heggie's Moby-Dick. “You can't sing that character prettily,” Honeywell insists. “You have to see the torture in the man.” The idea that any composer, even one with as skilful a librettist as Gene Scheer, would try to turn Herman Melville's massive 700-plus page whale-hunting novel, with its tortured anti-hero, into an opera defies ready belief.

And yet, the opera has proven so stageworthy that Honeywell, the fourth tenor to wear Ahab's peg leg (“We normally sing on two legs,” they observe) can look forward to whale hunts with Pittsburgh Opera, Opera San Jose, Chicago Opera Theater and the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona over the next few seasons. Contemporary operas have seldom enjoyed such widespread exposure. But then Dead Man Walking, Heggie's career breakthrough opera, has now had a remarkable 60 productions (I even saw it staged in Dresden). Something is obviously changing. What is changing is the musical language used by many of today's composers, moving away from the aggressive dissonances of the recent past toward more singable, tonally rooted music.
The Grammys Awards are transitioning to online voting and have updated rules for its top category, album of the year.
The Recording Academy announced new changes Wednesday, including its official switch to online voting for its 13,000 members. Voting for the 2018 Grammy Awards will take place in the fall and will include songs and albums released between Oct. 1, 2016, and Sept. 30, 2017.
Bill Freimuth, the academy's senior vice president of awards, said the academy expects to attract younger voters and touring musicians who are away from home during voting season.
“It is something that has been long-desired, long-talked about and long-investigated,” they said of online voting, which comes a year after the Latin Grammys made the switch.
Freimuth said there were concerns about security issues, but added they have “done everything we can to make sure the integrity of the system will be preserved.”
Another major change is the addition of songwriters to the nominees for album of the year, which was previously reserved for artists, producers and engineers. However, all participants in the album, including featured artists, songwriters, producers and engineers, must now be credited with at least 33 percent or more playing time on the album to be eligible for nomination. Prior to the new rule, all participants on an album would earn a nomination for album of the year even if they worked on one song.
The album of the year rule change would mainly affect pop, rap and contemporary R&B albums where producers typically vary throughout the project, as opposed to country and rock albums, where fewer producers are present.
Beyonce's Lemonade, Drake's Views, and Justin Bieber's Purpose – all nominees this year for album of the year – each had at least 20 producers credited. Adele's 25, which won the top prize in February, had 11 producers. The fifth nominee was country singer Sturgill Simpson, who produced their album by himself.
“Does participation on a single track on a 12- or 15-track album really signify that they really worked on the album? When it was put that way most people were saying, ‘No, not really,'” Freimuth said.
If the new rule had been implemented at this year's show, Bruno Mars and Ryan Tedder wouldn't have earned Grammys for their production work on Adele's album, for example. Freimuth added that songwriters and producers who work on a big hit on an album could earn a nomination for record or song of the year for their song.
The new changes were approved last month by the Recording Academy's board of trustees. Other changes include nomination review committees added to the rap, contemporary instrumental and New Age genres. The committees serve as an additional layer of checks and balances, and for rap, could prevent wins like Macklemore & Ryan Lewis in 2014 over Kendrick Lamar, which were highly criticized. It could also allow rising acts to earn nominations over veteran performers like Eminem and Kanye West, who consistently earn nominations.
“We form these committees only when we hear from … those genre communities (when) they feel like something's wrong, or that our nominations could be better,” said Freimuth. “For rap, what they were finding was that ‘legacy' artists, almost no matter what they released, they would get a nomination because of their name recognition and fan base.”
The rock, R&B and country genres are other genres that have nomination review committees.
The Grammy Awards have 83 categories. Nominees will be announced Nov. 28, and the 60th awards show will take place at Madison Square Garden in New York on Jan. 28, 2018.
NYON, SWITZERLAND—Real Madrid versus Paris Saint-Germain. Cristiano Ronaldo versus Neymar. Historic achievement versus burning ambition. Two-time defending Champions League winner Madrid was drawn Monday to play the tournament's standout team in the last 16, made possible because the 12-time champions finished second in their group while PSG won its group. “They (PSG) are really very strong in every department of the field,” Madrid director Emilio Butragueno said. “But I have to underline, we are the holders and our players, they always rise to the occasion.” PSG bought Neymar from Barcelona for a record $262 million (U.S.) fee in the off-season with a specific aim of winning a first European title. Madrid won six European Cups before PSG was even formed in 1970. “As I always say, we must be ready to play any team and we will be ready,” PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said in a statement on the club's website.

Neymar scored in five straight wins as PSG finished ahead of Bayern Munich in its group, finishing with a competition record of 25 goals in the group stage. Ronaldo scored in all six of Madrid's matches to set another Champions League record. Barcelona, which leads the Spanish league unbeaten despite the loss of Neymar, was drawn to face Chelsea in a meeting of recent champions. The English club is one of the few opponents Lionel Messi has failed to score against.
Egypt, Sudan Vow to Cooperate as Ethiopia Builds Nile Dam (AP)

By Associated Press
CAIRO — Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has met their Egyptian counterpart in Cairo, as the two countries look to repair ties that were recently frayed over an upstream Nile dam being built by Ethiopia.
At a joint press conference Monday, al-Bashir and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed to cooperate in managing the effects of the dam, which Egypt fears will cut into its share of the river. The Nile provides virtually all of Egypt's freshwater, serving as a lifeline for the country's 100 million people.
Tensions had risen in recent months, when Sudan appeared to take Ethiopia's side in the dam negotiations and revived a longstanding border dispute with Egypt. Ethiopia has vowed to go ahead with the dam despite Egypt's concerns, saying it is vital for the east African country's development.

BEIJING, March 19 (APP):Pakistan Ambassador to China, Masood Khalid has received a special ‘Outstanding Contribution to International Cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative' award.
The event organized by China Home and Abroad News Press on its 17th anniversary was attended by the ambassadors as well as the cultural, press and business counsellors from Pakistan, Belarus, Philippines, Myanmar, Austria, Nepal and other 13 countries.
Sitting in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, on the lawn where Christ Church Cathedral erects its Nativity scene every year, is the holy family. But there's no manger, shepherds, wise men or angels; just a chain-link fence surrounding the couple and the newborn.
Inside the fence, Mary sits on a wooden block, cradling baby Jesus in their arms as Joseph stands next to them looking down.
Christ Church Cathedral, one of the oldest churches in Indianapolis, is protesting the detention of families under the Trump administration's “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting as many people as possible for crossing into the United States illegally. Justice Department lawyers said in a filing last week that families could be detained for longer than the 20-day limit required by a previous court settlement.
The Rev. Stephen Carlsen, the church's dean and rector, said the news prompted the church to create a display showing a “detained” holy family. Joseph and Mary were not any different from migrant families fleeing violence from their home countries, they said. The couple fled to Egypt after Herod ordered the execution of baby boys in Bethlehem, according to the Bible.
“People forget what that scene means,” Carlsen told The Washington Post. “That was a homeless couple who weren't welcome anywhere, who took refuge in the barn, and it was to that couple that the Christ child was born.”
“What we take away from these stories is the same thing we take away from our teachings and religious ethics,” Carlsen added. “The heart of God is always with those who are on the margins, who are vulnerable and have no voice.”
The Episcopal church, in a blue city in a blue county in the middle of red-state Indiana, is known for being politically active and has been vocal in its criticism of the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration.
“This issue isn't a new one for us,” Carlsen said. “We've been working pastorally and also raising our voices on behalf of families who have come to our country seeking safety and seeking a future for their children.”
Last weekend, the church joined the Families Belong Together rally outside the Indiana Statehouse to protest the separation of families. Hundreds of similar protests took place across the country. In 2014, the church was among a handful of religious organizations that married gay couples after the state's ban on same-sex marriage was ruled unconstitutional.
Christ Church Cathedral announced the display in an early-morning tweet Tuesday using the hashtags #EveryFamilyIsHoly and #CadaFamiliaEsSagrada.
“On our lawn tonight we placed The Holy Family . . . in #ICE detention,” the church tweeted.
The display is reminiscent of photos of migrants in large pens with chain-link walls at a detention center in Texas. Similar images circulated in the news media during the 2014 migrant crisis under the Obama administration.
Carlsen said they have spent some time standing on the sidewalk in front of the church to talk to people about the display. They said some people aren't able to see the parallel immediately.
“People have to connect the dots. That's what's so powerful about a religious icon,” they said. “Some people connect the dots and disagree. Other people connect the dots and I can see their heart soften.”
More than 2,500 children were sent to shelters and facilities across the country between May and June. In defending the family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited a Bible passage invoked by defenders of slavery. The passage, Romans 13, says that God has ordained the government for their purposes.
But Trump reversed course amid a public uproar that included condemnation from religious leaders, including Pope Francis. They signed an executive order that ended family separations and instructed the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together while in custody. The administration said about 500 children have since been reunited with their parents.
Carlsen said they do not know how long the display will be outside the church.
“How long is it needed?” they said. “I would love for it to be outdated and be taken down. That would be my greatest wish.”

MASON, OHIO—Wimbledon champion Roger Federer withdrew Monday from the Western & Southern Open, which they have won seven times, citing a back injury. Tournament officials announced Federer's withdrawal on the first full day of matches at the event in Cincinnati. The 19-time major champion said in a statement that they “tweaked” their back last week at the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where they lost Sunday to Alexander Zverev in the final.

Canadian Denis Shapovalov jumps in rankings after unexpected Rogers Cup run Svitolina tops Wozniacki for Rogers Cup crown The Swiss star, No. 3 in the ATP Tour rankings, becomes the fifth of the top six players to skip Cincinnati because of injuries. They join top-ranked Andy Murray, No. 4 Stan Wawrinka, fifth-ranked Novak Djokovic and sixth-ranked Marin Cilic, the defending champion. Only second-seeded Rafael Nadal, the tournament's top-seeded player, remains in the draw.
“It's just coincidence,” said Nadal, 31, pointing out that all of the missing players except Cilic are 30 or older. “We're not 20 years old any more. We're not playing all the weeks. It's part of our sport. I've been in their position lots of times. I've missed more events than the other players. It's part of the game. I wish them all a speedy recovery. We need them in the game. I hope they get back soon.” Federer's withdrawal means Nadal, who lost in the third round at Montreal, will return to No. 1 when new ATP rankings are released on Aug. 21. The Spaniard will be No. 1 for the first time since July 6, 2014. Nadal has spent 141 weeks as the men's No. 1 player since first ascending to the top spot after reaching the Western & Southern semifinals in 2008. “It's been tough to get back to No. 1,” they said. “I'm happy to have the chance to be in that position.”

Russia is committed to honoring its international obligations, including in relation to missiles, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, responding to reports it had violated a treaty with the United States by deploying a new ground-based missile.
"Russia has been and remains committed to its international commitments, including to the treaty in question," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a daily telephone briefing.
"Nobody has formally accused Russia of violating the treaty," they said.
On Tuesday, media reported, citing U.S. officials, that Russia had deployed a ground-launched cruise missile despite U.S. complaints that this violated an arms control treaty banning ground-based U.S. and Russian intermediate-range missiles.
U.S. President Donald Trump will outline their much-anticipated infrastructure plan in their State of the Union speech on Tuesday, but details will not be unveiled until mid-February, an administration official briefed on the plan said to Reuters.
The Trump administration's $200 billion infrastructure plan will leverage new federal money to try and boost overall investment over the next 10 years.
The Republican president disclosed last week the proposal “will actually probably end up being about $1.7 trillion.” That is up from the initial Trump promise that a mix of federal and local investment would result in at least $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.
A White House spokesperson declined to comment Monday on the timing of the infrastructure proposal. On Friday, White House official D.J. Gribbin confirmed in remarks to mayors the administration will not seek new revenue to pay for infrastructure, but rather seek to pay for it with spending cuts. They said a proposal was expected a week or two after the State of the Union.
The administration is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion in federal spending, which in turn would encourage a big jump in state, local and private financing to build and repair bridges, highways, waterworks and other infrastructure.
The proposal will also aim to streamline environmental reviews and it make it easier to build highways and other projects and allow for greater tolling on roadways.
Scott Slesinger, legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Congress Monday “the poor state of our infrastructure is not because of environmental reviews or permitting. Our problem is cash. The solution is the political will to appropriate the needed dollars.”
Reuters reported this month that the administration's plan involved $100 billion in cost-sharing payments for urban projects and $50 billion for rural projects, with the remaining $50 billion largely split among “transformative” projects such as high-speed trains, and funds for federal transportation lending projects.
A leaked document released last week, which an administration official confirmed was “largely accurate,” shows the administration plans to reduce federal cost-sharing for projects to no more than 20 percent of the costs from the traditional 80 percent share.
Democrats want the Trump administration to agree to significant new spending to pay for infrastructure upgrades and have called the smaller cost sharing proposal a non-starter.

More than 50 years ago I travelled to London's Whitehall Theatre to see the late Brian Rix starring in one of their ridiculously hilarious farces and now, thanks to The Play That Goes Wrong which opened in Milton Keynes last night, the memories of those crazy days came flooding back.
Just like those Brian Rix's Whitehall farces – incidentally the theatre was renamed the Trafalgar Studios back in 2004 – The Play That Goes Wrong is a clever over-the-top piece of comic theatre and it's no wonder that numerous West End and International awards have been bestowed upon it as it enters it's a third year.
The play features local drama group, The Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society, whose new production is an Agatha Christie-style murder-mystery called Murder at Haversham Manor.
Set in the late 1920s, the amateur group encounter catastrophe after catastrophe as things go hopelessly and hilariously wrong from the opening scenes – it's all reminiscent of dear old Lord Rix's productions of those 1950s/60s heydays.
Co-written by three members of the Mischief Theatre Company – Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer and Henry Shields – they've come up with every slapstick joke known to man along with every physical and crazy comedy routine without actually injuring one another. And it all adds up to plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, cracking timing and great fun for the audience and for the cast alike.
Before curtain up, a couple of cast members walk through the audience calling out as if looking for their dog Winston. After that, the entire amateur drama society members struggle with their lines, miss their cues while their props are either misplaced or just go missing.
However it would be unfair to retell any of the jokes or the plot lines as it could spoil it for those wishing to see the show which plays Milton Keynes Theatre until this Saturday.
What I can reveal is that the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society and its acting Director Chris is played by Jake Curran (who also doubles up as Police Inspector Carter) and who tries to keep their cool when everything around them seems to fall apart.
They have something of a John Cleese manner as a straight man in many of those old Monty Python sketches and while it's all totally over the top, I couldn't help feeling that Basil Fawlty had vacated Fawlty Towers for the evening and joined in.
Elena Valentine's Sandra (who plays Florence Colleymore) is looking for their moment of fame while their brother Thomas Colleymore – played by Kazeem Tosin Amore playing Robert … yes it's all very confusing! – delivers some cracking one liner, especially when he's propping up the collapsing scenery.
There's some fantastic self-conscious facial expressions towards the audience from Max (Bobby Hirston) who plays the clumsy Cecil Haversham and Arthur the Gardener. As a first timer on the boards he's clearly stage struck while their brother Charles Haversham (Steven Rostance as Jonathan) is the first to die… or does he?
Meanwhile Catherine Dryden's is a coy Annie who ends up in dispute as they play the same role as a defrocked Sandra, with both trying to outdo the other. Also worthy of mention is Benjamin McMahon as Dennis who excels as Haversham Manor's dopey butler Perkins, especially in the sequence when the main characters get themselves into a loop and repeat the same lines over and over again.
The Play That Goes Wrong delivers slapstick comedy in the cleverest way and it certainly left me grinning like a Cheshire cat. In fact the highest praise you can ever give a performance is with a standing ovation… and on this occasion it was richly deserved!
The Play That Goes Wrong remains at Milton Keynes Theatre until this Saturday (28 April) with shows at 7.30pm nightly and matinees on Wednesday and Saturday at 2.30pm. Tickets from the box office on 0844 871 7652 or online at www.atgtickets.co.uk/miltonkeynes
Google has been trying to expand its operations in China and has launched a dedicated artificial intelligence research hub in Beijing. Photo: Reuters
Beijing: Alphabet Inc's Google has launched a file managing tool in several Chinese app stores as it looks for fresh inroads into the world's biggest smartphone market, where most of the internet giant's top products remain banned.
The US firm on Thursday released a China-specific version of ‘Files Go', a storage management tool for smartphones, the second China-specific app it has released since its flagship services were banned.
The app, which has a small number of users compared to Google's flagship search and app store products, is also the first it has launched on third-party Chinese app stores including those hosted by Baidu Inc, Xiaomi Technologies Co Ltd and Huawei Culture Co Ltd.
China has represented a black hole on Google's global map since regulators began banning the company's products in 2010 when it refused to censor results in line with local laws.
Its search engine is banned in the Chinese market along with its app store, email and cloud storage services.
China's cyber regulators say restrictions on foreign media and internet platforms are designed to block influences that contravene stability and socialist ideas.
Google has been trying to expand its operations in China and has launched a dedicated artificial intelligence research hub in Beijing, but its return to providing consumer products has been slow amid tightening censorship regulations.
Google has, however, ramped up its China efforts recently. CEO Sundar Pichai has made several visits to the country and has spoken at two Chinese government forums since December.
Last year, Google released its ‘Google Translate' app in China. It is maintained by Google's local joint venture.
The ‘Files Go' app, which helps users free up storage space, has been developed by Google's Next Billion program that targets developing markets, including India and Indonesia, where there are a large number of people using low-end smartphones.
While Google's consumer services are largely blocked in China, its Android operating system is used widely by top smartphone vendors, including Xiaomi and Huawei phones.
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday freed one of the last remaining Crown Resorts Ltd executives jailed for illegally promoting gambling, as a protracted saga that forced the Australian casino operator to cancel global expansion plans and hurt profits nears an end.
Jason O'Connor, head of international VIP gambling with the casino giant, was released before 7 a.m., an official told media outside the detention centre in Shanghai.
The Australian was the most senior of 16 staff detained in October and jailed by a Shanghai court in June. Their 10-month sentence ran from the time of their first detention on Oct. 14 last year.
They were flying home following their release on Saturday, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in an emailed statement. They did not give a time for their arrival.
Crown executive chairperson John Alexander said in an emailed statement they were "very pleased" staff were being reunited with their families and expressed gratitude for the help provided by the Australian government and the company's legal team over the past few months.
The authorities released 10 employees, including Australian nationals Jerry Xuan and Jane Pan Dan, in July.
Crown, half-owned by billionaire James Packer, had been trying to attract wealthy Chinese to its casinos located outside China, where gambling is illegal, except for Macao.
But the case prompted Crown, the world's biggest listedcasino company outside China, to retreat from globalexpansion plans and sell off its Macao assets, and instead shiftits focus back home.
EXPRESS UK – BELINDA ROBINSON
The provocative move will anger US president Donald Trump who has repeatedly warned the rogue state that they will “totally destroy” the country if the US is threatened.
But the warnings appear to have fallen on deaf ears as the North gets set to test another nuclear missile.
The Russian lawmaker sent out the warning after they visited Pyongyang, according to RIA.
Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian Duma's international affairs committee, and two other Russian lawmakers visited Pyongyang on October 2 to 6, RIA reported.
Mr Morozov said: “They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States.
“As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future. And in general, their mood is rather belligerent.”
US officials have not yet responded to the claim.
TORONTO (Reuters) - The man accused of plowing a rental van into pedestrians on a crowded Toronto sidewalk, killing 10 people in Canada's deadliest mass killing in decades left a “cryptic message” on social media before their attack, police said on Tuesday.
Suspect Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in the incident, which had the hallmarks of deadly vehicle assaults by Islamic State supporters. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was no reason to suspect any national security connection.
One possible clue to their motive emerged on Tuesday as Facebook confirmed Minassian said in a post before the incident that referenced an “incel rebellion,” referring to a shorthand used in some online message boards for “involuntary celibacy.”
The post also voiced admiration for a man who killed six college students before taking their own life in California in 2014.
“The accused is alleged to have posted a cryptic message on Facebook minutes before” the attack, Graham Gibson, a Toronto police detective sergeant, told a news conference. The majority of the victims were women, ranging in age from their mid-20s to early 80s, Gibson said.
They declined to answer a question about whether anger against women motivated the attack, saying, “that's going to be part of our investigation.”
Facebook has since deleted Minassian's account, a representative said.
“There is absolutely no place on our platform for people who commit such horrendous acts,” they said in an email.
Minassian kept their shaved head down during a brief court appearance in Canada's largest city, speaking quietly with a defence lawyer and stating their name in a steady voice when asked to do so.
Trudeau called on all Canadians to stand united with Toronto as flowers and scrawled messages in multiple languages piled up at a makeshift memorial in the city's north end, an ethnically diverse neighbourhood of towering office buildings, shops, restaurants and homes.
“We cannot as Canadians choose to live in fear every single day as we go about our daily business,” Trudeau told reporters outside of parliament in Ottawa.
The prime minister said the incident had not changed the country's threat level or security preparations for a G7 summit in Quebec in June.
Minassian had briefly served in Canada's armed forces in late 2017 but asked to be voluntarily released after 16 days of training, defence ministry spokesperson Jessica Lamirande said.
The suspect's two-story red-brick home in a suburb north of Toronto was a crime scene Tuesday, taped off and surrounded by police vehicles. Officers went in and out of the house.

SOUTH KOREANS AMONG VICTIMS
Details about the dead began to emerge on Tuesday, with a South Korean foreign ministry representative saying that two of that country's citizens were killed and one injured in the attack. The representative spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.
A Jordanian citizen was also killed, said an official at the country's embassy in Ottawa.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp identified one of the victims as Anne Marie D'Amico, an employee of asset manager Invesco Canada. In a statement, Invesco confirmed that one of its employees had been killed but did not name them
It could be days before all the victims are publicly identified, said Ontario Chief Coroner Dirk Huyer said, adding that the extent of their injuries was making some identities difficult to determine.
“It ranges from scrapes and bruises to terrible injuries that I won't get into discussing here,” Gibson added.
The attack shook the usually peaceful streets of Toronto, which recorded 61 murders last year.
The drama started at lunchtime on a warm spring day, when the driver drove their vehicle into the crowds. The street was soon covered in blood, empty shoes and bodies.

Taylor Swift performs "Out of the Woods" at the 58th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California February 15, 2016.
DENVER (Reuters) - Pop star Taylor Swift on Friday won a preliminary round in a federal court trial stemming from their allegation that they were groped by a Colorado disc jockey, as the judge dismissed the DJ's rival claim accusing the singer of wrongfully getting them fired.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Martinez left intact Swift's assault and battery countersuit against David Mueller, who had asserted they were falsely accused by the recording star and ousted from their $150,000-a-year job at radio station KYGO-FM under pressure from them
The High School Esports League (HSEL) will be the first esports league to offer students a chance to compete in Fortnite in their Summer Open League title under a free agent system.
The HSEL is partnering with NRG eSports and The National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE). NRG eSports is a professional gaming organization backed by several well-known investors, including Shaquille O'Neal and Alex Rodriguez.
With that kind of financial backing from NRG eSports, the HSEL's Summer Open Title will award the winning team with two hours of playtime against Svennoss, the current top Fortnite player, according to fortnitetracker.com.
Although the real prize might come from the partnership with NACE.
NACE will be scouting the Summer Open, with 70 of their partnered college recruiters, for potential college recruitment and scholarship opportunities. With the new “free agent” system that HSEL has instituted for their Summer Open, high school students can partner up with friends from any high school in the U.S., opening these scholarship opportunities up to those who don't have an esports league at their high school.
Esports is now a multi-million dollar industry, expected to reach $905.6 million this year. Just last month, Ashland University in Ohio became the first college in the U.S. to offer scholarships to top “Fortnite” players. For those who aren't quite up to the rigors of becoming a competitive esports player, the industry is creating other new jobs, including esports doctors.
“Fortnite” is the current most-watched and most-streamed titleon streaming platform Twitch. The co-op survival game, released last year, saw a surge of popularity after the release of the free-to-play “Fortnite Battle Royale,” in which 100 players compete to be the last man standing. Earlier this week, publisher Epic Games announced that they will provide $100 million to tournament prize pools for the 2018-2019 season. Though the title is currently not recognized by professional esports leagues, Mason Mullenioux, CEO of HSEL, gave Variety their reasons why they believe that won't be the case for long.
“‘Fortnite' has the perfect mix to become an esport,” said Mullenioux, “It's easy and fun to pick up and play, hard to master, and keeps you wanting to play game after game. It's also no secret that Epic Games wants to make Fortnite a lasting esport.”
In addition to publisher backing, Mullenioux noted professional teams, such as NRG eSports, signing top “Fortnite” talent and the priming of high school and college talent for the game's future as an esport.
“It's happening right now,” Mullenioux stated. “The future will only be much bigger.”
Robby Muller, the Dutch director of photography of such striking '80s and '90s films as “Dancer in the Dark,” “Down by Law,” “Repo Man” and “Paris, Texas,” died July 4 in Amsterdam. They were 78 and according to Dutch publication Het Parool had been suffering from vascular dementia for several years.
Muller was known for their collaboration with filmmakers including Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch, Lars von Trier, Alex Cox and Barbet Schroeder, who created some of the most notable auteur films of the 1980s and 1990s.
As a European, they brought a memorable approach to portraying Los Angeles on film in William Friedkin's “To Live and Die in L.A.,” Schroeder's “Barfly” and Cox's “Repo Man.”
The last feature-length film they shot was Michael Winterbottom's 2002 “24 Hour Party People,” which vividly captured the Manchester music scene of the 1980s.
Born in Curacao in the Dutch Antilles, they studied at the Netherlands Film Academy. Wenders' 1970 “Summer in the City” was the first feature for both of them. They went on to serve as D.P. on Wenders' “Alice in the Cities,” “The American Friend,” “Kings of the Road,” “Until the End of the World” and 1984's “Paris, Texas,” which was hailed for its contrast of bleak desert scenes with garish views of life on the road.
Roger Ebert said of “Paris, Texas”: “The photography by Robby Muller contains the sense of a far horizon beyond every close shot.”
For Jarmusch, they shot “Down by Law” in what the Guardian called “moody and exquisite” black and white; they also shot the New York director's “Dead Man,” “Mystery Train” and “Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai.”
Of von Trier's “Breaking the Waves,” the Guardian said, “The superb cinematographer Robby Muller lit broad areas of space to facilitate freedom of movement on every location and set, and shot the action with handheld Super 35 mm cameras, lending rare visual dynamism to the CinemaScope screen.”
 They are survived by their partner Andrea Muller.
Aaron Donald sought to accomplish two things in 2017: They wanted to let the Los Angeles Rams know they were unhappy with their contract, and they wanted to show them how worthy they were of exorbitant compensation.
Shortly after Donald was named Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year on Saturday, the line of questioning naturally steered toward money.
"I'm just glad and blessed to have the opportunity to be holding this trophy," Donald said onstage at the NFL Honors ceremony in Minneapolis. "I've got a good team, got great agents that I know are going to handle the business side, and I trust those guys. All I can do is play football, put it on film. When it happens, it happens. But I've got a great team with me, so I'm going to let those guys handle it."
Donald was referring to their team of agents at CAA, but they could have easily been referring to their team of Rams.
Donald, who recorded 11 sacks and an NFL-leading 91 total pressures during the 2017 regular season, was far from the only member of the Rams honored Saturday. Todd Gurley was named AP Offensive Player of the Year after leading the NFL with 2,093 scrimmage yards and 19 touchdowns. And Sean McVay was named Coach of the Year after leading the Rams to an 11-5 record and a division title as a 31-year-old rookie head coach.
The pressure has turned up on the Rams to secure a long-term deal with Donald now that they are entering the final season of their rookie contract. Becoming the fifth defensive tackle to win AP Defensive Player of the Year since 1982, when the sack became an official stat, should only increase Donald's price further. But the task is easier in a different way: The Rams are set up for long-term success, in a major market and, eventually, an unrivaled stadium -- and Donald knows it.
The 26-year-old verbalized it again Saturday.
"It definitely was a fun year," Donald said. "It's a lot more fun when you're winning than losing. We definitely got a whole lot to build off, so that's the main thing. We've got a young, hungry coach with a lot of young, hungry players who are not satisfied, who know we should be playing right now. When you've got a bunch of guys like that on a team, with great coaches like Wade [Phillips] that's putting us in situations and putting us in places to have success, to help this team to win, sky's the limit."
"Sky's the limit" is not a phrase that would've been uttered about the Rams at this time last year. They were coming off a 4-12 showing in their highly anticipated return to L.A., their 10th consecutive losing season. They were a disaster with seemingly no direction, the type a fierce competitor like Donald wouldn't want ties to.
Now the Rams are the first team ever to have the AP Coach of the Year, AP Offensive Player of the Year and AP Defensive Player of the Year in the same season, a reminder of the rapid turnaround they underwent and the bright future that lies ahead.
Shortly after the season ended, with a loss to the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the playoffs, seventh-year general manager Les Snead expressed hope that the Rams' direction would ease contract negotiations with Donald's reps.
"He probably hates losing more than they like to win," Snead said then. "I know they have told people how much they respect Sean, the other coaches on the staff, the culture they're building. What we're building, he's a main part of, so I do think that definitely helps. But I do think, like most players, they also want to be compensated well as well. Both sides of the street."
Donald will likely command a contract that will make them the game's highest-paid defensive player, which means more than $70 million guaranteed (Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller got that) and more than $19.06 million annually (Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh makes that). The question is whether Donald, only the ninth player to win both Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, will start to command quarterback-level compensation.
Perhaps their agents' demands ease a bit.
Last year, while going back and forth, the Rams began to feel as though there wasn't much of a willingness to get something done from Donald's side unless the terms were jaw-dropping. It was too early in their rookie contract, and there was so much uncertainty surrounding the organization. But Donald now likes what the Rams are building, and they like their place in it.
"The season we had was a great season, but it ain't the best that we can do," Donald said Saturday. "I know we can do more, and I know the guys that I'm going on the field with, going to war with, know that, too."
Dog owners were known to SPCA and had been convicted on animal cruelty charges in 2015
16 dogs have been seized from a property in Quesnel. Pixabay photo
Sixteen dogs have been seized from a property in Quesnel by the BC SPCA.
A July 4 press release from the SPCA says the dogs were being kept in crates too small for their size in a poorly ventilated area, with little or no access to water and with feces/urine-soaked matting.
Karin and Catherine Adams have been named as the individuals keeping the dogs.
The BC SPCA says the pair are known to them, and were convicted of animal cruelty in 2015 after an SPCA investigation. Their sentencing included a 20-year ban on owning animals.
“It is extremely frustrating when we deal with repeat offenders, particularly those who breach the terms of their sentencing,” says Marcie Moriarty, chief prevention and enforcement officer for the BC SPCA.
“However, we are pleased that these dogs are now safe and are getting the attention and care they need.”
Moriarty adds that the SPCA was alerted to the situation by calls from concerned members of the public, and their investigation went on from there. “These individuals are very, very well known to us.”
They say that in the past, the Adams women have been caught with even more animals in their care. They pair has made concerted efforts to sell puppies in the past, and the BC SPCA has also previously found distressed horses in their care.
“They are notorious,” they say.
The dogs include breeds such as German shepherds, a Yorkshire terrier, a retriever, bull terriers, standard poodles, Portuguese water dogs, a Pekingese, corgi-border collie crosses and miniature pinschers.
The SPCA says they will be recommending new charges of animal cruelty, and the investigation continues.
The women will face charges for violating the conditions of their 2015 sentence.
The SPCA currently have the dogs in a number of different shelters throughout the Interior.
Moriarty says there is no evidence the dogs were stolen; however, if individuals' dogs have been stolen and they believe their dog may be one of the 16, they can bring their dogs' identification to the SPCA.

THE HAGUE - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday called for the arrest and surrender of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who is wanted on war crimes charges for allegedly suppressing opposition to the rule of their father, former Libya ruler Muammar Gaddafi.
On Sunday, Saif al-Islam's lawyer said their client had been released under an amnesty law passed by parliament from prison in the eastern Libyan town of Zintan, where they had been held since 2011.
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that their office was trying to verify Gaddafi's release. “I call on Libya and all other States, if in a position to do so, to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi to the ICC,” they said. Saif, whose whereabouts are not known, was last seen by an independent international observer in June 2014.
Saif, 44, is the most prominent of the late leader's children, and was touted by some as a reformist successor before the uprising six years ago in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed.
On Sunday, Saif's lawyer Zaidi told Reuters Saif could play an important part in national reconciliation efforts and they would not be turning themselves in to the ICC in The Hague.
Libya slid into turmoil after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A UN-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east.
A Tripoli court sentenced Saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. A statement posted by the attorney general's office in Tripoli on Sunday said they were still wanted under that conviction.
The ICC has said that trial did not meet international standards.
Zintan, about 145 km (90 miles) southwest of Tripoli, has its own divisions but has been broadly aligned with the government and armed forces based in eastern Libya.
DEAR ABBY >> Im in my late 20s and have a male companion who is 30-plus years older than I am. We were together for a while, then stopped so we could both try to find someone closer to our ages. Neither of us did, and we recently started seeing each other again.
Although we are good for each other and compatible in many ways, we are realistic that our relationship isnt long-term for major reasons. (I want children; hes happy with grandchildren. They want to travel after retirement; Im just starting my career.) We live for the moment and dont dwell too much on the future.
My problem is, this time Im really falling in love with him. Last time, I was reluctant to become emotional because I was afraid of getting hurt. But this time, I am all in. Can any good come of this? We meet each others relationship needs in the here and now, but is the end just heartbreak?
 Loving for the Moment
DEAR LOVING >> Its time for you to start compiling a list of the pros and cons of this romance. You and this man are at different stages of life and have very different goals. If you really want to have a family and a career, you will have to sacrifice something for it, and that something may be devoting much more time to this man. Sorry, but somethings gotta give.

DEAR ABBY >> Recently, my husband and I were walking down the sidewalk in our neighborhood and came across $160 in cash strewn all over the ground. We picked it up, and as we were doing so, our neighbor came outside. We knew their husband had just gotten home, and the money was near their car, so we asked if it might be his. We handed them the cash and told them to let us know.
Two weeks have gone by and no one has claimed it. Our neighbor still has it in their possession, and has mentioned in passing that we should spend it on toys for our kids or food/drinks at the next get-together.
While I think these are OK ideas, Im a little bitter because my husband and I found the money, and I feel we should be the ones who get to keep it if no one comes forward to claim it. I dont want to damage the friendship we have with our neighbors, but I feel like were losing a bit. What do you think?
 Finders Keepers
DEAR FINDERS KEEPERS >> I think that before handing over the money, you should have had your neighbor ask their husband if they had lost any and how much. Because you didnt do that and they have the cash, perhaps you should remind them that per their suggestion, you would LOVE to spend some of it on toys for your kids, and ask for some or all of it back. If shes a good neighbor, shell agree. If not, you will have learned an expensive lesson.

Detroit Lions Unveil New Uniforms
Click to enlarge
The Lions unveiled their new uniforms last night. They're not perfect, but they're definitely an upgrade. You can read my full assessment in in this ESPN piece, which was posted last night. If you want more, there's lots of good info and images here and a few dozen photos here.
Speaking of the Lions, check out this sleeve patch that they wore in 1951:
What is that? It's the Detroit sestercentennial (250th anniversary) logo. The Tigers wore it that season as well (and so did the Red Wings, although I've been unable to find a good photo of them doing so):
(My thanks to @dmoon for reminding me about the Lions' 1951 patch.)

JJBers via wikimedia Town Hall in Scotland, Conn., in March 2017
A lot of ink has been spilled — digital and otherwise — on the dismal state of Hartford's finances and the very real possibility of bankruptcy. Not so much about one of the state's smallest towns, which is “teetering on the edge of insolvency,” and, relative to its size, is facing challenges almost as daunting as the capital city's.
If you live in a small town as I do, the plight of tiny Scotland, Conn., gives you pause. The town has only about 1,700 residents and has a median family income of about $60,000, so it's hardly the poorest town in the state, though it's hardly Darien or Avon either.
But Scotland's financial situation is dire and it's made far worse by the state's own fiscal woes. Locked in a budget stalemate, the state's finances are essentially being run by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy by executive order, which is one of the factors wreaking havoc on Scotland's finances.
Scotland not only has small population but it has a tiny business community to match. The largest commercial taxpayer is Scotland Hardwoods, a lumber manufacturer. There is one farm left in the town, a general store, and several home businesses. The state owns almost 2,000 acres that is off the local property tax rolls.
Growth has been worse than sluggish. In the last six years, First Selectman Daniel Syme says there has been exactly one new home built and the grand list has actually declined because of a recent revaluation. Consequently, Scotland has a tax rate that more resembles a distressed city like Bridgeport. At almost 39, Scotland has one of the 10 highest mill rates in the state.
But Malloy's executive-order budget has eliminated the state's payments-in-lieu-of-taxes program that compensates towns for nontaxable property.
Education consumes 81 percent of Scotland's $5.9 million budget, which was approved by taxpayers last month. Under Malloy's executive order, Scotland's Education Cost Sharing grant will be cut by 70 percent — from $1.42 million to $426,900.
To make matters worse, Regional School District 11, which includes Scotland, Chaplin, and Hampton, is very expensive to run. Parish Hill school, a regional facility serving grades 7 to 12, has only 240 students, an enrollment that is absurdly small and steadily declining. There has been talk of dissolving the district.
The situation is dire, as Syme told The Mirror in an interview. The town has $463,000 in its reserve accounts, or about 9 percent of its annual operating budget. If the state's budget isn't resolved by April, the reserves will have to be spent.
There has even been talk in Scotland of dissolving the town itself, declaring bankruptcy, or raising taxes even higher. They all seem like acts of desperation. Syme is convinced taxpayers in town won't accept anything more than a two-mill increase. That leaves bankruptcy or exiting the stage.
But if Scotland were to dissolve itself, who would take them in? In some parts of the country, municipalities can disappear and become unincorporated parts of their counties. For obvious reasons, that's not an option in Connecticut. Indeed it's not an option anywhere in New England with the exception of Maine, where more than 400 settlements known as the unorganized territories have no municipal government and so services are provided by the state and the county.
Could Scotland become a part of one or both of the two towns with which it shares a regional school district? Why would Hampton and Chaplin want to take on that liability and level of risk? How about neighboring Windham, which is home to the distressed small city of Willimantic and a school system so troubled that it was taken over the the state in 2011?
The reality is that if the state budget isn't resolved in time for Scotland to pay its bills, then Scotland and towns like it will have no option other than raising taxes or declaring bankruptcy. If taxpayers refuse to pay more and Scotland goes broke, the town could be taken over by the state, which would surely have broad powers to inflict further injustices on Scotland taxpayers.
The bills are coming due all across the state. Unless Connecticut sees a significant increase in economic growth, state aid to municipalities will continue to be cut and local governments will have three options: bad, very bad, and preposterous.
Malloy's horrifying proposal to have local boards of education pick up one-third of the tab for teachers' pensions — once unthinkable — is just the beginning. If Connecticut doesn't open for business soon, there will be more Scotlands ... and more Hartfords. Come to think of it, maybe those places aren't so different.

When the nation is stuck within the spectrum of a limited idea; extremism is the outcome.
When discourse is forbidden and questioning your instructor is tantamount to committing a sin; radicalism is produced.
When the same ideas are reinforced again and again without anyone challenging them; expecting pluralism is only naïve.
Given the events of the recent past, it feels as if the terrorist ideology has won.
Mashal Khan was brutally murdered within an educational institute; an institute that has an ideology of non-violence attached with its name.
The student involved in the murder of Sabeen Khan was affiliated to Institute of Business Administration Karachi (IBA); one of the leading business institutes within the country.
Punjab University, a name so huge in itself, is now a hub of the extremist Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT).
Naureen Jabbar, a medical student, fleed their hometown to join the Jihad of Islamic State (IS) and was caught in Lahore planning to attack churches on Easter.
The arrest of Naureen does not ensure that there will not be more like them
How long will it take for our authorities to understand that the army may start operations to physically eliminate terrorists but the ideology has seeped so deep within that killing people is no more the solution? It took the federal government three days to issue a statement on the incident of Mashal Khan.
This is how afraid we are of the extremists living within us.
We blatantly criticised Malala Yousafzai for pointing out that the Taliban are up against our education system.
Even after the Army Public School (APS) incident, the federal government failed to use that time to come up with counter narratives within the system.
That was the time when the public was ready to absorb the fact that there is no room for the extremist ideology in Pakistan.
This was the time when they needed to realise how many lives we lost because of our support to radicalism.
When student councils are not allowed to operate within the university setup, when political debates are snubbed and only extremist voices reach the masses; there will be more Naureen Jabbars, ready to fight a made up war against their own people.
Condemnation is not what the masses need right now.
Under the table deals with extremist outfits need to stop.
People cannot live in fear in their own homeland.
Pakistan is not a home for terrorists.
University of Iowa president Bruce Harreld is following the lead of their counterpart at Iowa State University and calling for an increase of 7.08 percent in tuition for undergraduate resident students in each of the next 5 years.
The U-I was the last of the three state-supported schools to make their presentation to the Board of Regents Tuition Task Force.
“It is quite clear that our ability to compete is based on our ability to chase and complete our strategic plan,” Harreld says. “In order to implement that strategic plant — resources will be required — and tuition must be part of that equation.”
Harreld says salaries at the school have fallen behind their peers due to a cut in state funding and that is going to hurt the quality of the education offered. “It has resulted in significant talent loss. Over 90 per year over the last two years, 90 faculty members over the last two years have left us. It is a trend we must fix and we will,” Harreld says.
They say the tuition paid by in-state students is at the bottom of their peer group and near the bottom for students from out-of-state. The proposed increases would add $3,050 dollars onto the base tuition for an undergraduate student by the end of the five-year period.
Harreld says the U-I cannot continue forward with its plan to improve student success without the proper funding. “We are not at a point in which a choice will need to be made about what quality of an institution we want to be and how we will support the success of our students,” Harreld says. “Increasing tuition is never easy. It's not something that anyone ever wants to do — particularly because of the impact and the burden it places on the students and their families.”
Harreld says the proposed increases are based on state funding staying the same and the student population staying around its current level. “We certainly understand the challenges related to increasing tuition. That's why we are committed to maintaining our focus on first-generation students and increasing our need and merit-based student aid,” Harreld says. “A careful balance between an increase in tuition and appropriate scholarship will help mitigate the impact on those who might be struggling with the cost.”
Iowa State University interim president Ben Allen proposed a similar seven-percent increase in tuition last week. While the University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook said tuition would have to increase 6.7 percent, followed by increases of 5.2 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.1 percent if state support stayed the same.

Welcome to mid-August – the dogs days of summer. With the free agent frenzy gone and training camp still weeks away, it's a dull time in the world of hockey. And, without NHLers headed to the Olympics in February, we don't even have the luxury of arguing over which superstars have earned the right to don their nation's colors next year.
So, any speculation to pass the time must be pointed towards the approaching NHL season. Today we'll take a look at Brad Marchand, who, following a pair of breakout seasons for the Bruins, could be one of the most watched players in the Eastern Conference next season.
Last season, Marchand missed the 40-goal mark by one goal but remained one of the NHL's deadliest scorers with 85 points. Will the Little Ball of Hate hit the mark next season? Besides offensive production, what else does Marchand have to offer the Bruins? Let's take a look.
Marchand's Scoring Breakout
Heading into last season, all eyes were on Marchand, who was coming off of the strongest campaign of their career in 2015-16. That season, Marchand surpassed the 60-point plateau for the first time, notching 61 points in 77 regular season games.
With the spotlight on him, the left winger lived up to the hype (and then some) last season, scoring 39 goals while adding 46 assists for 85 points in 80 games, pushing them above the point-per-game mark for the first time.
Marchand's offensive success last season can be attributed to a number of things, but one number that particularly stands out is their shooting percentage. Two seasons ago, Marchand scored on 14.8% of their shots, good enough for 39th in the league. Last season, #63 brought their shooting percentage up to 17.3%, which tied them with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin for 10th best in the league.
What's more surprising, however, was their uptick in assists last season. The 29-year-old nearly doubled their assist total from the year prior last season, tallying 46 assists (as compared to the 24 from 2015-16). The most impressive part of this increase is that last year was a quieter year for Marchand's partner in crime, Patrice Bergeron. Marchand's trusty center got off to a very slow start last season, and, despite finding their game, finished the season with 21 goals – 11 fewer than the past season. Yet, Marchand still managed to boost their assist total dramatically.
Of course, Marchand can thank David Pastrnak (who, I might add, has yet to ink a new deal with the Bruins) for many of those assists. Pastrnak had a breakout season of their own last year, making up for Bergeron's slow start.
Next Season's Production
So, how will these numbers translate into next season?
Well, things look good for the Canadian winger heading into next season. For one, Marchand has established themselves as an elite scorer. Their talent alone will be enough to make them one of the league' deadliest top-line wingers.
On top of that, though, Marchand will have an entire season with Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy's system, which was noticeably more aggressive than ex-head coach Claude Julien's. If next season's style looks anything like we saw from Cassidy last season, then the Bruins will be a more offensively-minded team than in year's past, which should be good news for the winger.
And, if Cassidy decides he'd like to keep Pastrnak on the opposite wing, then Marchand will have another dangerous scorer coming off of a breakout season to work with.
For these reasons, I expect Marchand to flirt with the 40-goal mark next season. And, if Pastrnak produces at a similar rate as last season, and Bergeron finds a bit more consistency in their production, it wouldn't be outrageous to think Marchand could land in the upper 80's as far as point go.
Leadership
Of course, hockey is about more than scoring goals. In the past, Marchand has made it clear that they want to be a leader in the Bruins dressing room. They can do that a number of ways.
For one, Marchand can continue to improve their defensive game, which has gotten noticeably better over the past few seasons.
With one of the greatest defensive forwards in NHL history alongside him, you'd hope Marchand could mold themselves into a top-tier two-way forward, and he's been doing just that. In fact, last season, Marchand finished 12th in Selke Trophy voting (given to the league's top defensive forward). If Marchand wants to lead, they need to continue playing a big role on both ends of the ice.
Finally, we must address the elephant in the room: discipline. Over the course of Marchand's career, the winger has had issues playing clean hockey. The constant chip on their shoulder is part of what makes them a great player, but he's had trouble remaining on the correct side of the line in the past. In fact, their suspension at the end of last season is probably what kept them from reaching 40 goals.
Here it is, plain and clear: Marchand needs to move past the dirty play. Especially with their production now, Marchand is too valuable to the Bruins to be missing games for undisciplined play.
The good news is that Marchand's penalty numbers have been on the decline. Despite logging a considerably larger amount of ice time in each of the past three seasons, Marchand's penalty numbers have decreased (95 PIMs in 2014-15, 90 in 2015-16, 81 in 2016-17). The Bruins need Marchand on the ice as much as possible. And, as a member of Boston's penalty-killing unit, losing them to the sin bin does extra damage.
But, until Marchand can prove he's past their antics, it'll be tough to consider them a true leader, despite what their stats might say.
All in all, though, Marchand is in the position to become a leader for the Bruins. If they can keep their cool on the ice, and continue to produce at an elite level, then Marchand could finally fill the shoes that have been waiting for him.

PanARMENIAN.Net - A statuette which Greek archaeologists are calling a "7,000-year-old enigma" has gone on show in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, BBC News reports.
The bird-like object was carved from granite - without the benefit of metal tools, as it dates from the Final Neolithic period.
The 36cm (14in) statuette has a pointed nose, round belly and cylindrical legs. But it has mystified archaeologists, who do not know exactly what it is or where it came from.
The museum says the figure is asexual, with no sign of breasts or genitals.
But it says it is difficult to say whether that is a result of the challenge of carving granite without metal tools, or whether it was deliberate and could tell us something about the place of gender in Neolithic society.
The piece is on display until 26 March as part of the Unseen Museum display, a temporary exhibition of some 200,000 antiquities held in the museum vaults and not on permanent show.
Student societies sent unsolicited packages containing everything from electronics to sex toys
Some of the items that have mysteriously been sent to Camosun College Students Society in recent weeks. (Photo submitted)
A pair of Victoria student societies are on the receiving end of what would appear to be an expensive practical joke.
Student societies at the University of Victoria and Camosun College have been receiving mysterious parcels in recent weeks, containing everything from electronic items to sex toys.
“I wouldn't say anything's worth over $50 at this point, but it's pretty substantial,” said Michael Glover, Camosun Student Society services co-ordinator. “We got a turntable that plugs into USB, but none of us have any records.”
They said they've probably received 30 or 40 items in all over the past three months or so, all coming in Amazon packaging.
“We've talked to Amazon to try and find out what's going on and they're as perplexed as we are,” said Glover.
Pierre-Paul Angelblazer, UVic Student Society's interim director of outreach and university relations, said they have also been receiving numerous packages for the past few weeks.
“They're generally fairly valuable things,” they said, adding the first packages were donated to the campus food bank.
“We're continuing to get the packages but we're just turning them away and having them shipped back to Amazon. We're not opening the boxes anymore.”
Glover says Victoria schools aren't alone in receiving the mysterious packages, as he's heard of schools around B.C. and across the country who have been receiving them.
They said the student society hasn't decided what to do with all of the merchandise that includes a dash cam, a pair of HDTV antennas, fishing tackle and sex toys.
“We've got about $1,000 worth of merchandise here. If they're sending them to 100 student unions, that's $100,000 [not including the shipping],” they said. “Amazon is winning, someone is winning, but what all this junk is for … I have no idea. We'll go fishing later? Some lucky student will win a vibrator?”
Glover said the latest shipment arrived on Thursday, and the student society is just waiting for the issue to resolve itself.
“For us it's kind of neat – it's like ‘Oh, what did we get today?' And if you need an HDTV antenna in black or white, we're your guy.”
The romance between venture capitalists and dating startups appears to have hit a rocky patch.
VC investment in the space declined over the past year, with smaller average rounds and fewer funded companies, according to Crunchbase company profile data. In particular, U.S.-based startups saw meager funding, with less than $7 million invested in early-stage prospects that described themselves as dating companies.
Globally, disclosed venture, seed and growth funding for self-described dating companies totaled around $47 million for the past 12 months. (The Largest fundings are highlighted in the table below.)
Full interactive list here.
Funding for the past year is down from $280 million invested during the prior 12 months. (Though to be fair,the lion's share of that, $240 million, went to China-based dating app Baihe, a decade-old category leader.)
While recent numbers look low, it should be noted that VCs and dating startups never had a particularly successful relationship history. Often they're strategically mismatched. VCs look for a loyal, active, long-term user base, and dating apps tend to attract periodic, short-term users. Monetization is also a challenge, as paid apps have to compete with free ones. There are also few deep-pocketed acquirers with interest in the space.
Moreover, venture capitalists haven't made a lot of money from dating. The most successful US-launched dating app in recent years, Tinder, was incubated by Internet publishing giant IAC in 2012 and didn't rely on VC funding. The sole large U.S. public company in the space, Match Group, is also an IAC spin-out.
Venture investors had hoped mobile dating app Zoosk would deliver a big IPO a couple years ago, but it fizzled. The San Francisco company, which had raised more than $60 million in venture funding, pulled its planned public offering more than a year ago, citing unfavorable market conditions. It hasn't closed a round since.
For the companies that did get funded in the past couple of years, there are some common attributes that shed light on what investors want in a dating startup.
Most of all, it helps to be based in China. Over the past two years, the largest funding rounds by far for dating startups have gone to Chinese companies. The largest funding for the past year, $32 million, went to Tantan, a mobile dating app modeled on Tinder. Blued, an app for gay users modeled on Grindr, raised a Series C round of undisclosed size at a reported $300 million valuation.
Investors also seemed drawn to startups offering tools to narrow down and simplify dating options. In this camp is CoffeeMeetsBagel, which matches women with a limited number of men who have expressed interest in them. It has raised $11 million to date. Three Day Rule, which provides subscribers with a personal matchmaker, was one of few U.S. dating companies to score Series A funding last year, bringing in $1.2 million. Zurich-based Once, which pairs subscribers with one handpicked match per day, raised $5.6 million.
Perhaps if Tinder's parent company Match can prove that dating apps can drive long-term growth in revenue per user, domestic investors will take more interest in the sector. For now, this Valentine's day looks like a canceled date between the local venture community and the entrepreneurs who think that everyone has a shot at love.

TAMPA-Screening for colon cancer should begin earlier, at age 45 instead of 50, due to an uptick in colorectal tumors among younger people, the American Cancer Society said on Wednesday.
The new guidelines came after research showed a 51 percent increase in colorectal cancer among people under 50 since 1994, and an accompanying rise in death rates.
“When we began this guideline update, we were initially focused on whether screening should begin earlier in racial subgroups with higher colorectal cancer incidence, which some organizations already recommend,” said Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society.
Groups known to suffer disproportionately high rates of colon cancer include African-Americans, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.
“But as we saw data pointing to a persistent trend of increasing colorectal cancer incidence in younger adults, including American Cancer Society research that indicated this effect would carry forward with increasing age, we decided to reevaluate the age to initiate screening in all US adults.”
The new guidelines do not specify which kind of test people should get, but includes options such as a traditional colonoscopy - which should be done every 10 years - or high-sensitivity stool analysis which depending on the type, could be done every year to every three years.
Regular screening should continue until age 75, and “clinicians should discourage individuals over 85 from continuing colorectal cancer screening,” because the risk of complications outweighs the benefits at that age, said the report.
Experts say it is unclear why colon cancer rates are on the rise in younger people.
Research shows that adults born around 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer than adults born around 1950, who have the lowest risk, said the report in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.
Meanwhile, colon cancer rates in people older than 55 are declining, largely due to screening and removal of precancerous polyps.
According to Elena Ivanina, a gastroenterologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, the 51 percent increase in colorectal cancer among those under age 50 since 1994 is an “alarming” trend.
“The reason for the increase is currently not known but possibly associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyles, heavy alcohol use and chronic inflammatory conditions, which are all on the rise,” said Ivanina, who was not involved in crafting the guidelines.
They applauded the move toward earlier screening, saying it “will benefit the general public.”
Another widely respected medical group which issues screening recommendations, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), decided not to recommended in 2016 that colon cancer screening start at 45, saying any additional benefit would be “modest.”
The American Cancer Society urged people to talk with their doctors about which kind of screening to pursue, based on risk factors like family history, diet, alcohol consumption and exercise patterns.
“I would say an actual colonoscopy would be the best for multiple reasons,” David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at Northwell Health in New York, told AFP.
“It is the only one of those tests that actually prevents cancer. It allows you to find polyps before they become cancer.”
Shoppers walk past the entrance to the Lemon Grove shopping mall in Sydney, Australia, August 11, 2017, site of a shopfront company at the heart of one of Australia's biggest money laundering scandals.
SYDNEY (Reuters) - In a run-down mall in one of Sydney's biggest Chinese neighborhoods in 2015, 29-year-old Jizhang Lu showed up at the top-floor offices of a meat export company carrying a carrier bag stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
According to police documents filed in court and reviewed by Reuters, Lu said they made the trip to the shopfront of CC&B International Pty Ltd eight times over three weeks. Each time a CC&B employee would hand them a receipt showing a different company had bought tens of thousands of kilograms of meat.
The cash - as much as A$530,200 ($416,840) at a time - was then deposited at a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (CBA.AX) branch, according to the police statement of facts agreed by Lu.
But the apparent purchases were fake, and last year Lu was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to helping launder A$3.2 million of what police allege were proceeds from an unidentified international drug syndicate.
The court records reviewed by Reuters did not name Lu's lawyer. Lu could not immediately be contacted directly because they were in custody.
The police case against Lu is now one of several being cited by financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC in its statement of claim against CBA, the largest civil court action of its kind in Australian corporate history.
AUSTRAC has accused CBA of "serious and systemic" breaches of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules, alleging the country's second biggest mortgage lender failed to detect suspicious transactions nearly 54,000 times. It faces fines potentially amounting to billions of dollars.
CBA has said it will fight the AUSTRAC lawsuit, saying it would never deliberately undertake action that enables any form of crime. CBA said a coding error with new automated teller machines was behind most of the breaches but that it recognized there were "other serious allegations" in AUSTRAC's claim were unrelated to that software problem. It declined to comment specifically about the police case against Lu.
PROCEEDS OF CRIME
AUSTRAC's lawsuit against CBA asserts that, in total, A$17.7 million was deposited at the bank from February to August 2015 on behalf of a company identified in the earlier criminal case as CC&B.
"These funds were the proceeds of a drug importation syndicate and were proceeds of crime, within the meaning of the Criminal Code Act," AUSTRAC's statement of claim says, referring to CC&B only as Company 1.
Lu was identified in AUSTRAC's statement of claim against CBA, which also specified the time and length of Lu's sentence. A subsequent Reuters search of the criminal case against Lu produced the police "facts sheet" which provided further detail of their operation, including the name of CC&B.
The records of Lu's criminal case, provided to Reuters by a communications officer for the court which convicted Lu, showed that they pleaded guilty.
A call to the phone number listed on CC&B's website went unanswered. A Reuters visit to the address where Lu said they dropped off bags of money, at Lemon Grove shopping center, showed no sign of CC&B - other than a mention in an old store guide for shoppers.
Calls over two days to Lemon Grove also went unanswered.
Australian company filings showed CC&B's corporate address as "Sunnyside Accountants". A woman who answered the phone at that firm said CC&B was a former client but that they could give no further information because the organizations had parted ways. Sunnyside hasn't been named in AUSTRAC's suit.
"CAN YOU HELP?"
Lu, a Chinese national on a business visa, described themselves as a "net engineer", according to the police document filed in court. They had no involvement in the meat export industry and earned 60,000 yuan ($9,000) a year in their home country, they told police.
Lu said they met another Chinese man while grocery shopping in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood, where CC&B was based.
"After some chatting, they say, 'can you help me do this please?'," Lu told police, according to the document.
Lu agreed to help "because the man asked him", the police statement said, without elaborating.
They told police they didn't understand the receipts because they were written in English.
Australia's Joint Organised Crime Group charged two CC&B employees with dealing in criminal proceeds about the same time as Lu, in August 2015.
The Australian Federal Police could not immediately provide an update on the two CC&B employees identified as being charged.
The police statement said a third CC&B person, company director Ka Chun Leung, was a "potential co-accused" but has left the country. Efforts by Reuters to contact Ka were unsuccessful.

Woody Allen‘s daughter Bechet Dumaine Allen is shutting down accusations against their father.
The 19-year-old daughter of Allen and wife Soon-Yi Previn spoke out after Moses Farrow, whom Bechet referred to as their uncle, defended the filmmaker in an essay last week. In their piece, Moses alleged that their estranged sister, Dylan Farrow, lied about being molested by Allen as a child. Moses charged that their mother, Mia Farrow, was mentally and physically abusive to them and their siblings.
Bechet, who has largely avoided the spotlight, said they felt compelled to publicly take their father's side too. While they didn't mention Dylan by name, they did share Moses's piece.
“I never wanted to involve myself in the social media debates involving my father, but there comes a point when I realize that I can either continue pretending that none of this is going on, or stand up for him,” Bechet wrote on Facebook. “He has been nothing but supportive and loving, and now it is my turn to support him.”
They added, “I want to thank [Moses] for sharing their personal experiences so that people may begin to learn the truth about our family.”
Allen and Mia Farrow dated for more than a decade before they split in 1992, when they discovered that they were having an affair with their adopted adult daughter Soon-Yi Previn. During their custody fight over minors Moses, Dylan, and Ronan (then known as Satchel), Mia accused Woody of molesting Dylan. While the state prosecutor said there was probable cause for a trial, they said they didn't want to put Dylan through the process. However, an investigation by Yale-New Haven Hospital found no evidence that sexual abuse had taken place. Woody has always maintained their innocence.
Other family members have taken sides too. Journalist Ronan Farrow, for instance, has long protected their sister. They did it again after Moses's latest words on the subject.

Ruralco's shares are in a trading halt after the agribusiness announced it will raise up to $65 million to pay for about $60.8m in new water businesses and farm services acquisitions.
The company is buying Irrigation Tasmania for $19.9m, Mildura Irrigation Centre in Victoria, and River Rain Irrigation in Renmark, South Australia.
The new water equipment and advisory services additions to Ruralco's stable follow deals recently locked in for Riverland Irrigation in SA and Hunter Irrigation in NSW.
The company's farm merchandise retail division will expand with the purchase of NSW Central Tablelands Combined Rural Traders (CRT) business, Sid Newham Rural Supplies, in Bathurst.
Ruralco also recently announced it was buying Great Northern Rural Services in Western Australia and last week received Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's approval for a $16m take over TP Jones' rural merchandise stores in Tasmania.
Its CRT wholesale business is already a supplier to the CRT member stores being acquired.
Managing director, Travis Dillon, said by buying existing independent CRT members Ruralco earnings from each geography would grow from purely wholesale revenue to a vertical margin encompassing wholesale and retail.
“We've identified specific geographic gaps in our rural services footprint and aligned growth initiatives to fill these,” Mr Dillon said.
“Investment in water business has potential to reduce the cyclical impact of rainfall and drought events on earnings, allowing Ruralco to capture a greater share of wallet in a higher margin category.
“It represents a significant competitive advantage between us and our peers.
“We're pleased to have secured a portfolio of high quality businesses aligned with our future farming strategy on attractive acquisition metrics.
Chairman, Rick Lee, said the management team's acquisitions made a strategic fit with Ruralco's core business and they were “confident they will deliver value”.
Ruralco shares went into a trading halt on Wednesday morning as brokers went about finding support for the offer, which will also help pay for a 50pc stake in the Ausure Consolidated Brokers insurance business.
The company is seeking to raise $30m via an institutional share placement at $2.66 a share and another $35m in a one-for-six accelerated entitlement offer also priced at $2.66/share.
The offer is at a 11.5 per cent discount to the five day volume weighted average price of Ruralco shares on the Australian Securities Exchange, which last traded at $3 a share.
Shares are scheduled to resume trading on Friday.
More than £1 million has been raised for people affected by the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower.
Companies, individuals and charities sprang into action to help those in need of food, water, clothes and shelter after the inferno in north Kensington.
Three appeals have raised a seven-figure sum in just over 24 hours since the blaze which killed a dozen people and left scores more injured.
An appeal on JustGiving launched by Karolina Hanusova raised £286,437 while another set up by Hayley Yearwood has generated £431,910.
The London Evening Standard launched an appeal on a dedicated website dispossessedfund.org.uk, raising £282,939 as of 6am on Thursday.
The three appeals had more than 30,000 supporters between them, with supporters leaving messages including "My heart goes out to all those that had to gone through this" and "A terrible tragedy. My heart cries for all those lives lost".
David Holdsworth, chief operating officer at the Charity Commission, has urged people to give to registered causes.
They said: "We are saddened to hear of the tragic events in west London.
"There are many registered charities on the ground doing what they do best to assist those who have been affected.
"We are urging members of the public that wish to make donations to check that they give to a registered charity in order to best support those affected, and also importantly to check with those charities what support they need - whether that is money, time or other essential supplies."
Rest centres at the Westway Sports Centre in Crowthorne Road, St Clement Church, Treadgold Street and the Rugby Portobello Trust in Walmer Road, cared for people overnight.
Local football clubs Queens Park Rangers (QPR) and Fulham rushed to support those left homeless by the blaze.
QPR said it had opened its doors and facilities to those affected by the fire, but also said it could not accept any more donations, while Fulham also helped with the collection drive.
A number of individuals also reached out via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to offer accommodation and transport help to those affected.
One woman, named Giselle, tweeted: "Just called (Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea) @RBKC and left my details. They are looking for emergency housing. I have offered my place. Do the same if you can #Grenfell"
Instagram user co._lams posted an image reading: "Any residents of Grenfell Tower or Lancaster West Estate who need a local place to stay DM me."
Community response from all faiths 'has been phenomenal'
Community centres have been overwhelmed with donations as volunteers and neighbours pulled together after the Grenfell Tower fire.
Churches, mosques and sports centres have opened their doors to help victims of the tragedy.
Many have been flooded with so much food, clothing and other supplies that they were turning new donations away.
Wisps of smoke could still be seen escaping from the tower block on Thursday morning as desperate residents tried to track down missing loved ones.
Missing persons posters were taped up in doorways, along with offers of help, including from celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who offered free food at one of their nearby restaurants.
Satta Padham, of the Sikh Welfare and Awareness Team, said: "There was a lot of chaos yesterday, people were missing, a lot of people slept on floors and people brought supplies - food, clothing and essentials that they could grab on the way.
"What I remember was the smell of burning - it gets you straight in the back of the throat.
"There were a lot of people trying to help from the local area, they all knew somebody in there.
"These are real people that have lost family and lost their homes - 150 families were in the building, a lot of children and women are still missing.
"But there has been a great solidarity between people in the community."
Dozens of families spent the night in Westway Sports Centre, where the relief effort is being co-ordinated.
Harris Iqbal, of Penny Appeal, is helping at the leisure centre.
They said: "Over the course of the day hundreds and hundreds of people came through the doors yesterday.
"The last 24 hours have been very distressing and upsetting for everyone - the families affected and also their friends and loved ones.
"There are a number of people looking for loved ones who are missing, many have lost loved ones and are grieving.
"Others have lost their home and are extremely, extremely upset."
They added: "The community response has been phenomenal - all faith groups, mosques, churches and gurdwaras have opened their doors, charity organisations and everyone has collaborated in a way I've never seen in London before."
Peter Boulton, 61, spent the night in Westway Sports Centre with around 30 others after being evacuated from Treadgold House in the early hours of Wednesday.
"We were all evacuated at about 2.30am," they said. "I just sat on the pavement yesterday - I didn't know where anyone went.
"It was only at 4pm that I went to a church and found the centre - it was chaos.
"Hopefully we will be allowed back in today but until the engineer gets in there no one knows."
Mr Boulton, who has lived in the block for 15 years, added: "They spent such a lot of money and tarted up Grenfell but it seemed to be plastic and seemed to be flammable.
"I've never seen fire go up so quickly in my life. Within 20 minutes people from the 10th floor upwards didn't have a hope."
The Detroit Tigers have had their ups and downs in three-plus seasons under Brad Ausmus, but the first couple weeks of April have never been much of a problem.
The Tigers improved to 8-4 with a win at Cleveland on Sunday and took two of three in that series with the Indians. Its Detroits fourth straight strong start to the season since Ausmus took over as manager.
In 2014, their first season at the helm, the Tigers raced out to a 27-12 mark en route to an AL Central title. The following year, they started 11-2, although that season eventually fell apart and Detroit finished last.
In 2016, the Tigers started 7-3 and were in contention for a postseason spot until the very end. They ultimately fell short of a wild card.

Ausmus recently downplayed the trend.
I dont really care how we start, to be honest with you, they said. I just care what our record is when were finished.
The Tigers still have their issues. The bullpen has already been a problem, and their run differential is at minus-9. But Detroit cant worry too much about how its victories are coming. Even at this early stage, these wins are important, considering how uncertain the future is for this roster.
Detroit has made it clear it will need to cut payroll soon. J.D. Martinez and Francisco Rodriguez can become free agents after this season, and the Tigers have a team option on Ian Kinsler. If this team had started poorly, there might already be speculation about key players being traded at the deadline.
Instead, Detroit is in first place, and as long as thats the case, the Tigers can remain in win-now mode. The most encouraging sign for Detroit has been the performance of young left-handers Daniel Norris and Matthew Boyd, who have combined to go 3-1 with a 3.04 ERA in five starts.
Here are a few other developments from around baseball:
DIGGING A HOLE
While Detroits postseason hopes are rising a bit, the Toronto Blue Jays have baseballs the worst record at 2-10. Its still far too early for any panic in Toronto, but there were some similarities between the Blue Jays and Tigers coming into the season. The core of Torontos lineup includes 34-year-old Russell Martin, 32-year-old Troy Tulowitzki and 36-year-old Jose Bautista, so time may be running out for this group, especially if things dont go well this year.
With slugger Josh Donaldson and right-hander Aaron Sanchez on the disabled list, the Blue Jays could be in trouble if this slide lasts much longer.
NAME GAME
Abbott & Costello could have had some fun with the Chicago White Sox on Friday night.
The White Sox fielded a lineup of Avisail Garcia in right field, Leury Garcia in center field and Willy Garcia in left field for their game against Minnesota. It was the first time in major league history that a team started three outfielders with the same last name.
The Garcias, who are not related, went 4 for 10 with two doubles and a walk.
HIGHLIGHT
Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock raced back to the warning track to take an extra-base hit away from Corey Seager on Sunday, then smacked into the wall at Dodger Stadium and fell onto their back, holding onto the ball the whole time. The padded wall was actually shaking a bit after the impact.
LINE OF THE WEEK
Yoenis Cespedes, Mets, hit three home runs in the first five innings of New Yorks 14-4 win over Philadelphia on Tuesday night. Cespedes later added a double for good measure.
The Bond market traded on a bullish note, with yields trending lower by c.20bps d/d, driven by local client demand especially on the short and medium tenured buckets.
The market witnessed the most demand around the 7-year tenor (2024s/2025s) which contracted by c.25bps, down to c.13.20% in last trades.
We expect a slight ease in the bullish sentiments as demand from Wednesday's bond maturity inflows thin out.
Meanwhile, Treasury bills market traded on a slightly bullish note, with demand skewed to the shorter end of the curve, as system liquidity remained significantly buoyant following inflows from N300bn bond maturity.
TheSovereigns bond lost some ground gained in previous sessions, as investors sold off slightly especially on the longer end the curve.
The Nigeria Corps were also a tad lower, except for marginal gains recorded on the FBNNLs, ECOTRA 21s and UBANNL 22s.

Washington
Houston's James Harden scored a career-high 53 points, Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook achieved a first-half triple double and LeBron James sparked an injury-hit Cleveland squad in triumphant NBA efforts Saturday.
Westbrook, the NBA's top scorer with 31.3 points a game, needed only 19 minutes to reach double figures and finished with 17 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds in the Thunder's 114-88 home victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
Harden, Westbrook's former Thunder teammate, had a triple double of their own with 17 assists—matching their career best—and 16 rebounds in powering the host Rockets over New York 129-122.
Four-time NBA Most Valuable Player James scored 32 points, 17 in the first quarter, and had nine assists while Kevin Love added 28 points and 10 rebounds to spark the defending NBA champion Cavaliers over host Charlotte 121-109.
Westbrook, the only NBA player since 1997 to manage a first-half triple double, scored 11 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and passed off 12 assists to spark Oklahoma City to a 69-40 half-time advantage. But Westbrook's 16th triple double of the season fell short of the NBA's fastest-ever triple double, achieved in only 17 minutes by Syracuse's Jim Tucker in 1955.
At Charlotte, Jordan McRae scored 20 points in only their second career start to ease the load on James as Cleveland was missing guard Kyrie Irving due to a tight right hamstring and reserve forward Mike Dunleavy with an ankle injury.—AFP
White House Narrows List Of National Security Adviser Candidates To Replace Flynn
Enlarge this image toggle caption Khalil Mazraawi /AFP/Getty Images Khalil Mazraawi /AFP/Getty Images
The White House is narrowing its list of candidates to replace former national security adviser Michael Flynn and has already interviewed former CENTCOM deputy director Robert Harward about the vacancy, according to a senior administration official.
The official said they spoke to Harward last week and again on Monday.
"We've been getting our ducks in a row for a long time," the official said.
The comments indicate that Flynn's exit had been anticipated for some time as controversy swirled around their conversation with the Russian ambassador during the White House transition and their subsequent comments that misled then-Vice President-elect Pence about those conversations.
Trump asked for Flynn's resignation on Monday night, citing an "evolving and eroding level of trust," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during Tuesday's briefing.
Spicer told reporters Tuesday evening that the administration hopes to announce a replacement by the end of the week. But they cautioned that Trump has not yet made a decision.
Robert Harward is a retired Navy vice-admiral who was the deputy director of the U.S. Central Command under now-Defense Secretary James Mattis during the Obama administration. They served on the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. As ABC News notes, Harward was the deputy commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command and led Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 in Afghanistan. They also led troops in Afghanistan and Iraq after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Harward is currently the Chief Executive for Lockheed Martin operations in the United Arab Emirates. He's the son of a Naval officer and grew up in Iran, graduated from the Tehran American School. They speak Farsi.
Other candidates believed to be under consideration for the job are former CIA director and retired four-star Gen. David Petraeus and Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who was named the acting national security adviser after Flynn's resignation.
Petraeus would be a controversial choice given the scandal that caused them to resign in 2009 as head of the CIA. They pleaded guilty in 2015 to sharing classified information with their biographer Paula Broadwell, with whom they were having an extramarital affair. Petraeus was given two years probation (which runs through April of this year) and had to pay a $100,000 fine, but they avoided jail time due to a plea deal. Petraeus met with Trump during the transition and was in the mix to be Secretary of State. Before their fall from grace, Petraeus was a widely-respected general who helped lead military US strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Kellogg is a retired three-star Army lieutenant general who was a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign. As NPR's Tom Bowman noted, they served in the Vietnam War with 101st Airborne Division and was commander of the 82nd Airborne. Kellogg also served in Iraq as a leader with the Coalition Provisional Authority, the interim government after the fall of Saddam Hussein.
Elma David of Trinidad, the only granddaughter, of 88 year old Edna David was charged with their murder at their court appearance on Monday in Trinidad.
An autopsy was ordered on the Body of Elma David who was originally believed to have passed by natural causes. However, the autopsy revealed that the grandmother died of suffocation. One week later their granddaughter, Edna, was charged for their murder. Mental health may be an issue in this case as the 23 year old Edna is an outpatient of the St. Ann's Psychiatric Hospital.
 They are expected to appear again in court on June 11th.
The trio fell into a pool at the provincial park Tuesday afternoon
Squamish RMCP say they have found the bodies of three hikers who fell into a pool in Shannon Falls Provincial Park Tuesday afternoon.
“We're changing the operation into a recovery mission,” said Cpl. Sascha Banks.
“We have located the area that they're in and we're just trying to find a safe way to get them out.”
Search crews had been searching through the night for the trio of hikers. Police say they were swimming with a group of friends at the top of Squamish Falls when the slipped and fell into a pool 30 metres below.
Banks said that police are not releasing the names of the hikers because they haven't been able to contact their next-of-kin.
“When that time comes, that will be a decision for the B.C. Coroners Service,” Banks said.
The area remains closed to the public.

18 Top Networking Sites for Startup Founders (Infographic)
One of the top bits of advice any experienced entrepreneur will tell you is how important “who you know” is in the success equation. The importance of collaborating with like-minded business owners — especially those who know more than you do — cannot be overstated.
It's so important to limit the connections you have with people who get in the way of your goals. Of equal importance is seeking out and finding those who can help you overcome the hurdles that will get in the way of those ambitions. Hurdles including information, networking and financial woes.
Making connections with other business owners and those who work for them can foster lucrative partnerships. Smart networking also offers marketing opportunities for your startup you might otherwise never find. Luckily, there are a number of social sites that have cropped up over the years, which offer entrepreneurs a networking base to make necessary connections with those who work in business.
Just as the name suggests, Meetup is all about meeting up with people. The idea is simple, yet the networking opportunities offered can put you in touch with people with very complex interests. Interests including tech (all kinds), sports, entertainment, fashion, social issues, and career and business networking meetup events.
Whether you want to learn more about entrepreneurs or consumers in your industry, need to find influencers for marketing purposes, or wish to collab with like-minded business folk, Meetup can help put you in touch with people near and far from your geographic location.
CoFoundersLab is an interesting platform that offers a lot of options for startup founders to network with other professionals. When you first sign in, you'll be asked about your main interest on the site: finding a cofounder; becoming an adviser to startup founders; or simply networking to find side projects, part-time jobs, or opportunities for mentorship from others.
After filling out a comprehensive profile on your interests, skills, and traits you want to find in others, you'll be plugged into one of the most powerful online startup networking platforms. The knowledge-base is very complete, and the daily user-base is extensive and constantly growing. While sites like FounderDating offer good networking opportunities too, CofoundersLab owns them and has absorbed many other competitors over the years — meaning you needn't go any further than this site if you wish.
The great thing about Startups Anonymous is that it currently doesn't require a paid membership, though you can help them out via Patreon if you wish. This sharing site allows you to anonymously share your startup story, and ask and answer questions. While questions can be asked anonymously, users are free to message the question authors — even though they're not obliged to answer if they don't wish to.
The site has a Reddit/Quora feel with the question and answer format, and aspiring founders can read through tons of new and old posts asking questions from the common to off-the-beaten-path type of questions weighing on entrepreneurs. The AMA section of the site is all but dead, but the other sections are full of golden startup nuggets — and cheeky entertainment too!
Micromentor may well deserve to be first on this list of top networking sites for startup founders. One of the most difficult challenges to overcome for any founder is finding a mentor to guide them along the path they're embarking upon. Micromentor specializes in bringing mentors and mentees together in one place.
Just click onto the site and you'll immediately see the potential it has. Simply create a profile and start reaching out to their bevy of mentors. If you're an experienced entrepreneur, you can mentor people on the site. Micromentor encourages its members to talk directly on the phone. This place is all about fostering entrepreneurial dreams and accelerating startup growth.
AngelList is one of, if not THE most established platform on this list. They specialize in virtually every stage of the startup process, including employee recruitment, partnerships, incubators, helping determine valuations, and finding investors. For investors, AngelList is a great platform for finding suitable startups to invest in.
While the site is heavily focused on the job finding/recruitment and investing side of startups, the very best and biggest angels on the planet frequent the site. Networking opportunities abound, and it's also a great place to diversify your personal portfolio, as you can invest in several startups at once with a single one-time investment.
The 5 sites mentioned above are, in my opinion, the very best networking sites to get your entrepreneurial feet wet with. By no means are they the be-all, end-all. Here's the rest of the sites mentioned in the accompanying infographic – brought to you by Wrike project management software and tools:
Two Toronto Star investigative reporting projects were among those honoured at one of Canada's most prestigious public service journalism awards Wednesday night.The Star's Panama Papers, and Secrecy and the SIU series were each given citations of merit as nominees for this year's Michener award. The top prize was awarded to London Free Press for its two-year investigation into the life and death of Jamie High, which exposed shortfalls in policing, bail, community and hospital mental health care. Robert Cribb, Marco Chown Oved and Tanya Talaga represented the Star in its collaboration with 100 media outlets around the world who worked together to investigate what has now been dubbed the Panama Papers.Spearheaded by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation looked into the contents of 11.5 million files leaked from inside Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-headquartered law firm that specialized in building offshore companies. Article Continued BelowThe investigation exposed offshore companies linked to more than 140 politicians, implicating 14 current or former world leaders. The Star published more than 50 exclusive reports as part of the Panama Papers coverage, including how offshore banking is costing Canadians, links to Canadian politicians, and how the Canada Revenue Agency stacks up against other countries in convicting tax cheats.In March 2016, a probe by Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) into the shooting death of Andrew Loku determined that the officer did not exceed “justifiable force” and no criminal charges would be laid, the Michener Awards Foundation release said.
Stories of overcoming long odds are always the best. San Jose's Kevin Labanc has a story of their own that's just starting to take shape.
The former Barrie Colt great finds themselves these days on the Sharks' top line playing to the right of Logan Couture. That's not bad for someone who originally came into the league as a sixth-round draft pick. A total of 170 players heard their name on draft night in 2014 before Labanc heard his.
The Sharks took Labanc 171st overall after compiling 35 points in 65 games for the Colts in 2013-14. While these numbers seem underwhelming, Labanc enjoyed a nice playoff run that season. In 11 games, they scored three goals and seven points. Those watching them could tell they had another gear to their game.
Good thing the Sharks thought that as well.
Labanc exploded the next two seasons for the Colts scoring 107 and 127 points. They added 26 points in 15 playoff games in 2015-16. They became one of the best forwards in the entire Ontario Hockey League and paid off the Sharks' trust in them in a huge way.
After spending time with both the Sharks and the San José Barricuda the next two seasons, Labanc now has exactly 100 NHL games under their belt. They have 14-33-47 in those 100 games and is a +4. They have a career-high 21 assists this season.
We caught up with Labanc after the Sharks' morning skate in Columbus to discuss a variety of topics including the season to date, how they overcame long odds to get to this point and we get the inside scoop on their epic Twitter handle.
Q&A With Kevin Labanc
THW: The race to the playoffs is so tight these days. Does every game you play these days feel like a playoff game?
LaBanc: Yeah, I mean every game is just so tight. Every game counts. You don't want to waste the points. You gotta really come to play every night. There are no nights off.
THW: You are in the midst of three games in four nights and tonight is your third game of a five-game road trip. Just how crucial are these games for you given where you're at in the standings?
LaBanc: It is really important. We need those two points to better ourselves in the standings and to make ourselves feel comfortable later in the season. We gotta come ready to work.
THW: Your team obviously misses Joe Thornton. What part of their game do you feel you miss the most?
LaBanc: He's such a good, all-around player. They create offense and he's great defensively. But it's that offensive production. You can't replace that. He's just so skilled and that experience to say you know what, we're ok here. We'll just get back to work here. We'll get one, we'll get two and we'll be on a good start.
THW: So you are in your second full season with the Sharks. You already have a career-high in assists. What do you think is working so well for you?
LaBanc: I'm just feeling more comfortable. The longer you play, the more comfortable you feel being out there. Things just start to slow down for you. You're not as nervous with the puck. You feel confident. I'm experiencing that now.
THW: I really love your story from the time you were with the Barrie Colts. (The Sharks) made you a sixth-round pick. Looking back at your career, what do you feel like you had to overcome to go from a sixth-round pick to now playing on the top line for the San José Sharks?
LaBanc: Just my work ethic. That's what I was doing when I was back with Barrie. I was working hard. They have a great coach there too in Dale Hawerchuk. They taught me a lot about the game. He's a hall of famer and they know so much and he's so knowledgeable. You just learn so much by looking and listening. That's what I did. You gotta learn everyday otherwise once you stop, things start to go downhill.
THW: Who's really mentored you in the room to help get acclimated to the league?
LaBanc: Goodness, there are so many guys you could say (Joe) Pavelski, (Tomas) Hertl, (Logan) Couture. Jumbo is obviously, probably the one because he's been in the league the longest and he's had the most experience. They know what it takes to become the player that they are.
THW: So my last question for you, Twitter handles (Labanc starts laughing.) @str8tothebanc is one of the best ones. Where did this handle come from?
LaBanc: I think it was a 50 cent song. It started with that then one of my buddies just said to make that your Twitter account. I was like alright. They made it for me. I was like alright let's just stick with it.
Coach Peter DeBoer's Thoughts
Sharks' head coach Peter DeBoer said today that LaBanc “is a special offensive player.” But they add that the 5-on-5 game is a work in progress. That's expected for someone who is a power-play specialist and gifted offensively. While they still have areas of the game to learn, LaBanc is earning the trust of the coaching staff and continues to show improvement in key areas of their game. Playing on the top line is a testament to how far he's come.
LaBanc and the Sharks hope to get back to the winning way Friday night in Columbus. We thank them and the Sharks for their time in talking with us.

CHITRAL-A daylong education convention was held at Government Postgraduate College of Management Sciences and Commerce Chitral under the auspices of AlifAilan.
The education convention was organized for nominated candidates of NA-1 and PK-1 to motivate and brief them for giving first priority to education if they elected in the upcoming election 2018. Several politicians from various parties gathered at the convention to discuss the failing state of education in Chitral, analyzed the five-year education plans of contesting candidates and probed reasonable solutions to ensure quality education across the government-run schools.
The convention was organized by AlifAilaan which was attended by parents, youth activists and civil society members of Chitral. Wazir Zada, Israruddin and Abdul Latif from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Maulana Ejazur Rehman and Maulana Abdul Haq from Muttahida Maajlis-e-Amal, Maulana Sirajuddin from Rah-e-Haq Party and two independent candidates - Haji Abdur Rehman and Ameerullah - participated in the political convention.
The district is soon going to become a commerce zone in near future via Wakhan corridor that connects Pakistan with Central Asia. Chitral's declining standards in education raise questions whether Chitral's schools are equipped with the right tools to provide students with the necessary skills they would need in the future to sustain and protect Chitral's environment and economy.
Chitral is ranked 46th nationally on education score that measures retention, learning and gender parity, as per Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 released by AlifAilaan. Analysis of the educational landscape in Chitral revealed that shortage of post primary schools, unavailability of basic school infrastructure and facilities and quality of education are the three most important factors contributing to failing education standards in Chitral.
Around 78% of all schools in Chitral are primary level which adversely impact the number of students enrolled at higher levels. Due to lesser number of schools, enrolment drops as students move up the higher classes especially for girls, leading to drop-outs after Class 5. Gender disparity is also evident by the fact that only 30% of all schools in Chitral are for girls, leaving little opportunities for girls to study.
These factors have negatively contributed to poor learning outcomes of students and quality of education. More than 80% of grade 5 students cannot read a story in Pashto, Urdu and English let alone solving simple division questions of grade 2 standard. Any improvement that is sought in the learning outcomes of children has to be backed by hiring of subject specialist teachers immediately.
While speaking at the session, PTI candidates Wazir Zada, Israruddin and Abdul Lateef pledged to bring reforms in quality and learning outcomes of the students by improving the syllabus based on international standards coupled with the latest digital technology in classrooms. Mr Ameerullah focused on speeding up teachers' training and appointments of subject specialist teachers in higher secondary schools.
MMA candidates Maulana Hidayatur Rehman and Maulana Abdul Akbar said girl's education would be their main priority in their upcoming term so that gender parity can be improved. Maulana Sirajuddin pledged to focus on improving the primary level education, infrastructure and quality, if they win the elections. Demands were also raised from the community members who wanted to see better opportunities of higher education in their area supported by scholarships. One community member pointed out the misallocation and underutilization of education budget and urged the candidates to make education their priority in the funds distribution after coming to power.
Towards the conclusion, all contesting candidates signed on a charter of demands for the constitutional provision of quality education for children of Chitral, and promised to deliver on the charter if elected during upcoming elections. The charter is backed by a host of organizations, parents and community members in Chitral.
Talking about this education convention, Sobia Parveen told this scribe that they learned more knowledge from this session and would try to motivate their elected members towards promoting of quality education at Chitral.
RIYADH - At least 12 Saudi soldiers have died on the southern border since early February, according to an unusual series of official reports released as the country fights Yemeni rebels.
In separate dispatches since February 5, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) has carried photographs of funerals for the "martyrs" it said died "defending the southern borders."
The most recent report, published late on Monday, named Jaber Haroubi as the latest soldier to be killed.
SPA also quoted the father of another military casualty, Mohammed al-Manjahi, as saying they were proud of their son.
A Saudi-led coalition began air strikes over Yemen in March 2015 to support the internationally recognised government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi in the fight against Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
The Huthis, allied with former members of the security forces loyal to ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have carried out retaliatory rocket strikes and engaged in firefights along the border.
They have also launched ballistic missiles further into the kingdom.
An earlier AFP tally of reports by the Saudi interior ministry and civil defence department found that at least 115 civilians and soldiers had been killed on the southern border since coalition operations began.
That total has now reached at least 127.
A Western diplomat told AFP last week that more than 100 members of the Saudi armed forces had likely been killed since the coalition intervened nearly two years ago.
The coalition's spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment on the tally.
Official media have previously reported on funerals for dead troops. But this month's series of dispatches, including photographs of slain soldiers' families bearing coffins, is unusual.
SPA said the director of the Border Guards, Awad al-Balwi, last Wednesday paid tribute to two of their men killed in the Jazan region on the frontier.
"They were among the best," SPA said they told the dead men's families while conveying condolences in their villages.
The Saudi interior ministry regularly gives details of casualties among its Border Guard troops but other military services normally do not.
SPA on Monday reported that separate funeral prayers were held for five other soldiers killed on duty in the south.
There were no details of how they died.
The rebels' Almasirah television website said on Monday that insurgents killed an unspecified number of Saudi soldiers during an advance "towards the mountains surrounding Jazan".
The latest losses came as Yemeni government forces claimed full control of the Red Sea coastal town of Mokha on Friday and prepared a push further north into rebel-held territory.
Medical and military sources in Yemen on Monday reported renewed clashes in Mokha as well as the coastal town of Midi, which is just over the border from Jazan.
They reported eight rebels and three pro-government troops dead in fighting on Monday evening.
Six loyalist troops died on Tuesday when a coalition air strike hit their convoy north of Mokha in "error", a military source said.
The war in Yemen has left thousands dead and millions struggling to feed themselves, a toll which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in Riyadh on Sunday left them heartbroken.
Seven ceasefires brokered between government and rebel forces by the UN have failed, while UN-backed peace talks have repeatedly broken down.
PARIS: The two frontrunners in the French presidential election, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron, were staging rival rallies in Paris Monday, seeking to stay ahead of a fast-chasing pack just days before the vote.
After weeks of twists and turns, the unpredictable race has narrowed dramatically, with surveys suggesting four candidates are in contention to win one of the top two spots in the April 23 vote and progress to the run-off election a fortnight later.
Scandal-hit conservative Francois Fillon and radical leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon are steaming up behind the two frontrunners, and with around one in three of the French electorate still undecided, candidates are scrapping for every vote.
Le Pen and Macron, who have both scored as high as 25 percent in voter surveys, stood at 22 percent in the latest IPSOS poll, while Melenchon has surged to 20 percent and Fillon stands at 19.
Melenchon's late surge - and the possibility they could square off against Le Pen in the May 7 decider - has sparked alarm over the future of the EU, as both candidates advocate withdrawing from the bloc for different reasons.
Outgoing President Francois Hollande weighed in on Saturday, saying Europe has "protected us against war" in the decades since World War II.
"Let us preserve it instead of scapegoating it," they said at a World War I centenary event in northern France.
Macron plans their biggest rally yet at the Bercy sports and concert hall, a venue with a capacity of 20,000.
The location near the economy ministry serves as a reminder that the relatively inexperienced Macron held the key economy portfolio for two years under their mentor Hollande.
The 39-year-old former Rothschild banker quit the Socialist government last year to form their "En Marche" ("On the Move") party and launch their bid for power as a candidate "neither of the left nor of the right".
En Marche says it has planned "1,000 events a day" including 163 public rallies until the official end of campaigning at midnight on Friday.
Le Pen's own rally will be at the 6,000-capacity Zenith concert hall in northeast Paris, with activists saying they plan protests outside the venue.
A protest is also expected in the southern port of Marseille on Wednesday where Le Pen plans another large rally.
Melenchon, 65, plans a quirky event that will see them board a barge in a northeast suburb of the French capital and float down a canal, making five stops along the way to meet and greet supporters.
The voyage lasting more than five hours will end up at the Francois Mitterrand Library, a nod to the Socialist leader of the 1980s and early 1990s whom Melenchon references frequently in their stump speech as an icon of the left.
The founder of "La France Insoumise" ("Unbowed France") plans another form of multiple appearances on Tuesday, where they will hold a rally in central Dijon while their hologram will speak for them in six other cities.
For their part Fillon, dogged by a fake jobs scandal that has seen them charged with abuse of public funds, is vowing to pull off a victory that will "surprise the microcosm" arrayed against him.
They believe a small coterie of detractors mounted a campaign to smear them with the revelations that they put their wife Penelope on the public payroll with jobs that earned them hundreds of thousands of euros (dollars).
Fillon, who led the race for weeks before the scandal broke in late January, spent Easter weekend wooing the Catholic and conservative vote.
Conspicuous by their absence at the height of the scandal, the 63-year-old former prime minister has revved up their campaign appearances in the past week.

LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Wednesday they suspected two people found in a critical condition near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned earlier this year may have been exposed to an unknown substance.
Police in Wiltshire, where ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in March, took the rare step of declaring a major incident after a man and a woman were found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury.
The pair is now in hospital in a critical condition.
“They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement. “Based upon the number of casualties affected, it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public.”
The pair, both in their 40s, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. They are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, which remains open as usual, police said.
The Skripals spent weeks in a critical condition in the same hospital before slowly recovering and being discharged.
More than three days since the two people were found, tests are still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill.
Amesbury lies seven miles (11 kms) to the north of Salisbury, where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.
Police said sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury that they believed the man and woman found in Amesbury had frequented would be cordoned off as a precaution.
A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said there was not a significant risk to the wider public.
Britain blamed Russia for poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two.
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Russia has said it does not have such nerve agents, did not develop Novichok, and President Vladimir Putin dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and their 33-year-old daughter.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.
There was much disappointment at Pakistan's defeat at Melbourne by an innings, something of a rarity for Australia, which was deprived of the chance of batting again which they normally use mainly, to rub the noses of the opponent in the dust. Disappointment yes, surprise no.
For the surprise we had to depend on Asif Zardari, who had said that they would spring one when they spoke at the gathering to mark the death of their wife, Benazir Bhutto. What they chose was not really a surprise for the whole nation, as for the dedicated jiala. To wit, they said that they and their son Bilawal would enter Parliament before the next general election through by-elections on the safe Larkana seats. That is a surprise to gladden the heart of a diehard, someone who believes that there is only democracy in the country only if a member of the family of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto holds office. By that standard, there is no democracy nowadays. By that token, Zardari will find a lot of grateful people when they and their son get into the House.
Admittedly, PTI chief Imran Khan will be less than enthused. They had hoped for a PPP ready to try a ‘minus-one' formula. Bilawal's activation had seemed a step towards this. But Asif came back and while the PPP seemed ready to accept him, Imran did not. I would suspect it would all depend on how the former President marks the coming in of the New Year.
This New Year conveniently begins the week. Indeed, it falls on the weekly holiday. This seems a good time to have a resolution as any. Let's not have any big resolutions, like having world peace, but small ones, like keeping our environs clean.
Every year, we have a record at the end of those who lived and died. I wonder what it was about music and religion. I mean, among those who passed away in Pakistan seemed to have had the double connection. I mean Junaid Jamshed was a pop star who turned a preacher; Amjad Sabri sang devotional music, and A. Nayyar was a Christian, and though they never made it an issue, it was something that stuck out.
George Michael also died, and though they were not a Pakistani, they were a musician. They aren't really seen in the context of religion. Nor was Carrie Fisher, who shot to fame as Princess Leiah in the original Star Wars movies of about 40 years ago. Before that, they were the elder child of the Debbie Reynolds-Eddie Fisher marriage, which ended with Fisher becoming Elizabeth Taylor's third husband. Debbie Reynolds died very soon after. Debbie Reynolds will not be remembered by many people except as a name, for they had more or less left films half-a-century ago, rather even more. I fans, if alive at all, might well have started to develop Alzheimer's. Eddie Fisher is dead already. At least he's been spared the agony Debbie Reynolds went through, of seeing their child dead.
Well, no one seems to have died so far, even though the most common pastime on New Year's Eve still seems to have been throwing crackers into cars with windows open. One would think people would keep their windows closed, but have you ever done so during winter? The car becomes stuffy. And what do you do? Roll down your window to let in the air. And as many crackers as the young bucks of the city can fling in.
I wonder if Russia did any more hacking to bring in the New Year. I hope they got their timing right, because 2016 was a second longer. That's because they are adjusting the year to match the planet's orbit around the sun. It's the same idea as the extra day in February every four years, as 2016 already had. Otherwise, the calendar would quite quickly grow out of sync with the sun, and we'd be marking New Year in midsummer.
Well, one set of people who won't be marking the New Year will be the 39 Christians (or is it 50? So many have died that the number is uncertain) who died in Toba Tek Singh last Sunday, while trying to celebrate Christmas with homemade liquor mixed with aftershave lotion. No one said there was a scent coming from the brew, but I suspect that the aftershave wasn't just thrown in because of its alcohol content, but also for its smell. It would have made the liquor taste awful, though.
Aftershave is definitely an acquired taste, but cough syrup is also drunk for its alcohol content. The increase in sentences for drug adulteration would not apply to the Toba Tek Singh brewers, though. There are an increasing number of incidents in Pakistan, though we haven't reached the peaks achieved by Indians, who add industrial alcohol to the brew of country liquor, ignoring the fact that industrial (which is 100 percent ethanol) has had methanol added. Methanol is a poison. Indeed, methylated spirits (ethanol with methanol added) would be used in aftershave.
Another group not celebrating would be the 35 Russian diplomats thrown out of the USA as part of the sanctions by the Obama Administration over the hacking scandal. It's a little murky. I mean, did the Russians help Trump win or not? Even if they didn't, did their hackers try to influence the election, or just altruistically reveal what was going on at the Democratic National Committee? Will the Obama Administration make a difference? This is especially relevant considering how narrow the election result was.
Politico has obtained rare footage of the ex-wife of President Donald Trump's labor secretary nominee appearing anonymously on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1990, where they alleged spousal abuse. "I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this," Lisa Fierstein alleged the labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder, told them in an episode titled "High Class Battered Women."
Puzder, the CKE Restaurants CEO, is slated for their Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday although four Republicans have said they are "withholding support," possibly jeopardizing their nomination. In addition to allegations that they abused their wife, Puzder faces trouble due to pushback from labor rights activists and their admission that they and their wife once employed an undocumented immigrant as a part-time housekeeper.
When Fierstein appeared on Oprah, they were already divorced from Puzder — their separation was finalized in 1987 — and disguised by large sunglasses and a wig and used an assumed name. Another woman who appeared in the episode supplied the video to Politico, and Senators on the HELP committee have also reviewed the tape, which was supplied to them by the Oprah Winfrey Network but had not been made available to the public.
In a petition seeking $350,000 in damages, Fierstein also alleged Puzder "assaulted and battered me by striking me violently about the face, chest, back, shoulders and neck, without provocation or cause" and left "bruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck" as well as "two ruptured discs and two bulging discs." The petition was ultimately dismissed "on the grounds that Puzder's divorce agreement had already settled all Fierstein's prior claims against him," Politico writes.

After the underwhelming events of Season 7 of AMC's The Walking Dead, Season 8 is shaping up to be an “All Out War” among the various groups of survivors. Our original protagonists, ie Rick & Co., have blended in among the citizens of Alexandria, Hilltop, and The Kingdom, and have united them against the main threat of Negan and their Saviors. However, twists and turns to the story that unfolded in Season 7 also featured some new groups that walked the line between ally and enemy, with a group of dump-dwelling Scavengers stabbing Rick's group in the back while the isolated Oceanside community regretfully gave up their guns for the cause.
As TV Line reports, AMC has now added a trio of series regulars for Season 8, and that news gives us a very minor hint as to how the story will shape up this fall. Steven Ogg, Katelyn Nacon, and Pollyanna McIntosh have all been promoted to series regulars for the upcoming season. Though some have been around a little longer than others and certainly aren't replacements for the departed Steven Yeun (Glenn), Michael Cudlitz (Abraham) and Sonequa Martin-Green (Sasha), each of these actors performed their characters exceptionally well; the series will be stronger for their inclusion.
In case you don't recognize them by their real names, we'll break them all down for you. Ogg plays the Savior Simon, Negan's right-hand man and charismatic collector of all that is owed to their boss. He's been featured quite a bit in their chats with Gregory at Hilltop Colony since Simon's now acting as their resident “Negan”; he's also terrorized Alexandria on occasion. Expect Simon to go to war alongside their boss in Season 8.
Nacon, the veteran of the show in this group, plays Enid, introduced as a wandering, solitary survivor who lost their parents. Enid and Carl have established a romantic relationship on the show, but lately Enid's been spending more time with Maggie at Hilltop, acting almost as a younger sister for the burgeoning leader.
McIntosh stole their scenes in Season 7 when they were introduced as Jadis, the leader of the Scavengers. Them motto, and that of their group, is “We take. We don't bother.” Never trust a weird-talking group of garbage people because they will sell you out for a better deal in short order. Expect Jadis to be on the wrong side of the fight when The Walking Dead returns.
Here's what showrunner Scott M. Gimple had to say about the direction of The Walking Dead in Season 8:
“It's going to become a bit more kinetic and fast-moving, because that's where the story is going. The content is definitely going to be determining the form.”
Music to our ears. The Walking Dead returns this fall.

It features international guests like Jamaican reggae star Popcaan and American rappers 2 Chainz and Young Thug, as well as Giggs' UK peers like D Double E. Giggs was never a grime guy, and the tape has the slow-creep sound of a form of UK rap that hasn't gotten much attention on this side of the Atlantic. It's a cool sound, one worth investigating.

PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - France condemned on Friday attacks by suspected English-speaking separatists in Cameroon that killed three gendarmes on Thursday, but urged the Cameroonian government to engage in dialogue to stop an escalation in violence.
The separatists have taken up arms over the past year in an attempt to create a nation they call Ambazonia. The insurgency represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of Cameroon's President Paul Biya.
France, which has significant business interests in its former colony and relies on it to fight against Islamist militants, has been careful not to overly criticise the government's handling of the crisis.
“France condemns the new killings of law enforcement officials that took place on 1 February in Cameroon,” Foreign ministry spokesperson Agnes Von der Muhll told reporters in a daily briefing after three gendarmes were killed in separate clashes on Thursday in towns in the North West Region.
They said only dialogue would enable a peaceful response to the concerns of all sides and ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
“This is a message we are also passing on to the Cameroonian authorities, in close consultation with our European and international partners,” the spokesperson added.
Violence has flared in the past week, with armed separatist factions clashing against Cameroon security forces in several towns and villages in the two English-speaking regions after Nigeria deported the leader of the self-declared state and 46 others.
The United Nations refugee agency condemned the handing over of the 47 people, saying most of them had submitted asylum claims and their forced return was in violation of international refugee law.
More than 43,000 Cameroonians have fled as refugees to Nigeria to escape the government crackdown on the separatists, say local aid officials. The majority are in Nigeria's Cross River state, which borders southwest Cameroon. (Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Gareth Jones)

MARGAO: Cases of shopkeepers cheating consumers are on the rise in the commercial capital of Goa – Margao with the former taking advantage of the loopholes in the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011.
This act does not permit the officials to act upon those shopkeepers who sell unpacked and opened items even though they are convinced that customers are given duplicate items which do not have price mentioned on it. The act needs amendments.
Many shopkeepers selling hardware and electrical items, spare parts, gift items, lose engine oil, garments, etc easily cheat the customers by selling duplicate items sans price tags. The shopkeepers first judge the customers and then speak of prices of their products and successfully sell these items to them.
“I purchased some bathroom items from a shop at Aquem-Margao and when questioned over the price tags, the shopkeeper told me that all items do not have printed price tags. They convinced me that they sell genuine products. I believed them and took away the product but found it to be duplicate and also that I was overcharged,” Cynthia Fernandes of Benaulim said. They however lacked proof to complain to legal metrology department.
Another consumer said that they approached the legal metrology and explained how they were cheated adding, “The officers concerned said that they cannot act in case of the purchase of unpacked item. I was dejected.” They cautioned consumers not to purchase items sold loose.
When contacted, assistant controller of legal metrology department, Margao Arun Panchwadkar informed that they have no powers to act against shopkeepers selling unpacked items. They said, “In case of sale of loose items, we cannot take action. However, we have booked many cases under the controlled commodities act. I urge the people to insist on box packed items with bills from the shopkeepers as it will help us to act instantly.”
However when asked whether the department of legal metrology had ever arrested any person for violation of consumer rights, they said that the act empowers them to arrest accused persons only if they are found to be a repeated offender.
A circuit court judge has blocked the sale of Georgia Washington Middle School. The ruling is now being appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
A Montgomery circuit court judge's ruling that blocks the sale of Georgia Washington Middle School by the Alabama State Department of Education is being appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court.
Interim State Supt. Dr. Ed Richardson appealed the matter to the state's highest court following Judge Greg Griffin's March 5 order, which also blocks the closure and sale of other schools and Montgomery Public School system property.
MPS is currently under state intervention with Richardson leading the charge to reorganize the financially and academically struggling school system. As part of their intervention plan, Richard confirmed in February they would close four schools and sell one of them, Georgia Washington, to nearby Pike Road Schools for $9.75 million.
The Alabama Education Association sued Richardson and the state's intervention team, claiming they have no authority to close or sell any schools. AEA also claims Richardson has conflicts of interest due to previous consultant work with PRS.
In their appeal, Richardson contends that delays in moving forward with "intervention-related initiatives" will be "extraordinarily costly" to the Montgomery County system. He's publicly stated that if Georgia Washington Middle is not sold, he'll have no choice but to layoff 200 educators.
"The sale of the Georgia Washington facility alone will produce almost $10 million in revenue to the Montgomery System," Richardson said. "We cannot risk losing that opportunity or the long-term benefits that will be realized through other cost-saving measures that are now on hold because of the court's order."
Richardson said he's confident the Alabama Supreme Court will bring a “big picture” perspective to the issues of intervention authority and governance that are raised by the case.
“The intervention statute was intended to permit the State Superintendent to make the kind of bold, often politically difficult decisions that are necessary to get underperforming boards of education back on the right track," Richardson added. "Intervention measures that can be undermined by entrenched political interests or judicial second-guessing are doomed from the start. Our hope is that the Supreme Court will interpret the statute in a way that will permit the intervention process to work as the Legislature intended it to.”
The Alabama Supreme Court has not indicated when it will make a decision on the appeal.

Tetera Faulkner held out as long as they could before leaving the Western Force for the Rebels. (AAP)
Outgoing Western Force star Tetera Faulkner has revealed how their children broke down in tears when they told them they were moving to Melbourne to join the Rebels.
Melbourne-bound prop Tetera Faulkner has revealed their children's heartbreak at their decision to leave Perth amid uncertainty around the Western Force's future in Super Rugby.
Faulkner announced just 24 hours before the ARU's decision last Friday to cut the Force from next year's competition that they were joining the Rebels on a two-year deal.
While the Force's other five members in Michael Cheika's 34-man Wallabies squad are pledging to commit to the Force until the fallen franchise exhausts every legal avenue, Faulkner said they couldn't wait any longer.
"I've got four kids of my own and a wife as well, so to actually move on from the Force was a tough decision," Faulkner told AAP on Tuesday.
"But obviously the decision with the Force, getting kicked out of the tournament, played a bit of a part in me moving on.
"At the same time, it was a personal decision to move on to the Rebels, but it did play on my mind and we could only hold out as long as we could."
The 29-year-old's oldest children are aged seven, five and three, while their youngest, son Arepa, was born just eight days ago.
"So we were obviously trying to hold out to let them finish school in Perth. You've got to think about that stuff as well; trying to change schooling," Faulkner said.
"They've obviously got their friends who they've grown up with so it's a hard decision not only for myself but for them as well.
"They were in tears when I had to tell them."
Faulkner is hoping to put the Force drama behind them and cap a monumental month with a call-up for their third Test in Saturday night's Bledisloe Cup blockbuster with the All Blacks in Sydney.
"My boy was born on the Wednesday and I got the email (about my Wallabies squad selection) on the Thursday so it was quite an exciting time coming into camp," they said.
"Fingers crossed I get a run."
Having won an injunction against the ARU's decision on Monday, the Force are now hoping to gain leave to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.

CIUDAD VICTORIA:- A Mexican journalist was found beaten to death in the northern state of Tamaulipas, on the US border, prosecutors said, at least the fifth reporter murdered in the country this year. Hector Gonzalez Antonio, a correspondent for national daily Excelsior and local radio and TV stations, was found bludgeoned to death on a road in the state capital, Ciudad Victoria, the state prosecutor's office said in a statement. "An investigation has been opened to identify and locate those responsible for this homicide," it said.–AFP
Pictures from the crime scene showed the journalist's bloodied body, shirtless and missing a shoe, abandoned on a narrow dirt road on the outskirts of Ciudad Victoria.
Gonzalez, 40, had been kidnapped in a carjacking on Monday, said watchdog group Reporters Without Borders.
A lot of things have been said about Edmonton Oilers prospect Jesse Puljujarvi. The hot topic on Edmonton's prized forward centers around their development, or lack thereof. At the 2016 NHL Draft, the first two names predictably flew off the board. Auston Matthews went first overall to the Toronto Maple Leafs, followed by Patrik Laine going to the Winnipeg Jets. Puljujarvi was the consensus pick to go third.
Many people believed Puljujarvi and the Columbus Blue Jackets were a perfect match. After all, why wouldn't the Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen select their fellow countryman from Finland? Kekalainen instead caused a shockwave when they chose a big, strong, potential first-line center in Pierre-Luc Dubois. The hockey world was stunned, as was Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli who ran to the podium to select the Finnish forward.
The rumors leading up to the draft were that Edmonton was going to select a defenseman with the fourth selection. Olli Juolevi, Mikhail Sergachev, and Jakob Chychrun were the three big blueliners that year. Instead, Puljujarvi fell into Edmonton's lap, or did he?
Debunking the Kekalainen Story
Thus started a rumor that the Blue Jackets GM knew something about Puljujarvi that soured their taste. After all, Kekalainen's from Finland, and he's bound to have some connections in their native country, right? The words were spreading that Puljujarvi didn't compete the way Laine and Matthews did. Then it was that Puljujarvi's 200-foot game wasn't as rosy as most scouts thought it was. Whatever the reason, the seed was planted that there was something wrong with Puljujarvi.
“ “I was shocked by Puljujarvi. I just could not see them going anywhere but three. I know there had been talk floated out there of Winnipeg even going with them at two. And Dubois, I know people that had them six, seven on the list. In the Top 10, I know that was pretty unanimous. – Gare Joyce, Sports Writer (Sportsnet) ”
There was a lot of shock and awe when the Blue Jackets took Dubois. Even the Columbus media was perplexed over the decision. One theory was that Kekalainen really wanted Dubois, but may have botched a deal with Edmonton or Calgary. Those were the two teams picking after Columbus. The Blue Jackets would've moved down in a trade, and with a handshake agreement the other side wouldn't take Dubois.
“ Jarmo Kekalainen said they would take the best player available, regardless of position. Then, they turned their back on the best player available and everyone at First Niagara Center knew it. – Michael Arace, Columbus Dispatch ”
Regardless it's a lot of conspiracy theories without a whole lot of substance to sink your teeth into. It's quite simple though. Kekalainen really wanted that big first-line center, not a winger like Puljujarvi.
This whole talk might've just been a whole lot of hoopla. Then again it does make a good story, doesn't it?
Patience Is a Virtue with NHL Prospects
Last season, Puljujarvi made the opening night roster in Edmonton. They even scored in their NHL debut. Things were looking up! The 18-year-old would then struggle through the next 13 games with just two assists. This prompted fans to ask if the Oilers should send them to the minors. It was evident Puljujarvi wasn't quite ready for the NHL just yet.
They were playing third or fourth-line minutes most nights, something that wasn't conducive to their success. Ask yourself this; if an 18-year-old is playing 7:21 minutes in ice time (TOI) on some nights, do you think you're going to get results? Adding to that, Puljujarvi was a healthy scratch 14 times by the Oilers. They played 28 of 42 games until they were re-assigned to the Condors on January 5.
Under the tutelage of Bakersfield Condors head coach Gerry Fleming, Puljujarvi got their development back on track. They were playing top minutes in Bakersfield and finished the year with 28 points in 39 games. If you're familiar with the NHLE calculator, that's the equivalent of 27.7 points. Those are fair numbers for a rookie, but not difference-making numbers, yet. This season, Puljujarvi is a tweener for a lot of people.
Should Edmonton send them back to the AHL for another year? Should they get a look in Edmonton's crowded top nine? When all was said and done, Kailer Yamamoto burst onto the scene and exceeded expectations. Puljujarvi had a decent camp, but it was a numbers game, and Yamamoto and some others outplayed him. Some people have been quick to write off Puljujarvi, but going back to Bakersfield again doesn't mean he's floundering as a prospect, far from it.
Leave Puljujarvi Alone, Let Him Develop
Some of the more asinine comments online were that Puljujarvi was already being labeled as a bust by some fans. Laughable! Leon Draisaitl faced similar adversity during their rise to NHL stardom. Draisaitl struggled like Puljujarvi in their rookie year. They then didn't make the Oilers opening night roster in 2015-16 before emerging as a star and playing the final 72 games that season.
Patience is often a virtue when it comes to NHL prospects, even first round picks. It's clear the Oilers don't have to rush prospects along anymore, and that's a good thing. Edmonton doesn't need Puljujarvi to jump in and save them, and Puljujarvi doesn't need to be with the main club right now. The objective is for this youngster to develop. The only way to develop is to play. If he's not going to play, he's not going to develop.
Olli Juolevi is another top-five pick from that 2016 draft that didn't make their NHL team this year either. Juolevi was loaned to TPS in Finland by the Vancouver Canucks. Even Dylan Strome (third overall, 2015) has shown a fair share of struggles at the NHL level. Strome is now penciled into the Arizona Coyotes' roster.
“ “Jesse needs more time. We expect Jesse, when they arrive and he's ready to play – and the same can be said of Yamamoto – to play in our top nine, minimum. Not on the fourth line. We didn't feel like they won that position and therefore we wanted to get them to Bakersfield and have them start the season there and get them working on their game." – Oilers Head Coach Todd McLellan ”
NHL Prospects Mature at Different Rates
The point is, prospects mature at different speeds, and people need to ease off Puljujarvi. They need to develop into a difference-maker for the Oilers, not just another body on the roster. They need to mature, work on their offensive game, and build some consistency. Coming into the NHL, there's a different level of desperation and urgency with players. Puljujarvi just doesn't have that gear, yet.
“ I thought they were playing straighter lines, pursuing the puck better, and making more plays. But they aren't without mistakes. I told them they needed to clean up their game a little bit, go down there and shove it up my you know what. I wouldn't be adverse to bringing them back, but I want to see their game cleaned up a little bit. I'm happy with the development trail he's on. – Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli ”
If Puljujarvi can play top line minutes and get some power play time, he'll come back to Edmonton a better player. There's already a precedent that's been set. Mikko Rantanen, William Nylander, Logan Couture and Bobby Ryan all went through this before becoming difference-makers at the NHL level.
Leave Puljujarvi down in the AHL as long as it takes so they become that type of player for Edmonton.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court on Tuesday referred the matter of an Indian national, who married a Pakistani woman, to the Ministry of Interior for deciding the case.
The top court while referring the matter directed the interior ministry to pass a speaking order as to whether the Pakistani citizenship be allowed to an Indian national keeping in view the fundamental rights within two-week.
The top court ruled that till the decision of the ministry, the matter shall remain pending adjudication before this court.
The court also suspended the direction of interior ministry's letter wherein it had asked the Indian national to submit Rs5 million as citizenship fee.
The court ruled that the question whether deposit of citizenship fee Rs5 million was ultra vires or admissible shall also be decided.
The court further ruled that the home department shall decide about the citizenship of Indian citizen's son as they have attained the age of majority.
On March 30, the Supreme Court while stopping the deportation of an Indian national had issued notices to Attorney General and Advocate Generals of provinces to assist the court in deciding the law regarding grant of citizenship to foreign national husbands.
The court had also appointed Advocate Salman Aslam Butt as an amicus curie (friend of the court) in the case.
The question of law involved in the case is if a person weds a foreign woman they can become a Pakistani citizen but the law is silent pertaining to grant of citizenship to a foreign man who weds a Pakistani woman.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan took up the interior ministry's appeal for hearing wherein it challenged the Lahore High Court (LHC) Judgment regarding directions to the ministry to grant the citizenship to Indian National.
“The high court has not taken into consideration the Indo-Pak relations and the judgment will cause inflow of Indian male citizen into Pakistan, creating a threat to the national security,” the interior ministry highlighted the point in its appeal.
During the course of hearing, Deputy Attorney General Sajid Ilyas Bhatti recalling the facts of the case informed the top court that Syed Hassan Asghar was an Indian national presently residing at Multan who had come to Pakistan in 2003 along with their son and mother from Delhi, India.
They informed that Ashghar had applied for the citizenship of Pakistan on the basis of their marriage dated February 16 of 2004 with a widow Rukhsana adding that out of this wedlock two daughters were born.
Bhatti contended that after marriage, Asghar had been applying for extension of visa and interior ministry of Pakistan time and again extended their visa.
However, Bhatti said, the ministry asked Asghar to deposit foreign exchange equivalent to Rs5 million under the law of Pakistan Citizenship Act 1951 to award citizenship.
“Instead of depositing the foreign exchange as required by law, Asghar and their wife Rukhsana filed a writ petition for grant of citizenship which was allowed by the LHC on the basis of Article 25 of the Constitution,” they added.
Bhatti then read or the Section 10 (2) of Citizen Act 1951 stating that a foreign woman belonging to a commonwealth country can be granted citizenship if they wed a Pakistani man.
The Chief Justice questioned that whether the fundamental rights of a person who cannot afford to pay money would be infringed.
Bhatti submitted before the bench that it was mandatory to deposit foreign exchange equivalent to Rs5 million under Section 20 of Citizenship Act 1951 to process the case for Citizenship Certificate.
The CJ observed that as to how can foreign exchange could be tied up with nationality. “Under what authority of law this letter [of the ministry for depositing Rs5 million] is issued,” the CJ questioned.
Attorney General for Pakistan Jawed Khan submitted that they disagreed with the view of federal government in this regard.
The CJ observed that the bench was going to send the matter to the interior ministry to hear Asghar without money and for passing a speaking order keeping in view the fundamental rights so that the ministry's reply makes the matter clearer.
The appeal of the ministry stated that the high court could only refer the matter to the concerned ministry but it cannot pass a judgment itself, adding the judgment of LHC was against law and facts of the case were not sustainable in the eyes of law.
It further added that LHC had no jurisdiction and cannot pass an order to grant citizenship. “All the legal remedies have not been availed before invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of the high court,” it stated, adding: “Granting citizenship to a foreigner woman married a Pakistani national cannot be treated at par with foreigner man who has married a Pakistani national woman and cannot be said discriminatory and is not in violation of Article 25 of the Constitution.”
The interior ministry also stated that a foreign origin husband after marrying a Pakistani woman and obtaining Pakistani nationality would be free to divorce and can move freely in Pakistan.
In 2016, LHC‘s Justice Ali Baqar Najafi in their judgment had observed that right of a woman to marry of their own choice is the basic human right and to acknowledge this right no discrimination is to be observed against Article 25 of the Constitution.
They further had observed that under Article 232 (2) of Beijing Declaration of 1995, the governments were required to review national laws, including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family, civil, penal, labour, or commercial law to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedure of all relevant international human rights by means of a national legislation, revoke any remaining laws for discrimination on the basis of sex and removing gender bias in the administration of justice.

EXECUTIVE HIRES
Reel FX Animation Studios has re-hired veteran executive Jared Mass to head up Reel FX's originals unit.
Based in the studio's Hollywood location, Mass will oversee a growing slate of animated feature films, as well as a range of episodic, streaming, and cross-platform projects.
Reel FX partners with major studios on its original properties, including the recently announced “Monster of the Hill” with Paramount Pictures and Walden Media. The film, which is set to open in 2020, is set in a world where monsters are tame and monster wrestling is a popular sport. Based on the graphic novel by Rob Harrell, the movie is produced by longtime Reel FX executive Brad Booker, directed by Disney veteran Bradley Raymond, and written by Matt Lieberman and Etan Cohen.
Notable Reel FX films include “The Book of Life” with Fox, “Free Birds” with Relativity Media, which each generated more than $100 million at the worldwide box office, as well as “Rise of the Guardians,” which was developed in-house before the property was sold to DreamWorks Animation. Reel FX will continue to serve as a vendor for upcoming film projects such as Warner Animation Group's “Scooby-Doo.”
With an employee base of over 200, Reel FX recently opened a feature animation complex in Montreal. With its Dallas and Hollywood locations, the studio will double its staff over the next two years.
Mass was previously VP at Paramount Animation, where they helped acquire “Monster on the Hill” and “Clifford the Big Red Dog” for the studio, and oversaw the recently released “Sherlock Gnomes.” During their initial stint at Reel FX Animation Studios, they served as an executive during the development and production of “Book of Life” and “Free Birds.”
The FAA has launched an investigation after a drone had an apparent close call with a jet near McCarran International Airport.Video circulating online shows the drone hovering as what appears to be a Frontier Airlines jet flies almost directly beneath it.It's not clear who shot the footage or when it was taken, but ABC News has confirmed that it was taken in the vicinity of McCarran.FAA regulations generally prohibit drone operators from flying above an altitude of 400 feet, near other aircraft or in controlled airspace like the area near an airport. There are, however, instances in which pilots can apply to have those rules waived under specific circumstances. It's not clear under which regulations this pilot was flying.According to the agency's website, flying a drone in a manner deemed reckless could lead to fines or criminal action.In addition to the FAA, the local police department is now investigating the incident and the FBI "was made aware of it as well," according to ABC affiliate KTNV-TV. Drone U, a company that offers drone flying and photography services, posted the video to Facebook along with a message condemning what they called a "reckless and criminal act.""Drone U and it's [sic] members work tirelessly in making our skies safe for all users of the National Airspace System. This pilot's actions not only endangered the flying public, but has the potential to discredit an entire [Small Unmanned Aircraft System] industry," the company wrote. "It is the opinion of Drone U and it's [sic] members that the pilot receive swift and just punishment for this example of irresponsible and reckless flight."Some online viewers have speculated that the footage could be fake, with the possibility raised that the footage was crafted using shots from a video game.

The Michael Komape trial wrapped up on Friday in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane, with counsel for the family, Vincent Maleka, asking Judge Gerrit Muller to compel the provincial Department of Education to attend to the dire state of school sanitation in the province.
Five-year-old Michael drowned in a pit toilet at a school near Polokwane in 2014. Limpopo's Department of Education has already admitted liability for the death. It now remains for the court to decide on the amount of damages to be awarded to the family, which is seeking compensation for emotional shock, trauma and grief.
The state has opposed calls for so-called Constitutional damages on top of the common law damages being claimed by the family.
Much of the argument in the last two days centred around whether the Limpopo Department of Education should be compelled to address the sanitation backlog of schools in the province, and by what means.
The court raised the prospect of a so-called structural interdict, which would likely compel the Department to address its sanitation backlog within a fixed time period.
Maleka argued against this on the basis that it would require each violation of the interdict to be argued afresh in court. The Department was unlikely to comply with a structural interdict, given its tardiness in addressing the existing sanitation backlog in schools, they said.
They asked instead for the judge to develop a common law remedy which would allow specific damages for grief, or alternatively for damages specifically related to violations of the family's Constitutional rights, such as the right to life, dignity and equality.
They also asked for a declaratory order declaring that the Department has failed in fulfilling certain of its Constitutional obligations. Such an order would have a practical effect, said Maleka. It would hold the Department accountable for its violations of the Constitution, and it would vindicate the rights of Michael Komape and other learners in the province.
It would also give teeth to the Constitution, in that basic education envisaged by the Constitution is impossible without functional school toilets.
“There surely cannot be justice for Michael Komape if the defendants are allowed to plunder the public purse to pay the damages for their willful negligence without any further sanction. As we stated earlier, this case requires a judicial sanction that is exemplary and the declaratory order is an important component of the groundbreaking relief that we ask this Court to grant,” said Maleka.
Oral evidence in November last year showed the Limpopo Department's sanitation and toilet system to be among the worst in the country. Even the Department's own annual reports show the extent of the sanitation backlog in the province's schools. The court heard evidence that funds earmarked for sanitation infrastructure went unspent several years in a row and were then returned to the National Treasury.
In their heads of argument, Maleka pointed to the legacy of apartheid-era discrimination that afflicted rural schools. “We submit that the fact that Michael was an African learner living in a village in Limpopo and that they died in a school toilet is not a coincidence. It is precisely because Michael was an African learner at a rural public school that they died and that they died in the manner in which they did. It is difficult to argue that this could have happened to a learner of another race or in an urban school. It follows then, that this type of pain, suffering and grief could not have befallen anyone other than a rural African family.”
Judgment was reserved. It remains to be seen whether this turns out to be a precedent-setting case that provides backbone to the Constitution and holds government departments accountable for their actions and omissions. This is the outcome being sought by Maleka and public interest law firm SECTION27, which is representing the Komape family. If the Komapes are successful in their case, it will force government departments to examine their actions in light of Constitutional rights to equality, dignity, and to life. It will force government departments to re-prioritiseg budgets to avert the kind of tragedy that befell Michael Komape in 2014. DM

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (WOWO/AP): People at rallies in Indiana are taking a stand against racism in response to a white supremacist rally that spiraled into deadly violence over the weekend in Virginia.
Jim Sims, president of the Monroe County NAACP branch, told a crowd on Sunday night in Bloomington that hatred, hate speech and hate groups won't be tolerated.
In Indianapolis, hundreds of people filled the stairs of Monument Circle on Sunday evening to sit in solidarity with the victims of Charlottesville.
President Trump Monday condemned the violent car attack by an Ohio man that left one woman dead and almost two dozen injured, specifically calling out and denouncing the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists after receiving criticism for not doing so in an earlier statement.
Former Indiana Governor and current Vice President, Mike Pence, also denounced the groups by name over the weekend.

KARACHI - Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) Chief Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi on Tuesday said they would make Pakistan Islamic welfare state as per the vision of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Addressing ‘Meet the Press' here at Karachi Press Club, Rizvi was of the view that the rulers had made the amendments in the constitution for their own interest. They vowed that the TLP would form a next government and reduce the luxury expenditures of the cabinet to spend the same for the public welfare.
They reiterated that the TLP would eradicate the interest system, get the looted money returned to the country, implement uniform judicial and education system for all. “Common men are being convicted for ordinary offences for last 70 years but those who have plundered the national exchequer are roaming freely. But now this will not be happened as we will make audit of everyone whose assets are beyond Rs 30 million,” Rizvi said.
That in the TLP's government, 33 per cent fine would be imposed on those who fail to give their money trail and the one's entire assets would be confiscated if they are found involved in corruption.
The TLP chief said the party has fielded 571 candidates across the country but did not get even a single rupee from any of them for awarding the ticket, accusing other parties of taking money from their candidates.
After an incredible career, Randy Moss on Saturday night became the first wide receiver elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the first ballot since Jerry Rice in 2010.
Moss spent four of their 14 seasons with the New England Patriots and was a huge contributor to the Patriots' perfect regular season in 2007. They had 98 receptions for 1,493 yards and an NFL-record 23 touchdowns that season.
The majority of Moss' career was spent with the Minnesota Vikings, where their speed (4.24 in the 40) and height (6 feet 4) were primarily showcased. Their hands were exceptional as well — they coined the term getting “Mossed,” which is universally used among football players.
Moss finished their career with 982 receptions, 15,982 receiving yards and 156 receiving touchdowns. Other accolades include six Pro Bowl appearances and four first-team All-Pro honors. They led the NFL in receiving touchdowns five times in their career.
They did not win a Super Bowl, but they came close after scoring a touchdown with two minutes left against the New York Giants to put the Patriots ahead in Super Bowl XLII after the 2007 season. But David Tyree's famous catch kept the Giants alive, and they won the game moments later.
The other Hall of Fame selection for the 2018 class are Terrell Owens, Ray Lewis, Brian Dawkins, Brian Urlacher, Bobby Beathard, Robert Brazile and Jerry Kramer.

Pakistan has a strong 37 million mobile broadband (MBB) subscriber according to Phoneworld.com. One of the most important reason cited behind increasing social media users in the country is the successful penetration of 3G/4G technology in Pakistan.
Social media has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern day communication, and Pakistani users seem to be utilsing and capitalising the available opportunity. The total number of Pakistani social media accounts crossed the 44 million mark, according to the statistics released by social media companies.
Facebook surpassed all others applications at 30 million users across Pakistan, according to stats provided by PTA as on November 15, 2016. LiINE stood at 7.1 million users as per October 15, 2016, followed by Instagram with 3.9 million active users (source: Business Manager Dashboard).
Twitter and Snapchat trailed behind others at 3.1 million users as of July 2016 and 0.4 million users as of January 2017, respectively. Social media in Pakistan is frequently used for various reasons that include e-commerce, socio-political discussions, social vigilantism, and political activism.

Development of a next-generation Audi Q3 is well underway as our latest spy shots confirm.
The new compact crossover SUV is expected on sale in 2019, as a 2020 model, and so far it doesn't appear that Audi will be pulling any surprises regarding the design.
The vehicle should resemble a scaled down version of the latest Q5 albeit with a more dynamically proportioned body.
The platform residing under said body will be the familiar MQB design used by the Volkswagen Group for compact cars and non-premium mid-size models.
Look for turbocharged inline-4 engines predominantly, though a plug-in hybrid option may be offered at some point. We're also expecting a repeat of the RS Q3 with the same 400-horsepower 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 found in the latest RS 3. The good news is that Audi Sport should offer the RS Q3 in the United States this time around.
The redesigned Q3 is just one of at least five new SUVs Audi has in the works. The others are the electric e-tron and e-tron Sportback models, plus the Q4 and Q8 coupe-like offerings. There are also rumors Audi is working on a Q1 subcompact SUV based on its next-generation A1.
AMESBURY, ENGLAND—British counterterrorism police were investigating Wednesday after two people were left in critical condition, exposed to an unknown substance a few kilometres from where a former Russian spy and their daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent. The Wiltshire Police force declared a “major incident” after a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalized after being found unconscious at a residential building in Amesbury, 13 kilometres from Salisbury, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4.

( Matt Dunham / The associated Press )
London's Metropolitan Police force said “given the recent events in Salisbury,” counterterrorism officers were working with local police on the investigation. Police cordoned off the building and other places the two people visited before falling ill, but health officials said there was not believed to be a wider risk to the public. The man and woman were sent Saturday to Salisbury District Hospital, where the Skripals spent weeks in critical condition after being poisoned. Police said authorities initially believed the latest victims might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.

“However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,” police said in a statement. “At this stage, it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed.” A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency.

Chemical watchdog rejects Russia's claim of 2nd nerve agent found in U.K. city where ex-spy was poisoned Sergei Skripal, 66, is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap. They had been living quietly in Salisbury, a cathedral city 145 kilometres southwest of London, when they were struck down along with their 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was visiting him.

Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals with a nerve agent known as Novichok, a group of chemical weapons developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Moscow denies the allegation. The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides. Residents in Amesbury, a quiet neighbourhood of newly built houses and apartments, said they had received little information about the unknown substance from authorities. “Amesbury's a lovely place — it's very quiet, uneventful,” said Rosemary Northing, who lives a couple of hundred yards (meters) away from the cordoned-off building. “So for this to happen, and the media response and the uncertainty, it's unsettling.” Neighbours said police cars and fire engines descended on the home late Saturday. Student Chloe Edwards said they saw people in “green suits” — like those worn by forensics officers — and their family was told to stay inside their home for several hours. “We wanted to know what happened. And with the Russian attack happening not long ago, we just assumed the worst,” said Edwards. Police from 40 departments in England and Wales had just returned home in June after months of working on the Skripals' poisoning. Wiltshire Police spent about £7.5 million pounds ($13 million) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals' poisoning and believe that their front door was contaminated with the nerve agent. After being found unconscious in the street, the Skripals spent weeks in critical condition. Doctors who treated them say they have made a remarkable recovery but they still don't know what the Skirpals' long-term prognosis is. The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their protection.

LOS ANGELES-Madonna's lyrics and details of their new songs have been leaked online.
The 'Like a Prayer' hitmaker has recorded a number of tracks to accompany their first new song in three years, 'Beautiful Game' - produced by 'Die Another Day' producer Mirwais - which they performed at the Met Gala earlier their month.
The songs recorded for Madonna's 14th album reportedly include some of the Queen of Pop's most personal and controversial lyrics to date.
An insider told The Sun newspaper: ''Madonna is desperate to make their 14th album their most cutting edge yet.
''She is going to be furious that their early work is already being leaked when the whole point is for it to have a shock impact.'' The 'Into The Grove' hitmaker is also believed to rap parts of the song.
'Dos Hermano' is partly sung in Spanish and is a slow ballad about two brothers who are separated by immigration laws.
Whilst 'Turn Back Time' is believed to have been co-written with Joe Henry - who last worked with Madonna on 2012's 'Falling Free' - and reportedly sees Madonna reflect on having an abortion when they were young and all the things the child has missed out on.
'Smartgun' tells the story of a black boy who is shot by police, and 'Persistence' features the repeated line: ''If you want something, you have to ask for it.'' It's not the first time Madonna has fallen victim to an album leak.
In 2015, the singer was left infuriated when tracks from 'Rebel Heart' appeared online.
The culprit was arrested in Tel Aviv by the Lahav 433 crime-fighting agency for ''breaking into'' their computer.
The 'Hung Up' hitmaker expressed their relief at the news, writing on Facebook: ''I am profoundly grateful to the FBI, the Israeli Police investigators and anyone else who helped lead to the arrest of this hacker. I deeply appreciate my fans who have provided us with pertinent information and continue to do so regarding leaks of my music. Like any citizen, I have the right to privacy.
''This invasion into my life - creatively, professionally, and personally remains a deeply devastating and hurtful experience, as it must be for all artists who are victims of this type of crime.''

The United States is ready to make a "decisive" response to North Korea's possible attack near its territory of Guam, but its focus in dealing with the recalcitrant regime is placed on diplomatic efforts and economic pressure, its top military officer said Monday.Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairperson of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the US is seeking a peaceful resolution to the North Korea's nuclear and missile issue, according to a pool report."Our job is to make sure our leadership has an option available to them," Dunford told a group of reporters. "I believe there are two things we are clear about: One, our responsibility to defend against attack, two, our requirement to make sure we have a decisive response in the event of attack.""We are capable of defending them (American and Korean people) right now, against limited attacks and certainly are prepared to be strong in case of deterrent fails," they added.Dunford arrived in South Korea on Sunday for a two-day visit, the second leg of their tour to Asia which also includes stops in Japan and China.His remark came amid a flurry of exchanges of bellicose rhetoric between the US President Donald Trump and the Pyongyang government after it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The UN Security Council adopted a fresh US-led sanctions resolution on the North in early August.North Korea's military said last week that it will finalize a plan by mid-August to launch four intermediate-range ballistic missiles near the US Pacific island of Guam, home to key American air and naval bases.Trump said that the North will meet "fire and fury" should it continue to threaten the US They also warned that military solutions are "in place, locked and loaded."There are concerns here that any miscalculation may trigger an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula. But key US officials dismissed the possibility of an imminent war with North Korea.Earlier in the day, Dunford met with President Moon Jae-in and said military options will come only after sanctions fail.Dunford told reporters they did not discuss adjusting the two-week joint military drill between Seoul and Washington slated for late August.North Korea has claimed that the exercises are rehearsals for a northern invasion, despite reassurance by Seoul and Washington that they are defensive in nature."These exercises are in developing our operability, developing our readiness and forces here in the Korean Peninsula, in case of deterrent fails, but we did not have the conversation here," they said.The chairperson stressed the role of China in applying sanctions and pressure for Pyongyang's denuclearization."One of the real purpose of my China trip...is military-to-military relations that will result in mitigating the risks of miscalculations and making sure that we have the ability to communicate in a crisis that is an important thing," they said.

Valentine's day is around the corner so men and women everywhere are racking their brains for the perfect present. Buying a gift for men though can be a stressful experience. Be it a birthday, celebration or personal milestone, many men and women find it difficult to figure out what their male friends or significant others want. That's why TVF decided to perform a public service and ask the guys directly what they loved. So, the next time you're running around to buy a gift for a man, just pick something from the list below and thank us later.
Watches: A watch can complete a man's ensemble and quickly become a talking (or bragging) point at a party. If your man loves classics, a vintage HMT (if you can find one) with a metal strap should be your brand of choice. For fun-loving guys, try a Swatch watch with a pop-coloured leather strap or even a watch with Swarovski crystal studded dials from a variety of watchmakers. Fossil's unconventional dials will delight a creative or artistic soul. Alternatively, the G-shock collection by Casio is reasonably priced, waterproof and perfect for those who love adventure sports. If your man is a fitness enthusiast, surprise them with an excellent fitness band from GoQii.

Whisky: A well stocked bar is every man's pride and joy. Whisky, especially scotch is an extremely popular gift with men. It is a gift that can be displayed with pride and shared on occasions with friends and family. Scotch is any whisky (single malt or blended) that comes from Scotland, is usually aged for at least three years (often more) and distilled twice. Each region in Scotland produces whisky with a distinct flavor. Spirits from Islay, like Laphroaig, tend to have a strong peat flavor while single malts from Speyside tend to be lighter and sweeter. Connoisseurs will sing praises of the golden colour of blends like Johnny Walker or Black and White, and the smoky taste of Scotch whiskies like Black Dog. If your partner is truly mad about malts, go the whole hog and surprise them with a malt tour in Scotland - the ultimate whisky experience.

Jackets: For a more personal touch, a jacket can be quite an apt gift. A romantic-at-heart will love a traditional bandhgala while bike enthusiasts swear by their weather-worn leather jackets. Blazers are great day-to-night apparel, looking perfectly at home in the office or in a bar. You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to brands and designers: high street labels like Blackberry's and Zara offer trendy outerwear at affordable prices. Custom made jackets like the ones from Raymond's Made-To-Measure collection or the Bombay Shirt Company are also a great option, if you really want to get creative with the design.
Sunglasses: If your friend is a globetrotter, a smart pair of shades will delight them like nothing else. Whether they are sunbathing in the Maldives, chasing zebras in Tanzania or skiing in Courchevel, this travel accessory adds an instant glam quotient to almost every type of holiday. Recent sunglass trends have been a major throwback to retro shapes inspired from Hollywood films like Tom Cruise's aviators from Top Gun, Steve McQueen's Persols from The Thomas Crown Affair or the wayfarers sported by the lead actors in The Blues Brothers. You'll find many variations at high street brands like H&M and Diesel but if you can stretch the budget, pick up a good quality pair from Burberry or Louis Vuitton. Better yet, buy a unisex design that you can borrow when your heart desires!

Headphones: Most guys love their music, whether their choice of genre is soft rock, hard metal or folk fusion. So, it makes sense that headphones are on the list of the most popular gifts loved by men. Make sure you know what you're looking for when it comes to buying headphones. For style combined with comfort, Skull Candy headphones come in a fun palette of colours. For amazing sound quality and pumping bass, you can opt for Shure or Sennheiser; they may look basic but deliver on their audio capabilities. Audio-Technica headphones are also gaining a cult following among audiophiles for their excellent sound clarity. If your man listens to music while working out, get the Jabra Sports in-ear headphones which are made for the gym. Though it feels pragmatic, this gift will be treasured by all music lovers.
So, take a pick from this list and the guy you gift will be indebted to you for life! For more great gifting ideas, see here.

LOS ANGELES (AP)  Relievers Pedro Baez and Ross Stripling are on the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for their NL Division Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Outfielder Joc Pederson and utility player Tim Locastro didn't make the lineup announced by Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts on Friday before Game 1 at Dodger Stadium.
Arizona made two changes to its roster from the wild-card game against Colorado, adding Game 1 starter Taijuan Walker and Pacific Coast League MVP Christian Walker while dropping outfielder Rey Fuentes and catcher Chris Herrmann.
Baez made a team-leading 66 relief appearances this season, but was a target of derision for Dodgers fans while posting a 2.95 ERA. After two dismal appearances in early September, they didn't allow a run while striking out seven over four scoreless appearances to end the regular season.

Roberts has been a firm supporter of Baez, who has pitched for the Dodgers since 2014. The 29-year-old Dominican right-hander has a career 6.52 ERA in 11 postseason appearances.
"I'm definitely confident that they have worked out their issues," Roberts said this week.
Stripling was busy all year for the Dodgers, working 74 1-3 innings in a season that included two starts. But they also hit the postseason with questions after posting a 6.08 ERA in their final 13 appearances.
The Dodgers kept 12 pitchers, including eight relievers, at the expense of the speedy Locastro, who could have been a pinch-running specialist. Los Angeles also kept Kyle Farmer as a third catcher behind Yasmani Grandal and Austin Barnes.
Pederson, the Dodgers' slugging outfielder, also was left off the roster after batting .071 with no homers after July. Roberts instead went with Farmer, who played in only 20 games for Los Angeles this season.
Taijuan Walker will make their postseason debut in Game 1 for Arizona against Clayton Kershaw, stepping up after Arizona was forced to use presumptive Game 1 starter Robbie Ray in relief against Colorado.
Christian Walker batted .309 with 32 homers for Triple-A Reno, but they have only 39 career at-bats in the big leagues. They will provide a right-handed power threat off the Diamondbacks' bench.
Infielder Chris Owings also was left off Arizona's roster. They broke their right middle finger in July, but is close to returning.

The Calgary Flames returned to the postseason this week for the first time in two seasons, pitted against the Anaheim Ducks in a first round match-up. While the Flames lost both games in Anaheim by identical 3-2 scores – running their winless streak at the Honda Center to 29 consecutive games – they appeared a much better match for the Ducks than they were when they met two years ago. Three key things became evident during the first two games in Anaheim that may point to the Flames turning things around when the series moves to Calgary for Games 3 and 4.
Forward Depth Is Better Than Expected
Heading into the series, the big question was whether Calgary's top two lines could hang with Anaheim's top two lines. The good news is that the groups centered by Sean Monahan and Mikael Backlund have been fairly effective in neutralizing the Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler lines. The surprising aspect of this series has been how well Calgary's third line of Sam Bennett, Kris Versteeg and Alex Chiasson have fared against Anaheim's third unit of Antoine Vermette, Corey Perry and one of Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie. The Ducks have struggled to contain the Bennett line's mixture of speed, physicality and creativity. Case in point: Versteeg set up Bennett for a goal in Game 1 with a gorgeous no-look behind-the-back pass. That goal was preceded by a shift where Chiasson made two or three smart moves with the puck to keep possession. Those types of shifts have occurred on several occasions for the Flames.
At even strength, the emergence of the Bennett line as a scoring threat has really caught the Ducks off-guard and given the Flames an advantage in those situations.
Lack of Discipline
Despite playing quite well over the first two games of the series, the Flames are down 2-0 primarily due to a lack of discipline. Simply put: they're taking dumb penalties at dumb times.
Dougie Hamilton taking a tripping penalty in the first minute of Game 1 after stopping skating to complain to the officials about a perceived too many men violation by the Ducks. The Ducks power play resulted in a goal and the Flames chasing for much of the remainder of the game.
Lance Bouma taking a goalie interference penalty immediately after the Flames killed off a Hamilton tripping penalty while the game was tied. The Flames gained momentum from the initial kill and the Ducks scored the eventual game-winning goal on the subsequent power play, killing the Flames' momentum.
Hamilton taking a cross-checking penalty in the third period of Game 1 after Mark Giordano took a big hit from Ducks forward Ryan Getzlaf. The Flames managed to kill that penalty off, but the penalty halted their momentum in a game they were pushing to tie up.
T.J. Brodie taking a cross-checking penalty behind the play in the third period of Game 2 on Ducks forward Ryan Kesler. The penalty immediately followed the Flames getting scored on and really hurt their ability to push for a tying goal.
Each of the “discipline” examples had the wrong guy taking the wrong penalty at the precise wrong time, derailing Calgary's momentum and giving the Ducks several chances to take hold of each game.
Lack of Focus
In addition to displaying a lack of discipline at times, the young Flames group has seemingly wilted at times under the bright lines of the playoffs by displaying a lack of situational focus. Some examples:
Hamilton's asupervisorstioned tripping penalty in Game 1.
All three forwards and both defensemen getting caught on a bad line change in Game 1, resulting on a three-on-none rush for the Ducks and the game-tying goal.
Bouma's asupervisorstioned goalie interference penalty in Game 1.
Jakub Silfverberg's goal in Game 2, an uncontested wrist shot that just beat Brian Elliott over their shoulder.
Rickard Rakell's wrap-around goal in Game 2, on a dump-in play where all of Calgary's skaters went after the initial puck-carrier and left Rakell all alone.
Each “focus” problem involved the Flames losing track of a player for several seconds, or otherwise stepping over the line and derailing their team's game plan.
Hope Still Exists
The Flames are down 2-0 in their series. It's not an ideal start. But the Flames have been able to go toe-to-toe with the Ducks for the most part. If they can rein in some of their disciplinary and focus issues while maintaining the rest of their standard of play, they can potentially push the Ducks to their limit or even win the series.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Crystal Palace winger Bakary Sako will miss the rest of the season after fracturing their ankle, manager Roy Hodgson said on Friday.
Sako limped off in the first half of Palace's 1-1 Premier League draw at West Ham United on Tuesday.
Hodgson said the 29-year-old, who has scored six goals in all competitions this season, suffered damage to their ankle ligaments and remains a doubt to be fit for the start of the 2018-19 campaign.
“Baky's injury is a very serious one. He's fractured their ankle and damaged ligaments around it,” the former England manager told reporters.
“He certainly won't play again this season and may be a doubt to be fit for the start of next.”
Hodgson described the type of injuries to hit their squad this season as “unusual” as they have just 19 players to choose from for Sunday's league fixture against Newcastle United.
“Our injury situation is unusual. A lot of clubs can get a number of muscle injuries, but we're in a situation where we've lost five for the season,” they said.
“(Christian) Benteke, (Wilfried) Zaha, and (Mamadou) Sakho all spent at least 6 weeks out earlier in the season.”
Hodgson added that Norwegian new signing Alexander Sorloth will replace Sako in the squad at Selhurst Park this weekend. (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge)

In this edition of our Bruins roundtable, we asked our B's writers which rookie exceeded their expectations the most in the 2017-18 campaign. Unsurprisingly, Jake DeBrusk's name rang through the answers as the player who began the season on the bubble but who cemented themselves into a fan-favorite with their talent and, more importantly, their work ethic.
Check out what Brandon Share-Cohen, Drew Johnson and myself had to say about DeBrusk, and another B's forward.
BSC: Jake DeBrusk
While the results didn't always reflect it, Jake DeBrusk's effort throughout the season was unquestioned and commendable. Before they broke out in the postseason, their impact on the roster was felt from their tireless work ethic and hard-nosed style of play. They were far-and-away the most surprising rookie for me as I wasn't entirely sure he'd make the roster on opening day.
With that said, they went from “possible roster bubble” to “untouchable trade piece” in just one season in my mind. They have the potential for 30-goal and 60-70-point seasons in the NHL and their ability to make others around them better shouldn't be understated.
Drew Johnson: Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen
DeBrusk was the young gun who exceeded my expectations last season. While they were streaky, they showed that they have the potential to be a consistent goal-scorer in the NHL and will likely be a reliable top-six forward for some time. I expect them to become a permanent member of the second line during the 2018-19 campaign.
Danton Heinen also impressed me. Going into the 2017-18 season, I expected them to push for a roster spot but was 50/50 on whether or not they would stick. Clearly, they did, and I believe they will continue to develop into a solid third-line winger. While I have yet to see consistency from Heien, especially in their two-way game, I expect that will come in time.
Cam Hasbrouck: Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen
Just like the two fellas who answered before me, Jake DeBrusk was my first choice for Boston's most surprising rookie. As a first-round draft pick, it may seem silly to be surprised by a strong rookie campaign, but DeBrusk's first season in the big show was exceptional. Their 43 points were solid, but those who consistently watched the B's last season know that DeBrusk brought more to the table than pretty stats.
The 21-year-old left a mark with their consistently exceptional effort, their willingness to work in the dirty areas, and their refusal to quit on any play. They quickly transformed from a player with a bright future to becoming a staple in Boston's nightly lineup. Just one season into their career, the youngster should be considered nearly untouchable in trade conversations.
Like Drew, I was also impressed with the level of play that we saw from Danton Heinen at points throughout the season. The former Denver standout wasn't the most consistent producer for the Bruins last season, but when they found their game they were a force. Heinen demonstrated natural offensive abilities and earned their spot as a regular in Boston's competitive lineup. If they can work on those skills and find a way to produce on a regular basis, they could have a very bright future in Boston.
Lastly, I'd like to address a player who was not mentioned in this piece: Charlie McAvoy. While McAvoy had a very strong rookie season, they were left out of this conversation because they were the Bruins rookie to watch coming into the season. So while they did have a big impact on Boston's success this season, it wasn't necessarily a surprise to any of our writers, so hold the riots.
After missing out on John Tavares, the Bruins aren't quite where they want to be entering the 2018-19 season in the powerhouse Atlantic Division. In all likelihood, the Bruins still have some moves to make this offseason. But assuming the players mentioned above remain in black and gold, they'll be worth keeping a close eye on right from the start of camp this fall.
* Tottenham beat Newcastle 2-0 at St James's Park
* Dele Alli and Ben Davies scored in the second half
* Newcastle had Jonjo Shelvey sent off in the 48th minute
* Former Newcastle midfielder Sissoko jeered by home fans
* England midfielder Alli shone for the visitors
* Tottenham host Chelsea next, Newcastle visit Huddersfield NEWCASTLE UNITED 0 TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 2
Aug 13 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur got their Premier League campaign on track with a clinical 2-0 win at 10-man Newcastle United on Sunday after Dele Alli scored one goal and helped create the other at St James's Park.
Alli broke the deadlock on the hour after promoted Newcastle had Jonjo Shelvey was sent off in the 48th minute for stomping on the England midfielder and set up the second for left back Ben Davies along with Christian Eriksen.
A tepid contest devoid of goalmouth action in the opening half sprung to life after Shelvey was dismissed for a petulant stomp on Alli, who pulled all the strings for last season's Premier League runners-up.
They swept home Eriksen's inch-perfect cross and then helped the Dane carve open the home team's defence with a quick one-two which left Davies with a simple finish from seven metres.
Caltrain has a problem.
Passenger numbers are exploding thanks to the Bay Area's tech boom, and service has not kept up with demand. Peak trains are full, and it is difficult to find the capacity to run more. Service frequency is the same as it was in the late 2000s, but daily ridership has grown from 36,000 in 2009 to 62,000 in 2016.
Riding outside rush hour is no better: off-peak trains don't come frequently enough, and take more than an hour and a half to go between San Francisco and San Jose.
All of Caltrain's problems have solutions. These involve smart investments in better service and one of the keys is the Caltrain electrification project. For $2 billion, it would wire the line between San Francisco and San Jose and buy new high-performance electric trains, reducing local travel time by twenty minutes.
And yet, the Republican Party is threatening to cancel the project.
Caltrain is seeking $647 million in federal funds, but the state's entire Republican Congressional delegation sent Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao a letter demanding that they freeze funding until California did a new audit of high-speed rail.
In effect, the Republican delegation wants the Trump administration to hold Caltrain hostage in order to force the state to cancel high-speed rail. Residents of the Bay Area and supporters of good government should be prepared to fight this move.
The Republicans do not have anything against Caltrain electrification. It is not as flashy as California High-Speed Rail, and up until now did not attract much attention from opponents of rail expansion. But it is a necessary step for bringing high-speed rail all the way to San Francisco since high-speed trains must be electric.
As a result, it is threatened with the chopping block. To the state's Republican delegation, grandstanding about California High-Speed Rail is more important than solving the regional transportation woes of the Bay Area.
It is not just high-speed rail that requires Caltrain electrification. Two other regionally beneficial investments rely on the project as well.
The first is the Downtown Extension, which would bring trains from their current terminus at 4th and King to Transbay Terminal. Not many people work in Mission Bay near 4th and King; in contrast, based on analysis done by rail activist Clem Tillier, there are more than 100,000 middle- and high-income jobs within a half-mile radius of Transbay Terminal, more than within the same radius of every Caltrain station from 4th and King down to Gilroy, combined. The Downtown Extension tunnel would not be able to accommodate diesel trains because of the fumes.
Second, capacity upgrades require adding tracks. The Caltrain corridor has just two tracks, one in each direction. This means mixing express and local trains require carefully timing the schedules so that the fast trains don't get stuck behind the slow ones. Electric trains accelerate much faster than diesel trains, which reduces the speed difference between trains that make all stops and trains that only stop at Baby Bullet stations.
Even then, some infrastructure for timed overtakes is required for additional capacity. High-speed rail includes money for such overtakes, which is useful for Caltrain as well. Electrification reduces the required scope of investment into overtakes.
In addition to capital investment, electrification is necessary for solving Caltrain's problem of poor frequency. To run the Baby Bullet express trains, Caltrain had to cut service to the local stations. Several stations have only hourly service even at rush hour, even stations that are close to many suburban homes and jobs and had high ridership until the Baby Bullet came], such as California Avenue.
Because electrification reduces the speed difference between local and express trains, it would permit Caltrain to run frequent rush hour service to these stations, in both directions, for both traditional and reverse commuters.
All of these benefits together add up. Caltrain expects 100,000 passengers per weekday by 2040. If local trains go between San Francisco Transbay Terminal and San Jose in an hour and twenty minutes, and Baby Bullets in fifty, then this ridership level is not hard to reach. Ridership is already growing, and is limited by capacity and by poor service, both of which become easy to solve if Caltrain is electrified.
There is room for making Caltrain's modernization project better. Its cost per mile is very high, for technical reasons some of which can be fixed. For example, the masts holding up the catenary wires are spaced more closely than is standard, and this raises the cost of installation. However, the high benefits of the project ensure that even at the current cost, it is worth it. Per rider, the cost is only about $20,000, one of the lowest costs of any rail project in the US today; the cheapest on President Trump's wishlist is about $50,000.
The state's Republican delegation is unlikely to be able to stop high-speed rail. Nor is it interested in reforming high-speed rail to be cheaper. The delegation's request for an audit rings similar to rail cancellations in Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin after the 2010 election brought Tea Party-supported Republican governors to this state—cancellations that led the federal government to divert more high-speed rail stimulus money to California. Even with its $3.3 billion in federal funds, California High-Speed Rail is increasingly relying on state money, from the cap-and-trade fund in addition to the Prop 1A ballot money.
Instead, the Republican delegation is going after a rail extension that is much smaller in scope than high-speed rail and has less room for future cost overruns or ridership shortfalls. Its attempt to force the state's hand to shrink the role of government is leading to bad government. Instead of fighting off government waste, it is fighting off worthwhile public investments in order to make a political point.
To call your elected representatives in Congress, you may use the following script:
Hi, I am [say your name] from [say where you live]. I'm calling to urge you to voice your support of the Caltrain electrification project. It is more cost-effective than any mass transit project that the administration would like to fund, but California's Republican delegation wants to choke federal funds to it, since it is a necessary component of California High-Speed Rail. Caltrain electrification has many benefits to local commuters who are stuck in traffic, regardless of what happens with high-speed rail, but the state Republicans want to hold it hostage until they get high-speed rail canceled. You owe it to your constituents to do what you can to make sure good public investments like Caltrain electrification get the funding that they need and are not held hostage to grandstanding.

TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices recovered, pulling the 10-year yield off 6-1/2-month highs, after the Bank of Japan acted decisively on Friday to curb a rise in bond yields, by offering “unlimited” buying in long-term Japanese government bonds.
The measure was the most important weapon for the BOJ to achieve its ultra-loose policy mandate -- the yield curve control (YCC) policy -- in which it aims to keep the 10-year JGB yield “around zero percent”.
The BOJ offered to buy 10-year JGBs at the yield of 0.110 percent, the same level it had offered unlimited buying twice last year.
Such buying at a specific yield level is considered the most powerful show of force in directing the market, compared with its regular bond purchases through auctions.
On top of that, the BOJ increased the amount of its planned buying through auction in five- to 10-year JGBs to 450 billion yen ($4.10 billion) from the 410 billion amounts it has favoured since late August.
“Today's operations have clarified the BOJ's stance (to keep the 10-year JGB yield from rising above 0.110 percent.) Concerns in markets should recede for now,” Noriko Tada, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
The price of the 10-year JGB futures rose to 150.28, from the day's low of 150.09 and up 0.08 on the day.
The benchmark 10-year cash JGB yield edged down to 0.090 percent, the same level as its previous close, from 0.095 percent touched earlier.
JGB yields have risen in recent weeks, in line with global peers, on rising expectations that the world's central banks are increasingly leaning towards winding back stimulus as the global economy gains momentum.
Investors have started to speculate that the BOJ could also be moving towards an exit from ultra-easy monetary policy, although BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has denied that they were considering such a major adjustment in the near future.
“I think the BOJ took pre-emptive steps to fend off further rises in JGB yields. JGB prices recovered so I think it was a success at least for now,” said Naoya Oshikubo, yen rates strategist at Barclays.
“But given that the main reason for higher yields comes from foreign bonds, the market will likely remain capped,” they added. ($1 = 109.6800 yen) (Editing by Eric Meijer and Jacqueline Wong)

A Farmington Hills man, already a registered sex offender, learned they could spend 25 years in prison for producing child pornography, sentenced Monday in Detroit to federal prison.
Timothy Allen Fulgenzi, 38, pleaded guilty to that charge as well as a charge of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual conduct.
Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Lemisch announced the sentencing, which was passed down by U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh III.
In July of 2015, a national manhunt was conducted by police searching for a missing 15-year-old girl, whose family had learned was having a relationship with Fulgenzi. They fled with her, stealing a car in Northville, and was later found in Tennessee, after they had called police in Farmington Hills and denied they were with him.

MIAMI, Fl., January 31, 2018: Young Caribbean footballers get another shot at the big league as Manchester United, in partnership with Flow, host the second Flow Skills Ultimate Football Experience across the region with the launch on January 27 in Jamaica. Every young footballer's dream is to play on the global stage and with Flow Skills that dream is within reach as Caribbean football clubs and coaches prepare youngsters to come out for the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) endorsed initiative so they can get a chance to be seen by some of the world's top coaches and Manchester United Legends. In fact, Manchester United Ambassador, Dennis Irwin accompanied by Manchester United Soccer School (MUSS) coaches will attend the launch event and will make appearances in other markets during the course of the competition through to its culmination in Trinidad on Monday, March 26, 2018.
“What an opportunity! When I was a young footballer myself, I'd have given anything to have a chance like this – complete access to legends and coaches we'd only see on TV. With Flow Skills, today's talented young Caribbean footballers not only get to meet these coaches face-to-face, but also to get tips and advice from the coaches and legends of the great game during ‘All Star clinics'. Wow! I'm elated, to say the least, and I'm really proud that Flow is inspiring and developing our youngsters in this way. Thanks to Manchester United, we are making a real impact on young people's lives offering them a not-to-be-missed opportunity,” said Garfield Sinclair, President of Cable & Wireless Caribbean, which operates the consumer brand Flow in the region.
In the preliminary round, eligible footballers from local clubs within Flow's 15 Caribbean markets will go through a series of specially designed skills tests recommended by MUSS and will be judged and delivered by CFU coaches. As the competition progresses to the second phase, two participants from each market, along with their respective coach, will advance to a two-day skills session in Trinidad and Tobago. There, they will experience one-on-one training with CFU and MUSS coaches. In a test of skills, two top performers will emerge and earn for themselves, their coach and a parent the opportunity to visit Old Trafford in Manchester; but more importantly the youngsters will get the chance-of-a-lifetime to participate in a talent development football camp courtesy of Manchester United and Flow.
The Caribbean Football Union's General Secretary, Neil Cochrane noted, “On behalf of the Acting President Randy Harris, the Executive Committee and Member Associations of the CFU, let me state how proud we are to once again endorse this most significant football development program. From our involvement in the inaugural staging of the initiative, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, as this has been a truly exhilarating and beneficial initiative. Hundreds of young footballers in 15 countries – half of the CFU's membership – are again getting the exposure they crave, and the opportunity to compete, hone their skills, and, hopefully fulfil their dreams. We consider this initiative as adding significant value to our portfolio of annual activities but even more important is the value that it adds to youth development and to building a solid foundation for football across the region. Once again, we welcome this partnership with Flow and Manchester United for the 2018 edition, and stand ready to get the ball rolling.
Last year's winners Ronaldo Flowers (left) of Antigua and Che Benny (right) of Trinidad experienced the dream and had this to say:
“It was great. I learned so much and got the chance to travel to Manchester and to go to Old Trafford and meet football legends.” – Ronaldo Flowers, now 14 years old.
“I will forever be grateful to Flow and Manchester United. I could not have asked for a better opportunity. My dream really did come true and today I am a better player for it.” – Che Benny, now 17 years old.
Flow Skills Ultimate Football Experience is one of several Manchester United and Flow partnership initiatives.
Participating Flow markets include: Anguilla, Antigua, Barbados, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Turks & Caicos Islands.

If we believe the social elites, it's truly a trying time to be a woman in America.
Just last November, millions of us were coerced by our own deeply embedded (very deeply, in my case) loathing of our womanhood to vote against Hillary Clinton. And now, just as we've really started getting our voices back — albeit through the trope of silent protests based on a television show not exactly representative of American society — that nefarious squad in the White House has turned the screw and ended the contraception mandate for employers who object on religious or moral grounds.
The contraception mandate, if you will recall, is that tidbit from the Obama administration that forced all employers to provide their employees with access to abortifacients (contraceptive methods that can cause abortions, such as the morning-after pill) through their health-care plans. The administration rejected requests for a religious or conscience-based exemption to the mandate, meaning that employers from Christian colleges to nuns found themselves having to choose whether to violate their deeply held pro-life convictions or to incur ruinous fines that might put them out of business.
After years of court decisions against this coercion and repeated promises from the Trump administration to restore freedom to business owners, the White House has finally moved to scrap the mandate.
To read the news, one would think this is a blow to women everywhere. Feminists are up in arms (when are they not, though?). All women, we hear, must be devastated by this decision. As the contraception-mandate battle heats up again (the ACLU has already sued the Trump administration), we're destined for a fresh round of rhetoric that wildly overgeneralizes about American women. (See, for example, Michelle Obama's assertion that all women who did not vote for Hillary “voted against their own voice.”)
Meanwhile, the women who are pleased with the reversal of the mandate — like me — will simply be disregarded.
This is a situation worth investigating: that the groups allegedly most committed to advocating for women have come up with a way to disdain and ignore a huge segment of women. Why?
There are really only a couple of ways for progressives and feminists to deal with the phenomenon of pro-life, anti-contraception women: 1) allow for the possibility that, just like men, women can have different ideas about human flourishing; or 2) conjure up some psycho-babble to demonstrate that women who disagree with progressivism by being pro-life aren't really pro-life. However freely they think they've come to their convictions, they're really hive-minded morons brainwashed by the oppressive men in their lives. The second approach, unsurprisingly, is highly favored today.
As C. S. Lewis' marvelous Professor in The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe asks, “What do they teach them in these schools?” (Don't answer that — the answer would bring tears to the old professor's eyes, probably some of them tears of laughter.) One of the things they do not teach in “these schools” is basic logic. This may be because logic has recently been demonstrated — not logically, don't worry — to be an instrument of the patriarchy. If they did teach logic, however, perhaps in their young and tender years some of these progressives would have encountered the very simple logical principle of Occam's Razor. This fine little piece of reasoning says that the simplest explanation is almost always the best. In other words, if there are two possible explanations for a phenomenon (such as the existence of pro-life women), the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is most likely correct.
If we apply Occam's Razor, we find that the common progressive explanation for the existence of conservative women is hardly an explanation at all; it is a speculation, a hurried fumbling with categories, a fabulous romp through the unverifiable hinterlands of the subconscious. It is, in other words, a series of utterly fatuous assumptions. It requires at least these assumptions (there are likely more buried in there somewhere):
1) Pro-life women cannot use language the same way as men: i.e., when a woman says, “I am pro-life,” they do not mean it in the same way a man does.
2) Women cannot be relied upon to know their own minds: i.e., when a woman expresses a conviction that goes against progressive orthodoxy, they cannot actually believe it. They must necessarily be following the dictates of male dominance, and they cannot discern this until they have ceased to believe what they believe and has accepted the rival dictates of progressivism.
3) Women cannot be relied upon to evaluate their own experiences and come to rational conclusions: i.e., women must receive conclusions from some other group (almost always made up largely of men, either regressive men or progressive men — don't forget that the sexual revolution has more fathers than mothers).
4) Women are not rational animals (though, to be fair, progressives probably don't think men are rational animals either, because they don't believe in rationality).
Pro-life women exist and are, in fact, pro-life as we commonly understand the word.
The alternative to high-jumping all of these assumptions is, of course, to recognize that pro-life women exist and are, in fact, pro-life as we commonly understand the word.
The application of Occam's Razor to the situation makes it quite clear which explanation is more likely. But to acknowledge that there is genuine disagreement between women on these matters is to invite unpleasant scrutiny of both abortion and contraception. This would mean accepting that a reasonable person could conclude that by remaining abstinent until marriage, not using contraception, and being open to life (even when that is painful or difficult, such as when a child has a severe birth defect), their life is better. This isn't a political question; it's a metaphysical one. Are we happier and more fully human when we seek a life that is completely free from limitations and where choices have no consequences, or are we more fully human when we accept limitations and recognize that our choices have consequences?
Progressives try to minimize and silence pro-life women because our presence is an existential threat. The sexual revolution takes no prisoners. It is absolutely essential to the movement that nobody's choices have consequences, because if somebody's do, it's possible that everybody's do. As the brutal facts about abortion have become impossible to deny, abortion advocates have to be able to picture themselves as warriors battling on the front lines of a cataclysmic struggle for the good of all womankind. That's the only way for them to justify the obvious and horrific collateral damage from their crusade.
It is a trying time to be a woman in America, but not for the reasons the media want us to think. We are having to grow up and face reality, and it is not a pretty sight. The reality is that unborn babies feel pain. The reality is that contraception use has dramatically changed our communities and families, and not necessarily for the better. Pro-life women who are slighted, ignored, or put down by mainstream voices should speak up, but we should also remember that when feminists and progressives ignore us, it's because they can't bear to consider the possibility that we're right.

LAHORE - The LHC Wednesday sought personal appearance of the secretaries of prosecution and SG&AD departments and other responsible officers on a petition seeking 15 per cent quota for recruitment of female prosecutors. CJ Syed Mansoor Ali Shah took up the matter and directed the officers concerned to explain as to why quota promised earlier by the government was not given to the lady lawyers.
The petitioners, through their counsel, argued that earlier on behalf of the provincial government that female lawyers would be given 15 per cent quota but later refused to honour the commitment. The counsel informed that the government had challenged this quota before Supreme Court.
They asserted that this government decision was based on malafide and should be declared as illegal. They also sought directions to recruit lady prosecutors according to the quota.
The hearing adjourned for today.

OTTAWA — A surge in full-time work fuelled a 10th-straight month of net job gains to match the economy's longest monthly streak since the financial crisis nine years ago.
Statistics Canada says September's unemployment rate stayed at a nine-year low of 6.2 per cent after the country added 10,000 net new jobs, including 112,000 full-time positions.
The rise in full-time work more than offset a drop of 102,000 part-time jobs, however, last month's job gains were entirely driven by growth in public-sector employment.
The September increase was also concentrated in factory work as the goods-producing sector added 10,500 jobs, compared to a loss of 500 positions in the services industry.
MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri said on Friday it had bought a 50 percent share in STX shipyards from France, in a deal expected to broaden an alliance between the naval industries of the two nations.
The deal, which values the stake at 59.7 million euros, ends a long dispute that strained relations between France and Italy.
French President Emmanuel Macron angered Rome in the summer by ordering a “temporary” nationalisation of STX, based in Saint-Nazaire in western France, cancelling a deal in which Fincantieri and another Italian investor had agreed to buy 55 percent.
Fincantieri said in a statement that the latest deal “represents an important first step towards the creation of a future alliance in both cruise and military naval sectors.”
Paris and Rome are exploring the creation of a Franco-Italian naval group, merging French military shipyards firm Naval Group with Fincantieri, a bid to ward off the threat from industrial powers such as China and the United States.
Fincantieri had 4.4 billion euros in revenue in 2016, and expects it to grow at least 16 percent every two years, up to 2020. Smaller STX France is the only one big enough in France to build aircraft carriers and other large warships.
Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Thursday that Italian Leonardo, which supplies land and naval defence electronics and is one of the world's 10 biggest players in the defence industry, would be part of the talks.
State-controlled Fincantieri made a bid for STX France, which specialises in building cruise ships, after the demise of South Korea's STX shipbuilding group.
Under the terms of the agreement, the French state will hold 34.34 percent of STX, Naval Group 10 percent, STX employees up to 2.4 percent and local suppliers up to 3.26 percent.
In order for Fincantieri to take effective control, the French state will lend the group a 1 percent stake. Fincantieri will nominate four members of STX's eight-person board.
In a town full of venture capital firms, Storm Ventures has made its mark with a singular focus on the enterprise. This week, the company announced it has taken on two freshly minted partners, Arun Penmetsa and Paul Willard, to continue the mission. They are doubling the number of partners with this announcement.
Penmetsa has been a principal at Storm for the last 3.5 years before being promoted to partner recently. Before joining Storm they worked as an engineer at Oracle and Google. Meanwhile, Willard, who was previously a partner at Subtraction Capital and has had stints as CMO at Atlassian and Practice Fusion also joined Storm as a partner this year.
The two men join a firm with over $800 million in assets under management and each brings real world experience working at successful enterprise companies
Willard says they felt like they found kindred spirits when started talking to the folks at Storm because their mission matched so well with their work helping young enterprise companies. “Part of the reason I came on board is I align so well with them,” Willard told TechCrunch.
As they pointed out, the company has been working with early-stage enterprise startups for the past 17 years and most VC firms in Silicon Valley are lacking that concentrated enterprise experience. “Everyone else might have a partner or two, but the enterprise is not the [primary] focus of their existence,” they said.
Penmetsa, who was hired by Storm out of graduate school at Stanford, has worked their way up the company the ladder the old fashioned way. They say working at a venture capital company that emphasizes the enterprise has its advantages. “Storm's strategy is pretty focused on enterprise and enterprise SaaS companies. We focus on that one area, and spending more time in that area, we have some sense of how [enterprise] companies evolve. It's not a blueprint, but patterns do emerge,” they explained.
In their role at Storm before the promotion, Penmetsa worked with a variety of enterprise startups including TruStar Technology, a security startup concentrating on threat information sharing and ShoCard, a blockchain identity startup. They plan to continue to looking at security, while also exploring digital healthcare as well.
Willard, who was an aerospace engineer at Boeing in the 1990s, has a passion for airline-related startups, and when they were at Subtraction they helped a number of companies including Zipline, which is building robot airplanes to deliver emergency supplies like blood and medicine and Boom, a company building a new generation of supersonic transport planes. They plan to bring that experience to bear at Storm as well. While they say that they are open to talking to any enterprise software startup, they have their eye on Robotics as a Service and drone companies in particular at the moment.
The two new partners are already on board and at work at Storm. Today marks the formal announcement of their hiring.

In this photo, Michigan State University womens volleyball coach Cathy George looks on before the teams match in East Lansing, Mich. Since becoming coach in 2005, most of their teams have featured one or more players trained by Rick Butler, a prominent volleyball coach publicly accused of sexually abusing and raping six underage girls they trained in the 1980s. Nick King  Lansing State Journal via AP
CHICAGO >> Michigan State University, already reeling from the scandal involving a gymnastics doctor who molested young athletes, maintained ties to a prominent volleyball coach long after they were publicly accused in 1995 of sexually abusing and raping six underage girls they trained in the 1980s.
Letters obtained by The Associated Press from advocates for the accusers reveal the school has been under pressure for at least a year to sever its relationship with Rick Butler. They run training facilities in suburban Chicago that for decades have been a pipeline for top volleyball recruits, including Michigan State.
Butlers accusers say they threatened to use their national influence to thwart their college prospects if they did not accept their advances.
Questions about ties to Butler add to the scrutiny of Michigan State that began when Dr. Larry Nassar was charged in 2016 with abusing scores of gymnasts over 20 years while they had an office on campus. A former dean, William Strampel, was recently charged with failing to protect patients from Nassar and with sexually harassing female students.

Colleges nationwide have recruited players trained by Butler and sent teams to play at their facilities, but one of Butlers 1995 accusers, Sarah Powers-Barnhard, said theres a special onus on Michigan State in the wake of Nassar to have nothing to do with him. Instead, they said, the school turned a blind eye to Butlers sordid history.
If we dont stop supporting the top abuser in volleyball, how can we ever claim zero tolerance for sexual abuse? they said from their Jacksonville, Florida, home.
The 63-year-old Butler has never been criminally charged. The alleged abuse occurred more than 30 years ago and was already beyond the statute of limitations for prosecution when the first three accusers came forward in 1995. Three others came forward more recently.
Powers-Barnhard said Butler molested their hundreds of times over two years starting when they were 16 and they were around 30. They say they raped them at their home, in cars and even in a train-car bathroom as their teammates sat nearby.
In a short Monday statement responding to AP questions, the university said Butler is currently not affiliated with MSU in any way. The school, it added, is not actively recruiting players from their program at this time.
The statement did not address other questions, including when any affiliation with Butler might have ended or why the university had ties to them for so long after they were publicly accused.
In a 1995 report, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services found no evidence to support Butlers claim the three athletes were lying. They acknowledged during a 1995 hearing held by USA Volleyball, the sports national governing body, that they had sex with the three. They insisted it was after they turned 18 and was consensual.
A statement issued Tuesday by their attorney, Danielle DAmbrose, said the allegations they sexually abused anyone are absolutely false. It added that their volleyball program has no affiliation with Michigan State University or any other collegiate program.
USA Volleyball in December banned Butler from its events for life, and the Amateur Athletic Union stripped them of their membership this year.
Many college coaches are reluctant to criticize the onetime Olympic team trainer. Thats partly because they consistently produce stellar recruits via their flagship company, Sports Performance Volleyball, and their 12-court Great Lakes Center. Both are in Aurora, west of Chicago.
The long list of schools that signed recruits once trained by them includes the University of Notre Dame and the University of Nebraska.
Each year, Butler holds what many colleges have considered cant-miss recruiting events showcasing their players. Coaches from around 50 schools nationwide were on a list of attendees for the event last February, though no Michigan State coaches were. Notre Dame and Nebraska also werent listed.
Coaches are afraid that if they dont show deference to Butler, hell steer recruits to other schools, said Kay Rogness, who in the 80s helped establish Sports Performance. They fell out with Butler around 1990 and has since become one of their harshest critics.
Among the many coaches who worked early in their careers for Sports Performance was Michigan State head volleyball coach Cathy George. Since becoming coach in 2005, most of their teams have featured one or more players trained by Butler. Michigan States website mentions Butler by name, citing athletes trained by him.
Powers-Barnhard and George knew each other, and George called them after the allegations emerged in 1995. George expressed sympathy but said they couldnt refuse to deal with Butler, according to Powers-Barnhard.
At the time, George was head coach at Western Michigan University. She said, Im sorry all this happened, but I will still have to recruit from him, said Powers-Barnhard, a three-time All American.
There was no response to messages left for George.
Michigan State cannot plausibly claim it was unaware of the allegations.
Chicago-area media widely covered the accusations in 1995. And theyve been covered periodically since then, including in a 2015 feature on the ESPNs Outside the Lines and in a recent Chicago Sun-Times series.
Efforts to banish Butler have been driven partly by Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic swimming champion who later became a civil rights lawyer. They now lead a Florida-based group called Champion Women, which advocates for female athletes.
The schools volleyball coach is conducting business with ... a known sexual abuser, Hogshead-Makar wrote on July 21, 2017 , to then-Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis and to the schools then-general counsel, Robert Noto. They got no response.
They also attached a photo of George sitting with Butler at a girls national volleyball tournament in Florida last year, when multiple players for other teams wore T-shirts citing allegations against Butler. The photo was from a report by Jacksonvilles First Coast News television.
In a Jan. 19 letter, Hogshead-Makar said the university had obligations to avoid dealing with Butler under Title IX, the federal law forbidding sex discrimination in education. Michigan State didnt respond.
In response to a similar note by email last year from part-time volleyball coach and activist Chris Murdock, associate athletic director Shelley Appelbaum said issues surrounding Butler were still unfolding and the university would monitor the situation.
Butler sounded confident in a statement to PrepVolleyball.com after the Amateur Athletic Union cancelled their membership, saying they emailed 600 families about the AAU action and that no families pulled kids from their programs. Those programs, they added, will not miss a beat.
The bans on Butler do not prohibit them from training children, said Emily Swanson, a Denver lawyer who has also spoken out against him. They said their staying power derives from coaches who keep going to them for recruits. They urged schools to refuse to recruit their athletes, even if some miss out on scholarships as a result.
If schools stopped recruiting their players, players would stop going to them to train, they said. That would shut them down.

Grizzlies coach David Fizdale criticizes the referees for the free throw differential in the Game 2 loss against the Spurs before storming off. (1:19)
SAN ANTONIO -- Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale offered up scathing criticism of the officials Monday, on the heels of their team's 96-82 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game 2 of their Western Conference first-round playoff series.
"It's unfortunate that I've got a guy like [point guard] Mike Conley that in their whole career has got zero technical fouls and just cannot seem to get the proper respect from the officials that they deserve," Fizdale said after Memphis fell to a 2-0 deficit. "It was a very poorly officiated basketball game."
The Grizzlies overcame a 19-point halftime deficit, which had swelled to as large as 26, to pull to within four points at the 10:08 mark of the third quarter.
Despite the furious comeback, Memphis fell short. Kawhi Leonard finished the game hitting 19-of-19 from the free throw line to become the first player since Dirk Nowitzki in 2011 to hit 19 or more in a row from the charity stripe without a miss in the playoffs.
Editor's Picks Leonard's 37 points lead Spurs by Grizzlies 96-82 Kawhi Leonard had a postseason career-high 37 points and added 11 rebounds and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Memphis Grizzlies 96-82 on Monday night to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round serie
The Grizzlies' secret weapon Marc Gasol laughed when new coach Dave Fizdale asked them to shoot four 3-pointers a game. No one's laughing now. 1 Related
In fact, Leonard attempted more free throws than the entire Memphis squad (13-of-15). San Antonio as a team connected on 31 of 32 from the free throw line.
"Zach Randolph, the most rugged guy in the game, had zero free throws," Fizdale said as they stared down at the box score from Monday's game. "But somehow, Kawhi Leonard had 19 free throws. First half, we shot 19 shots in the paint, and we had six free throws. They shot 11 times in the paint, and they had 23 free throws. I'm not a numbers guy, but that doesn't seem to add up. Overall, 35 times we shot the ball in the paint. We had 15 free throws for the game. They shot 18 times in the paint and had 32 free throws. Kawhi shot more free throws than our whole team. Explain it to me."
Given San Antonio's championship pedigree, legendary coach Gregg Popovich and Memphis' relative lack of postseason success, Fizdale doesn't believe the officials gave their team proper respect on calls. Officials whistled Memphis for a total of 22 fouls, compared to 13 for the Spurs.
"We don't get the respect that these guys deserve because Mike Conley doesn't go crazy. They have class, and they just plays the game," Fizdale said. "But I'm not gonna let them treat us that way. I know Pop's got pedigree, and I'm a young rookie. But they're not gonna rook us. That's unacceptable. That was unprofessional. Our guys dug in that game and earned the right to be in that game. And they did not even give us a chance."
As Fizdale finished their thought, the first-year head coach slammed a pen to the table and stood up.
"Take that for data," they said.
Conley finished the game with a team-high 24 points on 8-of-18 shooting and 4-of-5 from the free throw line.
"I don't [know] what the numbers were exactly, but Kawhi shot a lot of free throws," Conley said. "He does that a lot. I don't know how many we shot. But the name of the game tonight is we've got to keep them off the line."
When asked whether they receive proper respect from the officials, Conley responded, "As far as getting to the free throw line? No, but they respect me as a person, I feel like. But when it comes to the game, I'm not sure."
Conley agreed with Fizdale that San Antonio's history of postseason success gives it a leg up with the officials when compared to the Grizzlies.
The Spurs are 27-2 in playoff series when they take a 2-0 lead.
"Yeah. You see two different teams here," Conley said. "The Spurs are champions. They've won many times. They've done a lot of great things. We haven't earned that yet. We have to get to that mountaintop. And we understand that. I understand that. That's why I'm not going to complain about it. I'm just going to keep my head down, keep focused, try to play through it the best I can and keep my teammates from letting it affect them mentally."

Chicago Blackhawks fans had something to celebrate on July 1 when the Hawks signed 3-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Sharp. With the additional arrival of Brandon Saad, Hawks fans feel more optimistic than ever to bring the Cup back to Chicago after being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs two years in a row. However, there is much more than meets the eye to the fan favorite player Hawks fans have known and loved for over a decade. Here are five must-know facts about Patrick Sharp.
1. Family First
Sharp and their wife Abby have two daughters; five-year-old Madelyn and three-year-old Sadie. During free agency, their wife and two daughters played a big role in their choice to sign with the Hawks saying,“the family is thrilled to be coming back home.” Known for being a family man, they kept up that reputation by signing where their family wanted for less money than another team could have offered.
Sharp also cites their parents as big supporters in their career. Their father's diagnosis with leukemia inspired them to help others fighting the disease through a charity called Leukemia Texas. Sharp's philanthropic efforts can be seen on their Twitter page.
2. Perfect Season
2013 was a great year for the Blackhawks that began with 24 games without a loss in regulation and ended in a Stanley Cup victory. The regular season was also a perfect season for Sharp as they stated at the “Sweet Home Chicago Panel” at the 2017 Blackhawks Convention: “You know who was undefeated that year? Sharp was. (I) started the season the first 24 games, we won every single game. I got hurt in game 24, I came back and played two games, we won both so we're 26-0. I sat out the next two weeks to rest the shoulder for playoffs, played the last two regular season games, 28-0.” That year they tallied 6 goals and 14 assists which are impressive for a shortened season.
3. Sweet Home Chicago
Sharp had many offers during free agency but ultimately chose to go with the Hawks because it felt like home. Their wife was thrilled when they signed with the Hawks as they told NHL.com, “Stan (Bowman) got in touch. That was the end of it. I could have made more money elsewhere, but when I found out the Blackhawks were interested, that's all that mattered. I was in Connecticut. I took the call, then went outside with my phone. My wife, Abby, followed me. While I was talking with Stan, they were beside me, jumping up and down, saying, “Sign it! Sign it!” Chicago fans seem to return the favor and granted Sharp with a standing ovation when they arrived at the 2017 Blackhawks Convention.
4. Stronger than Ever
Despite being 35 and having a string of injuries in the 2016-17 season with the Dallas Stars, Sharp feels on top of their game. They told WGN Radio:
“I feel good, I feel healthy. It was a crappy year last year for a lot of different reasons. For me, individually, for the team in Dallas, we had high expectations to try to build off of my first year there. For whatever reason, it just didn't work out. It was a rough season, throw in a couple of injuries on top of that. I finally got this hip cleaned up which I have been meaning to do for a few seasons now. It's about a four to six month rehab. I just saw Dr. Terry this past week for my 4 month checkup and I'm good to go. I'm feeling healthy and as strong as ever, so I can't wait to get back.”
With Sharp back at their best, they can be a valuable asset in the Hawks quest to win the 2018 Stanley Cup.
5. Contract
Sharp's current contract is much less than it was prior to their trade to the Stars with a cap hit of $800,000. The contract lasts for a year and Sharp hopes to bring the Stanley Cup back to Chicago in the 2017-18 season. With their health back as well as the Hawks being closer to the team back to what they were in the 2014-15 season, they may very well achieve their goal.
Richard Curtis has reunited with the cast of their 2003 romantic comedy hit “Love Actually” for a special short film being produced for U.K. charity Comic Relief.
The short, titled “Red Nose Day Actually,” sees stars including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy reprise the characters they played in the Working Title hit, released in most markets by Universal, which grossed nearly $250 million worldwide.
“Over the years I've enjoyed doing “Red Nose Day” specials of TV things I've worked on,” said Curtis, who co-founded Comic Relief in 1985 alongside comedian and actor Lenny Henry. “It seemed like a fun idea this year to do a special sketch based one of my films, since Red Nose Day is now in both the U.K. and America.”
Currently in production the short explores what the film's characters are up to in 2017. Also returning to their original roles are Martine McCutcheon, Andrew Lincoln, Lucia Moniz, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Olivia Olson, Marcus Brigstocke, and Rowan Atkinson. Notable absences include Emma Thompson, Martin Freeman and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The original film also co-starred the late Alan Rickman who died in January 2016.
“I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to “Love Actually,” but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,” added Curtis. “We've been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part and it'll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later.”
The U.K. premiere of “Love Actually” in November 2003 was held in aid of Comic Relief. The short film will screen as part of Comic Relief's “Red Nose Day 2017” charity telethon on March 24 on BBC One.

Detroit Collegiate Prep pulled away in the fourth quarter to defeat Detroit Southeastern, 57-44, in a girls basketball game at Southeastern on Monday.
Sophomore guard Ajanae Horton led Collegiate Prep (2-0, 1-0 Detroit Public School League Division 2) with 10 steals and 28 points, including a trio of three-point plays in the fourth quarter.
“Horton was playing within the offense, which led to our scoring opportunities,” Collegiate Prep coach Orlando Watkins said.
Senior center Sapphire Dawson had 15 points and 12 rebounds.
“I'm really proud of my senior (Dawson). They were taking the baseline multiple times. It's hard for the other team because we play them at center, but when we open it up, no one can check them And we did a really good job rebounding today,” Watkins said.
Collegiate Prep normally plays zone defense this early in the season but switched to man for several possessions in the second half.
“Once we went to man it forced them to push the pace, which I don't think they wanted to do,” Watkins said.
Dawson and junior guard Nikiya Corden, who scored 12, are the only upper-classmen that Collegiate Prep starts.
“Seventy percent of this team is tenth graders, so they don't always play patient. They're a solid, well-coached team, but we came in and took our opportunities from within the offense instead of forcing it,” Watkins said.
“We just need to refine what we're doing. Repetition is your friend in this game.”

Do twins run in your family? Are your son and daughter identical? Do you have help? Do you want more children? Parents of multiples learn early on to field these amusing questions, along with the occasional unwanted advice and horror story with a grain of salt. Parents of multiples are often punctual and run a tight ship at home. Their children typically go to bed at the same time every night, and the parents almost always have a sense of humor. For most, this doesn't happen overnight. It takes sleepless nights, duct-taped diapers, baby gate and crib failures, and accidentally locking the kids and keys inside the car before they truly get the hang of wrangling multiple children. Here are tips from parents with twins, triplets or more on how to survive and thrive when parenting multiples:Join a parent of multiples group. The support from other parents of multiples is like no other. They just get it. Arrange play dates regularly. Article Continued BelowStick to a schedule.

ISLAMABAD - Approving 124 supplementary demands for grants and appropriation amounting to Rs121 billion, the National Assembly's budget session Wednesday ended with hullaballoo, exchange of heated remarks and customary boycott of opposition.
The combined opposition, before observing boycott, in a novel way of protest silently sat around the speaker's podium for a few minutes but a PTI MNA Hamid-ul-Haq behaved a bit violently by ripping off their shirt in front of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.
However, Khursheed Shah rushed to stop them and left the house with other opposition parties' members in protest. The opposition also staged a protest outside the parliament house's gate. They were also holding placards inscribed with slogans like ‘anti-people budget'. Some lawmakers, including, PPP's MNA Shazia Marri, PTI's Hamidul Haq, were seen wearing garlands of fruits, vegetables and milk.
Inside the house, the ruckus started when PTI Deputy Parliamentary Leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi was interrupted during their speech by Abid Sher Ali and Mian Abdul Manan with their teasing remarks.
Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar, concluding the debate on supplementary grants, once again urged all the political parties to sit together to formulate a national economy agenda. “This effort will surely help the people of Pakistan if consensus develops on it,” they said.
Minister, in absence of opposition, said the future of Pakistan is bright as international financial institutions are also admiring economic indicators of the country. “Pakistan has achieved economic stability because of prudent economic policies of incumbent government,” they said, praying this process of success would further continue in coming days.
“We are thankful to Allah Almighty for granting us opportunity to present the 5th budget,” they said, lauding all the lawmakers for their contribution in the budget.
Dar announced honoraria equal to four months basic pay for employees of Senate and National Assembly as well as the staff of all the organisations deployed for the budget session. The minister said that all the complaints regarding non-payment of honoraria will be addressed. They said the overall impact of the honoraria will be equivalent to five basic pays as it will be given in accordance with the new pay scales.
About non-payment of honoraria, NA speaker remarked that the non-payment of honoraria will be considered a breach of the privilege of the Parliament.
The House approved all 124 supplementary demands for grants and appropriations amounting to over 121 billion rupees for the outgoing financial year of different ministries and departments. The house also approved Rs68.5 billion charge expenditures.
At the fag end of proceedings amid desk-thumping, the minister announced ten per cent increase in salaries of parliamentarians. Taking the floor, Opposition Leader Khursheed Shah raised serious concerns for not taking parliament into confidence by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on foreign policy. “Why our [foreign] policy is still unclear, as minister for foreign affairs [PM] should inform the parliament about it,” they said. They also questioned that why Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was not given opportunity to speak in the Islamic summit. About absence of Prime Minister, Shah sarcastically said the Premier has no time for its own parliamentarians.
PTI's Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the government institutions were creating restrictions in the way of JIT. “JIT is feeling insecure,” they said apparently quoting JIT's report. Qureshi was repeatedly interrupted by some government MNAs, including Abid Sher Ali, Mian Abdul Manan and others, with their teasing remarks.

PLANO, TX (February 14, 2017) /PRNewswire/ — Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.

We also remained relentlessly focused on driving growth and productivity across our business with Rapid Continuous Improvement.”
For the quarter, reported net sales increased 2% on favorable product and package mix, a 1% increase in sales volumes and higher pricing. Net sales was partially offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency translation and unfavorable segment mix. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 2% as net sales growth, lower logistics costs and ongoing productivity improvements were partially offset by increases in certain operating costs and an $8 million increase in planned marketing investments. Currency neutral segment operating profit was further reduced by 2 percentage points of foreign currency transaction.
Reported income from operations for the quarter was $335 million, which included $11 million in unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains and $3 million in expenses related to our acquisition of Bai.

By geography, U.S. and Canada volume was flat, and Mexico and the Caribbean volume increased 5%.

Fountain foodservice volume decreased 4% in the period.
In NCBs, Snapple decreased 3% and Hawaiian Punch declined 5% on category headwinds and higher pricing on single-serve packages. Mott's decreased 2% in the quarter as growth in sauce was more than offset by declines in juices. Our water category increased 8% on strong growth in Bai, Core Hydration and FIJI. Clamato increased 13% on distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation.

In NCBs, our water category grew 18% primarily on growth in Bai, FIJI, Aguafiel and Core Hydration.

Sales Volume
Sales volumes increased 1% in the quarter and for the year.
Beverage Concentrates
Net sales increased 4% in the quarter driven by concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year, favorable product mix, lower discounts and a 1% increase in concentrate shipments. SOP increased 7%, as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $1 million increase in planned marketing investments.
Packaged Beverages
Net sales increased 3% for the quarter on favorable product and package mix and price increases. SOP decreased 3% as net sales growth, favorable logistics costs and ongoing productivity improvements were more than offset by increases in certain operating expenses, including $4 million of health and welfare and insurance costs and additional frontline labor costs focused on driving better execution. SOP was further reduced by an $8 million increase in planned marketing investments, which reduced SOP by 4 percentage points.
Latin America Beverages
Net sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by a 5% increase in sales volumes, favorable product and package mix and higher net pricing. SOP was flat, as the segment incurred $8 million of higher U.S. dollar denominated input costs which caused a 40% decline in SOP. The asupervisorstioned foreign currency transaction cost taken together with increases in certain other operating expenses collectively offset net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements.
Corporate and Other Items
For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $73 million, which included $11 million in unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains, $3 million in acquisition costs related to Bai and an increase in American Beverage Association expenses due to timing. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $75 million.
Other expense decreased $4 million in the quarter on the favorable comparison of a prior year impairment charge of $7 million on the Garden Cocktail brand.
Net interest expense increased $14 million in the quarter driven by $12 million of mark-to-market activity related to certain interest rate swaps and amortization expense associated with a bridge facility related to our acquisition of Bai.
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate was 35.4%. The effective tax rate in the prior year period was 36.4%.
Cash Flow
For the year, the company generated $939 million of cash from operating activities compared to $991 million in the prior year. Capital spending totaled $180 million compared to $179 million in the prior year period. The company returned $905 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases ($519 million) and dividends ($386 million).
2017 Full Year Guidance includes the following items:
Organic volume growth of approximately 1%; total volume growth of close to 2%, inclusive of the Bai acquisition, which closed on January 31, 2017.
Net sales growth of about 4.5%, including over 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency translation impact and also includes the Bai acquisition, which is expected to add approximately 3 percentage points to growth.
Expected net sales and operating profit associated with the Bai acquisition are now expected to be better than previously communicated in November of 2016, however non-cash purchase price accounting adjustments are expected make the acquisition $0.10 dilutive to Core EPS for the year.
Collectively, foreign currency translation and transaction are expected to reduce Core EPS by $0.11, primarily driven by the Mexican peso, which we believe may deteriorate an additional 14% from the 2016 year-ended level.
Recent events affecting Mexico have created an uncertain economic and consumer environment leading us to reduce our 2017 Core EPS expectation by $0.04.
Excluding the Bai acquisition, packaging and ingredient costs are expected to be inflationary by approximately 0.5% on a constant volume/mix basis.
The company expects its core tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, inclusive of a favorable accounting change associated with stock compensation expense that is expected to increase Core EPS by about $0.07.
The company expects strong free cash flow, capable of funding both a 9.4% dividend increase and repurchases of its common stock of $450 million to $500 million.
The company expects capital spending to be approximately 3 percent of net sales.
Taking the above items into consideration, the company expects 2017 Core EPS in the $4.44 to $4.54 range.

While 2016 has been an eventful year globally, SFU has experienced some major controversies and changes this year. Here is a rundown of the top SFU news stories of 2016.
Virgil Hill
On April 1, former SFU basketball head coach Virgil Hill stepped down from their position. This came after a series of allegations from some players of the men's SFU basketball team, many of whom left the team earlier in the year. SFU has since hired Steve Hanson; in May, the former lead assistant coach was promoted for the spring 2016 season.
The Highland Pub – Debt, debt, and more debt
In May, The Peak reported that the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) Highland Pub holds a $3 million dollar deficit, which lead to the closure of the Highland Pub for the 2016 summer semester. Later in the year, the pub re-opened in September with a slow start. SFSS CEO Martyn Wyant revealed that they would be unveiling a new business plan for the pub to try to reduce some of this deficit. The plan would also combat the competition from the recent openings of restaurants and the BC Liquor Store on campus, including the potential to allow minors into a closed off area of the pub. Later in October, The Peak reported that the pub was $60,000 behind schedule following only a partial opening in September with reduced kitchen staff and shorter opening times.
Deepak elected at SFSS president
In March, Deepak Sharma won over the majority of SFU students and was elected SFSS president over their opponent Darien Lechner. This was only just the beginning of a string of controversy within the SFSS and with their elected president for 2016–17. In June, Sharma resigned as president as they did not receive membership eligibility status due to failing to enroll in courses for the summer 2016 semester. Larissa Chen, former VP student services, stepped in as interim president (as is required of the VP student services) and announced that an official byelection would be held in October 2016.
. . . actually, Larissa elected as SFSS President
Chen had the chance to take on the role of president of the SFSS for the rest of the fall 2016 to spring 2017 term when they were initially offered the interim role. Instead, they resigned from their position as interim president, only to run in the official byelection alongside former president Deepak Sharma and independent candidate, Darien Lechner. However, Chen was voted in as official SFSS president with a 55.8% majority by 6.1% of the student body.
Cancellation of the stadium project
Other notable scandals and controversies from the SFSS include the cancellation of the SFU stadium which caused a huge backlash from SFU athletic teams students. Roughly 70 athletes stormed the SFSS board meeting at the end of August. While the project came in at $20 million dollars over budget, the SFSS was questioned on their transparency over the project. No word, as of yet, to potential options for the future of this project.
Sexual violence policy at SFU by May 2017
The student body is awaiting the draft release sexual violence policy on January 4, 2017. In 2016, it was made clear that SFU was in need of such a policy following the alleged mishandling of three sexual assault allegations at SFU residence. Since then, SFU has held sexual assault policy consultations at each campus with various SFU audiences. The university intends to finalise a policy — like all other post-secondary institutions in British Columbia — as mandated by the provincial government.
Upgrades to SFU infrastructure
Two major announcements were made this year post SFU's 50th anniversary. In July, The Peak reported a $10 million renovation to the infrastructure running from the Trottier Observatory to the SFU fountain, in order to replace some deteriorating materials which may cause leaks and other issues. In October, SFU also announced a $126 million project to expand the Surrey campus, building a five storey building for the new Energy Systems and Environmental Engineering Program, SFU News reported. This announcement was welcomed by a visit from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Burnaby Mountain tank farm expansion
On November 29, the Federal Government approved the controversial Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Throughout the fall of 2016, The Peak has reported increasing safety concerns over the expansion of the Burnaby Mountain tank farm located just a mile below SFU's Burnaby campus. While students such as Grayson Barke spoke out about the safety risk the expansion poses, SFU formally announced their stance on the pipeline project with a detailed report, which outlined its risks, just one day before the federal government's announcement of its approval.
Have your say
Leeds United have completed a deal to sign Japan international Yosuke Ideguchi.
Agreement is believed to have been sorted with Gamba Osaka before the weekend and the midfielder will head for Elland Road when the transfer window opens next month.
They will be loaned abroad immediately because Football Association rules will prohibit them from gaining a work permit for the rest of the English season.
They have not made the requisite number of international appearances for Japan to meet the FA's requirements.
However, Leeds view Ideguchi effectively as a summer 2018 signing and are confident they will secure a work permit for the 2018-19 campaign.
The J-League campaign was completed last month and United see a European loan as a way of keeping Ideguchi active.
The next Japanese season will commence in the Spring.
Leeds were known to be tracking Ideguchi towards the end of the summer transfer window with a view to signing him.
They had come to attention during Japan's successful qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup, scoring in a 2-0 win over Australia that guaranteed the country's involvement in Russia.
They also scored in stoppage-time as Japan played North Korea over the weekend.
Speaking to Japanese media, Ideguchi indicated that they were ready to take up a move to Elland Road.
“I think this is a place where I can learn and improve as a player,” they said.
“There are opinions that it is better to wait six months (until after the World Cup), but I want to go there without being influenced by people's opinions.”
The deal between Leeds and Osaka is believed to be worth around £500,000 including bonuses.
BEIRUT - Fighting in parts of Syria on Sunday threatened a shaky ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey, whose efforts to kickstart talks towards ending the conflict won backing from world powers.
The nationwide truce between the regime and non-jihadist rebels aims to smooth the way for peace talks in Kazakhstan later this month orchestrated by Damascus's allies Moscow and Tehran and rebel backer Ankara.
The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved a resolution supporting the Russian and Turkish initiative aimed at ending the nearly six-year-old war that has killed more than 310,000 people and displaced millions.
Air raids and clashes have continued to shake parts of the country since the ceasefire started at midnight on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. Four civilians, two of them children, and nine rebels have been killed since the truce took effect, said the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria for its information.
In northern Syria, regime air strikes on Sunday targeted the rebel-held town of Atareb, the monitor said. Regime air strikes also hit the Wadi Barada region near Damascus, where the government says rebels last week deliberately targeted water infrastructure that supplies the capital.
On Saturday night, rebels shelled Fuaa and Kafraya, two besieged Shiite-majority villages in northwestern Syria.
In the rebel bastion of Eastern Ghouta east of Damascus, which the government has waged a months-long offensive to retake, opposition fighters exchanged fire with regime forces. The truce excludes the Islamic State group and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.
Saturday's UN resolution "welcomes and supports the efforts by Russia and Turkey to end violence in Syria and jumpstart a political process", and hails the planned talks in the Kazakh capital Astana as "an important step". The measure also calls for the "rapid, safe and unhindered" delivery of humanitarian aid in Syria.
In Eastern Ghouta's Hammuriyeh area, Syrian activists marked the New Year by decorating a tree with lights and pictures of war victims, an AFP photographer said.
The Observatory says a total of 60,000 people lost their lives in violence across Syria in 2016, more than 13,000 of them civilians.
Syria's conflict began in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests and has since spiralled into a multi-front war involving various sides and international players. Russia and Turkey say the Astana talks in late January will supplement, not replace, UN-backed peace efforts, including negotiations set to resume on February 8 in Geneva.
Moscow and Ankara have been working increasingly closely on Syria, including on a deal to allow the evacuation of civilians and rebels from the besieged northern city of Aleppo last month. The fighting in Syria has occasionally spilled over into neighbouring Turkey, with several attacks blamed on IS or Kurdish militants.
In the latest violence, 39 people, including many foreigners, were killed Sunday when a gunman went on a rampage at an exclusive nightclub in Istanbul where revellers were celebrating the New Year. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
Turkey has waged a four-month incursion in Syria that it says is to expel IS and Kurdish fighters from the border area. Washington has been noticeably absent from the new process to end Syria's conflict, but has called the truce "positive".
Moscow -- which has been supporting Damascus with air strikes since 2015 -- has said it hopes to bring US President-elect Donald Trump's administration on board once they take office later this month. On Saturday, in the coastal regime stronghold of Tartus, two suicide bombers blew themselves up at a security roadblock, killing two members of the regime forces.

Passengers on an easyJet flight have been left “disappointed and annoyed” after they were trapped in Iceland because of snow in Bristol.
The plane was due to leave Reykjavik at midday on Sunday, March 18, but one frustrated passenger said they waited at the airport for more than eight hours without any information from the airline.
Some of those trapped in Iceland have now had to pay for other flights to get back to the UK via Gatwick.
James Giles-Franklin was one of the passengers on the easyJet flight coming from Reykjavik to Bristol.
They said: “It was obvious it was going to be delayed. We got there and we were sat in the airport for eight-and-a-half hours before we got any information.
“The most frustrating thing about it was there was no communication from easyJet at all. They kept saying we should approach a member of staff, but there was nobody around.
“It was ridiculous. We were told they were going to charter a flight to bring us back, but it was not going to be until Tuesday. We got taken to the hotel and that was it.
“There was absolutely no information. Everyone just wanted to get back.”
Mr Giles-Franklin is flying to Gatwick with Iceland airline Wow before travelling back to Bristol for their wife's birthday.
Another passenger said there was no easyJet representative at the airport to ask for information.
They said: “After a wonderful weekend in Reykjavik we woke up to the news that there was snow in Bristol and delays to our flight.
“We checked in as normal and the information we were given was that there was a delayed flight at Bristol because the airport was closed but was re-opening at 12. We had no other information from easyJet.
“So we sit and wait. I kept an eye on departure board at Bristol and at approximately 5pm Bristol departure board said the flight had left but we found that had in fact not happened. And at 8pm finally our flight was cancelled.”
The passenger added they were told to get their luggage and was sent to a hotel. They were told they would be flying on Monday, March 19, but when the hotel manager called the airport they were told there was no flight and that passengers would have to organise their own travel home.
They said: “We need to get home so we booked a flight to Gatwick as there was no guarantee of a seat on Bristol flight. So due to the lack of communication we're really disappointed and annoyed.
“We had to pay for our plane to Gatwick our way back to Bristol and anything else in relation to getting home and hopefully we can claim back.”
A statement from easyJet said: "Like all airlines, easyJet's flying programme from Bristol was severely disrupted on Sunday 18th March as a result of the adverse weather conditions and was required to cancel 61 flights to and from Bristol.
"easyJet did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our customers, communicating regularly by email, SMS and our Flight Tracker and providing hotel rooms and meals for affected passengers.
"Customers on cancelled flights were provided the option of transferring their flight free of charge or obtaining a refund.
"The safety of our passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority. Whilst this was outside of easyJet's control we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result of the weather."
More than 50 flights leaving Bristol Airport had to be cancelled on Sunday, March 18, after a frozen runway and delays de-icing planes meant hundreds of passengers were left stranded.

KARACHI - The sizzling heat claimed two more lives while hundreds of people suffered heatstroke as the port city experienced the hottest day of the season on Wednesday.
The mercury shot up to 45°C in Karachi as another bout of heatwave continued to prevail in the metropolis.
Following the predication of the hottest day by Pakistan Metrological Department, special heatstroke centres were established in various hospitals of the city including Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Civil Hospital, Karachi (CHK), Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) and others.
During the hottest day, hundreds of people were affected from heatstroke and were shifted to private hospitals for medical treatment. According to Edhi, a young man died of heatstroke in Khamiso Goth, New Karachi area. The young man later identified as 26-year-old Qurban Ali, son of Akhter Ali, while their body was brought at Edhi Morgue.
Another 70-year-old man died at Cantt Railway Station. The body was shifted to morgue after completion of legal formalities. Police said that the victim has yet to be identified till filling this report.
JPMC Director Emergency Dr Seemi Jamali told The Nation that no case was reported of heatstroke but several people were brought JPMC with heat exhaustion related complication and they were discharged after first aid. Dr Jamali said that low humidity is the reason of heatstroke but today there was 40-50 percent humidity reported in atmosphere.
According ASH administration, a man was brought at ASH from Liaqutabad area with heat exhaustion complication but no case of heatstroke was reported.
Similarly, CHK administration also denied that no case was reported in heatstroke while some cases of heat exhaustion were reported in the hospital.
During the holy month of Ramazan current weltering weather have life threats but city administration has yet taken any effective steps in this regard. Following the prediction about increase in hot weather in Karachi, administration had announced heatstroke camps in city but no one camp was witnessed in the city.
However, various NGOs, police, Rangers and several other private organisations established their roadside camps in the city to provide first aid to the people those suffer from heat exhaustion. The volunteers at roadside camps provided wet towels among the people those travelled during noon hours to save their lives from heatstroke.
Several traders placed water pipes at outside their business points and showers on people during the peak hot hours.
On the other side, residents of mostly areas were facing acute water shortage during the scorching weather. People were compliant that they're waiting in long queues for hours outside the water tanker hydrants to get water tanker during ongoing hot weather but Karachi Water and Sewerage Board paying no heed on the issue.
Despite the tall claims no letup in unannounced power loadshedding in the city despite the repeated directives by ruling government to avoid power suspension during ongoing heat spell.
The city faced an extended heatwave earlier this month as well, when the mercury routinely touched 44°C for four to five days. The scorching weather forced the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi to postpone the examinations last week.
The board has changed the timings of examinations from May 29 to June 13 owing to the heatwave. Exams for Arts Group (Regular and Private) will now start at 8:30am. The temperatures were recorded in Mohenjo Daro 50°C, followed by 49°C in Shaheed Benazirabad, Larkana, Dadu, Jacobabad, Lasbella, Sibbi, and Bahawalnagar.
At least one person was killed and 30 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia when white nationalists protesting plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general clashed with counter-demonstrators and a car plowed into a crowd.

Peter Jok's three pointer with a minute-18 remaining in overtime gave Iowa the lead for good in an 86-83 win over Michigan in Iowa City. The Wolverines led by seven points midway through the second half before the Hawkeyes rallied to force overtime.
“I couldn't be more proud”, said Iowa coach Fran McCaffery. “In the first half I did not think we were locked in even though we were up three. I probably challenged them more at halftime of this game than I have in any other game this year and they responded.”
Jok led the Hawkeyes with 25 points, including three of four from three point range. It was the Hawkeyes' fifth straight win over the Wolverines and the fourth time in the last seven games these teams have played in Iowa City that the game went to overtime.
China successfully launched on Thursday its first X-ray space telescope to study black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts, state media reported.
A Long March-4B rocket carried the 2.5-tonne telescope into orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China's Gobi Desert at 11:00 am (3:00 GMT), according to the official Xinhua news agency.
The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), named Insight, will allow Chinese scientists to observe magnetic fields and the interiors of pulsars and better understand the evolution of black holes.
It will also help scientists search for gamma-ray bursts corresponding to gravitational waves and study how to pulsars can be used for spacecraft navigation, Xinhua said.
"Insight is expected to push forward the development of space astronomy and improve space X-ray detection technology in China," Xinhua said.
Beijing sees its multi-billion-dollar space programme as a symbol of its rise and of the Communist Party's success in turning around the fortunes of the once poverty-stricken nation.
In April, China's first cargo spacecraft successfully docked with an orbiting space lab -- a key development toward China's goal of having its own crewed space station by 2022.
Last month, China opened a "Lunar Palace" laboratory on Earth to simulate a moon-like environment and house students for up to 200 days as the country prepares for its long-term goal of sending humans to the natural satellite.

PARIS - Two teenagers were rescued from the catacombs beneath Paris on Wednesday after getting lost in the pitch-black tunnels of the underground burial ground for three days.
The two, aged 16 and 17, were taken to hospital and were being treated for hyperthermia after being found by search teams and rescue dogs in the early hours of the morning. “It was thanks to the dogs that we found them,” a spokesperson for the Paris fire service told AFP at the end of the four-hour operation.
A network of around 250 kilometres (150 miles) of underground tunnels forms a maze beneath Paris, with only a small section open to the public at an official visitors' site in southern Paris.
Entering the other galleries has been against the law since 1955, but daredevil school children, explorers and alternative partygoers are known to access them through secret entrance points.
The transfer of human remains from Parisian cemeteries to the tunnels began towards the end of the 18th century for public health reasons, with the bones of approximately six million people found there.
The ambient temperature in the dank narrow passageways is about 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit).
It was not clear who had raised the alarm about the missing teenagers or why they got lost.
The operator of the Catacombs museum, a popular attraction where the queues are sometimes several hours long, stressed that no-one had ever got lost in the two-kilometre (over one mile) of tunnels open to the public.
Whether you're a moviemaker, critic or devoted film collector, lovers of cinema can all agree: A Criterion Collection release is a stamp of cultural importance.
How can the arthouse distributor's releases be used as tools to help independents hone their craft? Criterion Crash Course, our series focusing on new Criterion titles, considers every aspect of Blu-ray/DVD packages, from the film itself to its special features, as weapons in a moviemaking arsenal. Explore the moviemaking lessons from these packages—gifts that keep on giving.
Roma (1972)
The mark of a great auteur is the prominence of their directorial stamp. By 1972, Federico Fellini had produced the bulk of the work now praised as their masterpieces. The second half of their career, however, shows the director at perhaps their most audacious. The placement of their name in the title of three of their later films—first with Satyricon, then Roma and, finally, with Casanova—was not only a selling of the film on the director's worldwide acclaim, but a shorthand signifier that these are Fellini's visions of Petronius Arbiter's Satyricon, Rome, and Casanova. Perhaps Fellini's most challenging work, Roma ostensibly lacks a central narrative and runs as a vignette-strewn dream, in which viewers experience Rome directly through the director's eyes.
Thanks to The Criterion Collection's stunning 2K restoration, Roma can be appreciated in all its bold, ingenious, original glory. The package includes additional footage cut for the film's international release, which Criterion have included as a supplementary feature alongside various interviews and archival media.
Lessons in Abandoning Convention
While moviemakers may not always be privy to the funding that allowed Fellini to create such an unconventional work, the single most important takeaway Roma has to offer is that a film does not need to always follow the rules. Roma is unique in that it has nearly no central character—that is, with the exception of the titular city. Rather than shackle the narrative to the cathartic journey of a central figure, Fellini bounces in and out of a loosely (in the loosest sense) autobiographical narrative, in order to present snapshots of the city at different points in history. This isn't necessarily “Rome,” it is Fellini's Roma—as represented in the title.
Fellini's choice, here, was bold, because despite their experiments with fragmented narrative in Satyricon, they risked alienating viewers by abandoning conventional narrative structure in a much more pronounced fashion. While mileage may vary, the end result is moving. Rather than be distracted by characters who embody their own struggles, viewers stay fixated on the city itself. We learn to see Rome through Fellini, and love the city's splendors in the ways that Fellini desires.
In an age of strict, conventional storytelling—even ruling in the independent film world—Roma serves as a blueprint for forgoing established norms in narrative structure and finding ways to develop a new form of storytelling. Roma cuts to the heart of the message in a succinct manner, with Fellini's unorthodox method working to better highlight the central themes. Fellini trusted their voice over conventional technique. True, this method runs a greater risker for failure, but this is exactly what makes Fellini's career so impressive. Even late into their career, Fellini was willing to take great chances in order to produce great work, and, for this, it remains why Roma is undeniably Fellini's Roma.
Special Features
While Criterion's edition of Roma isn't bare bones, there are noticeably fewer features to wade through on this disc—though, what is provided helps to contextualize the film.
Of most importance for moviemakers is the interview with moviemaker Paolo Sorrentino about Fellini, with special focus paid to Roma and how the film has impacted Sorrentino's own career. Hearing about how Fellini's conceptual and cinematographic vision of Rome influenced works like The Great Beauty shows just how palpable a style Fellini harbored, and why more moviemakers ought to seek guidance in their work. Especially pertinent is Sorrentino's reflection on the mies-en-scene and sound design of Roma‘s sequence on the Great Ring Road—a reminder that a “deliberate hodgepodge of events” can be employed to render the illusion in your film that “anything can happen in one afternoon, even when we know it's simply impossible.”
Additionally, an interview with poet Valerio Magrelli features more personal anecdotes to help illuminate aspects of Fellini's personality. Magrelli's insights call attention to the parallels between the autobiographical tendencies of the poet and the endlessly self-scrutinizing approach Fellini takes with Roma and the majority of their filmic canon.
Rounding out the features included are a detailed audio commentary by Fellini historian Frank Burke and an essay by scholar David Forgacks, both of which underscore the film's tension between objective notions of Rome and Fellini's assemblage of the elements of the city they favor and privileges. Moviemakers interested in freely interpreting historically charged spaces will find much to weigh in on in Burke and Forgacks' discourse on Fellini's regionally-bound hybrid of sense memory and fantasy.
The Takeaway
Roma is not Fellini's greatest cinematic achievement. It lacks the engagement of 8½, the visual splendor of Satyricon, or the whimsy of La Dolce Vita. But it is undeniably pulled directly from the mind of its director. Within Roma, moviemakers can find the courage to follow their own voice, regardless of where that places them in the scope of conventional structuring and cinematic devices.
Even if one were to view Roma as a failure, it brings something fresh and invigorating to the table; it's a film that redefines the ways in which narrative can unfold and cinema can feature inanimate subjects. If you are to keep Roma at heart, it can teach you how to find ways to develop storytelling innovations and keep the seemingly stagnant industry evolving. With their signature witticism, Fellini best summed up what moviemakers stand to learn from him, and distills the essence of their career on the whole: “Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole,” they once said, “it would be about me.” Filter the world through the only lens you can truly trust—your own. That's what Fellini did. MM

Connor Hellebuyck is an elite goaltender. Their 44-11-9 record, 2.36 goals-against average (GAA) and .924 save percentage (SV%) are massive reasons for the Winnipeg Jets' success this year. Their case for capturing the Vezina is a compelling one, as their team simply wouldn't be where they are without him.
However, they haven't had much success this season against one certain squad — which happens to be the one the Jets find themselves facing in the second round.
Hellebuyck's Nightmares Against Nashville
Hellebuyck's had some problems when playing the Nashville Predators. Their numbers against the league's top team aren't exactly a dream.
In five games and four starts against the Predators in 2017-18, their GAA was 3.91 — the worst figure versus any team they faced more than once. They gave up a total of 19 goals in those five games. They also posted a SV% of .882, well below their sparkling overall number.
On Nov. 20, in the two teams' first matchup of the season, Hellebuyck allowed five goals on 29 shots in a 5-3 loss, including two that slid along the ice and through their five-hole.
On Feb. 27, they had arguably their worst start of the season in a 6-5 loss. They looked bad and was torched for six goals on 26 shots, including three straight in the third as the Jets squandered a 5-3 lead.
A rare off night for goalie Connor Hellebuyck as the Jets fall to the Predators 6-5. They didn't look very good on at least 4 of the goals scored by Nashville. But he's been the Jets the best player in most of the games this season. He'll bounce back. — Joe Pascucci (@Pascucci015) February 28, 2018
After that game, Hellebuyck didn't talk to reporters. When they did speak two days later, they refused to discuss the game.
“I do mind going back to it. I don't want to bring it up,” Helleybuyck said in the interview. “There's no need — it's in the past. There are 82 games and I'm focusing on the next one. We've had a good run, so far, and we want to continue it.”
Hellebuyck Shaky Even in Wins
Even in their two wins against the Predators, Hellebuyck wasn't their usual brick-wall self. On Dec. 19, they made 30 saves in a 6-4 win. However, the win was more thanks to Brandon Tanev's unlikely late-game goal than Hellebuyck's performance: they gave up a sharp-angle stinker and a softie they should have been able to squeeze but didn't that trickled through them and just over the goal line.
On Mar. 25, when the Jets punched their ticket to the playoffs with a 5-4 shootout victory, Hellebuyck allowed a couple they would probably have liked to stop, including one with less than a second left in the first period. Overall, though, they were decent, saving 32 and not allowing a shootout goal.
Hellebuyck Bounce-Back Ability — and They Know It
Even with their suspect numbers against the team the Jets will soon face for four or more, fans shouldn't be too concerned. Hellebuyck has uncommon levels of mettle, maturity, and confidence.
Connor Hellebuyck performance immediately after allowing 5+ goals in the previous game this season: 7-0-1
GAA: 1.37

He's a hard worker who doesn't wallow in a bad performance or let a bad night snowball into a free fall. After allowing five goals or more in a game, they have — without exception — rebounded with a great performance. Their ability to do that is one of the things that makes them so valuable.
Their bounce-back ability was never more apparent than it was in Round 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. After a rough 6-2 loss in Game 3, Hellebuyck didn't panic, but instead turned their net into Fort Knox, posting back-to-back shutouts. Paul Maurice praised their goalie for the trait after their Game 4 shutout.
“You knew, five to 10 minutes into that game, they were right and feeling good,” Maurice said after Game 4. “It's really good for our hockey team to see that from him. To see that they can come back and rebound – this kind of confidence builders in the playoffs are critical.”
Hellebuyck Needs to Look Forward, Not Back
Hellebuyck is emerging at just the right time and needs to keep their momentum going. They need to put their regular-season struggles against the Predators in the rearview and focus on doing what they did in Round 1 and the vast majority of the regular season. Their team will need them at their best in what's bound to be a dogfight between two of the NHL's very best.
“I'm going to have to look to the future and remember this,” Hellebuyck said to Darrin Bauming after the series-clinching Game 5. “That this was a big building stone and a step in my career. That I can do this, and if things falter, I have a good foundation to fall back on.”
If big No. 37 can push aside their struggles against the Predators — which by all indicators they can — the Jets will have a good foundation to build on for a Round 2 victory.
Iran Focus
London, 11 Dec - Andrew L. Peek is set to become the new deputy assistant secretary of state covering Iran and Iraq with an announcement expected very soon. They will take over the role of the current deputy assistant secretary for Iran - Chris Backmeyer - who was the deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the State Department and National Security Council director on Iran from 2012 to 2014 for the Obama administration.
Peek is a former U.S. Army intelligence officer who was a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve. They were a member of the State Department transition team for the president.
This move will see a career diplomat replaced with a loyal supporter of Trump. Peek has no previous diplomatic experience and does not have an established reputation as an Iran expert.
However, Peek has an extensive military background and they have years of Senate experience in which they advised Republican senators on issues related to foreign policy.
Peek's new role could give them a huge influence on matters related to Middle Eastern diplomacy. Many of the State Department posts that require presidential nomination are still empty and it is almost a year since Trump took office.
Officials in the White House have been open about their frustration with regards to Iran policy being handled by career foreign service officers. There have been several clashes between officials who disagree on how to move forward with Iran. Some want to pursue a more aggressive policy and would like to present options to abandon the 2015 nuclear agreement.
Relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States have been growing more and more tense in recent weeks. In October, President Trump announced that the nuclear agreement could no longer be recertified under U.S. law, stating that it was no longer the U.S. interests.
This has led to speculations that Trump wants to derail the nuclear deal. Some have been very critical of this potential move, especially leaders in Europe who have said that derailing the deal will lead to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Roles for deputy assistant secretary are usually filled by a mixture of political and career appointees and they do not typically need a Senate confirmation or presidential appointment.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and their team are frustrated that the president has left around half of the State Department posts without a nominee.
President Trump has been very outspoken about their thoughts on Iran and they have ignored pleas from European leaders to recertify Iran's compliance. In their speech explaining their decision, Trump explained that Iran is not acting in the interests of the United States.
Although EU leaders criticised this decision, many have agreed that Iran's malign acts must urgently be addressed, including its ballistic missile program.
In a conference last week, MEPs from all over Europe participated in a conference regarding Iran and many of them called on EU High Commissioner Federica Mogherini to stop appeasing Iran and to put human rights before trade deals.
NAIROBI : Japan on Monday started withdrawing its troops from a UN mission in war battered South Sudan, according to an official, a move coinciding with escalating violence in a conflict where killings have been described as genocide.
The 350-strong Japanese military contingent, which has been based in South Sudan's capital Juba for the past five years, has been mostly helping with infrastructure construction.
"The first group is leaving today," Daniel Dickinson, spokesperson for the UN peace keeping mission called UNMISS, told Reuters moments before the troops were due to board their flight at Juba International Airport. Dickinson said the Japanese contingent would leave in three batches and that the group that was due to leave on Monday had 68 troops. Deadly violence, often driven by ethnic hatred has gripped South Sudan since 2013 when fighting broke out between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and their political foe Riek Machar whom they sacked as vice president.
A 2015 peace deal ended that conflict and Machar was early last year restored to their vice presidency position but persistent animus between the two men finally exploded into fresh fighting in July.
Episodes of mass violence especially in the equatorial region of south Sudan have been growing, with surviving civilian witnesses reporting government troops turning up in towns and starting shooting rampages.
The UK has described the killings and other atrocities in South Sudan as genocide although the UN has not yet made that determination.
South Sudan government spokesperson, Ateny Wek Ateny, said they welcomed Japanese troops' departure because "the government of South Sudan is able to control the country."

ISLAMABAD - Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa has affirmed that Pakistan would continue to play positive role being one of the highest troop contributing nation for maintaining international peace and security under United Nations flag.
They were talking to Under Secretary General, United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, Jean Pierre Lacroix who called on them at GHQ, Rawalpindi, said a statement issued by Inter Services Public Relations issued here on Monday.
The visiting dignitary acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan Army's sincere efforts and sacrifices in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
The Centre for International Peace and Stability (CIPS) was established in 2013 to provide peacekeeping training to domestic and international peacekeepers and was inaugurated by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon.
Earlier, Jean Pierre Lacroix visited CIPS, at National University of Science and Technology, (NUST).
While interacting with students and faculty members, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to sacrifices of Pakistani peacekeepers for global peace and security and saving civilian lives under UN umbrella.
Pursuing a long history with UN Peacekeeping since 1960's Pakistan has been wholeheartedly supporting UN in Peacekeeping in more than 44 missions.
The delegation paid tribute to 156 Pakistani peacekeepers who have sacrificed their lives in the noble cause of humanity and restoring peace and stability in different regions. "We are extremely grateful to Pakistan for its warm welcome and also for Pakistan outstanding contribution to UN Peace keeping," Lacroix said. They said "this visit was also an opportunity to pay tribute to 156 Pakistani peacekeepers who lost their lives serving the UN, we express special thought for them, for their memory and also their families and we also would like to extend our thanks and gratitude to all the Pakistani peacekeepers currently serving in our missions and as well as their families. All of them are paying a price for that and we are extremely grateful."
They said: "Pakistan Army and armed forces contributions to our mission is really making a difference and we think it's an outstanding contribution to the cause of Peace and stability in the world".
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Liverpool's Adam Lallana is a doubt for Sunday's Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur with the club not willing to risk aggravating the midfielder's muscle injury, manager Juergen Klopp said.
England international Lallana sustained a serious thigh injury in pre-season and has struggled for fitness, featuring only seven times for the club in all competitions this season.
The latest setback has kept Lallana out of Liverpool's last two matches, against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup and Huddersfield Town in the league.
”It's really unlucky,“ Klopp told the club's website (www.liverpoolfc.com). ”It was a serious injury in the summer. Because of Adam's quality in training, it looks immediately like we can put them in, but physical-wise he's not fit.
”The two things that happened after their big injury were in the 10 or 15 minutes after they came on. From nil to 100 in a second, and that's maybe what caused the problem.
”We really tried to be sensible with it, to do the right thing. But it didn't work, twice. It's really not a big thing, three games is like not being injured.
Klopp did not completely rule out Lallana's participation against fifth-placed Tottenham though.
“He's maybe available for Tottenham, and if not then he'll have missed three games,” Klopp added.
“That's really OK but of course it's not cool. The body needs to adapt again to the intensity.”
Liverpool is third in the league with 50 points from 25 games, 18 points behind runaway league leaders Manchester City. (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)

One person is feared dead as fire crews continue to trawl through the rubble 24 hours after a huge blast ripped through a block of flats in Oxford.
Dramatic pictures showed the full force of the explosion which broke out at around 5pm yesterday afternoon.
Rescuers continue to scour the wreckage of the three-storey block of flats but fire officials say the site "would no longer sustain life".
Eyewitnesses described seeing people being dragged out from underneath the rubble as emergency crews arrived at the scene.
The cause of the fire is also still unknown - with initial claims it had been a 'gas' explosion since denied.

Supt Joe Kidman LPA Commander for Oxford City LPA, said: “This was a very concerning incident and emergency services are likely to have a significant presence in the area in the coming days.
“At this time one person remains unaccounted for and we are offering ongoing support to that person's family at this time."
Around a dozen people were evacuated to nearby emergency accommodation overnight.
Jenny Kitzinger posted on Twitter: "My dad's ok, but here's remains of their bedroom, so reminding all re. fire safety & smoke alarms today. + a HUGE thank you to @OxonFireRescue."
Two people were treated for minor injuries including a pregnant woman who was taken to hospital following the blast.

When the blaze took hold at dusk last night, a massive fireball could be seen coming from the remains of the three-storey block of flats in Gibbs Crescent, Oxford.
The building is owned by housing association A2Dominion.
Huge flames and plumes of smoke were caught on camera with the force of the explosion causing several nearby boats in the marina to catch fire too.
Neighbours say they fear the blast may have been deliberate - which is yet to be confirmed.

Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue confirmed two people sustained minor injuries - with one taken to hospital.
But a "small number" of people are still unaccounted for as rescue teams start to sweep the rubble.

An ambulance spokesperson had earlier said it was a gas mains explosion - but that has been denied by authorities.
A statement released from SGN on Tuesday, gas distribution network company for the Oxford area said: "Following reports of an explosion in the Osney Lane and Gibbs Crescent area of Oxford, our engineers joined the emergency services on site this evening.

"While it's too early to speculate as to what has happened, we have confirmed there is no mains gas supply to the property affected."
Police have ruled out terrorism as the cause of the blast.

"I just started using my camera, I got stupidly close. I just went in, got as many photos as I could then leave because I could hear all the sirens.
"I could smell all the furniture burning. I saw the tarpaulin of a boat on fire.
"There were a lot of sounds coming from the fire which was making me really nervous because it was an explosion and I didn't want to be around if there was another one."
Cyber threats have metastasized worldwide.
In the U.S., they have presented as security issues for critical infrastructure, such as industrial sites, and cast doubt on the integrity of crucial information technology systems used for elections –including many vulnerable voting machines themselves that are employed and managed at the state level.
Technological approaches to curbing or countering these cyber threats are proliferating, but they alone cannot offer adequate protection. What is needed is manpower: hundreds of thousands of information security professionals working in the private and public sectors to actively defend the cyber terrain on which America's national security, prosperity, and democracy depend.
Like many private companies and public agencies in the U.S., the Department of Defense struggles with a shortage of information security professionals. But RAND research suggests that the armed forces, and the nation more broadly, might already have some of the personnel resources it needs — in the ranks of its Reserves and National Guard.
RAND researchers studying the skills of personnel in the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve in 2015 estimated, conservatively, that more than 100,000 of these men and women have some degree of cyber competence, including thousands with deep or midlevel cyber expertise.
Many of these soldiers, like their counterparts in the reserve components of other military services, perform information security functions in their civilian careers, often in high-tech sectors. Some are serving in newly created reserve component cyber formations.
A growing proportion of service members in the reserve components are also “digital natives” — part of the younger generations who grew up using a wide variety of technologies. Many want to leverage their tech skills as part of their military duties.
The Department of Defense — and individual states across the country — would do well to tap into this pool of trained, vetted, and often combat-experienced men and women available to extend the labor pool of information security professionals — personnel who could provide support to federal and state civilian authorities during times of crisis.
For example, the reserve component could be mobilized to help the Department of Homeland Security defend the industrial control systems of critical infrastructure experiencing an attack, especially the newest addition to the DHS list of critical infrastructure, the election system itself.
Other countries have begun to leverage civilian-acquired skills in their defense against cyber threats. In the wake of cyberattacks against its public and private Internet infrastructure in 2007, Estonia announced plans to develop the Estonian Defence League, a collection of volunteers—now numbering in the hundreds—who are prepared to help the country respond to emerging cyber crises and attacks.
The U.S. has different options for filling shortfalls in its arsenal of information security professionals. In March, for example, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AR) proposed the creation of a “cyber national guard” to attract talented civilians who do not want to serve in the military, but are willing to contribute to the nation's cyber defense.
The reserve components of the U.S. military are uniquely positioned to attract, train, and manage a cadre of information security professionals who are able to operate both with the active components of the U.S. armed forces and with civilian authorities. Innovative approaches to recruiting, tracking readiness, and career planning of these professionals will be required, and new models of reserve component participation and training might prove necessary.
There is every reason to believe that nefarious actors, including powerful nation-states, will continue to target critical infrastructure, the U.S. election system as a whole and information technology systems in general.
This threat to American democracy and cyber way of life demands hands-on attention to the underlying machines and devices. Mitigating this threat with human resources will require the cyber equivalent of boots on the ground. The state of Ohio has already tapped its National Guard to defend its election system from hackers.
Time is running out to build an adequate nationwide defense for the next presidential election cycle, but many of the necessary personnel resources are right here—in the form of the Guard and the Reserves that are ready and willing to be called up to perform the mission.

Raiders QB Derek Carr says that the loss is "all my fault" but wants to make it clear that he's going to continue to fight for their teammates. Coach Jack Del Rio says that Carr is the "triggerman of our offense. Our offense didn't get it done today." (1:02)
KANSAS CITY -- It is obvious, isn't it?
Derek Carr does not look like the same quarterback they were last season when, despite breaking their right ankle in Week 16, they finished tied for third in NFL MVP voting.
There were the acrobatics -- remember their Superman-like dive over a defender in New Orleans in the season opener? There was the laser-like accuracy and deep shots with aplomb, and the white-knuckle finishes -- they won seven games in 2016 on fourth-quarter or overtime drives.
That's a major reason the Oakland Raiders gave them that five-year, $125 million contract this offseason, making him, at the time, the highest-paid player in the history of the game.
The Carr of 2017, though, does not look as confident, nor as precise, under first-year offensive coordinator and close friend Todd Downing. Carr no longer scrambles to extend plays and looks extremely uncomfortable whenever the pocket starts to show any sign of collapse, as was the case when they got sacked three times in the Raiders' 26-15 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.
First place in the division was on the line. Against a team that had lost six of seven. And with weapons in Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper coming back into service after a week off due to suspension and injury.
And yet
Carr and the Raiders' offense did not simply sputter and stall. It never truly started and, despite finishing with a mini-flourish courtesy of two fourth-quarter touchdown drives after trailing 26-0, Carr had a Total QBR of 9.7, the third-lowest single-game Total QBR of their career.
"I wish I had the answer, because it would have been something we could have nipped after the first couple of drives," Carr said when asked how such a slow start could happen, with so much on the line.
"But, I'll look at myself like I always do and see what I can do better and see if I can help my teammates along the way."

Of course, Carr suffered a broken pinkie finger on their passing hand last year, and then their season ended with a broken right fibula in Week 16. Then they suffered a broken bone in their back in Week 6 this season at Denver, an injury that cost them one game.
You think that's not on their mind still, not even a little bit? They did, after all, mention all three injuries in passing at a podium session earlier this season.
Fine, then, are you sure they are healthy, and they feel good?
"Yeah," Carr said. "Yes. Thank you."
Still, no one operates at 100 percent in the NFL, especially not after 13 games. But if Carr is so limited that the Raiders' purported high-powered offense cannot operate at at least minimal efficiency, they should not be out there, no? Some might call it selfish. Others, selfless.
Then again, if they can suit up, they should play. Unless
"Any time you can hit the quarterback the way they were hit early," Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, "that affects him."
The late Al Davis would agree, whole-heartedly. Something about the opposing quarterback, in the first five to 10 plays of a game, must go down, and they must go down hard.
Is Carr shook?
Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledged the entire team was "shook" in a Week 3 loss at Washington. It has been trying to bounce back ever since. And here the Raiders are, 6-7 and a game behind the Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West.
"It sucked," Carr said, when asked about the offense's lack of execution. "Wasn't good enough and you put it all on me. Don't you blame one coach, one player, it's all my fault.
"There's no easy way to go through this one. This one sucked."
Through three quarters, Carr had just 69 yards passing and an interception, while completing 11 of 23 attempts.
And they were not really trying to stretch the field.
Consider: Carr completed only one of 10 passes thrown 15 or more yards downfield on Sunday, a 29-yard touchdown to tight end Jared Cook, and had a 2.9 yards per attempt rate.
In the 31-30 defeat of the Chiefs in Week 7, Carr was 5-of-14 on deep passes for a season-high 167 yards and two TDs with an 11.9 yards per attempt rate.
Plus, Carr has now thrown seven touchdowns and seven interceptions on passes of 15 yards or more this season, after throwing just three picks on 101 such passes last year.
"Well, they are the trigger man of our offense," Del Rio said. "The offense didn't get done what we need to get down today."
Really, it has not been consistent all season.
Colorado State men's basketball coach Larry Eustachy has been placed on administrative leave amid an internal investigation into their conduct with players and other staff members.
Colorado State athletic director Joe Parker announced Eustachy's temporary leave in a statement Saturday, just hours before the Rams' home game against Nevada.
"I have asked head coach Larry Eustachy to temporarily step away from the men's basketball program, as they have been placed on administrative leave while we conclude our climate assessment," Parker said. "We are diligently working through this assessment as expeditiously as possible, understanding the importance of a thorough and fair process. No conclusions have been made."
Assistant coach Steve Barnes will coach Colorado State on Saturday night. The school announced Wednesday that it would have conversations with students and staff members about the 62-year-old Eustachy.
It marks the second time in four years that Colorado State officials have interviewed players and others about Eustachy's behavior. A 2013-14 investigation alleged that they created a "culture of fear and intimidation" and emotionally abused their players, according to the 90-page report completed by former Rams athletic director Jack Graham.
Eustachy's contract expires after the 2020-21 season.

Cousins signing another brutal Warriors response to LeBron challenge
Omnisport FOLLOW NEWS News 92 // 04 Jul 2018, 19:34 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
DeMarcus Cousins playing for the New Orleans Pelicans
LeBron James was allowed to bask in the spotlight for one day before their thunder was stolen by an all too familiar source.
James' decision to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers was hardly a stunner, but it was viewed as a move that would change the landscape of the NBA.
Yet the dust on their move had barely settled when the Golden State Warriors offered James what will be an irritating reminder that, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
The Warriors delivered the shocker an extremely intriguing free agency period was perhaps lacking on Monday, sending the basketball world into disbelief by signing All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a reported one-year $5.3million deal.
By using their mid-level exception, which teams can utilise once a year to sign a player to a contract for a specified maximum amount, on Cousins, the Warriors have sent a message to James and the rest of the NBA. Nothing is changing, certainly not the destination of the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Golden State will keep winning, and they will keep finding ways to get better, and the rest of the league will scratch their heads wondering how they keep managing to do it.
Cousins, whose arrival has not yet been made official but who has said they made the "smartest move ever" by joining Golden State, should take the Warriors, who own the regular-season wins record and have lost six of their last 38 playoff games, to yet another level.
They fill a need at a position that has long since been their biggest weakness, bringing a skill set most centers can only dream of having and giving the Warriors - providing they can quickly recapture their best form following Achilles surgery - a big man who can make plays as a ball handler and off the dribble from the three-point line. Yes, the Warriors, a team boasting a pair of guards known as the Splash Brothers and one of the best scorers of all time in Kevin Durant, now have a center who just happens to excel beyond the arc, offering them the flexibility to deviate from their small-ball line-up but still carry the same level of shooting threat.
The 3rd splash Brother. Let's go @boogiecousins — Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) July 3, 2018
The fact the Warriors were able to pull this deal off will continue to astound for some time, and it is a testament to the franchise's ruthless attitude to challenges to their superiority.
The humiliating nature of Golden State's 2016 Finals loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers would have been enough to crush the confidence of some franchises. The Warriors' response was to sign Durant and crush any hope Cleveland had of adding to their sole title.
Just as Durant's arrival was the result of a lengthy recruitment effort, the Cousins deal did not happen overnight, but the timing, a day after James had made their decision to confront the Warriors head on in their own conference and build a contender of their own out west, is fitting.
Regardless of what team James hopes can be put together in Los Angeles, their hopes of winning the title next season could be considered decimated just 24 hours into their career as a Laker, with the Warriors, once Cousins returns to fitness, able to put out a starting five comprised entirely of All-Stars.
As a team and an organisation, the Warriors don't just respond to tests of their dominance, they swat them aside with a brutality that surely leads the rest of the league to question the point of trying to keep pace with them in the first place.
To the CITY and FANS of Nola, Thank you! pic.twitter.com/qZhVBHAth4 — DeMarcus Cousins (@boogiecousins) July 3, 2018
But in this case their rivals aided Golden State's cause. The Lakers reportedly had the chance to sign Cousins, who is said to have turned down a two-year $40m offer to stay with the New Orleans Pelicans, for a similar deal to the one the Warriors inked them to. Still, Golden State, who drafted Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green seventh, 11th and 35th respectively, deserve continued praise for capitalising on the slip-ups of their foes.
The latest league-wide miscue pounced on by the Warriors is unlikely to have long-term implications. Providing Cousins' impresses on the way to a title, they will be able to command a maximum contract the Warriors will be unable to give him. Yet, if their increasingly impressive history is any guide, by that point Golden State will have figured out a way to replace them and improve further as they look to maintain their dynasty by the Bay.
LONDON (Reuters) - Jewish community leaders in Britain said their talks on Tuesday with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on how to end anti-Semitism in their party had been a “disappointing missed opportunity”.

Corbyn met with the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council after they organised a protest last month accusing them of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in their party because of a far-left world view hostile to Jews.
Before the meeting, Corbyn acknowledged that anti-Semitism had surfaced within their party and apologised for the pain this had caused.
But the groups said after the meeting that Corbyn failed to agree there should be a fixed timetable to deal with anti-Semitism cases or that no member of parliament should share a platform with somebody expelled or suspended for anti-Semitism.
“Our meeting with Jeremy Corbyn today was a disappointing missed opportunity,” they said in a statement. “We welcome the fact that Mr Corbyn's words have changed but it is action by which the Jewish community will judge them and the Labour Party.”
Some opinions polls put Labour almost level with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives, meaning they are a potential next British leader, although the next election is not due until 2022.
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups they support.
Corbyn reiterated after Tuesday's meeting that they were committed to stamping out the problem.
“When members of Jewish communities express genuine anxieties, we must recognise them as we would those of any other community,” they said.
“Their concerns are not ‘smears'. Jews belong in the Labour Party and we are utterly committed to making it a safe and welcoming place for them.”
A debate in parliament last week underlined the depth of the criticism directed towards Corbyn over anti-Semitism, where members of their own party described in powerful terms the depths of the abuse they and Jewish friends were experiencing.
A Labour member of parliament said last week that their wife had been threatened with rape and sent a dead bird in the post after they attended the demonstration against anti-Semitism.
After the protest organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, Corbyn offered to meet both groups' leaders urgently to discuss their concerns.
LAHORE-Farhana Asad has dedicated nearly half their life to the study and revival of the traditional arts through a host of mediums.  They are preserving traditional handcrafted techniques that are being entirely lost due to mechanization. They are focused in building a community of classically trained artisans, working with their hands and hearts, to sustain the soul of a society through its handicrafts that have been traditionally passed down from generation to generation. They strongly believe that preserving the traditional artistic traditions can help heal a culture that is ravaged with strife and war. In an exclusive interview with The Nation they talk about their success and career. Following are the excerpts of the interview.
Tell us about the journey of an ordinary girl who perused their passion in craftsmanship that led to building up a brand LÉL?
This journey of 30 years has been very challenging but extremely fulfilling. Although I was an art student, working in stone came by chance, which then became a passion. I have studied art at school and college so I was already an art student, working in various mediums but when I came across the technique of transforming “hard stone” into works of art I continued to evolve this new passion.
What is your chosen medium and what techniques do you follow to indulge new ideas with your work?
I have worked in several mediums. As an artist, however, Lél is centered on stone and we have developed various techniques through trial and error. Some techniques I have invented on my own but at core we follow the ancient Florentine technique.
How would you describe your work and where do you think it fits within the sphere of contemporary art?
Our work is based on a traditional art form. However, we are attempting to combine modern aesthetics without compromising with the techniques of Pietra dura. Pietra dura is a very ancient technique and is extremely time consuming which makes it very expensive. We are trying to make contemporary pieces and modernizing it without changing the technique.
Would you like to share some interesting events that led to a success story of your brand Lél?
During the early 1980s, I was travelling through the antique bazaar of Peshawar's Walled City. The market lanes teemed with all kinds of wares and they were also marked by Afghan refugees who had poured into the city in scores due to the Russian invasion and subsequent war in Afghanistan.
A small box with a roughly hewn image of an American eagle caught my eye at one of the stalls. Upon asking its maker, I was guided to the home of an old Afghan man living in a tiny room laden with works in stone inlay. The art, they acknowledged, had been passed down in their family through generations.
For me, this was a transformative moment. The chance discovery of a graven box in Peshawar served as impetus for me to begin learning techniques of Pietra dura with a master artisan.
Where do you get the beautiful stones you use in your work? Describe the kinds of stones for our readers?
Our palette is a wide array of wonders, which includes a range of semi-precious stones (Onyx, Jasper, Agate, Jade, Serpentine, Sandstone), and coloured marble (Mardan pink and Ziarat white) sourced from the mountains of Pakistan. Whereas, Lapis Lazuli is sourced directly from the Badakhshan province in Afghanistan, Malachite from South Africa and Turquoise from Iran, our pallette is itself a discovery of the natural wonders, which we artistically shape and customise.
Where do the craft of Parchin Kari design stands today?
There is only one school in Florence that still practices this technique. They call it a laboratory not a workshop. The art form still survives in Agra as MKughal emperors were big patrons of this art form. The Taj Mahal itself is decorated with stone inlay and we are perusing it in Pakistan. The technique varies from place to place, but the concept of stone inlay remains the same.
Any upcoming exhibitions audience should be looking forward? What's on the horizon for you at the moment?
We are exhibiting at the HSY Mansion in Karachi from the 5th till the 7th of January. There was a lot of demand coming from Karachi for an exhibition. I feel people in Karachi really understand and appreciate the art and technique of what we do. After this we are also planning an exhibition in Lahore.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Superstore is staying put at NBC.
The network on Tuesday, February 14 handed out a renewal to the America Ferrera-led comedy. The series will return for a 22-episode third season, The Hollywood Reporter reveals.
“We are extremely proud of Superstore, which is one of the smartest and funniest comedies on television today,” NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke said in a statement. “Through the show's expertly drawn characters, our producers and cast do a remarkable job touching on many issues in which audiences can relate. To its credit, not only does Superstore make us laugh, but it makes us think as well.”
The single-camera workplace comedy centers on a group of employees at a Wal-Mart-like retail store in St. Louis. Justin Spitzer (The Office) created the series and executive produces with Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad and Gabe Miller & Jonathan Green. Universal Television produces in association with Spitzer Holding Company and The District.
Superstore was a solid performer for NBC in its first season last winter and became one of just two half-hours at the network to return for the 2016-17 season (the other being The Carmichael Show). Going into its second season, Superstore also got the benefit of airing a special episode behind the Summer Olympics in August — an episode which drew 9.7 million viewers. So far this season, the show has averaged a 1.8 demo rating among adults 18-49 in live-plus-seven-day numbers.
Although the series was originally only picked up for a 13-episode season two, NBC ordered a back-nine in September.
Superstore is the second comedy at NBC to get an early renewal, joining the Kristen Bell-Ted Danson starrer The Good Place. The network also handed out a two-season renewal to family drama This Is Us last month. While the latter hails from outside studio 20th Century Fox Television, Superstore and The Good Place are both produced in-house — a sign of the times as networks continue to push for vertical integration.
NBC still has yet to launch several first-year comedies, including legal satire Trial & Error, Marlon Wayans' Marlon and Great News from 30 Rock exec producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. In addition to Superstore and The Good Place, the network also has the Will & Grace revival on deck for the 2017-18 season.
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May left China on Friday with deals worth more than 9.3 billion pounds ($13.26 billion), at the end of a three-day trade mission where President Xi Jinping pledged to upgrade their “golden era” in relations.
Britain is trying to reinvent itself as a global trading nation after a 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union, and China, the world's second-largest economy, is high on the list of countries that Britain wants to sign a free trade agreement with.
Speaking at a business summit in China's commercial capital Shanghai, May said Britain was keen to help bring Xi's vision for globalisation and a more open Chinese economy to life.
“Meanwhile, the UK is preparing to leave the European Union. We're seizing the opportunity to become an ever-more outward-looking Global Britain, deepening our trade relations with nations around the world - including China,” they said.
Chinese investment is helping Britain develop infrastructure and create jobs, with some 50,000 British businesses importing goods from China and more than 10,000 sell their goods to China, they added.
“We've agreed on moves to bring more of the UK's internationally renowned food and drink to China, to open up the market to some of Britain's world-class financial services providers,” May said.
The 9.3 billion pounds in deals will create over 2,500 jobs across the United Kingdom, the British government said.
Britain's financial services firms alone secured deals worth more than 1 billion pounds and market access, that would lead to 890 jobs, it said, without giving details.

China sees Britain as an important ally in its call for more open global markets, despite widespread concerns in the foreign business community about the difficulty of operating in China, and both countries refer to a “golden era” in relations.
Meeting in Beijing late on Thursday, Xi told May the two countries should “add new meaning into the bilateral ties so as to forge an enhanced version of the ‘Golden Era',” according to state-run media.
China has also been appreciative of Britain's enthusiasm for the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Xi's Belt and Road initiative to build a new Silk Road.
In a front page commentary on Friday, the overseas edition of the People's Daily said Britain had shown “intelligence and pragmatism” in supporting Belt and Road.
“It is a model for other Western nations,” it said.
But Brexit has unnerved Beijing, concerned about losing an important voice supporting free trade in the European Union and what it may mean for market access to Europe for Chinese firms which have invested in Britain.
Still, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told May on Wednesday that China's relations with Britain will remain unchanged through Brexit.

Gabrielle Fonrouge – NY POST
A GoFund Me page has been set up for the hero dad who attacked the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar in court on Friday. The “Show support for Randall Margraves” fundraised close to $10,000 in less than three hours from more than 200 supporters. The original goal was only $1,000. The creator of the fundraiser, identified as co-worker Aaron Pangborn by MLive, wrote on the page it was made “to help a brother and friend in need.” Supporters commended Margraves actions and said any father would have done the same thing.

It doesn't take much of a nudge from a vehicle for a roadside sign post to end up getting in the way of pedestrians.The edges of our roads are cluttered with all kinds of stuff — fire hydrants, traffic signals and utility posts, to name a few — that are necessary to daily life and safely navigating the street.The most pervasive are street signs that provide essential cues to drivers on where to go — or not — and what to do while getting there. Without them we'd be guessing, and likely engaging in erratic driving.But the sheer volume of necessary objects along the curb also exposes them to the rough-and-tumble of life on the street, and all the hard knocks that go with it.And sooner or later, all the vehicles that go whooshing past the objects make it inevitable that inadvertent contact between them will happen.Article Continued BelowThat may be the best way to explain a sign post that somehow ended up bent across a busy downtown sidewalk, where it forces pedestrians to go one way or another.A reader told us they are often on the sidewalk on the west side of McCaul St., just south of Baldwin St., and has for at least a year been dodging the sign post, particularly when two or more people converge at the same spot.“Sometimes I have to walk along the edge of the curb to get past it, when other people come along and go on the other side of it,” they said, adding that when it's busy, “there's a bit of a people traffic jam.”
MIRPURKHAS - The Chemist and Druggist Association of district Mirpurkhas, which met here on Tuesday, adopted a resolution strongly condemning the suicide attack during the protest by their counterparts in Lahore and the introduction of a controversial drug act. The meeting was presided over by Association President Muhammad Rafique Amir and was attended by Mirza Imran, Ghulam Shakir, Aftab Memon, Iftikhar Ahmed, Santosh Kumar, Muhammad Kamran, Irfan Ahmed and others. Participants of the meeting rejected the controversial Drug Act, and expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of costly lives in the suicide attack in Lahore at the very time when protest by the pharmaceutics was in progress. They also prayed to Almighty Allah for forgiving the departed souls. The meeting demanded the government to immediately arrest those who carried out the attack and give them exemplary punishment. Participants of the meeting said that the chemists and druggists of Mirpurkhas, including pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors, stood by their brethren in Lahore and asked the government to realise gravity of the situation and meet demands of the chemist community.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -
Wednesday, May 30, 2018 at 9:56 am |
U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the first quarter amid downward revisions to inventory investment and consumer spending, but a robust labor market and income tax cuts are likely to boost activity this year.
Other data on Wednesday showed private employers maintaining a steady pace of hiring this month and the goods trade deficit falling in April. The reports added to solid April data on retail sales, business spending on equipment and industrial production.
Gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2.2-percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of first-quarter GDP, instead of the previously reported 2.3-percent pace.
The economy grew at a 2.9-percent rate in the fourth quarter. Economists expect that a $1.5 trillion income-tax cut package, which came into effect in January, will spur faster economic growth this year and lift annual GDP growth close to the Trump administration's 3-percent target.
The government reported that after-tax corporate profits surged at a 5.9-percent rate last quarter after increasing at a 1.7-percent pace in the fourth quarter.
That was the fastest pace of growth in profits since the first quarter of 2016 and reflected a boost from the reduction in the corporate-tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. According to the Commerce Department, taxes on corporate income decreased $117.4 billion in the first quarter.
The tax code revamp also bolstered dividends received from the rest of the world. Wages and salaries increased $119.5 billion in the first quarter, an upward revision of $3.1 billion from earlier estimates.
As a result, gross domestic income (GDI), an alternate measure of economic growth, increased at a 2.8-percent rate in the January-March quarter. GDI rose at a 1.0-percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output (GDO) and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.5-percent rate in the first quarter. That followed a 2.0-percent rate of growth in the prior period.
Economists had expected first-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 2.3-percent pace. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries were down. U.S. stock index futures were higher.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked to a 1.0-percent rate in the first quarter, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent pace.
That was the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013 and followed the fourth quarter's robust 4.0-percent growth rate. But the fundamentals for consumer spending remain strong.
The ADP national employment report on Wednesday showed private sector payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs in May after rising 163,000 in April.
In the first quarter inventories increased at a $20.2-billion rate, instead of the $33.1-billion pace estimated last month. Inventory investment contributed 0.13 percentage point to GDP growth instead of 0.43 percentage point.
The smaller inventory accumulation bodes well for GDP growth in the second quarter. The trade deficit in the first three months of the year was a bit bigger than initially thought. Trade was neutral to GDP growth. It was previously reported to have contributed 0.20 percentage point to output.
Trade could contribute to GDP growth in the second quarter. In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit fell 0.6 percent to $68.2 billion in April. Both goods export and imports fell last month.
Business spending on equipment was revised up to a 5.5 percent growth rate in the January-March quarter from the 4.7 percent pace estimated last month. That was still a moderation in investment following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017.
Investment in home-building fell at a 2.0-percent rate in the first quarter instead of being unchanged as reported last month.
Payday loans such as Great American on the Southern Boulevard in Montgomery must change how they do business with borrowers.
Shay Farley is an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC says it's been warning state lawmakers and federal officials something had to change in the payday loan industry. This has been five years in the making.
"The agency came and did a field study in B'ham in 2012 and since that time has been investigating payday loans," said Farley.
Five years later, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered all payday lenders in Alabama such as Great American to do what's known as a repay analysis. This has nothing to do with the high interest rates often attached to these loans.
"It only says if you're going to give a loan to a borrower that is less than 45 days you have to do an ability repay analysis so both the loans will be governed by protection. It gives Attorneys General across the country the power to enforce the new rule change," Farley said.
Great American referred all questions to corporate in Tennessee but we never heard from the company, and the head of the advocacy group that supports payday lenders in Alabama was said to be out of town Friday. Farley, meantime, says this is a good step in protecting consumers.
"Only 240,000 Alabamians borrowed yet paid over $160 million in fees, not to repay the loan but keep flipping it," they said.
The new rule is effective immediately.
The new rule did not make clear what the consequences would be if a payday lender violated the new rule.

WASHINGTON, July 4 (APP):A Pakistani American IT professional who worked for years for US lawmakers was cleared of allegations that they stole government secrets with the cover from House Democrats, a Washington Post report said on Tuesday.
Imran Awan and four of their associates, including family members, were subject of a federal investigation that they might be accessing congressional servers without authorization. After the case was surfaced last year, conservative media used it against House Democrats. Imran was apparently the “Pakistani mystery man” that President Trump referred to in their tweet while commenting on
the issue.
However, concluding its 18-month investigation, federal prosecutors said that the government had uncovered no evidence that they violated federal law with respect to the House computer systems.
As the federal prosecutors concluded their investigation, as part of an agreement, Awan pleaded guilty to a minor offense of making a false statement on a bank loan application, a crime that was unrelated to the investigation. Prosecutors said they would not recommend jail time, the Washington Post report said.
Those who were subject to the federal investigation including Imran's brothers Abid Awan and Jamal Awan, their wife Hina Alvi and friend Rao Abbas.
A Washington Post report said last year that the investigators of the Inspector General's office had been quietly tracking the five IT workers' digital footprints for months.
Awan and their associates worked as IT specialists for dozens of Democratic lawmakers, but were banned from the computer network in February last year after being accused of violating House security rules.
The investigation that followed was given aggressively covered by conservative media outlets, a term usually used for outlets that support Republican Party's views and policies.
“The case has highlighted Trump's willingness to lobby for specific outcomes of federal criminal investigations and to suggest a coverup by their own Justice Department,” the Washington Post report said.
“Trump also attempted to tie Awan to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server — a breach that intelligence agencies have concluded was directed by Russia,” the report added.
The office that conducted the investigation is led by a US attorney general who was nominated by President Trump, according to the report, which said that Awan was released from electronic monitoring and will be free pending their sentencing Aug 21 in the bank loan case.
Bank fraud charges against Awan's wife Hina were dropped by the prosecutors as part of Awan's guilty plea deal. While obtaining a bank loan, Awan had shown a rental property as their wife's primary residence. The loan was fully repaid.

CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela was "an act of craziness," the South American country's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Friday.
Venezuela's foreign ministry was expected to issue a statement on Saturday responding to Trump's comment that "a possible military option" was under consideration for the crisis-racked nation.
The country is deep in a recession compounded by shortages of food and medicine, while anti-government protests have killed more than 120 people since April.
Responding to Trump, Padrino told state television, "It is an act of craziness. It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States."
"As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela," they added.
Communications Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remark "an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty."
In a Friday night message on social network Twitter, they said, "The diplomatic corps is summoned to the foreign ministry for tomorrow, when it will release a communiqué addressing the imperial threat to Venezuela."
Last month's election of a legislative superbody packed with allies of unpopular socialist President Nicolas Maduro drew international condemnation for usurping the authority of Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress.
Maduro says the assembly, which has the power to re-write Venezuela's constitution, is needed to bring peace and prosperity to the oil-rich but economically ailing country. Critics say the assembly casts aside any remaining checks on Maduro's power.
The opposition boycotted the vote for the assembly, which assured that it would be stacked with Maduro allies.
The White House said Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the administration appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela once democracy was restored.
Teachers in Utica and Taylor are planning pickets Monday night to bring attention to challenges they allege in union negotiations in their districts. (Photo: .)
Teachers in Utica and Taylor are planning pickets Monday night to bring attention to challenges they allege in union negotiations in their districts.
Members of the Utica Education Association will conduct an informational picket from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday outside board offices in Sterling Heights ahead of the district's regularly scheduled school board meeting.
The district, located Macomb County, is the second largest in the state. The union contract covered 1,440 teachers and professionally certified staff but expired in June.
Eliza Parkinson, president of the Utica Education Association, said there has been little progress at the negotiating table toward an agreement. The two sides have been engaged in negotiations for nearly a year.
“We are asking for the district to actually bargain with us,” Parkinson said. “We believe the superintendent is driving all decision making, and the board isn't being given a full picture.”
Union officials say they want to partner with the district and rethink how buildings are used and add programs such as a vocational high school.
District officials say this school year, budgeted expenditures have outpaced revenue by $8.3 million. The fund balance is $20.7 million and projected to be $12.4 million at the end of the school year.
“That needs to stop. We have offered enough to get them there,” Parkinson said.
Earlier this school year, the district laid off about 15 teachers after its enrollment dropped by about 500 students. Last year, the district had 27,735 students.
District spokesperson Tim McAvoy issued a statement Monday saying the district has an “unsustainable financial model” that needs to be addressed as part of its contract agreement with its teachers' union, a conclusion a fact-finding team reached last week as part of a series of recommendations issued to bargaining teams.
The district is not in the red, McAvoy said, “but, as the Fact Finder states, we must address our economic realities.”
McAvoy said George T. Roumell Jr., a labor expert who met with bargaining teams from the district and the union, said “the parties will not be able to sustain their current economic situation. The economics are just not there. The State is not funding Utica as Utica should be funded.”
If the district falls below 5 percent fund equity, the State of Michigan can intervene, McAvoy said.
“In the view of the Fact Finder, the time has come to settle the contract now and move on,” Roumell wrote in their report, McAvoy said.
McAvoy said the finding affirm the district's fiscal challenges caused by formulas used for state funding and continued loss of student enrollment through reduced birth rates.
The report said the district has an average teacher salary that is the highest of all Michigan districts with enrollment of more than 2,500 students, McAvoy said, and that among the top districts with the highest average salaries, Utica also had the lowest overall funding level per student.
The average salary in 2015-16 was $80,334. Foundation allowance in 2015-16 was $7,572 per pupil.
“These are brutal facts leading to the structural deficit and the potential for putting Utica on fiscal stress by the State of Michigan,” Roumell wrote in the report, McAvoy said.
Roumell issued 14 financial recommendations based on proposals submitted by the negotiations teams. They address salary, benefits and duration of the agreement, McAvoy said.
The district would not disclose the specific financial recommendations in the report, which will be released later Monday evening, including how much teacher salaries would be cut.
Parkinson said the union is challenging the report and disputes its findings.
In Taylor, members of the Taylor Federation of Teachers are expected to gather at the Taylor Federation of Teachers' Office on Monday and march to the Taylor Board of Education Meeting at 6 p.m. to protest concessions they say the district is asking them to take.
Linda Moore, president of the Taylor Federation of Teachers, said educators, community members and students are coming together to support the educators of the Wayne County district as they are being asked to take concessions.
“Teachers' working conditions are our students' learning conditions. When teacher unions bargain a contract, they are not only bargaining for the people who are in front of our children every day, they are bargaining for our students. Class size, classroom supplies, curriculum, just to name a few important issues,” they said.
In 2013, the union ratified a contract that was concessionary in order to ensure the survival of the district, Moore said. Union members gave up thousands of dollars each, Moore said, allowing the district to eliminate a $13 million deficit.
Five years later, the district is proposing that teachers take additional concessions, they said.
Moore said students deserve additional learning opportunities, reduced class sizes and enriched curriculum.
“We demand that the Taylor School District invest in our classrooms,” they said.
District officials were not immediately available.

All Wayne Samuels wanted to do was drop off their wife at the new Vaughan subway station and get on theirs way.
Not so fast.
Before they could drive away after a minute or so, two city of Vaughan bylaw officers handed them a $40 ticket, they said.
“They don't have the proper signage there. I said to them (bylaw officers), ‘Where's the sign that says you can't stop there?' And they pointed way back toward the intersection. I said, ‘I'm making a left turn. I'm watching for traffic and pedestrians and there's no way I'm going to notice a sign that says you can't stop in front of the main subway building,' ” said a frustrated Samuels, 50.
What really bothers them is the notion that bylaw officers watched them stop, knowing they would ticket them and didn't just tap on their window and tell them to move along instead of fining him.

When the Golden Globes nominations were announced Monday morning, one surprising title kept popping up: All the Money in the World, which received three nods, for best director, the best actor and best supporting actor.
It's not that the movie doesn't have an excellent pedigree and a star-studded cast. Four-time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott directed the film, which revisits the real-life saga of John Paul Getty III's 1973 kidnapping. But the movie has been most buzz-worthy because portions of it were very recently reshot. After actor Anthony Rapp and others alleged that Kevin Spacey sexually harassed or abused them, Scott recast the actor's role as billionaire tycoon J. Paul Getty — the grandfather of the kidnapped teenager — even though the movie was already essentially finished. Instead of Spacey, viewers will see another Oscar winner, Christopher Plummer.
Scott reshot Spacey's scenes from Nov. 20 to 29 while simultaneously editing those bits into the finished movie. As they told Entertainment Weekly, “I move like lightning.” They were convinced that they would still have the drama ready for its scheduled Dec. 22 release. In the end, they had to push things back, but only a bit — the movie is to be released on Christmas. That's important for awards purposes: They needed to have the movie finished in time for a 2017 release to be considered for this season's trophies.
Still, it's amazing that a movie that finished shooting less than two weeks ago is up for three Golden Globes, including nods for Scott, Plummer and their co-star Michelle Williams. Apparently, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association members got rush copies of the finished product. On social media, some wondered if HFPA members were just rubbing it in about getting a sneak preview.
Still others questioned whether the voters actually saw the film.
Will Smith will put their own stamp on the Genie, Disney executives promised at CinemaCon on Tuesday while unveiling a behind-the-scenes look at its live-action remake of “Aladdin.”
Instead of imitating Robin Williams' rapid-fire improv and celebrity impressions, Smith will inject the magical wish-granter with a little bit of the Fresh Prince and a little bit of Hitch. They also, as the footage shown Tuesday demonstrates, does not make a terribly convincing woman when dressing in drag.
Smith's spin on the Genie isn't the only big change in this “Aladdin.” Director Guy Ritchie, best-known for testosterone-infused flicks such as “Sherlock Holmes” and “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” is leaning into the action sequences.
“He's able to make it hot,” said Smith in an on-camera interview. And, indeed, the footage showed a kinetic camera following Aladdin (Mena Massoud) running, jumping, and leaping across the rooftops and through the tangled alleyways of Agrabah as they evade the Sultan's men.
“Aladdin” will also get a feminist makeover. Princess Jasmine, who in the 1992 animated film, had little to do save for moon about the palace, is made of tougher stuff in this version. Naomi Scott, who plays the role in the live-action version, said that in the remake “Jasmine is strong and speaks their own mind.”
Related MPAA Chief Talks Piracy, Trade, Global Box Office Growth at CinemaCon NATO Chief Questions Need to 'Disrupt' Movie Business
“Aladdin” will also feature new music, lots of dancing and pageantry, and familiar favorites such as “Friend Like Me” and “A Whole New World.”
Disney received a rapturous reception when it took the stage at CinemaCon, the annual exhibition industry trade show taking place this week in Las Vegas. The studio has released a dozen movies that have grossed in excess of $1 billion over the past six years, and has several promising upcoming blockbusters on its slate, such as “Solo: A Star Wars Story” and “Avengers: Infinity War.” It's not just money that's made Disney a favorite of theater owners. The studio is adamantly opposed to plans to release movies in the home weeks after their big screen debuts — an initiative that rivals such as Warner Bros. and Universal support.
“The Walt Disney Company is committed to the theatrical window. Period,” said Alan Horn, the studio's chief, to sustained applause.

‘I was prepared for yesterday. I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this'

Cody Isaacson's father David wasn't surprised to learn their son died in a hail of bullets in their Chilliwack home early morning on Jan. 31.
Heartbroken at the loss, certainly. Angry at the devastating effects of illicit street drugs, indeed.
But most of all, David is frustrated at a perceived lack of investigative work done by the RCMP to solve crimes involving those in the drug underworld.
“I anticipated this happening,” David Isaacson told The Progress in an interview a day after their son was killed when at least a dozen bullets were fired at the known drug house Cody worked out of at the corner of Broadway and Cedar avenues.

“I was prepared for yesterday. I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this.”
Chilliwack's first homicide of the year happened just after 6 a.m. at the house at 9291 Broadway Ave. Neighbours reported hearing between six and eight shots fired at the time, although as many as a dozen bullet holes were visible in the front door and wall of the bright yellow house. Each hole marked with a letter, “A” through to “L” labelled by RCMP forensics investigators.
At a press conference at the scene Wednesday afternoon, IHIT spokesperson Cpl. Frank Jang confirmed 28-year-old Cody Isaacson was the victim of the brazen killing, a person known to Chilliwack RCMP.
But as yet police have not yet confirmed that Cody was also the victim of a home invasion at a house on Second Avenue on Oct. 25, 2017. The Progress has learned they were indeed in that house along with their girlfriend when a number of individuals wearing masks stormed in with guns and hammers.
Reports are that three shots were fired, none striking anyone, although David Isaacson insists Cody suffered injuries to their face from hammer blows before they took a machete away from an attacker and fought back.
• READ MORE: Chilliwack RCMP investigating possible home invasion
Asked to connect the October home invasion with the Jan. 31 homicide, Cpl. Jang said IHIT investigators will be working with the local RCMP Serious Crimes Unit to make connections between other incidents.
A frustrated father, David insists police were aware of who was involved in the home invasion but did little to investigate it, something they think might have prevented Cody's death on Jan. 31.
“I knew something bad was going to happen to Cody,” they said. “Let's face it, when you are in that lifestyle you make a lot of enemies. But the police did no investigation from the earlier home invasion. They know who did it.”
Still, they say IHIT told them on Jan. 31 “they want to solve this,” and a friend told them Cody's photo was posted on SkyTrain in Metro Vancouver with the RCMP looking for tips.
And while David speaks highly of their recently murdered son, they understand the “business” and insists that in the context of the underground drug world, Cody was one of the good guys.
”He took good care of their crew,” David said. “Nobody has anything bad to say about him. They were always the person to give something. I am kind compassionate to others, and Cody was the same way.”
Cody does not have any local criminal contacts according to Court Services Online, not surprising to their father who said they unfortunately only got into dealing last summer.
They do, however, have a history in the north. Upon their murder, the Prince George Citizen went with the headline: “Former Prince George drug dealer shot to death in Chilliwack,” pointing to their 2014 conviction for weapons and drug possession leading to a 442-day sentence in jail.
The Citizen reports they were arrested twice within three weeks at the same Jasper Street home.
“On both occasions, police found enough crack cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to suggest it was used to supply drugs to lower-level drug houses around the city,” according to Citizen reporter Mark Nielsen.
Still, even here, father David comes to their son's defence saying that Cody wasn't at home when the drugs and weapons were found, their girlfriend was, so they could have walked away.
“He manned up because they were home, not because they had to, but they did,” David said. “Cody was a man when it came to doing the right thing, and that has made them some enemies.”
David hoped, though, that Cody would leave the world, something that nearly destroyed their own life. A recovering meth addict himself, David says they turned Cody on to their relatively new faith in Jesus and they thought Cody was doing well.
But meth is a stubborn foe.
“The crystal meth is a really, really bad drug. It destroys everything that gets in its path. It happened to us.”
In a wide-ranging interview on Feb. 1, David seemed remarkably calm about what happened, something they attributed to their faith, but they also are a little conflicted on what to do next, admitting they may have still been in shock.
Told by someone via text the night of the killing that the Red Scorpions gang were in town and they needed to flee, their defiant response: “I'm not going anywhere.”
Upon further reflection of their goals pursuing their woodworking, their religion and moving on with their life, now with the death of their son, David switched gears.
“Cody was a good kid,” they said, getting emotional for the first time, suggesting that maybe it was soon time for them to leave the Fraser Valley.
“There's nothing for me here anymore.”
Cody Isaacson leaves behind three children.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold hit a one-week high on Wednesday, rebounding from this week's seven-month low, helped by a softer dollar and smouldering trade tensions, though gains were limited by the prospect that rising interest rates will support the greenback.

The dollar fell versus the euro and the yuan, with the Chinese currency continuing its recovery from 11-month lows after the central bank took steps to stem its rapid rise.
A weaker dollar makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors.
“Gold has been trending lower for several weeks and this being non-farm payrolls (week) the dollar is likely to remain in range, so people are taking profit on dollar and gold positions,” said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at FOREX.com.
“I'm still not convinced we've seen the lows so long as gold remains below $1,300. The dollar is on an upwards trajectory. I don't think (looming U.S. interest rate) hikes are fully priced into the dollar or gold.”
Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,255.21 an ounce as of 1114 GMT after touching $1,261.10, a one-week high. The yellow metal has gained over $20 from Tuesday's low of $1,237.32 an ounce, its weakest since Dec. 12.
U.S. gold futures for August delivery were trading 0.2 percent higher at $1,256.30 an ounce.
Investors are now looking to minutes of the June U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due on Thursday and the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday for further cues on monetary policy. Valuations remain supportive of the dollar, with markets pricing in two more interest rate hikes for 2018.
World stocks were dragged lower meanwhile by growing anxiety ahead of Washington's end of week deadline to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing's vow to retaliate in kind on the same day.
“Since the trade wars have been doing the rounds, if anything we've seen gold come lower. But if it continues to escalate gold could go only one way and that's higher,” a Sydney-based trader said.
China is putting pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against President Donald Trump's trade policies at a summit later this month but is facing resistance, European officials said.
Gold is often regarded as a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty.
Silver was 0.1 percent lower at $15.98 an ounce and palladium gained over 0.8 percent to $946.15.
Platinum was flat at $837.20 an ounce. The metal fell on Tuesday to the lowest since December 2008 at $793.
U.S. markets will remain closed on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday.
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Seeks Public Input for Parkwide Visitor Services Contract Planning
PAGE, Arizona – Friday, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area began accepting public comments regarding visitor services to help inform new concession contracts for the uplake, downlake, and possibly Lees Ferry districts.
“We are taking this extra step and asking for public comments now because we want to hear from folks at the beginning of the process,” said Superintendent William Shott. “This is an opportunity for anyone interested to offer options as we look at a blank slate for new visitor service contracts for the park.”
The existing visitor service contracts for those areas expired and are operating under annual extensions until new contracts can be set in place. Comments will be accepted through 5 p.m., April 27, 2018, at: http://parkplanning.nps.gov/glca-FutureContracts
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area administers a concessions program to provide visitor services within the park. Concession contracts currently provide for water-based services, lodging, campgrounds, restaurant/food, and tour services. Over the past few years, visitation trends and demand for land-based recreational opportunities have increased. With two of the larger contracts needing renewal, the park has an opportunity to restructure contracts in such a way as to address increased visitation and changing visitor use and to increase efficiency in managing contracts. Suggestions for visitor services at Lees Ferry are also welcome.
This public comment opportunity is not part of a formal environmental planning and compliance process and is not legally mandated. The park feels that the public can provide valuable insight, perspective, and ideas to assist in developing contracts that provide needed visitor services. In situations where proposals include significant changes to an area or would result in additional development, the park will provide further public comment opportunities as part of the formal environmental review process.

Oil surged on Tuesday, February 14, buoyed by an OPEC-led effort to cut output while rising production elsewhere kept prices within the narrow ranges that have contained them so far this year.
Brent crude was 80 cents higher at $56.39 a barrel by 1425 GMT. U.S. light crude was up 70 cents at $53.63.
The two benchmarks fell 2 percent on Monday. They are both now near the middle of $5-per-barrel trading ranges seen since early December.
“The usually fairly volatile oil price has barely budged for two months, the reason being conflicting dynamics in the market,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO Bank in Amsterdam.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017 in a bid to rein in a global fuel supply overhang.
But undermining these efforts has been rising production in the United States, where increased drilling activity especially by shale oil producers has lifted overall output to 8.98 million bpd. That is up 6.5 percent since mid-2016 and its highest level since April last year .
“Oil just appears to be caught in a range at the moment and mainly focused on those supply considerations,” said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
Although OPEC countries are largely sticking to their agreement with compliance around 90 percent, investors suspect the cuts may not be maintained, preventing them from having a bigger impact on prices.
“OPEC producers want the market to believe they will stick to the agreed production freeze (cut). But lessons from the past have made the market deeply suspicious,” van Cleef at ABN said.
Many analysts say oil producers will have to cut production more quickly to drain the global oversupply in 2017, Reuters reports.

The new country South Sudan has limited access to power means the entire communities are left darkness, especially in remote areas. But now the South Sudan's first solar-powered radio is a game changer.
According to Yahoo, Issa Kassimu, an electrical engineer, came up with the bright idea of setting up the country's first solar-powered local radio station. Since March 2016 the Mayardit radio station has been running successfully in the sunshine.
The new Mayardit FM is not only changing the media, it is also playing the role of game changers role on people live. The South Sudan's vulnerable populations are very isolated and any kind of information darkness can have a devastating impact.

At the time of independence in 2011 more than 2.5 million of people have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict. The majority of them are internally displaced and reliant on word of mouth and radio out how to access food, water, and shelter.
The UNHCR has reported that Mayardit FM, northeast part of South Sudan, is fitted with 84 solar panels and 48 batteries and can broadcast for 24 hours using reserve energy built up from sunlight.
The electrical engineer Kassimu says that so far $172,000 was spent on switching to solar power. The cost will be covered within five years and will eventually save the money on fuel, equipment, and repairs.
The most of the radio stations in South Sudan is depended on electricity while Mayardit FM relies on solar power. The countries 1 percent of the population has the access countries electrical grid. These generators regularly break down due to the unstable energy they produce.
However, the radio stations are not political. But the conflict of the country has affected them. The Radio community says they are more emphasizing on peace and cooperation in South Sudan.
Meanwhile, the radio station has played a role of a game changer on the peoples of South Sudan.
TEMPE, Ariz. -- In what coach Bruce Arians called "great news," Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson's knee injury is not serious and will not require surgery.
An MRI showed Johnson has a left MCL sprain that would require six to eight weeks of rest and rehabilitation.

Johnson, speaking to reporters Monday, said they knew a few moments after the injury that it wasn't serious because of the amount of weight they could put on the leg and their ability to move around.
The injury ended their NFL record string of at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of the first 15 games of a season. They also fell short in their bid to be the third player to have 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. Johnson ended up with 1,239 yards rushing and 879 yards receiving.
Alabama Republican Congressman Gary Palmer says they were injured when they sought cover during the shooting at the Congressional Baseball Game practice Wednesday morning.
Palmer released a statement Wednesday afternoon and gave their account of the shooting.
"This morning I was with my Republican colleagues practicing for the annual charity Congressional Baseball Game -- a game that this year, ironically, is to honor victims of the recent terror attacks in England -- when a lone gunman walked out by the third baseline and opened fire," Palmer said.
Palmer was not shot.
"I was about 20 yards away from the shooter. It was reported that I received treatment. This was due to me injuring my leg as I sought cover," Palmer said.
According to Palmer's office, the injuries were minor, they were treated by a physician and they hope to play in Thursday night's game.
Palmer also sent well wishes and prayers to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and the others who were injured. They also expressed their gratitude to Capitol Police.
Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks was also at the practice and said they helped put pressure on Scalise's wound.

A pipe bomb that was strapped to a man went off in the New York City subway near the Times Square area of Manhattan on Monday, injuring the …
The New York police are currently investigating an explosion “of unknown origin” that occurred at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, on the 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue intersection near Times Square. The device used has been described as a home-made pipe bomb. There was at least one injury and one arrested, according to local media reports.

A video emerged in social media purportedly showing a second explosion in New York's Port Authority area.
The station is being evacuated and several metro lines have been affected by traffic cuts. Several emergency crews are in the area. Police sources told CBS television that the explosion was caused by a homemade device and, in fact, the arrested, a 27-year-old man of Bangladeshi origin, had another explosive in their possession. The man, ‘wearing wires', detonated the device which they were carrying in their jacket. The pipe bomb explosion was carried out in the name of ISIS by a Bangladeshi, the sources said.
Both, President Donald Trump and the Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, have been informed of the situation.

LAHORE - Pak-China joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCJCCI) President Wang Zihai has said involvement of technology leaders was a must for Pakistan to produce research-backed products in market, for which Chinese model of indulging academics and technocrats in production facilities should be espoused in Pakistan to create more competitive products.
According to PCJCCI spokesperson, Wang expressed these views in a meeting with five-member Chinese delegation from Jinan technology University China. The delegation was spearheaded by Zhang Shoufeng while other members included Zhang Xiuhong, Xiao Jing, Zhang Min and Wang Li. During the meeting, proactive suggestions and proposals were shared in which both parties professed international cooperation as a fundamental component for learning globally recognised best practices.
Wang Li informed the delegation that from the platform of PCJCCI, they were contemplating to enter into partnerships with international technology leaders for providing opportunities to young scholars to generate fresh innovative startups. In this regard China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would help achieve Pakistan's knowledge economy goals, additionally, Pakistan's image internationally has to be improved so that more international partners were ready to visit and invest in Pakistan, they maintained.
The PCJCCI president also informed them about the plans to form specialised science and technology parks that were much needed for waning the digital divide between China and Pakistan. They suggested that such parks could be formed in Pakistan with the cooperation of Chinese technology universities and innovative technology leaders.
The head of the delegation, Zhang Shoufeng, highly appreciated the idea shared by Wang Li, and said that the purpose of their visit was also to extend bilateral relations with Pakistan beyond manufacturing to the knowledge sharing. They suggested that to achieve the desired goals in innovation and technology, the Pakistani government must focus on improving the quality of research being conducted in the existing universities by providing them higher resources and expanding their ambit.
It was observed that the number of PhDs in Pakistan had risen from 300 in 1998 to about 7000 today, but still, knowledge platform and production platform was not synergised. It was jointly agreed that efforts should be made to outline strategic goals where fresh graduates and researchers could also contribute in value addition of the commodities being produced in Pakistan.

New York authorities say they have thwarted an ISIS-inspired terror plot to strike landmarks, subways and concerts.
The plot was disrupted with the arrest of three men, including a Canadian who allegedly spoke about wanting to bomb Times Square and shoot concertgoers.
It was claimed that one of the suspects also spoke of wanting to shoot subway passengers before setting off suicide vests to kill or injure as many people as possible.
The Canadian man allegedly told an undercover agent they wanted to “create the next 9/11", adding: "We just need guns in our hands. That's how the Paris guys did it."
The undercover agent convinced the suspects that they were an ISIS supporter prepared to carry out the attacks with them, say prosecutors.

But sources told NBC New York that the plot to target sites during Ramadan in 2016 was more aspirational than operational.
The suspects arrested on terror charges are Canadian citizen Abdulrahman el Bahnasawy, 19, Talha Haroon, 19, a US citizen living in Pakistan, and Russell Salic, a 37-year-old Philippines citizen.
Prosecutors said el Bahnasawy allegedly told an undercover agent that the suspects wanted to "shoot up concerts cuz they kill lots of people".
They were accused of buying bomb-making materials and securing a cabin near New York that would be used as a base and bomb-making factory.
Prosecutors said el Bahnasawy was arrested in New Jersey in May last year as they travelled to the New York area in preparation for the attacks.

They have pleaded guilty to terrorism offences and is awaiting sentencing.
Haroon allegedly made plans to travel from Pakistan to New York, and travelled within Pakistan to meet with explosives experts.
Salic is accused of wiring money from the Philippines to the US to fund the terror plot.
Both have been arrested and attempts to extradite them to face charges in the US are under way.
Prosecutors claim the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS and wanted to carry out attacks similar to those in Brussels and Paris.
The FBI and NYPD discovered and interrupted the plot months ago, but details are just emerging today.

It wasn't announced earlier because there was a hunt for potential accomplices or terror links, NBC News reported.
Haroon was arrested in September last year and Salic was arrested in April this year.
In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured dozens more at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.
The terrorist blew themselves up in a foyer as fans left the gig and mums and dads waited to pick up their children.
In the years since the 9/11 terror attacks, authorities in New York have foiled a number of plots to attack landmarks including Times Square.
Terrorist Faisal Shahzad, then 31, was sentenced to life prison after they left a Nissan Pathfinder packed with explosives in Times Square in May 2010.
Street vendors alerted police after they saw smoke coming from the car.

Govt focusing to give relief to power users
Islamabad
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday directed the Establishment Division to review the need to cut down on number of occupational groups of Federal Civil Services in line with reduced domain of federal government after the 18th Amendment.
Chairing a meeting on Civil Service Reforms at the PM Office, the Prime Minister observed that there was a need to review the methodology of induction in order to address issues resulting in low success rate in the competitive examinations.
The Prime Minister directed that process of legislation should be initiated to give effect to the proposal.
It was also decided to continue the consultative process to review the incentive structure for the bureaucracy which was the biggest impediment in getting a quality human resource in the civil services.
Meanwhile, a detailed briefing was given to the Prime Minister by Minister for Planning, Development and Reform Ahsan Iqbal on various proposals aimed at restructuring of the present structure of the civil service in order to make it more vibrant, professional and capable of bracing modern day challenges.
It was decided to undertake an in-depth analysis of the FPSC results data for the past three years and to make comparative analysis of the recruitment process with other developing countries.
On improving standards of professional training, it was decided, in principle, to upgrade and elevate National School of Public Policy to the status of National University of Public Policy and Administration. The meeting was attended by Chairman FPSC Naveed Akram Cheema and senior officials of Planning, Establishment and Finance Divisions.
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday said the government was cognizant of the problems faced by consumers in view of the power shortage and therefore was focusing on providing relief to the domestic and industrial consumers.
The Prime Minister expressed these views while chairing a meeting of the federal cabinet here at the PM Office.
The Cabinet lauded the efforts of former Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the Ministry of Power and the Cabinet Committee on Energy to have achieved the milestone of enhanced power generation which stood greater than the demand of electricity.
The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that several power projects were still in the implementation stage that would further enhance the generation capacity.
The Cabinet approved the signing of agreement on economic cooperation for the establishment of Joint Commission between Pakistan and Czech Republic.
The Cabinet also approved a proposal for the regulations of arms licenses for prohibited (automatic) weapons and lifting of ban on non-prohibited bore arms license. mAccording to the proposal, all automatic weapons shall be required to be converted to semi-automatic by authorized dealers within a specified time and get new licenses in lieu of the previously issued licenses.— APP
GENEVA - Intensified coalition air strikes have killed at least 300 civilians in the Syrian northern city of Raqqa since March, as US-backed forces close in on the stronghold of Islamic State forces, UN war crimes investigators said on Wednesday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by a US-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa a week ago to take it from the militants. The SDF, supported by heavy coalition air strikes, have taken territory to the west, east and north of the city.
“Coalition air strikes have intensified around the city,” said Paulo Pinheiro, chairperson of the UN Commission of Inquiry. “As the operation is gaining pace very rapidly, civilians are caught up in the city under the oppressive rule of ISIL, while facing extreme danger associated with movement due to excessive air strikes,” they told reporters.
Karen Abuzayd, an American commissioner on the independent panel, said: “We have documented the deaths caused by the coalition air strikes only and we have about 300 deaths, 200 in one place, in al-Mansoura, one village.”
The UN investigators do not have access to Syria. They interview survivors and witnesses in neighbouring countries or by Skype with those still in Syria.
Pinheiro, speaking earlier to the UN Human Rights Council, said that there had been a “staggering loss of civilian life” due to coalition air strikes that had forced 160,000 civilians to flee their homes.
Rival forces are racing to capture ground from Islamic State around Raqqa, and the Syrian army is also advancing on the desert area west of the city.
Separately, Human Rights Watch expressed concern in a statement about the use of incendiary white phosphorous weapons by the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, saying it endangered civilians when used in populated areas.
White phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon and can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. But it can cause serious burns and start fires.
In its speech to the 47-member forum in Geneva, the US delegation made no reference to Raqqa or the air strikes. US diplomat Jason Mack called the Syrian government “the primary perpetrator” of egregious human rights violations in the country.
Pinheiro said that if the international coalition's offensive is successful, it could liberate Raqqa's civilian population, including Yazidi women and girls, “whom the group has kept sexually enslaved for almost three years as part of an ongoing and unaddressed genocide”.
They also said that 10 agreements between the Syrian government and armed groups to evacuate fighters and civilians from besieged areas, including eastern Aleppo last December, “in some cases amount to war crimes” as civilians had “no choice”.
Syria's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Hussam Edin Aaala, denounced violations “committed by the unlawful US-led coalition which targets infrastructure, killing hundreds of civilians including the deaths of 30 civilians in Deir al-Zor.”

A man and woman found slumped in Ohio, just a few feet away from a 4-year-old, high on drugs. A mother sprawled on a store floor in Massachusetts, unable to respond to their daughter's cries. And in Detroit, two people filmed unconscious in a car — a syringe still hanging from someone's leg.
The video clips shown Wednesday during a town hall at Wayne State University powerfully illustrated the impact of a drug and opioid prescription epidemic that authorities in Michigan and across the country say are hiking the number of overdose deaths.
The fatalities in Metro Detroit in recent years also underscore the need for communities and law enforcement to address the problem, say experts and professionals in the field. Michigan ranked 10th nationwide in 2015 in overdose death rates
“This shows that things are changing and we have to respond,” said Cynthia Arfken, a Wayne State University professor and epidemiologist.
The causes, effects and responses to the epidemic anchored the forum hosted by the Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority. State, federal and local professionals explored its origins as well as offered the community tips on resources.
The event follows 52,404 overdose deaths across the United States in 2015, the latest data available from the federal Centers for Disease Control. Drug-related deaths climbed to nearly 2,000 in Michigan then, up about 500 two years earlier.
The state House on Tuesday approved a six-bill package meant to fight opioid and prescription drug addiction. The federal government in April also announced grants of nearly half a billion dollars for prevention and treatment programs to confront the opioid epidemic. Michigan is slated to receive nearly $16.4 million.
And in May, Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation into law that makes a narcotic overdose antidote available at pharmacies.
Panelists who spoke Wednesday night before a crowd of about 100 people linked the epidemic to several causes.
After years of operation overseas, heroin production expansion to Mexico “makes it much more readily available for our market in the United States — and unfortunately cheaper,” said Daniel Lemisch of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Michigan. They also noted a proliferation of illegitimate prescriptions.
“The heart of the problem is crooked doctors who are basically drug dealers with a lab coat ... pushing opioids into our community with devastating results.”
That coincided with noticeable upticks in drug-related deaths in Michigan, Arfken said. In Wayne County last year, the Medical Examiner's Office reported that such deaths jumped 56 percent, with fentanyl, a pain medication, accounting for roughly half of those fatalities.
The problem is reflected in the number of people seeking treatment or services through groups such as the Self-Help Addiction Rehabilitation Inc.
“This is a very lucrative illegal enterprise for a lot of people,” said David Gelios, special agent in charge of the FBI's Detroit office.
The Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority is distributing more drug antidote kits to first responders, who are carrying Narcan on their runs, and at the Detroit Police Department, “we are in the first stages of giving it to our officers” for help at scenes, Assistant Chief Arnold Williams said.
“Arresting is not going to solve the problem,” Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Sarah DeYoung said.
The session informed attendees such as Linda Holmes of Detroit, who was seeking resources to help their son deal with a heroin addiction. “They're trying to do something” about the epidemic, they said. “It's a good thing.”

PESHAWAR - Awami National Party (ANP) central leader and senior parliamentarian, Ilyas Bilour, on Wednesday demanded of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to hold probe against Pervez Khattak for purchasing buses for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project at an exorbitant price of Rs27.5 million each.
In a press statement issued on Wednesday, Bilour said that in Punjab each bus was purchased from Korea at a price of Rs10 million while in KP buses were purchased from China for Rs27.5 million.
"All records of corruption have been broken in this BRT project by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government," alleged Bilour, who is also a former member of Upper House of the Parliament. They reiterated their demand from NAB to hold an impartial inquiry in BRT project especially in the purchase of buses for the project. People should know that how the province was looted by those who were voted by people in the name of change, Bilour added. “If NAB did not hold an inquiry into this scam and unveiled faces of the corrupt, it will lose people's confidence,” they said.
MMA ON TICKET DISTRIBUTION

All district organisations were directed to finalise the names of all aspirants within two days and send the list to the provincial parliamentary board. This was decided in a meeting of MMA provincial council, held at the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam provincial office under the supervision of MMA Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa President Maulana Gul Naseeb Khan and general secretary Abdul Wasay.
All district presidents, general secretaries, and secretary information were present in the meeting.

It was also stated that in case of a deadlock or differences, the final decision would be made by the provincial parliamentary board.
In the meeting, all the district presidents were directed to start work and finalise the names of aspirants within two days and then send the lists to the provincial office.
On the occasion, the MMA leaders claimed that their government would end the ongoing political crisis in the country and hoped that the party would emerge as a powerful force in the upcoming general elections. They said that the public received nothing but hopelessness in the past 70 years and now they were looking towards MMA for a solution.
Donald Trump's presidency has put a spotlight on the risks of nuclear weapons, the Nobel Peace Prize winning nuclear disarmament group ICAN said on Friday.
"The election of President Donald Trump has made a lot of people feel very uncomfortable with the fact that they alone can authorise the use of nuclear weapons," the head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, Beatrice Fihn, told reporters in Geneva.
They said the US leader appeared to have a track record of "not listening to expertise", and insisted their supervision of a massive nuclear arsenal "just puts a spotlight" on the dangers of such weapons.

LONDON (AP) — Nick Kyrgios is almost always worth paying attention to.
Whether he's slamming 42 aces, hitting the ball at up to 136 mph and saving all five break points faced, as the 15th-seeded Australian did during a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-7 (5), 6-3 victory over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan in Wimbledon's first round on Tuesday.
Or accidentally hitting a ball girl with one serve, causing them to cry and leave the court, as also happened at the England Club.
Or arguing with the chair umpire over all manner of matters, possibly important or not.
Or barking at their guest box, at one point telling those in it they might as well not be there at all.
“He's always doing this,” said Istomin, who knocked off defending champion Novak Djokovic at the 2017 Australian Open. “It's not annoying me, so if they want to talk, OK.”
Or being by turns self-reflective and sarcastic during the news conference afterward, including when a reporter noted that Kyrgios' tennis career has featured some complicated moments — a euphemism if ever there was one — and they shot a sideways glance toward their agent, smiled wryly and replied, “Have I?”
This is, after all, a 23-year-old who just last month was fined more than $15,000 for simulating a lewd act during a match. Who has been docked money in the past for offenses such as crude comments about an opponent's girlfriend or quitting during a match for no apparent reason. Who has been accused of not giving their all on court. Who has displayed boundless talent in victories against players such as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, whom they beat at Wimbledon as a teenager ranked 144th in 2014.
They certainly earned points for honesty after Tuesday's win, not shy about expressing how much they like their chances at a tournament where he's reached the quarterfinals.
“I guess I'm in kind of, like, a happy place. I feel like I'm playing well. I mean, I have a different approach. I feel like I'm one of the guys that can cause a bit of an uproar at this event,” Kyrgios said. “We'll see how it goes.”
Asked whether it was exciting to be involved in such a tight encounter against Istomin, where the only service break of the entire match arrived in the penultimate game, Kyrgios was not ready to accept the premise.
“Not really,” Kyrgios answered. “I would prefer to play, like, a South American guy who's never played on grass before.”
Just telling it like it is.
They did that again when a reporter inquired about what seem to be mid-match fluctuations for Kyrgios, as they go from intense to laid-back to intense again, sometimes from point to point.
“I don't know, man. I just have so many thoughts when I'm out there. Like, I get so angry. I'm, like, I just go through so many different patches in a game. I guess it's so hard for me to find that balance,” Kyrgios said. “Yeah, I know what you mean. I look like I don't care one minute, then the next minute I'm playing really well. Not much really goes on, to be honest. … It's a tug-of-war, all the time.”

Manchester-Ariana Grande is in line to get honorary citizenship of Manchester from Manchester City Council after they arranged the One Love Manchester benefit concert to raise money for the victims of a terror attack in the city.
The council want to hand the ‘Dangerous Woman' singer the honour after they arranged the One Love Manchester benefit concert to raise money for the victims of a terror attack, after an explosion at Manchester Arena following the singer's performance there last month left 22 dead and many more injured.
They are proposing a new system, which would recognise those people who aren't residents of the city but still make an outstanding contribution to it.
Council leader Sir Richard Leese told BBC News: ‘'[Many people already see Ariana as] an honorary Mancunian. This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city. ‘'We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear ... [Ariana had] exemplified this response.''
Manchester City Council also revealed they plan to hold an event to recognise the ‘'great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the atrocity''.
Meanwhile, Ariana previously took to social media to insist they are ‘'thinking of their angels'' as they resumed their Dangerous Woman World Tour in Paris last week.
Captioning a photograph of the Eiffel Tower, they wrote: ‘'First show back tonight. Thinking of our angels every step of the way. I love you with all my heart.
‘'Grateful for and incredibly proud of my band, dancers and entire crew. I love you I love you. (sic)''

The Slippery Rock University football team travels to Erie, Pa to take on Mercyhurst University (3-2) for a Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) match-up with kick-off starting at noon on Saturday.
After their home overtime win last week against number five California University of Pa, The Rock moves up to number 12 this week in the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) coaches poll, as they look to go 6-0 on the season and 3-0 in PSAC play.
Last week was the second week in a row where The Rock had to score on their last possession late in the fourth quarter to come away with the wins. The Green and White currently sit in second place in the PSAC West, behind number four ranked Indiana University of Pa. (5-0), who SRU will play the following week at home.
“We're a 5-0 football team, but we could easily be a 2-3 football team,” SRU football head coach Shawn Lutz said. “But the belief that this team has, the togetherness, and the family atmosphere is there.”
Last week for Mercyhurst, they defeated Gannon University (1-4) in a close 24-22 victory at home to claim the Niagara Cup. The Lakers defense kept them in the game, as they have all season because they have only surrendered an average of 20 points a game through five weeks, which ranks them third in the PSAC in that category. Mercyhurst have found themselves in some tight games this season, as they have yet to win or lose by more than one possession.
“I think we're a battle tested team,” Lutz said. “It's not like their crumble under adversity or pressure situations, look how many they've been in and hopefully that's going to help us to move forward.”
The Laker's young offensive line, which has only one returning starter from last season, has given up the second most sacks in the PSAC this season with 14 total. This could bring trouble for Mercyhurst, as The Rock leads the PSAC in sacks for with 17 on the season, with redshirt senior defensive end Marcus Martin claiming 9.5 of those sacks.
On the offensive side of the ball, The Rock comes in ranked number two in the PSAC in average points per game as they average 44 points, with 220 points total on the season. For the Lakers, their offense ranks 13th in points coming into this week in the PSAC, as they have managed 97 total points this season, which averages 19.4 a game. Lutz mentioned how Mercyhurst's offense likes to pound the ball on the ground and to chew up the clock with a typical power eye formation.
“One thing they do is they control the football by running the football,” Lutz said. “They try to limit possessions and it's a totally different type of method and its been good for them.”
Rock redshirt senior quarterback Tanner Garry still leads the PSAC in passing touchdowns with 18, while also leading in passing yards with 1,693 through five games. Senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson leads the PSAC in receiving touchdowns with eight and receiving yards with 592, while fellow receiver, redshirt senior Milly Raye ranks not far behind with 522 yards and six scores. When it comes to rushing the ball, SRU has averaged 107 yards a game between redshirt senior Isiah Neely and redshirt first-year student Chacar Berry.
When it comes to PSAC conference play, it doesn't matter who you play. Lutz said if the team doesn't play up to their ability, their definitely going to lose.
“When you face Mercyhurst, you can throw the records out; I truly mean that,” Lutz said. “Mary (Schaetzle) does a great job over there at getting their kids to believe number one, to be physical, and just to play hard.”
Rock injuries this week include Johnson who is tending to a swollen knee and is getting an MRI on Thursday, while senior offensive lineman Ian Park is dealing with a foot injury. Coach Lutz said both players will be game time decisions.
The last meeting between the two teams came last season when The Rock defeated the Lakers 37-25, which included 31 first half points by SRU. This week marks the 10th game all-time between the two programs after Mercyhurst joined the PSAC in 2008, as The Rock owns the series 5-4. The game will get underway at noon on Saturday located at Tullio Field in Erie.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Pervaiz Khattak, has consented to compensate and pay for damages to the families of the deceased doctors, who lost their lives in different incidents on hospital premises.
After their meeting with a delegation of Insaf Doctors Association, the Provincial Doctors Association and others, their consent came.
They had a discussion on the issue that led to the confrontation between Young Doctor Association (YDA) and the Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) administration with Chief Minister.
Some doctors, about an estimate 35, had been arrested on Tuesday when YDA members allegedly locked the HMC's out-patient department and pressurized the staff members and doctors not to perform duties. Consequently, later on, the doctors were baton charged, as a result of which many doctors injured.
Taking action against the protesting doctors by HCM, the YDA members announced a boycott of their duties. However, when the doctors started protesting at the facility yesterday, after few minutes, again the HCM administration took action and arrested three YDA members.
Talking with the reference to the meeting, IDA Central President Dr Jawad said that in regard to compensation of deceased doctor families, a synopsis will be signed today, as CM has agreed to pay compensation to the families of the deceased doctors and set up an endowment fund for trainee medical officers and house officers.
They said, for the TMO's, a summary stipend would also be approved by the CM today, and the stipend since January 2017 would be released very soon. Amendments to the Medical Officer Act would be also passed from the K-P Assembly, they sustained.
Meanwhile, if the government released the arrested YDA members, the YDA has expressed willingness to withdraw the strike call and agreed to hold negotiation with the protesting doctors.
“If the government releases our men and agrees to hold negotiation with us, we will not go for a strike or boycott duties” YDA patron-in-chief Dr Alamgir Yousafzai told a private newspaper.
They claimed the HMC tortured and teased our YDA members who were still in the lockup, as well as the YDA president for the HMC, Ghaffar Shah, was seriously wounded and admitted to the facility.
“The ‘brutal' HMC administration ordered baton-charge against us, whereas we were protesting peacefully” said Yousafzai. ´The protest will be continued until our issues are addressed”
HMC Hospital Director Dr Shahzad Akbar said patient care would not be compromised.
“The administration was obliged to order police action as the YDA was distracting service delivery,” Akbar told the media, adding that the YDA had locked the outpatient department and those performing duties were facing problems.
“The system can't paralyze by few doctors and we will continue serving the patients,” Akbar said. They also showed to the media the CCTV footage in which doctors were damaging the locks at night so that they could not be unlocked in the morning.
On the other hand, a grand jirga comprising members of the PDA, IDA, MALGARI doctors, Watan Paal Doctor Forum and others was held at the HMC. The Jirga demanded their release and withdrawal of the cases against them.
They said in principle the K-P chief minister had accepted their demands and invited them for a meeting, but the YDA was not prepared to accept the representation of the PDA and others in the meeting. The jirga was to be apologetic that the YDA was not agreeing to a peaceful resolution of the issue.
A decision on the winning bid will be made June 13 at the FIFA Congress in Mexico
The group hoping to bring the 2026 World Cup to North America has defended its decision for a 60-10-10 split in games.
The plan calls for the U.S. to stage 60 games, including all games from the quarter-finals. Canada and Mexico will each stage 10 matches.
Carlos Cordeiro, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, called it “the most optimal mix of cities and matches.” And they said the bid is not anticipating that the world governing body of soccer will make any changes to its proposal, assuming it wins.
“The split of matches that we have proposed to FIFA frankly reflect the resources of the three countries,” Cordeiro told a media conference call Monday. “We in the United States are blessed with some very substantial resources in terms of stadium infrastructure, cities and so on. And that reflects the 60 matches we have on the table.
“But at the end of the day there is a reason why FIFA has encouraged joint bids and we do think that our joint bids taken together provide for a vastly superior bid than our competition.”

The so-called unified bid is up against Morocco to stage the men's soccer showcase. A decision on the winning bid will be made June 13 at the FIFA Congress in Mexico.
The North American group presented its bid book to FIFA on Friday in Zurich.
Steven Reed, president of the Canada Soccer Association, downplayed the decision by Vancouver to withdraw as a candidate host city because it could not agree to FIFA's demands.
“I think we're still really excited about that the candidate host cities that we have,” said Reed, referencing Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto.
“I guess to be perfectly honest I would be disappointed in that it's my back yard and I've lived there for most of my life,” added Reed, a native of North Vancouver, when asked again about Vancouver missing out.
Chicago and Minneapolis also pulled out at the last minute.
The 2026 World Cup will feature a newly expanded format with 48 teams and 80 games, up from 32 and 60 respectively.
9⃣2⃣ DAYS TO GO! 🏆🇷🇺
There's been 92 🇪🇸@SeFutbol goals at the #WorldCup so far, but only one produced a reaction quite like this. H/T: @andresiniesta8 😉 pic.twitter.com/xUkGiZQlRh — FIFA World Cup 🏆 (@FIFAWorldCup) March 14, 2018
Cordeiro also cited the “opportunity for record revenues” with all games sold out and some 5.8 million tickets sold, making for ticketing revenue of more than US$2.1 billion.
The North American bid features 23 candidate host cities — including the three in Canada and three in Mexico. That list will be likely be reduced to no more than 16 by FIFA should the North American bid prevail.
Mexican Football Federation president Decio De Maria said it will be easy for those living in the north of Mexico to attend games in the southern U.S.
“I think it is the same for Canadians,” they said. “They can attend easily the games that are going to be in the north of the U.S.”
De Maria called that mobility “a rich powerful tool of our bid.”
The three executives were in Kuala Lumpur where they were presenting their bid to Asian soccer officials. They have already visited officials in South America, Africa and Europe.
“We're not taking any vote for granted,” said Cordeiro.
The U.S. soccer boss said they were not concerned that the North American bid might be affected by anti-Trump sentiments around the globe.
“We believe strongly that this decision will be made on its merits,” they said.
“Look, this is not geopolitics,” they added, when pressed on the matter. “We're talking about football and fundamentally, at the end of the day, what's in the best interest of football and our footballing community. And we've had no backlash.”

Text of Michael Flynn's letter resigning as national security adviser, as provided by the White House.
February 13, 2017
In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, their advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.
Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.

Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.
I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way.
I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world.
As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for their personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of their presidency.
I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again.

Chad Bettis returns to the majors after battling testicular cancer and tosses seven scoreless innings to thunderous applause from the home faithful. (0:38)
I see Chad Bettis sitting in the dugout after throwing seven scoreless innings at Coors Field. Their pitching elbow is wrapped in a towel, and there's a smile on the face of Colorado Rockies manager Bud Black. The two men shake hands, and Black offers a little rub of affection on the top of Bettis' head. The handshake is a symbol of respect from manager to player for a job well done. Heck, seven scoreless innings at Coors Field is always a special moment, even if it didn't happen to be your first start of the season after undergoing nine weeks of chemotherapy for testicular cancer.
We only see the side of Bettis' face in the video, but we can still read a million emotions, from joy to relief to exhaustion to pride to maybe most of all a sense of wonder at the moment itself -- like the first time as a kid when you connect perfectly on the sweet spot of the bat or the first time you see a rainbow or perhaps the first time you fulfill a simple chore and your dad gives you a little rub on the top of your head.
I don't see just a baseball pitcher who has beaten cancer and pitched the most memorable game of their career. I think of my own dad who died last year. I think of an old friend from work and their son who is battling leukemia. I see reasons for optimism in this week of despair. I see hope in this time of hate. It's just a baseball game, but sometimes it can represent so much more.
What a special night. Thank you @cbettis35! It may have felt like you pitched tonight for just the Rox, but you pitched for so many more! — Ryan Spilborghs (@spillygoat19) August 15, 2017
After the game, Bettis would say they were fighting back tears until they took the mound.
"I don't think I was really in tune with what was going on until the fifth," they said. "Just so many emotions and I was trying to get them under control, but it was taking much longer than expected."
You couldn't tell watching them pitch. This was Bettis at their best. Remember: They won 14 games last season and was supposed to be the Rockies' Opening Day pitcher. They took the mound to a Danny Gokey song titled "The Comeback," although the Atlanta Braves nearly scored on the game's first batter, as Ender Inciarte's hit skipped past left fielder Gerardo Parra and Inciarte tried to turn it into an inside-the-park home run, only to be thrown out 7-6-2, with Trevor Story firing a great relay throw. DJ LeMahieu made a diving stop to end the fourth and save another run, but mostly Bettis cruised through their 90 pitches, inducing 12 ground ball outs and issuing no walks.
Funny thing is, the Rockies couldn't score, either. Julio Teheran matched Bettis with seven zeroes, and it looked like we might get just the second game in Coors Field history to go 0-0 through nine innings. This game didn't have Greg Maddux on the other side, however, and the Rockies finally broke through in the eighth, when Charlie Blackmon -- don't forget them in your MVP talk -- started a three-run rally with a leadoff triple. An error and Carlos Gonzalez's two-run single scored the winning runs.
Bettis didn't get the win since they aren't the pitcher of record, but there's not one person who watched this game who cares about that. They already have given us one of the biggest wins of the season.
The New York Yankees' secret weapon. The Yankees beat the New York Mets 4-2, as Aaron Judge hit just their second home run of August, then Aaron Hicks and Gary Sanchez homered off Hansel Robles in the eighth inning to break the tie. Hicks' blast deep into the right-field stands is a reminder of how valuable they were before going on the disabled list with an oblique injury in June. This was their second home run in five games since returning -- although Robles apparently thought it was a pop fly:

The secret weapon I'm referring to, however, is reliever Chad Green, who tossed 2⅔ hitless innings to lower their ERA to 1.95. Really, they have been more dominant this season than Dellin Betances or Aroldis Chapman. In 50⅔ innings, they have 74 K's and just 24 hits allowed, often pitching multiple innings. Among pitchers with at least 30 innings, only five have allowed a lower wOBA.
Green's key to success: A high spin rate on their fastball, which creates the illusion of a rising fastball that batters can't hit. Their swing-and-miss rate on their fastball is 40.2 percent, the highest in the majors, and batters are hitting just .101 against it. As a comparison, Chapman's peak swing-and-miss rate with their fastball was 41.3 percent in 2014, but he's at just 25.1 percent this year. Manager Joe Girardi isn't wavering from Chapman as their closer -- at least not yet -- and considering Yankees starters don't go deep, Green's middle-inning role is vital. But it will be interesting to see how Girardi manages the roles of all these relievers down the stretch and into the postseason.
The prodigy. The day after Rafael Devers homered off a 102.8 mph Chapman fastball -- the hardest pitch anyone has homered off in the tracked velocity era -- they homered again on Monday, and then again. In their first 16 games, Devers has 21 hits and six homers while hitting .339. Alas, Edwin Encarnacion also hit two home runs, and the Indians beat the Red Sox 7-3.

Trevor Bauer gave up three solo home runs, but did finish with 11 strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings as they continue to pitch much better of late and prove to manager Terry Francona that he'll deserve consideration for a role in the rotation in the postseason (yes, I'm handing the American League Central to the Indians). In their past four outings, he's pitched 28.2 innings, allowed six runs and fanned 33.
Kris Bryant is hot and Joey Votto is hotter. The Chicago Cubs pounded the Reds 15-5 -- the Cincinnati Reds, by the way, are on pace to allow 269 home runs, which would break the MLB record they set last year -- as Bryant went 2-for-4 with their 22nd home run. That's 11 hits in four games and 16 in seven games.
Just from the last 4 games, Kris Bryant has gone from
.279/.390/509 to
.296/.407/.541 #Cubs — Christopher Kamka (@ckamka) August 15, 2017
Then there's Joey Votto, who is so hot that Cubs manager Joe Maddon employed a four-man outfield against him:
It's not the first time Maddon has used a four-man outfield, as they used it against David Ortiz and Jim Thome when they managed the Rays. Whitey Herzog once tried it against Jim Rice. The reason for the extreme defense: With three hits on Monday, Votto has now reached base at least two times in 19 consecutive games. Here are the longest streaks since 1900:
Ted Williams, 1948: 21
Barry Bonds, 2004: 20
Pete Rose, 1979: 20
Joey Votto, 2017: 19
Interestingly, that was not the year of Rose's 44-game hit streak, which came in 1978. Votto has raised their OBP from .415 to .447 during this streak and now leads the majors in OPS.
We can't go without another Giancarlo Stanton highlight. Yes, they homered (again), which makes it 22 in 34 games:
On Sunday I wrote about how Stanton has closed their stance, perhaps leading to this hot streak. Hitting guru Bobby Tewksbary -- Josh Donaldson was one of their students -- breaks down Stanton's stance and why it's helped him.
Man, busy night -- I didn't even mention the first two major-league home runs by Rhys Hoskins of the Philadelphia Phillies or the first by the Kansas City Royals' Cam Gallagher. Theirs was a grand slam that also won a Royals TV viewer a $25,000 prize.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Republican leaders in Jefferson City say they are ready to help with the transfer of power after Gov. Eric Greitens announced they will be resigning Friday at 5 p.m.
House Speaker Todd Richardson (R-Poplar Bluff) said the Republican leadership has met with Lt. Gov. Mike Parson and invited the soon-to-be governor to address Missouri lawmakers in the next couple of weeks.
“We are pleased that there is an open line of communication and our most important focus is making sure is that we help the lieutenant governor with a smooth transition of power,” Richardson said.
Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard (R-Joplin) said they share similar views as Parson on issues such as job creation and training.
“It's not a happy time. It's not sad,” they said. “It's a time we just need to move on and we're going to help make that as easy as we can.”
The governor's announced resignation came shortly after a judge ruled they must turn over certain campaign information to the special House committee that's been investigating the governor.
That committee has canceled its meetings and so it's not clear if the information will ever become public.
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is seen as all but certain to keep its cash rate at a record low of 1.5 percent at its monthly policy meeting next week, a Reuters poll of economists found.
Out of 48 economists who were polled, 47 forecast the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would stand pat at its policy meeting on Feb. 6.
The RBA eased twice in 2016 but has since held steady as it balances the risk of fuelling further borrowing in the country's property market against tepid inflation. The housing sector has recently started cooling off from a blistering years-long pace.
While the majority predicted the central bank would keep rates steady until the third quarter of next year, 23 of 45 respondents forecast that it would tighten at least once by December next year, against one who expects two easings.
The cash rate is seen at 2.0 percent by June 2019, according to the median of 33 economists.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Economists were asked what the cash rate would be after the next RBA meeting in February and where rates would be at the end of each quarter until September 2019.

Chief Marcia Brown Martel sings outside the parliament buildings following a government news conference announcing a compensation package for indigenous victims of the sixties scoop, in Ottawa on Friday, October 6, 2017. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)
Survivors of a period in the 1960s that saw Indigenous children taken from their homes and placed with non-Indigenous families hope an agreement in principle with the federal government will put a stop to Aboriginal children being stolen from their language, culture and identity.
Beaverhouse First Nation Chief Marcia Brown Martel, who was themselves placed in the foster system as a child only to suffer emotional, physical and sexual abuse, said they have “great hope” now that a deal has been reached including $750 million in compensation for victims.
In February, the Ontario Superior Court found the government liable for the harm caused by the '60s Scoop. Brown Martel was the representative plaintiff.
“I have great hope that because we've reached this plateau that this again will never, ever happen in Canada again,” Brown Martel said Friday as they stood beside Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett on Parliament Hill for the announcement on the settlement deal.
At the same time, they warned, Indigenous children are still subject to the “millennium scoop.”
“Children are still within the child welfare system,” they said
“They call it ‘in care' but it adds a risk factor for them. Therefore, one must stop using that term … they're not in care. They're away from their communities … our children need to come home.”
Bennett fought back tears Friday as they announced details of the deal with Brown Martel and other survivors — a package that also includes up to $50 million for a foundation for healing and reconciliation.
The federal government has also earmarked $75 million for legal fees. The compensation money will go to individuals classified as status Indians and Inuit.
The '60s Scoop a dark and painful chapter in Canada's history, Bennett said.
“Their stories are heartbreaking,” Bennett said. “They talked of their identity being stolen. They talked about not really feeling that you belong anywhere because people have been moved so often or that they didn't really have a home.”
Too many Indigenous children are still being taken from their families, they added, insisting Ottawa must change the current design of the system to ensure funding goes toward children, family and communities rather than lawyers, agencies and non-Indigenous foster families.
“We want that overhaul to happen so that we a system of the rights and well-being of Indigenous children and youth to be raised in their language and culture and not have this harm done that was done to these courageous people,” they said.
The agreement is a ”first step” in resolving '60s Scoop litigation, Bennett added, noting the federal government is committed to working with other Indigenous Peoples affected.
The provinces and territories are also working on resolving remaining litigation, they said, adding individual compensation will be determined among legal counsel.
The agreement in principle announced by the government is less than the $1.3 billion Brown Martel sought for victims of the Ontario Scoop in which at-risk on-reserve Indigenous children were placed in non-Aboriginal homes from 1965 to 1984 under terms of a federal-provincial agreement.
In a class action started in 2009, Brown Martel maintained the government had been negligent in protecting them and about 16,000 other on-reserve children from the lasting harm suffered from being alienated from their heritage.
Jeffery Wilson, one of their lawyers, said previously the class action was the first anywhere to recognize the importance of a person's cultural heritage and the individual harm caused when it is lost.

Intel's teased the arrival of its Optane storage-class RAM in DIMMs.
Dubbed “Optane DC persistent memory” and suggested as a tier of storage between DRAM and SSDs, the product will ship in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB versions. Intel announced that the product “is sampling today and will ship for revenue to select customers later this year, with broad availability in 2019.”
Which probably means one or two server-makers might have some product before Christmas, but don't put these in your budget for a while yet.
Intel's idea is that these devices will just clip into a motherboard like any other DIMM, but offer persistent storage that's faster even than solid state disks. Which is a good thing because data in a DIMM slot has an easier path to the CPU than data on a disk, offering the chance to speed things up nicely. Intel's alleged that its tests – done with Optane test silicon on forthcoming Xeons – led to faster boot times and improved database performance.
When running an in-memory Redis database Intel said the new product delivered “more server instances at the same service level agreement (SLA) performance when compared to a system configured with just DRAM.”
The Register understands that Optane DC persistent memory will only work with Xeon CPUs, but not all of them, and that current Xeons may not support the product.
Intel's not revealed durability forecasts or offered prices for the new product, but has suggested that “systems architects and developers should consider new methods for data access and storage, and uncover opportunities to remove throughput bottlenecks.”
If you're willing to follow that instruction, Intel's already running servers packing the new kit at its Construction Zone. ®

Blood Orange's Dev Hynes released two new songs earlier this year, but neither, they clarified, would be on the follow-up to 2016's acclaimed Freetown Sound. Wheels are turning, however, as the songwriter has just announced a series of headlining dates to accompany a robust festival schedule this summer. They also reportedly shared a taste of more new music via Instagram Live.
In addition to their slots at Pitchfork Festival, Osheaga, and FORM Arcosanti, where he'll play a solo set, Hynes will spend the fall playing shows in cities like Seattle, Portland, LA, and Philly, among others. Tickets go on sale this Friday, April 27th, at 10 a.m. local time.
As for new music, Redditors say Hynes hopped on Instagram Live Monday night to say that they have a mixtape, album, and eight singles primed for release. They reportedly played four or five songs, and a commenter says they're “about 90% sure” they heard a feature from Solange, with whom Hynes previously collaborated on their True EP.
Stay tuned for updates and check out Hynes' tour schedule below.
Blood Orange 2018 Tour Dates:
Monopoly Man became the Internet crush of the day on Wednesday, after upstaging former Equifax CEO Richard Smith at a Senate hearing on the company's massive data breach.
The board game character, whose name is Rich Uncle Pennybags, was brought to life by Amanda Werner, an arbitration campaign manager for Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, groups that advocate for consumer rights and protections.
Almost immediately, the monocle, mustache, top hat, pillow case-sized bag of (#fake) Benjamins became a social media sensation.
The most unlikely viewers tuned in to the Senate Banking Committee hearing to watch Werner troll Smith, who was facing a roomful of angry senators after a hack that may have exposed the personal information of more than 145 million people.
People loved it.
"It was a very calculated move," said Werner, who prefers the pronouns "they" and "them," adding that it was hilarious to watch the scene become a meme in real time.
Werner mugged and preened for the camera and somehow, in a week dominated by sad and distressing news, gave people what they didn't know they wanted: a delightful reprieve.
Here's how Werner staged the viral protest — without getting kicked thrown out of the Capitol.
An alarm and an intern
Werner has attended a slew of Senate hearings and has even provided pro-consumer rights testimony in some cases. That is how the activist knew that getting on TV is all about location, and staying within the camera's frame.
The problem is that seats in the audience tend to fill up quickly, Werner explained.
"Luckily we have a very dedicated intern here," Werner said. "He showed up at 7 a.m. and held a spot in line for me so that we could get that prime seat." The one directly behind Smith, who was the target of the grilling.
Apparently, the intern was the first person in line.
During the hearing, Werner followed #MonopolyMan's rise to stardom in real time on a phone. Over Twitter Werner was able to figure out the best angles as their head floated in and out of the camera's view — at one point Werner peered over Smith's shoulder using the monocle to inspect the back of the millionaire's head; at another point they knowingly stroked the perfectly shaped mustache glued to their face.
Honed tone
Werner set out to garner as much publicity as possible for the type of advocacy work Public Citizen does on behalf of consumers.
"We wanted to do something to get people's attention," Werner said of the hours-long photobomb, adding that people's eyes tend to glaze over when anyone utters the words "forced arbitration."
Knowing that is the catalyst for coming up with creative protest ideas, Werner explained.
They added that given the somber tone of news coverage around the deadly shooting in Las Vegas this week, the goal was to inject a little humor into public discourse.
"I think this week has been a particularly rough week on the American psyche so I think people needed a little bit of levity," Werner said.
It certainly inspired tens of thousands of happy face crying emoji's on Twitter and on Facebook.
The decision to go the funny-route is in stark contrast the health care protests on Sept. 25 during a hearing on the most recent Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Demonstrators began chanting, delaying the start of the hearing. Fifteen people were arrested and charged with "Disruption of Congress," according to U.S. Capitol Police. Dozens, staging die-ins in the hallway, were arrested and charged with "crowding, obstructing or incommoding."
"There are a lot of different methods of protest and they all work for different instances," Werner said. "You have to decide which is the best for your particular situation."
Ultimately, Werner argued, a good protest leads to action. The notoriety is great to call attention to the cause, they said. But Werner added, "I hope that the effort [Wednesday] will make people not only laugh at the Monopoly Man and retweet these funny pictures but also to call their senators and tell them to vote no on SJ Res 47."
The bill would overturn a new rule intended to ban financial service providers, including banks and credit card companies, from using mandatory arbitration clauses to resolve their disputes and avoid class action lawsuits.
Fashion statement, not statement statement
There are certain lines that members of the audience at committee hearings cannot cross. They do not appear to be listed on the Capitol Police website, but here are a few guidelines that Werner has collected.
Wearing a costume? That's allowed.
Werner was a little concerned that the Capitol Police would not allow the top hat, but they didn't give it a second look.
In fact, Werner recalls hearing a story about another demonstrator who dressed as Abraham Lincoln, complete with the beard and requisite foot-long stove pipe hat, and legend has it they were also allowed to wear throughout the proceedings.
Holding up a sign? That is against the rules and can get people thrown out.
Werner knew that going in, but that didn't stop them from briefly holding up a yellow "Get out of jail free" card that appeared on screen a few times. "I didn't hold it up long," Werner confessed.
"I was a little afraid that as I was wiping my forehead with the $100 bill or doing other things that were calling a lot of attention to myself, that I might get warned," they said.
But the only warning Werner received was for holding a giant bag of money on their lap, which they immediately set on the floor.
Another word-of-mouth tip Werner has received: Writing messages on one's clothing is permitted.

Konstantin Khabensky's “Sobibor,” which screened in the market at Cannes, is based on a real-life concentration camp revolt during World War II, but although it is historically accurate, the director tells Variety that its “true quality” is its “emotional impact.”
The film centers on a Soviet officer, Alexander Pechersky, who organizes a mass escape from Sobibor, a prison camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. As well as directing, Khabensky also stars as Pechersky, alongside Christopher Lambert, who plays Nazi SS officer Karl Frenzel.
Although Pechersky led the revolt, Khabensky says the “main hero” is the camp itself. The movie is divided into different “episodes,” they say, and “every episode has its own destiny, its own path, its own rise and fall, its own details.” They add: “It was very important to me to research and show all of these episodes, and each were equally important.”
The actor-director says the film “speaks best to audiences who are open to emotionally accept things that are not easy to accept. We have been through 10 countries [with the film] so far, and everywhere this film goes to the heart of these people.” The film, although set in the past, is still relevant now, they say. “Humanity hasn't learned its lessons yet,” they say.
Khabensky says that one of the challenges of the shoot, which took place in Lithuania, was the cold weather, as the film was shot in the fall, the same time of year that the real-life escape took place.
The producers were Elmira Aynulova, Gleb Fetisov, who earned an Oscar nomination this year for “Loveless,” and Maria Zhuromskaya. Khabensky praises them for having the “bravery to go on the market with a film like this.” The Russian government also helped fund the movie.
All Media Company, which is handling international sales, has sold the film to Germany, where it is being distributed by KonoStar and Katrina TV, France and Switzerland, where it was picked up by First International Production, the U.K., where the distributor is 4 Digital Media, and Japan, where it was picked up by Fine Films. Other territory deals include Spain (Flins and Piniculas), Israel (KinoRai), Benelux (DFW), Poland (Nova Films), Hungary (Romis Entertainment), and Australia (Jewish Intl. Film Festival).

LONDON : Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing has said that their country is in contact with the Afghan Taliban's Qatar office and has repeatedly requested them to participate in talks.
However, the ambassador, in an interview with BBC Urdu service, said that China does not have influence over the Afghan Taliban.
Speaking of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, they said that their country wishes for cordial ties between the two neighbours and it is also striving for Afghan reconciliation process.
Commenting on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Jing said the multi-billion dollar corridor will be expanded to other regional states, including Afghanistan, as well.
They said the corridor is in its first phase, under which, work is ongoing on 21 projects, whereas another 20 are in the pipeline.
The ambassador said that around 10,000 Chinese nationals have been working on CPEC projects in Pakistan, and they have been satisfied with steps taken by Pakistan for their security.
Around 60,000 Pakistanis have also been working on CPEC-related projects, according to the ambassador.
Jing said law and order situation in Pakistan has significantly improved, compared to the past.
The ambassador further said they are hopeful that Gwadar is close to becoming an international trade hub.
To a question about Baloch resistance, the Chinese Ambassador said in their opinion they are not real Pakistanis otherwise they would have thought about Pakistani interests.

LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers will pay tribute to one of baseball's most celebrated home runs by introducing a "Kirk Gibson seat" at Dodger Stadium.
The seat will be added in the right-field pavilion in the spot where Gibson's game-winning homer landed during Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The chair will be painted blue and will feature Gibson's signature, the team announced Monday.
Tickets will cost $300 for a package that includes a companion seat, two commemorative T-shirts, food and drink. The Dodgers will donate $200 from each purchase to the Kirk Gibson Foundation to raise money and awareness for Parkinson's research.
"Kirk Gibson was part of one of the greatest moments in Dodger history, and we're thrilled to partner with Kirk to help them and their foundation raise funds and awareness in fighting Parkinson's disease," Chief Marketing Officer Lon Rosen said in a statement.
* Sale of up to $5 bln stake kicks off this week
* Foreign ownership limited to 49 pct
* Sabeco offers access to fast-growing Vietnam market
* Thai Bev seen as strong contender - sources
* AB InBev, Japanese brewers also keen - sources
By Anshuman Daga and Martinne Geller
SINGAPORE/LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Brewing groups including Thai Beverage, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Kirin Holdings are gearing up to bid for a stake in Vietnam's largest brewer, Sabeco, people familiar with the matter said, with the $5 billion sale process by the government opening this week.
The auction of up to 54 percent of Sabeco, in what is set to be Vietnam's biggest privatisation, offers brewers access to a fast-growing market with a youthful population and beer drinking culture.
Thai Bev, controlled by tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, is shaping up as a strong contender, the people said, as it is familiar with the Vietnam system and sees Sabeco as key to expanding outside its home market.
“They have been around this situation for many years and are very keen to get this asset,” said one of the people, none of whom wanted to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Last month, a Thai Bev unit bought a 49 percent stake in a Vietnamese company which, the people said, could be used as a vehicle to bid for Sabeco as a domestic player, giving it an advantage over international rivals.
Thai Bev had no immediate comment, but said in October it was keen to grow through acquisitions in markets such as Vietnam. Firms controlled by Sirivadhanabhakdi also hold a 19 percent stake in Vietnam's Vinamilk.
A spokesperson for AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, said the company was committed to Vietnam and to growing its business for the long-term. A spokesperson for Japan's Kirin said it was carefully considering its options.
Other potential bidders include Asahi Group Holdings , San Miguel and Heineken, though several people said Heineken already had a strong business in Vietnam and could sit out an expensive auction that values Sabeco at about 36 times core earnings - more than double the trading multiples of around 15 for some global brewers, according to Reuters data.
Heineken, which already owns 5 percent of Sabeco, did not respond to requests for comment.
Asahi could not be immediately reached for comment, but the Japanese firm's president told Reuters in September it was studying Sabeco.
San Miguel's president Ramon Ang said the Philippine conglomerate was interested to bid for Sabeco. Kirin owns around half of its affiliate San Miguel Brewery.
The Sabeco auction is on Dec. 18, and bidders who are keen to own a stake equal to 25 percent or more of Sabeco's shares need to inform local authorities a week before the auction.
OWNERSHIP CAP
Foreign ownership in Sabeco is limited to 49 percent.
That means overseas bidders can only bid for a minority stake of as much as 39 percent as foreign entities already own 10 percent.
Lack of control could put off some possible bidders, the people said.
“Having control of the business is very important for these international brewers because the multiple is very high. If you're going to pay that much you want to be able to institute your plans,” said one of the people, who expected international firms to sell their own premium beers like Budweiser, Heineken and Kirin through Sabeco's distribution network, in addition to Sabeco's beers, which include the Bia Saigon and 333 brands.
Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade, which represents state shares in Sabeco, said foreign investors can link with Vietnamese firms to buy Sabeco shares, but have to comply with local laws and regulations.
Sabeco's share price has nearly tripled since its listing a year ago, with analysts citing a small float as inflating its market value.
The brewer's sky-high valuations and a complicated sale process could pose challenges for some potential bidders, the people said.
The Sabeco sale could also set the pace for peer Habeco , in which Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S owns 17.3 percent.

Adtech startups like to announce when they've hit $100 million in annualized revenue, but Vungle — which focuses on delivering in-app video ads — is doing a bit better than that. It says it's now reached a $300 million revenue run rate.
And while the last three months of the year tend to be the biggest quarter for advertising, CEO Zain Jaffer noted that Vungle's announcement is based on January revenue — in fact, they predicted that the startup will bring in more revenue during the first quarter of 2017 than in in Q4 2016.
“I think we're in that one sector of advertising technology that is continuing to explode,” Jaffer said.
Specifically, they said mobile advertisers are increasingly focused on performance. That doesn't just mean clicks or even app installs — Jaffer said “the most profound shift” for Vungle has been getting access to post-install data, so it can measure whether its ads bring in users who actually open an app and spend money.
Competitor AppLovin recently sold a majority stake to a Chinese private equity firm for $1.6 billion, something Jaffer said “validates the space overall.”
“It's time for analysts to wake up and realize what really drives mobile revenues,” they added. “People are so obsessed with this idea that TV dollars are moving to mobile, but it's not just a format problem. There's a business model problem here” — something that's being solved as companies like Vungle can “literally prove what the user does.”
I also brought up Facebook and Google's current dominance in online ad spending — are they just going to take bigger and bigger pieces of the pie? Jaffer responded that Vungle takes “all competition seriously,” but they said it's differentiated by a focus on delivering “high value users” to advertisers.
“If you're that focused, I think you have the chance to be the industry leader,” they said.
Apparently Vungle has seen major growth in the Asia-Pacific region, with revenue up 400 percent since 2015. The company also says it's now used in 40,000 mobile apps. And it just released a report on mobile ad trends.

LOS ANGELES — Justin Johnson scored 23 points and Western Kentucky won consecutive NIT games for the first time since 1948 with a 79-75 victory over USC on Monday night.
Johnson spun in the paint and hit their patented hook shot with 1:03 remaining to give WKU a 76-73 lead and after Nick Rakocevic answered with a layup, Johnson went 1 of 2 at the free-throw line at 33.1.
USC first-year student Jordan Usher air-balled a 3-pointer with 24.2 left and the Trojans didn't foul, allowing Dwight Coleby to seal it with a dunk at 11.3.
Coleby finished with 13 points, Lamonte Bearden had 11 and Josh Anderson 10 for WKU (26-10), which plays Oklahoma State in the quarterfinals on Wednesday night.
Capitol Report
By State Representative, Leon D. Young
Scott Walker delivered their eighth state-of-state address last week. And, believe me, it was a performance for the ages. According to numerous political pundits, Walker is now facing the most challenging reelection race of their 25- year political career; and they have come out swinging.
Flanked by a group of unsuspecting parents and children, the governor began to weave their web of half-truths and outright lies. In a sudden and desperate effort to curry favor with working voters, Walker hatch their latest reelection ploy: A $100 child tax credit.
In speaking for more than an hour, the governor called for the $122 million a year child tax credit that would pay to parents even if they have no state income liability. The credit would be paid for by using the state's expected budget surplus, which was projected last month to come in $138 million better than previously expected.
Over the two-year budget, the tax credit as proposed would be paid out twice and cost about $244 million. Without the credit, that state is currently expected to end the current budget in June 2019 with $385 million in its main account. If the Republican-controlled Legislature approves the tax credit as proposed and other recent proposals by Walker, the state would be left with a budget cushion of less than $100 million – an amount that the state could easily exhaust in a matter of days.
The governor's newfound sense of compassion didn't end there. Walker has also proposed using $200 million in state and federal money to stabilize the state's Obamacare insurance market and hold down rising insurance premiums. Walker, a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act, now claims they are seeking state action because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unsuccessful in repealing the law. The governor's sudden decision to stabilize Obamacare premiums in the state is also a contradiction. After all, their blatant refusal to accept federal funding for the Medicaid expansion, coupled with their unwillingness to establish a healthcare exchange have caused premium rates to spike.
Walker's new bag of tricks also includes replacing the state's troubled juvenile prison, Lincoln Hills School for boys, with five regional facilities that would be located closer to the teenage offenders' home communities. The irony here is that Walker helped to exacerbate the problem. When Walker took office in January 2011, they moved quickly to close Ethan Allen and Southern Oaks, completely ignoring a task force recommendation that the juvenile facility transition required careful planning. And, to make matter worse, in their nearly eight years in office, Walker has never visited the troubled site to access the problem firsthand.
In addition, Walker is also proposing:
• Committing $50 million by June to expand existing state jobs programs in rural areas under a definition that would include 56 of the state's 72 counties.
• Seeking permanent federal approval for the state's SeniorCare prescription drug plan, which in the past Walker sought to scale back.
• Providing additional funding for low-pending school districts as well as districts in sparsely populated rural areas.
• Requiring able-bodied parents of children on food stamps to work or get training to receive more than three months benefits. This is a targeted population that Walker has repeatedly gone after and politically victimized.
Make no mistake about, Walker's new change of heart can be attributed to one thing — and one thing only: Their growing fear of difficult reelection campaign ahead. In a brazen attempt to suck up to hard-working Wisconsin families, Walker now proposes a measly $100 child tax credit, which is a complete insult. Let's not lose sight of the fact that Walker had no problem ponying up a staggering $4 billion in public money for Foxconn, a foreign technology conglomerate. With that being the case, Walker's recent about-face should be seen for exactly what it is: A series of reelection ploys that are calculated to yield them a third-term in office.
The Israeli government has scrapped its plan to forcibly deport African migrants, a move that had sparked protests. By JACK GUEZ (AFP/File)
Israel announced on Tuesday it had abandoned plans to expel African migrants who entered the Jewish state illegally, after failing to find a country willing to host them.
The plan had targeted some 42,000 migrants of Eritrean and Sudanese origin currently living in Israel.
Government legal advisers informed the Supreme Court of the plan's cancellation after certain unspecified countries refused to host the migrants, a government source said.
"At this stage, the possibility of removal to a third country is no longer relevant," the advisers said in a statement.
Migrants and aid workers have said Israel was negotiating with Rwanda and Uganda to accept the deportees.
The deportation plan has attracted a wave of criticism, including from the UN refugee agency, Holocaust survivors, and parts of Israeli civil society.
The government originally announced a plan under which it would present migrants with $3,500 (2,800 euros) and the opportunity to leave on their own accord, or face indefinite imprisonment with eventual forced expulsion.
In early April, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to cancel the plan, saying a new agreement with the UN would allow migrants to be transferred to "developed countries like Canada, Germany or Italy".
But they cancelled that plan several hours later, after caving to pressure from their right-wing base.
Human rights groups have long condemned Israel for its immigration policy and treatment of Africans seeking asylum.
Most of the migrants arrived to Israel after 2007, mainly from the Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
Security along the once porous border has since been signficantly tightened.
Most of the migrants have settled in a number of poor neighbourhoods in the coastal city of Tel Aviv, the country's economic capital.
I came over to say “hi” to my mom who has Alzheimer's and found them standing on the corner. Mom said they were on their way to the corner store. There is no store close by! Is this the wandering I feared?
No Wanderlust
Most people have heard of dementia and wandering. Wandering is a complicated concept, as it is a term that conjures up someone aimlessly walking around and potentially getting into trouble. The latter part is true, it is potentially dangerous, but it often happens for a reason.
Wandering is often a product of a person with dementia who is not able to express their needs or communicate desires in an appropriate manner. In some academic circles, the term is not accepted since it implies lack of purpose.
There are many reasons for wandering, one of which is having too much energy. A solution for that is regular exercise and activity. Loss of memory means that someone may set off to go somewhere, like the store, and forget where they wanted to go. Some people wander when placed in a new environment, such as a day centre or a nursing home, where things appear unfamiliar and they are searching for familiarity. Related to that type of wandering is someone who is searching for someone — or something — from their past, like a deceased loved one or a place that they recall fondly. Remember, long-term memories are more likely to be maintained in dementia. Searching for a parent or a sibling who has passed can occur.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations' human rights chief slammed the Security Council on Monday for failing to “defend human rights and prevent further loss of life” as the war in Syria that has killed nearly half a million people enters its eighth year.

“The Syrian conflict has been characterized by its absolute disregard for even the most minimal standards of principle and law,” said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein.
Saying that many who had sought to document human rights violations had been detained, tortured or killed, Zeid said: “The Security Council has not lived up to the sacrifice of these heroes throughout Syria. It has not taken decisive action to defend human rights and prevent further loss of life.”
The high commissioner for human rights spoke at an informal meeting at the United Nations shortly after their expected briefing to the Security Council was blocked when Russia requested a procedural vote.
The 15 members of the council attended the informal meeting.
Zeid was critical of the use of veto powers in the council to shield “perpetrators of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Syria and elsewhere” from justice.
Russia, the largest international backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has used its veto power nearly a dozen times on possible Security Council action on Syria since the country's civil war began in 2011.
“This failure to protect the lives and rights of millions of people is corroding not only the work but also the legitimacy of the U.N.,” said Zeid.
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump has insisted Iran has not acted in keeping with a deal to curb its nuclear program, days before they must decide on the future of the accord.
"They have not lived up to the spirit of the agreement," said Trump, as they huddled with military leaders ahead of perhaps the most consequential foreign policy decision of their young presidency.
"The Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence and chaos across the Middle East," Trump said in the Cabinet Room. "That is why we must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions" they said. "You will be hearing about Iran very shortly."
Gathered with military leaders and their spouses for a function after the meeting, Trump, stone-faced, said "this may be the calm before the storm," while refusing to go into detail.
Trump must tell Congress by October 15 whether they believe Iran is in compliance with the agreement.
They may well fly in the face of advice from some of their closest advisors, declaring Iran is not in compliance and leaving the pact's fate in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress.
Ahead of that deadline, several officials familiar with White House deliberations told AFP Trump has made it clear they do not want to certify Iran's compliance. But a formal decision has yet to be made.
"The president is going to make an announcement about the decision that he's made on a comprehensive strategy that their team supports, and we'll do that in the coming days," said Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
White House officials cautioned against reports that Trump would make a speech revealing their decision next Thursday. But the decision must come by an October 15 deadline.
Trump has often railed against the Obama-era deal, which offered Iran massive sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
They have repeatedly promised to rip it up, but has passed up an opportunity to end sanctions relief.
Every 90 days Trump must tell Congress whether Iran is living up to its end of the bargain, something that has already caused them political pain on two occasions.
The administration has made it clear that it wants Iran to stop ballistic missile tests and stop "nefarious" behavior across the Middle East, two issues that were not part of the agreement.
"They have not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and we'll be discussing that tonight" said Trump. "You will be hearing about Iran very shortly."
The build up to Trump's decision has been dominated by intense debate inside the White House and fierce lobbying in Congress.
Top military advisors Defense Secretary James Mattis and General Joseph Dunford, the chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff, have spoken out publicly in favor of the agreement.
European ambassadors and diplomats have been camped out on Capitol Hill, trying to argue against any punitive actions that invite Iran to decide the United States is in non-compliance.
Meanwhile, the deal's opponents, such as Senator Tom Cotton, have argued that Iran is not in compliance and sanctions and even military action should be considered.
Cotton met Trump at the White House on Thursday to make their case.
The Arkansas senator has argued that Iran is operating more advanced nuclear centrifuges than it is permitted, exceeding limits on heavy water stocks, continuing to illicitly procure nuclear and missile technology outside of approved channels and refusing to grant international inspectors access to nuclear-research and military facilities.
Bradford-Each year, over a million missing persons cases are reported in the US and UK, leaving families desperately searching for their loved ones.
In the hope of boosting this search, researchers have developed a new and more accurate method of ageing facial images.
They have tested their new software on an image of Ben Needham, who went missing when they were a toddler in 1991 on the Greek island of Kos.
The resulting images are vastly different to the computer generated images of Ben as an adult produced by current face-ageing current software.
This, they say, suggests that existing technology isn't up to the task. They hope their software can spark some new breakthroughs in existing missing persons cases.
They say they could use it to create more accurate images of what Madeleine McCann, who went missing 10 years ago in Portugal, will look like today.
The system was created by researchers at the University of Bradford.
Professor Hassan Ugail, who led the research, told MailOnline: ‘We see our software being used to find missing children by relevant agencies and authorities, including police forces around the world.'
The system maps out key features, such as the shape of the cheek, mouth and forehead, of a face at a certain age.
This information is fed to a computer algorithm which then creates new features for the face to produce photographic quality images of the face at different ages.
A key feature of the method is that it teaches the machine how humans age, by feeding the algorithm facial feature data from a large database of individuals at various ages.
This makes it more accurate than previous methods of facial ageing.
Professor Ugail told MailOnline: ‘Our method generates more individualized results and hence is more accurate for a given face. Professor Ugail added: ‘Each year around 300,000 missing person cases are recorded in the UK alone.
‘This has been part of our motivation in endeavouring to improve current techniques of searching for missing people, particularly those who have been missing for some considerable time.' To test the system, the researchers use a method called de-aging, in which they take a person's picture and run the algorithm backwards, in a Benjamin Button-like way. The result is then compared with an actual photograph of the individual taken at the young age.
As a test case, the researchers worked on the case of Ben Needham, who disappeared on the Greek island of Kos on 24th July 1991, when they were only 21 months old.
While Ben has never been found, several images have been produced by investigators showing how Ben might look like at ages 11-14 years, 17-20 years, and 20-22 years.
The team used their method to progress the image of Ben to the ages of six, 14 and 22 years.
The resulting images show very different results, which the researchers believe more closely resemble what Ben might look like today.
The results were evaluated using both machine and human methods, and in both, the images of Ben produced using this method were found to be more like the original picture of Ben than the images created as part of previous investigations.
Professor Ugail added: ‘No criticism is implied of existing age progression work.
‘Instead we are presenting our work as a development and improvement that could make a contribution to this important area of police work.
‘We are currently working with the relevant parties to further test our method. We are also developing further research plans in order to develop this method so it can be incorporated as a biometric feature, in face recognition systems, for example.'
The team now hopes to trial the system on more faces of missing people, and is eager to help in the search for Madeleine McCann.
Madeleine disappeared in May 2007 when they were just four years old, from their bed in a holiday apartment in the Algarve region of Portugal.
Professor Ugail told MailOnline: ‘Our algorithm is generic. We have not done any work on McCann's images, but we will be happy to do so if such an opportunity arises.'
Cricket - Sri Lanka v India - Second Test Match - Colombo, Sri Lanka - August 6, 2017 The helmets of India's cricket team are seen on the ground.
(Reuters) - India have omitted batsman Yuvraj Singh and rested their frontline bowling attack for the limited-overs leg of the Sri Lanka tour, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Sunday.
The selectors made seven changes to the squad and have overlooked Yuvraj after the 35-year-old managed just 109 runs in their last six one-day international innings.

The visitors will also be without spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja along with pacemen Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami, who have been a part of the ongoing test series in Sri Lanka.
Middle-order batsman Manish Pandey was included in the 15-man squad after recovering from an injury and scoring 307 runs for the A team in South Africa last month.
Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma, who has been named the vice-captain, returned to the squad after being rested for the series against West Indies. KL Rahul was included in the limited-overs side for the first time since February.
Virat Kohli-led India will play five ODIs and one Twenty20 in Sri Lanka starting Aug. 20.
Full squad: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma (vice-captain), KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wicket-keeper), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur.

Together again? Not so much.
Janet Jackson has shut down any rumours that they will be joining Justin Timberlake during this year's Super Bowl halftime show.
“To put to rest any speculation or rumours as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow; I will not,” Jackson said in a statement released Saturday. “Thank you for your support and I do look forward to seeing you all very soon.”
Timberlake is returning to the halftime show 14 years after a wardrobe malfunction with Jackson caused a national controversy. Timberlake was Jackson's special guest during their performance at that year's game and ripped off a piece of their clothing, revealing their nipple. Timberlake later described it as an unintended “wardrobe malfunction.”
CBS, which aired that Super Bowl, was fined $550,000 by the Federal Communications Commission, but the fine later was overturned.
The hashtags #JusticeforJanet and #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay became trending topics on Twitter days before Timberlake's record third trip to the stage at the Super Bowl, at which the Philadelphia Eagles will face the New England Patriots at the U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday.
At a press conference on Thursday, Timberlake mentioned Jackson's name, along with Jay-Z and ‘NSync, when talking about rumoured guests to join them onstage. They were not asked any direct questions about Jackson or the infamous wardrobe malfunction.
When the NFL announced late last year that Timberlake would be returning to the Super Bowl, the decision triggered a backlash from women, minorities and others who felt Jackson was unfairly forced to pay a far higher price than Timberlake faced. Some argued that Jackson, as a black woman, fell victim to a racist and sexist double standard and received harsher treatment than Timberlake, as a white man, did, and they said they benefited from “white male privilege.”
When asked during an interview last month if they and Jackson have since made peace, Timberlake said, “Absolutely.”
They said they and Jackson have talked privately about what happened.
“I don't know that a lot of people know that,” Timberlake said. “I mean, I don't think it's my job to do that, because you value the relationships that you do have with people.”

The Kansas City Royals have reinstated outfielder Alex Gordon and catcher Salvador Perez from the disabled list.
Perez sprained the medial collateral ligament in their left knee while carrying a suitcase up some stairs in their home in March.
Gordon went on the DL in early April with a torn hip labrum.
At 5-15, the Royals have one of the worst records in the majors and have already endured a nine-game losing streak.
Kansas City opens up a seven-game homestand that begins Tuesday night with two games against the Milwaukee Brewers and five against the Chicago White Sox, one of which is to make up for a postponed April 1 game.

ISLAMABAD - The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, on the penultimate day of the 14th National Assembly session, made a failed attempt to move a resolution for formation of a separate province (Southern Sindh).
The MQM-P, in the absence of lawmakers from other parties, initiated the move for a new province when their senior party member S Iqbal Qadri was chairing the house.
MQM MNA Ali Raza Abidi, at the fag end of the proceedings, requested the chair to allow them to move a resolution regarding Southern Sindh province. As many as 11 lawmakers including eight MQM-P lawmkers were present in the house when the resolution was moved. “I may be allowed to move the resolution for a new province by suspending the rules,” Abidi requested the chair, taking advantage of their party's majority in the house at the particular session.
The chair was seen interrupted by the National Assembly Secretariat staff not to allow the MQM-P member to move the resolution. “Where is your resolution? First, you (MQM-P member) will have to submit it to the secretariat and after examining the status the permission will be given,” said the chair. The MQM-P member suggested the chair to take the sense of the house and they might be allowed under the rules.
The chair, ostensibly having no solution to tackle the situation, immediately adjourned the proceedings of the House.
The MQM-P had earlier faced much criticism even to speak in favour of new provinces in the country, as their party members were, many times, interrupted on the particular issue.
The house on the second last day of the 14th National Assembly session saw lawmakers of almost all parties greeting each other.
The role of National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq during the five years was highly appreciated by all the political parties.
PPP-P's Aijaz Jhakrani, MQM-P's Saman Sultana Jeffery, Sahibzada Tariq Ullah, Jamaluddin Afghani and others also lauded the National Assembly speaker for smooth running of the house. MQM-P's Waseem Hussain said that there should be accountability of all including politicians. They said the speaker, during their tenure, carried out the entire legislative process in a well and coordinated manner.
The National Assembly speaker thanked all the lawmakers and also lauded the participation and performance of some prominent MNAs. A photo-session in which three parties' chief whips including Aijaz Jhakrani (PPP-P), Shireen Mazari (PTI) and Sheikh Aftab Ahmed (PML-N) stood together to award them (good performers) on the directions of the chair.
PTI's Arif Alvi, on their turn, proposed that there was a need to resolve the issue of ‘Durand Line' after a big step to merge the Fata with KP. They further said that load-shedding, water shortage and other related matters might be a big challenge for the caretaker setup.
MQM's Sheikh Salahuddin expressed strong reservation for not conducting a third-party audit of five percent blocks of the 6th Population Census by the government. “Should we contact the Supreme Court as the census was conducted on the direction of the apex court,” they said.
Capt (r) Muhammad Safdar said that the parliament would decide action against Lt-Gen (r) Asad Durrani over their co-authored controversial book. “Next parliament should summon them to ask questions about their book,” Safdar said mentioning that it was not enough to put their (Durrani's) name on the ECL. They also congratulated the house for mainstreaming Fata. They also suggested that the apex court should ask the chair before summoning any parliamentarian.
MQM-P's Kishwar Zehra said that the lawmakers had failed to deliver in the parliament. “Voters send us (MNAs) to perform but we could not properly deliver,” Zehra admitted.
The house observed one-minute silence over the killing of social activist and trader Charanjeet Singh in Peshawar.
The house also passed The Service Tribunals (Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Sheikh Aftab Ahmed.
The Los Angeles Chargers took their first big step into the future Sunday, hosting their first home NFL game at the StubHub Center in Carson.
And while the resulting 48-17 shellacking the team endured wasn't fun for many, it did provide some insight into some key aspects of what may or may not make the Bolts successful in 2017.
Here is a look at three takeaways from the Chargers' battle against the Seahawks Sunday night.
No. 1: Chargers' backup QB battle nowhere near over
Many sung the praises of general manager Tom Telesco for bringing in the talented backup quarterback Cardale Jones this offseason.
However, and unfortunately for fans, Jones appears to have also brought their accuracy issues with them from Buffalo as well. Jones completed just 22 percent of their passes (2-of-9), often times missing without a good reason.
Meanwhile, long-time Chargers backup quarterback Kellen Clemens saw the ball fumbled on an exchange between them and running back Andre Williams and threw two interceptions as well. While each INT was tipped, one of the two was simply a poor decision.
Finally, last year's practice squad quarterback Mike Bercovici continued to scrap, completing 4-of-6 passing while posting a passer rating (104.9) at least 30 points higher than Clemens, and 50 points higher than Jones.
After Kate Middleton and Prince William officially welcomed their third child on Monday, Kensington Palace released a statement on behalf of their family members. However, there was one name noticeably absent — Meghan Markle. So why was Meghan Markle missing from the royal baby announcement? Some might think there's shade being thrown their way, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
The statement in question read:
The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news.
According to British and european royalty expert, Marlene Koenig, who spoke with Harper's Bazaar, "Meghan is not a member of the royal family yet, so they are not a relative at this time. Meghan is Harry's fiancée, but is not yet Auntie Meghan." Koenig continued, "If the baby had been born after the wedding, Meghan would certainly have been included. It is not a snub."
Seeing as how the British Royal Family is usually a stickler for rules and tradition, this reason makes a lot of sense. Markle technically isn't family, yet, so apparently that is where the line is drawn in this case. Although, them not being officially part of the family didn't stop Prince Harry from bringing Markle to Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas celebration. According to People, the former Suits star was "the first royal fiancée to spend Christmas day with the royal family".
Yes, Markle has been known to challenge the royal status quo every now and again, but they probably couldn't do anything about their name not being mentioned in this particular statement. And, again, it's not really that big of a deal. Plus, according to HollywoodLife.com, she's already met the young prince, who still remains nameless — at least publicly. That's so much better than being included in the family's statement.
A "palace source" told the outlet Monday, "Harry and Meghan stopped by William and Kate's apartment very briefly today, just so they could meet the new [addition] and Meghan couldn't stop smiling. They absolutely love children, and much like Harry's mom, Princess Diana, she's a natural with them — kids just gravitate towards her."
This "palace source" also told HollywoodLife.com that Markle can't wait to have kids and now has "baby fever" thanks to meeting royal baby #3.

During the birth of Middleton and William's third child, Markle and Harry were busy attending an important event. It's probably safe to say the 36-year-old soon-to-be royal's mind was most likely elsewhere and not on why they aren't included in the announcement.
Harry and Markle attended Stephen Lawrence's memorial service at St. Martin-in-the-Fields church for the anniversary of Lawrence's murder. On April 22, 1993, Lawrence, a young black man, was killed at 18 years old. Their murder was considered a "racially charged shooting", according to People.
The prince spoke on behalf of Prince Charles at the memorial service and delivered the following message:
"I remember vividly the profound shock that I felt at [Stephen's] senseless murder, a feeling shared by so many people across this country and beyond. I remember, too, just how deeply moved I was by the determination of their family to build something positive from the tragedy they endured and to ensure that Stephen's story did not end with despair, but continued with hope."

Something as small as Markle's name not being mentioned in a simple statement isn't something to dwell over, especially when a baby was just born and Harry and Markle's wedding is less than a month away. They all have a lot going on right now and it's all much more important.

With temperatures set to drop further, the NHS in North Cumbria and the North East is encouraging all those at risk of falls to take extra care.
Around one in three adults over 65 who live at home will have at least one fall a year and about half of these will have more frequent falls.
As temperatures plummet, health bosses expect an increasing number of people to be affected and require urgent care.
The winter months bring additional challenges with wet, cold weather, falling leaves, ice and snow.
Falls are one of the main causes of older people attending accident and emergency departments and this can sometimes lead to lengthy hospital stays.
A report published in autumn 2017, commissioned by the Academic Health Science Network for the North East and North Cumbria, revealed that in 2014/15 there were 12,654 emergency admissions for falls in the North East and North Cumbria, costing an estimated £84,973,249 to the region's NHS.
NHS England's Medical Director for Cumbria and the North East, Professor Chris Gray, said: “When the weather is really bad, the advice is to think carefully about going out in the first place.
“These messages are really important as our A&E departments are under significant pressure.”

Taylor Leier, Pat Cannone, Charles Hudon, Jakub Markstrom, Brandon Pirri, Ryan Hamilton. What do these men have in common? They're all fringe players who've achieved limited (to no) success in the NHL? Mostly correct, but the answer I was attempting to extract is that they're the most recent recipients of the AHL All-Star Game/Challenge MVP award. The latest player to achieve this quasi-esteemed accolade is Rochester Americans Forward, C.J. Smith.
On Monday, the 23-year-old tallied three goals and two assists over the course of four games to lift their North Division to the All-Star Challenge crown. Smith's offensive aptitude culminated in them scoring the lone goal of the Championship game to down the Pacific Division, 1-0. Despite not being among the legendary company of yesteryear to secure the trophy, there is reason for Buffalo Sabres fans to be enthused about the youngster.
The North leads 1-0 with less than three minutes to go! #AHLAllStar pic.twitter.com/1XvEXrMjZs — AHL (@TheAHL) January 30, 2018
An Unconventional Path
Smith comes from the hockey breeding grounds of Des Moines, Iowa. Said grounds have bred a whopping total of two players to have played in the NHL – goaltender Scott Clemmensen, and the asupervisorstioned Smith. The former enjoyed a relatively successful 14-year career traversing between parent and farm clubs. The latter, Smith, honed their craft at UMass-Lowell for three years prior to being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Sabres in late March 2017.
The 5-foot-11, 185-pound left winger got their first taste of big league action for the Sabres shortly after signing with the club. For Smith, the crescendo of this experience was notching their first NHL point, an assist, in their debut against the New York Islanders in April. Much to the chagrin of some Sabres fans, Smith was unable to crack the team's roster out of training camp this season, and has subsequently been a key cog in the Amerks lineup since October.
Talented and Consistent
For those who have had the pleasure of watching Smith this season, it is quite evident that the AHL rookie is blessed a nice array of tools in their toolkit. Despite being very pedestrian in stature, Smith makes up for it with high-level speed and quickness that allow for them to create space. Their pro level shot and quick release have allowed them to frequently initiate the red light on every level he's played on. Their hockey IQ and defensive presence are also ever evolving.
Smith has been a model of consistency everywhere he's played. They were over a point-per-game performer during their three-year tenure at UMass-Lowell. As of this writing, Smith ranks as the 13th leading scorer in the AHL and is third among rookies with 39 points in 46 games. Most importantly, the youngster has proven to live up to their defensively responsible moniker with an impressive plus-minus of plus-eight. This type of production has helped Rochester enjoy a highly successful season to date, sitting seven points back of the Toronto Marlies for the Eastern Conference lead.
Growing Praise
The speedy winger is quite revered by their teammates. Former Amerks forward Nick Baptiste might be Smith's biggest proponent. “He's a skill guy. They make plays,” Baptiste said. “He's a guy that's dangerous around the net. He's got great, great hockey sense and great vision. He's a great player who's going to be a great player for a long time.”
Their teammates are not the only ones that are acknowledging the ascent of Smith. Sabres head coach Phil Housley took notice of the AHL All-Star MVP's performance last week. “I think they deserved to be there, No. 1, great for them to get the MVP; No. 2, he's earned it,” Housley said. “It's a great confidence booster for him. It's about representing your team in Rochester and representing the Buffalo Sabres organization and I tip my hat to them to win the MVP and win the tournament.” This type of notoriety can only bode well for Smith's future prospects.
NHL Spot is Imminent
Smith is in a desirable position of not having a daunting task to secure a top-nine slot on the Sabres in an imminent manner. The worst kept secret in hockey is that polarizing winger Evander Kane will be dealt in the coming weeks. That leaves Scott Wilson and Zemgus Girgensons as Smith's remaining competition at left wing on the existing roster. The right side does not exactly ooze quality, either, with the likes of utterly disappointing Sam Reinhart, overpaid Kyle Okposo and aging Jason Pominville holding down the fragile fort.
As for the future, Smith currently ranks as No. 8 on Dobber Prospects Top 10 Buffalo Sabres Prospect List. In case you've been hiding under a rock or partaking in copious amounts of Netflix marathons, you know that Casey Mittelstadt has been a revelation and will likely be a top-six forward on the team as soon as next season. Alexander Nylander, Cliff Pu and Rasmus Asplund all appear multiple years away from cracking the Sabres roster. This leaves the 23-year-old Smith in a pole position to take the bull by the horns and do what they do on the next level – produce.

Liverpool have arrived at Melwood to train in their final preparations before tonight's Champions League semi-final first leg vs Roma.
Jurgen Klopp will hope to mastermind the Reds' passage to Kiev against the Giallorossi by maximising their home advantage at Anfield.
A whirlwind first half performance saw Manchester City ship three goals in the first leg of the quarter-final and a similar display will be the aim tonight.
Especially due to Roma's home record in the Champions League this term, where they are yet to concede a goal. That despite facing Chelsea, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona on their unlikely run.

Klopp has admitted the Reds' performance vs West Brom last weekend was "not good enough," as the Baggies pegged back a two-goal deficit to draw 2-2 with late goals from Jake Livermore and Salomon Rondon.
“We will show them what is important about Rome.
"They play Saturday and Sunday will be a meeting about that," Klopp said.
“Then it is recovery and a little bit of preparation for that. It is not that much time but I am sure the boys will be ready. I don't have to tell them that was not good enough, we can do better. I think the boys deserved more. But it is 2-2 – there are bigger catastrophes in life.

“I think now let's go, prepare for Rome. It is Rome and it will be a completely different game. They have set-pieces as well but they don't play only set-pieces. Their boys play sometimes on the ground and then you can play football.”

ATTORNEY GENERAL STEVE MARSHALL LEADS 14-STATE AMICUS BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF RIGHT OF CITY OF PENSACOLA TO MAINTAIN HISTORIC CROSS IN PUBLIC PARK
MONTGOMERY – Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall led a coalition of 14 state attorneys general in filing a friend of the court brief supporting the City of Pensacola, Florida's, right to keep a historic cross on display in a public park.
Attorney General Marshall filed an amicus brief Tuesday with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals supporting the City of Pensacola's appeal of a June 19, 2017, lower federal court ruling ordering the city to remove a Latin cross from Bayview Park.
“The large cross in Pensacola's Bayview Park is a local landmark dating back more than seven decades,” said Attorney General Marshall. “The cross is woven into the fabric of Pensacola's history and its presence in a public park does not violate the First Amendment's prohibition of the establishment of religion, as opponents have claimed. To continue down the road of the lower court's reasoning would open the door to challenges of religious symbols on thousands of monuments and memorials on public property across the country.”
Attorney General Marshall's brief in the case Amanda Kondrat'yev v. City of Pensacola, Florida, asserts that the lower federal court ruling against the display of the cross ignores legal precedent protecting the display of historical monuments, including religious symbols, on public property.
“States, counties, and municipalities have historically included, or allowed private parties to include, religious texts and symbols on monuments and other displays on public property. The amici States have an interest in maintaining that practice, consistent with a proper understanding of the Establishment Clause,” the brief stated.
Alabama was joined by Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah in filing the brief.

If you look at whats happened in West Virginia and so many different places, were sending clean coal. Were sending it out to different places - China. A lot of coal ordered in China right now. So a lot of things are changing, and theyre changing very rapidly.- President Trump, remarks during Taxpayer Family Event, Dec. 5, 2017
---
On Dec. 5, several families gathered at the White House to discuss how the GOP tax plan would benefit the middle class. One of the speakers, North Dakota state Sen. Jessica Unruh, discussed how the corporate-tax reduction would benefit their coal mining company. Unruh praised the tax plan, including a provision that reduces the tax credit for renewable wind energy, saying it would allow them to invest more money in domestic energy production.
I think regulatory reform, coupled with tax reform, is exactly what we need to help make America great again, they said. (Continued below)

Weve done that, responded Trump, before detailing the ways that coal is purportedly making a comeback in West Virginia. Regular readers of The Fact Checker may recall that we gave them Four Pinocchios for claiming that they turned West Virginia around by cutting regulations on mining. This time, they pegged the states economic growth to increased exports of clean coal to China.
Theres a lot to unpack here. For one, are coal exports up? What makes the coal clean? And most important, Trump claims things are changing in states such as West Virginia, suggesting that those changes are a result of their administrations policies, but is that the case? Lets take a look.
The Facts
From 2013 to 2016, coal exports steadily declined as a result of slow growth in global demand for coal combined with increased competition among the worlds major coal suppliers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2012, coal exports peaked at 125.7 million short tons. By 2016, coal exports had declined to 60.3 million short tons - less than half the volume of the 2012 high.
But in 2017, coal exports soared. In the first quarter of 2017, coal exports were 58 percent higher than in the same quarter of 2016, according to preliminary data from the EIA. The exports are expected to slow as the year progresses, but the EIAs 2017 forecast of 72 million short tons is 19 percent higher than 2016 levels.
Where is all the coal going? Europe is the largest importer of U.S. coal, but demand for U.S. coal in 2017 has surged in China as well. From April to June in 2016, China imported a mere 1,107 short tons of coal. During the same period in 2017, China imported more than 1 million short tons of U.S. coal.
Trumps claim that there is a lot of coal being ordered by China checks out, but it also raises three questions: Is the coal clean, is the newfound demand a result of the Trump administrations policies, and is the coal coming from West Virginia?
The short answer to all three questions is: not at all, no, and nope.
The United States exports both thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity, and metallurgical coal, which is used to produce steel. And over the past year, U.S. exports of both types of coal have increased. But China primarily imports metallurgical coal from the United States. In 2017, more than 920,000 of the million short tons imported were metallurgical coal.
The distinction matters. The term clean coal refers to coal used for energy production. But the term is a confusion of concepts. When coal is burned to generate electricity, it releases a slew of noxious chemicals into the air, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury and other heavy metals. The clean part of the coal refers to electricity-generating plants that scrub sulfur dioxide from smokestacks and bury carbon dioxide emissions underground.
The term was first popularized by the coal industry in 2008, after the Environmental Protection Agency asserted that carbon emissions were subject to regulations under the Clean Air Act. The coal burned is not cleaner, but the plant uses technology to reduce the effects of burning the fossil fuel. Yet Trump has made a habit of calling coal clean. Weve called them out on the term in a previous column, but the correction didnt seem to stick.
Metallurgical coal, in contrast, is not combusted. Instead it is carbonized and turned into coke, which is used to manufacture steel. In the process, most of the carbon is maintained in the coking coal. So Trumps claim that the United States is exporting more clean coal to China doesnt make sense.
Still, it is clear from the data that coal exports to China are on the rise. In China, domestic production of coal has declined just as demand for the resource has increased, according to a report on the commodity from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Investments in property and infrastructure have underpinned the demand for steel products within China. As a result, the price of coal, and coking coal in particular, has sharply increased.
Thermal coal prices have risen by 111 percent since 2016, and coking coal prices have risen by more than 200 percent over a comparable time frame, according to the bank. The sharp rise in prices makes it cheaper to import coal from the United States.
In addition, as China works to reduce pollution, its government has moved to shut down inefficient, unsafe and polluting mining facilities, reducing coal production capacity by around 1 billion tonnes over the next 3-5 years.
Its unlikely that West Virginia will be making up for Chinas reduced coal production. According to the EIA, 75 percent of West Virginias coal is shipped to other states for use. The remaining quarter goes overseas.
In 2014, the value of coal exports to China from West Virginia ranked 13th out of the top 15 in the state, according to the Bureau of Business and Economic Research in West Virginia. And in 2015 and 2016, the bureau reported essentially no coal exports to China, causing a 90 percent contraction in exports from the state. (A report on the states economic outlook by West Virginia University said the increase in coal production in the state was due to a surge in demand for metallurgical coal from the Asia-Pacific region as well as a temporary boost in demand from Australia after Cyclone Debbie damaged the countrys rail infrastructure, but it did not specify China.)
The bureau estimates that the state will continue to see a modest decline in its overall share of U.S. coal exports as new construction along the Gulf Coast and in the state of Washington support the expansion of coal shipments to Asia and Europe from the Powder River basin in Montana and Wyoming and the Illinois basin in Illinois.
The White House did not respond to our request for comment.
The Pinocchio Test
Lets break down the presidents comment to its core elements.
If you look at whats happened in West Virginia and so many different places, were sending clean coal. Were sending it out to different places - China.
Trump claims West Virginia is exporting clean coal to China. But this is wrong for two reasons. One, in 2015 and 2016, West Virginia exported virtually no coal to China. Two, there is no such thing as clean coal. Electricity-generating plants can mitigate some of the effects of burning coal by capturing carbon dioxide and burying it underground, but that doesnt make the coal itself cleaner. And more important, the bulk of the exports of coal to China involve metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel, not generate electricity.
So a lot of things are changing, and theyre changing very rapidly.
Trump claims things are changing in West Virginia thanks to their administrations policies. But again Trump is trying to take credit for things outside their control. Market forces and external factors, such as China imposing regulations on mining its domestic coal supply coupled with an increased demand for coking coal, have contributed to a price surge, making it cheaper to import coal from the United States.
Still, Trumps claim is based on some factual information, namely that coal exports to China have increased in 2017. But their claims of coal cleanliness, their taking of credit and their suggestion that things are changing in West Virginia just dont hold up. We award Trump Three Pinocchios.

Police said that two separate complaints were lodged by Fatima Shaikh and Escolastica Naik. Shaikh was reportedly cheated to the tune of Rs 15.19 lakh, while Naik reportedly lost around Rs 10.02 lakh in the fraud. Referring to the cases, the police said that the unknown accused person cheated the complainants by personation using computer resource and made them deposit the amount in different bank accounts on the pretext of sending gifts. However, the victims did not receive the gifts even after depositing the money, said police.
In connection with the cases, the cyber crime police has registered two separate FIRs against unknown persons under Section 66D of IT Act (cheating by personation by using computer resource) and under the IPC Sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).
Barrie boasts one of Ontario's most beautiful waterfronts, but the scenic trails aren't enough to keep residents happy and they are looking to the three major party leaders for solutions for some of the community's biggest problems.
Voters will be going to the polls in more than a week to decide who will form the next Ontario government.
Global News has visited different communities throughout the election campaign and anchor Farah Nasser went to Barrie to speak with residents about what issues are most important to them.
RIDING RANT: What are the important election issues for Barrie residents
Barrie's population is 145,614, according to numbers from Statistics Canada and over the last decade the riding has flip-flopped in political representation.
In 2007, Ontario Liberal Party candidate Aileen Carroll was elected as MPP for the Barrie riding but in 2011, the Progressive Conservatives turned Barrie blue, electing candidate Rod Jackson.
ONTARIO ELECTION: Barrie—Innisfil riding
Jackson ran in 2014 Ontario election, but lost to Liberal candidate Ann Hoggarth.
In 2018, the boundary redraw will see two ridings in Barrie: Barrie – Springwater – Oro-Medonte and Barrie Innisfil.
Skyrocketing hydro rates
Hydro has been an election hot topic with each of the major party leaders describing plans on how they will best tackle the growing rates.
Barrie resident Marlene Miller said during the winter months, their bills continued to grow to an alarming amount.
“(It was) $999 for two months,” they said.
“It's pretty tough when you're a widow and living on a fixed income.”
ONTARIO ELECTION: Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte riding
Miller said they have tried to lower electricity bills by installing new windows and adding insulating to their home.
“I close all the doors to the rooms I don't use… I keep the temperature as low as I can, but I spend most of the time in the family room where there is gas fireplace,” they said.
The Liberals have made attempts at lowering hydro bills by cutting rates by 25 per cent last year and since that time, Miller said their rates have decreased by $300.
WATCH: Barrie-area residents stressed over increasing hydro rates
Ontario PC Party Leader Doug Ford has also promised further savings for Ontarians, saying they will “return all Hydro One dividend to hydro customers — saving the average family 4.7 per cent on their hydro bills.”
While Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath has promised to cut hydro bills by 30 per cent and bring Hydro One back in public hands.
High unemployment rates
Over the last several months, Barrie's unemployment rate has climbed to 8.8 per cent, making it the highest unemployment rate in Canada, according to Statistics Canada.
Barrie resident Christine Larson is an example of the statistic and said they have been looking for work since February.
 They are currently looking for a job in administration, but said they have had a difficult time.
WATCH: Why does Barrie have the highest unemployment rate in Canada?
“I'm applying for four or five jobs a day and not getting a response,” Larson said.
“I am definitely paying for everything everyone else is paying — I have a car, I have rent, I have utilities I have to pay for.”
Darryll Simpson, operations manager at ESS Direct in Barrie, said they believe the spike in unemployment rates are result of the newly introduce Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, which increased minimum wage to $14 per hour starting on Jan. 1.
ONTARIO ELECTION: How, when and where to vote
“Bill 148 changed the landscape for people looking for part-time work,” Simpson said.
“Those are, unfortunately, the people most affected.”

PanARMENIAN.Net - Kristofer Hivju, “Game of Thrones'” Wildlings leader Tormund Giantsbane, looks set for one of the most challenging roles of their career in eight-hour drama-thriller “Twin” – where they play a man who takes over their identical twin's very different life and character, Variety said.
Backed by Scandinavian major Nordisk Film Production, “Twin” will be presented for the first time in public at Series Mania's April 18 Co-production Forum by producer Sigurd Mikal Karoliussen, NFP head of TV drama Tomas Radoor and screenwriter-director Kristoffer Metcalfe.
A Hivju passion project which they created with Metcalfe, with the duo developing the project over near 15 years, “Twin” kicks off in the Lofoten Islands where cliffs fall near sheer 4,000 feet to fjords. A very cold-water surfing mecca north of the Arctic Circle, it is home to Erik, a surfer bum who hasn't seen their identical twin Adam – a business person with a successful family business, doting wife, picture-perfect family – for 15 years. When Eric loses everything, they reach out to Adam, who totally rejects him. A quarrel breaks out; Erik and Ingrid, Adam's wife, accidentally kill Adam. To cover the crime, and to save their brother's family, Erik takes over Adam's identity.
Hivju, who won a Swedish Guldbagge for their performance in Ruben Ostlund's “Force Majeure,” plays a villain in the eighth “Fast & Furious” installment “The Fate of the Furious,” now in cinemas.
“Twin” will play off the contrast between the spectacular Lofoten, an alternative world where surfers come from all over the world to indulge a passion, and Adam's family environment, part of a more traditional Scandinavian life into which the hapless hero is drawn, where people are linked by family circumstance and responsibilities, Metcalfe said.
In line with much contemporary drama, the show mixes a trinity of a thriller narrative, character-driven drama and broader social themes. The question of whether Erik and Ingrid's subterfuge is discovered drives “Twin's” suspense, as an old friend of Adam's, a traffic police officer, becomes increasingly suspicious of Erik.
The six-hour drama also offers a character study of how a man who has carved out their identity as a freewheeling spirt can both warm to and chafe at family responsibilities. Impersonating Adam, Erik comes to understand far better their brother and the sacrifices they have made than they ever did when they were alive, Metcalfe said.
For both Erik and Ingrid, the new situation also offers a second chance in life, they added.
But, according to Metcalfe, the dramatic irony of the series is that the main characters are forced to live a constant lie; because of that, they can never achieve fully what they are trying to do, and the series asks: Who are we really? And for whom?
The question of identity also plays out over a larger canvas. “Twin” asks what it means to be a father and responsible parent at a time when globalization is opening up options and a debate on the subject,” Metcalfe argued, adding that, as tourism has replaced fishing as Lofoten's most important source of income, the genuine, traditional world which Adam and Ingrid have prompted is in reality also just a facade.
Shot in Norwegian, and to be directed by Metcalfe, “Twin” is produced by Moskus Film, a production shingle which Karoliussen set up in 2012 with Jan Erik Langoen. Its biggest hit to date has been “Journey to the Christmas Star,” which sold to 116 countries. Norwegian broadcaster NRK ,the Nordic Film Institute and Film Fond Nord also back the series.

The propulsion shop personnel, including two members not shown, wanted to create a feeling of Esprit de Corps and a reminder of just how amazing it is to work on such a complex and important military machine. The General Electric F110-GE-100 turbofan, prepped and ready for testing, produces close to 29,000 pounds of static thrust in afterburner, which can propel the Fighting Falcon to approximately twice the speed of sound.
