When Carson Wentz faltered down the stretch last season, his surrounding talent took the brunt of the blame.
The Eagles' anemic wide receiver corps, specifically, was singled out as one of the league's least productive units.
Eight months later, the once-beleaguered receivers have seemingly transformed from the team's Achilles' heel to one of the deepest positions on the roster.
Look no further than the slot, where a previously drop-prone Nelson Agholor has excelled since camp opened. The 2015 first-round pick has been so impressive in separating from coverage that observers have been left to wonder how Jordan Matthews' role will play out this season.
Matthews remains the starter on the team's initial camp depth chart even as offensive coordinator Frank Reich acknowledges that the plan will be different than last year's.
Although coach Doug Pederson told reporters Tuesday that he doesn't foresee a reduced role for Matthews, at least one beat writer believes the Eagles have "already sold themselves" on Agholor as the No. 1 slot receiver. That sentiment comes days after NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah visited Eagles camp and ascertained that Agholor is destined for slot duties.
Philadelphia's brass insists Matthews is going nowhere, citing his chemistry with Wentz and historically productive first three NFL seasons.
Whether it's Matthews or Agholor in the slot, the primary takeaway from the first two weeks of camp is the increased talent level at the position. More than just competition for Matthews, the improved Agholor will also push Torrey Smith for snaps on the outside and provide insurance in the event of an Alshon Jeffery injury.
"Right now, the whole receiver room is more competitive," Reich added. "So yeah, I think it is a little bit different than last year."
Here's what else we learned on Tuesday:
Good luck stopping Tom Brady's loaded offensive attack this season. Since earning MVP honors in Super Bowl LI, Brady has welcomed back the most unstoppable tight end in history and wasted no time in establishing a rapport with speedy wideout Brandin Cooks and touchdown threat Dwayne Allen.
Returning from back surgery, Rob Gronkowski obliterated Jacksonville's defense for a staggering six touchdowns in Tuesday's scrimmage. As banged up as Gronkowski has been throughout his career, he has returned stronger every time.
Already hyped as Brady's best deep threat since Randy Moss, Cooks has been a one-man highlight reel since camp opened. Stepping in as Martellus Bennett's replacement alongside Gronkowski, Allen has already earned Brady's trust with "a ton of targets" in the red zone.
It's not simply the talent infusion that will keep opposing defensive coordinators up at night. The Patriots' depth, versatility and creative play-calling will enable Brady to keep defenses guessing by switching alignments and personnel depending on matchups and game situation.
Preseason Week 1 status
1. Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis missed Tuesday's practice with a Baker's Cyst in his knee, per NFL Network's Stacey Dales. The team released a statement noting the health issue is "minor," perhaps allowing Lewis to return within a matter of days. Special teams coordinator Darrin Simmons will lead the team in the meantime.
2. Coach Ron Rivera confirmed Tuesday that Cam Newton will not play in the preseason opener versus the Houston Texans, which will air at 7:30 p.m. ET on NFL Network. On a positive note, though, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that it appears Newton has "gotten over the hump" after missing the past week of practices following offseason shoulder surgery.
3. After telling reporters Monday that Jamaal Charles would play in the preseason opener, Denver coach Vance Joseph backpedaled on Tuesday. The plan now is for Charles to sit out Thursday's game versus Chicago, per The Denver Post. Bronco fans and fantasy drafters are understandably eager to see Charles in action after the four-time Pro Bowler missed the majority of the past two seasons with lingering knee issues.
4. Kirk Cousins will be without three of his top four targets for Thursday's game versus the Ravens. Coach Jay Gruden has ruled out tight end Jordan Reed (toe) and wide receivers Josh Doctson (hamstring), Jamison Crowder (hamstring) for preseason opener. All three of the core offensive players are viewed as "day to day."
5. Jaylon Smith "absolutely" will play in the preseason, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett insists. That said, it has yet to be determined if Smith will make his NFL preseason debut Saturday night against the Rams. Although Smith has exceeded expectations early in camp, Garrett will continue to handle the second-year linebacker with kid gloves.
"I think Jaylon's going to be around here the next 10 years," Garrett explained, via the Dallas Morning News. "We don't want to do anything that's not taking care of Jaylon."
6. One player who certainly won't be making his debut with a new team is Branden Albert, who informed the Jaguars of his intention to return to the field after last week's abrupt retirement. Placing the veteran left tackle on the reserve/retired list, executive vice president Tom Coughlin made it clear that the team has no plans to welcome Albert back with open arms. As is often the case in sports (and life), this situation boils down to money -- specifically the signing bonus Albert would owe the organization if he remained retired.
Depth chart drama
NFL teams have begun to release their first unofficial depth charts of training camp, which naturally leads to a few raised eyebrows around the league. While the listed pecking order often functions as a snapshot of the coaching staff's current viewpoint on the state of the roster, it's important to keep this exercise in perspective. It's an obligation that many head coaches brush off as a borderline afterthought:
Dirk Koetter, on what to read from Bucs' first depth chart: "I spent about 19 seconds working on that." ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Greg Auman (@gregauman) August 8, 2017
1. For all of the lip service paid to the Jets' quarterback "competition," Christian Hackenberg has seen precious few practice reps with the first-team offense. It's interesting to note that Hackenberg is listed third on the depth chart, behind not only presumed starter Josh McCown but also Bryce Petty.
2. Rookie Joe Mixon is fourth on the Bengals' depth chart at running back, behind Jeremy Hill, Giovani Bernard and even special teamer Cedric Peerman. Although Mixon will have to earn his share of the workload over the next few weeks, he's fully expected to be in the mix for carries as early as Week 1 of the regular season.
3. Handed $750,000 in guarantees on a $2.468 million contract, veteran Sean Spence is surprisingly listed as the fourth-team "WILL" linebacker on the Colts' depth chart. Beat writers have noted that Spence has begun fading from the picture at inside linebacker in recent practices.
4. Former Bills coach Rex Ryan recently raved about linebacker Reggie Ragland as perhaps "the best player we had on our entire football team" prior to last summer's ACL tear. It's fair to wonder about Ragland's fit in new coach Sean McDermott's system, as the former Alabama star has been relegated to second- and now third-team work since camp opened. Might Ragland be a preseason trade candidate?
5. Down a running back with converted quarterback B.J. Daniels nursing an undisclosed injury, the Falcons signed Kevin Taylor, son of Jaguars legend Fred Taylor. The younger Taylor is a long shot to make Atlanta's 53-man roster.
Where does a politician, or a political party, draw the line in the willingness to sacrifice principles for a few bucks? When we talk about the need to "change" the political environment and the culture of money and politics, isn't there some place where you can say, "right here, this is the perfect example and we aren't going to let this go on anymore"? I would argue that the place to draw the line is the relationship between the Democratic Party and Wal-Mart. And the time to draw the line is now.
I outline the facts in a moment. But, the premise for the need to draw the line now is this: There may be no corporation in American today that has been a more persistent, regular violator of the law than Wal-Mart. There may be no corporation in America that has been as virulently anti-union as Wal-Mart, firing workers repeatedly for trying to organize. There may be no corporation in America that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of Americans more than Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart has at least 80 class-action lawsuits in 41 states pending against it.
Wal-Mart illegally denied full rest or meal breaks in violation of state wage and hour laws--a violation that may cost the company $2 billion.
Wal-Mart abuses women, and is the defendant in the biggest sex discrimination case in history.
Wal-Mart is a habitual tax-dodger.
Wal-Mart's heirs buy expensive paintings but won't give their workers decent health care.
Wal-Mart sued a disabled woman, demanding she give back money she won in a settlement.
Wal-Mart exploits children in Mexico.
Wal-Mart lead a global corporate lobbying campaign to block a very modest improvement in Chinese labor laws--because Wal-Mart's business model depends on exploiting cheap labor, here and abroad.
And that's just a sample. Why would any political leader, who represents him or herself to be a defender of the working person, want to be affiliated with such a company?
The answer is clear: money. The Democratic Party is almost even with the Republican Party in the money it receives from Wal-Mart, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Center's data, published in an article in today's Wall Street Journal (I'll come back to that article in a moment), shows that 12 years ago, Wal-Mart's PAC gave 98 percent of its money to Republicans. In the current cycle, Democrats have received 48 percent of Wal-Mart's PAC expenditures.

Unfortunately, this is nothing new. In November 2005, I asked why Democrats were doing Wal-Mart's bidding, including helping block an important piece of labor legislation. Two years later, as the 2006 election drew near, Wal-Mart put on a big push to woo Democratic lawmakers, in particular, African-American and Hispanic representatives.
In one sense, this was inevitable in the culture of Washington politics: money flows to power. And, since 2006, Democrats are an equal power in the political power landscape.
Here is why the line must be drawn now and why this trend is particularly worrisome. The Wall Street Journal article reveals the background in a piece about Wal-Mart's internal political drive to organize its managers to vote Republican in the coming election as a strategy to defeat the Employee Free Choice Act, the single-most important legislative priority for organized labor:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if Democrats win power in November, they'll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies -- including Wal-Mart. In recent weeks, thousands of Wal-Mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized.
And...
"The meeting leader said, 'I am not telling you how to vote, but if the Democrats win, this bill will pass and you won't have a vote on whether you want a union,'" said a Wal-Mart customer-service supervisor from Missouri. "I am not a stupid person. They were telling me how to vote," she said.
And...
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has made defeat of the legislation a top priority. In the past six months, it has flown state and local Chamber members to Washington to lobby members of Congress. On Thursday, the Chamber began airing a television ad in Minnesota and plans to run ads in other states as part of a broader campaign. The bill was crafted by labor as a response to more aggressive opposition by companies to union-organizing activity. The AFL-CIO and individual unions such as the United Food and Commercial Workers have promised to make passage of the new labor law their No. 1 mission after the November election. First introduced in 2003, the bill came to a vote last year and sailed through the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, but was blocked by a filibuster in the Senate and faced a veto threat by the White House. The bill was taken off the floor, and its backers pledged to reintroduce it when they could get more support. The November election could bring that extra support in Congress, as well as the White House if Sen. Obama is elected and Democrats extend their control in the Senate. Sen. Obama co-sponsored the legislation, which also is known as "card check," and has said several times he would sign it into law if elected president. Sen. John McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee, opposes the Employee Free Choice Act and voted against it last year.
Putting aside the important point about whether Wal-Mart's internal political electioneering is illegal under federal election law, the far bigger issue is that Wal-Mart is making it quite clear that it will spare no effort to defeat EFCA. Wal-Mart and the business community believe that the passage of EFCA will allow millions of workers who want to be in a union to be able to exercise their rights without intimidation and fear of losing their jobs.
To cut to the chase, Wal-Mart's PAC spending is aimed at one thing: to make sure EFCA does not pass and, if it does pass, to make sure that the bill that reaches the president's desk will be weakened (which, by the way, is what happened to labor law reform in the 1970s). Let's look at the possible scenarios, assuming Barack Obama is president in 2009:
1. A 2008 election brings Democrats a large majority in the House and even 60 seats in the Senate. EFCA comes to the House floor and passes largely intact. EFCA arrives to the Senate and, lo and behold, one or more Democratic Senators block the bill, not to kill it but to exact changes that gut the effectiveness of EFCA.
2. A 2008 election brings Democrats a large majority in the House and even 60 seats in the Senate. EFCA comes to the House floor and a large number of Democrats from the list above introduce a series of amendments that seriously weaken EFCA.
3. A 2008 election keeps Democrats in control of the House and Senate with larger numbers. In both chambers, EFCA will face significant attempts to change its basic thrust.
I have always been a bit skeptical about using the large numbers of legislators who have signed as co-sponsors of EFCA as a barometer of the chances for the legislation to pass--and pass in a form that changes the playing field for union organizing from one grossly tilted towards employers to one that gives workers the real right to choose a union.
The Wal-Mart contribution list above remind me of that scene in "The Untouchables" where Eliot Ness, sure of the evidence against Al Capone, finds out that the entire jury has been bought of. Of course, the movie ends with a happy resolution but we aren't in Hollywood when it comes to EFCA.
So, what should be done:
1. The Change To Win Coalition and the AFL-CIO should jointly send a letter to Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Charles Schumer (head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee) and Chris Hollen (head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) demanding that party members return every dime to Wal-Mart.
2. Both Federations should also write to every member of Congress declaring that any Democrat receiving or keeping Wal-Mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good-bye.
I'm a sucker for things theatrical. I just wish I were more creative myself. But I live vicariously through those of you able to create.
Today - a plain brown cardboard box held the most delightful, amazing, breathtaking gift that I could ever imagine... even my brilliant gifter's name is a bit of a mystery, written as it was to trail off the paper, leaving me wondering is it "sillyokito"? "Sillyakita?" "Sillyokio?" Like a faceless man, the letters shift and I'm just left dazzled. Thank you with every fiber of my being.
So, let me tell you about my treasure. I feel as rich as a Lannister today, my friends.
Upon opening the box, I find a lovely note on thick parchment, sealed with blood red wax and - okay, holy hell you guys, I'm already crying because I'm a huge sap and I'm just as excited as my kiddos are on Christmas morning.
The first thing I see? Dark wings - with a parchment wrapped around it's leg. The parchment reads "winter is coming". It's very hot here, so I'm excited twofold.
Digging down, is a handmade quilt - lovingly rendered with the four major houses and their words. I have to let the photos speak now because I don't have the words. I wish I'd taken more close up photos - the wolves are... amazing. I mean, GHOST! And Grey Wind, Shaggydog, Summer, Nymeria and poor Lady. I'm just... overwhelmed!
In this exchange, I played the game of thrones and I definitely won. There are no gifts like this. There is only this.
“You say prediction market and people are like ‘What's that?' – it doesn't sound that important or lucrative or interesting.”
That's Jeremy Gardner, best known as the director of the College Cryptocurrency Network, talking about the first reactions some may have to his latest project, Augur, the decentralized, blockchain-based prediction market founded by Jack Peterson and set to launch a token crowdsale this spring.
Common perceptions aside, Gardner and core developer Joey Krug are out to prove that a platform that allows participants to bet on the outcome of real-world events can be a vehicle for social good, rather than simply another outlet for digital gambling.
In conversation with CoinDesk, Gardner and Krug sought to portray Augur as a project that plans to use decentralized public ledgers to create a way for anyone in any field, from finance, healthcare and governance, to tap into the collective forecasting power of a global user base.
Gardner said:
“With bitcoin, it's a better money than what we have, but it's a version of what we have today. We've never really had a wildly popular prediction market. We've never had these open-source tools to be able to bet on the Internet and turn that into a social good.”
Both Gardner and Krug have left college to launch the six-person project, one that boasts financial support from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the guidance of Ron Bernstein, founder of Intrade, what was until the time of its shutdown in 2013 one of the more well-known prediction markets.
Speaking to CoinDesk, Bernstein said he expressed an early interest in the project as he views it through the lens of his own struggles trying to launch a similar, though centralized, platform.
The Intrade and Tradesports CEO compared the challenges the project faces to tech giants like Uber, which have tested regulatory boundaries in order to ensure they are first to market with a potentially powerful idea.
“The potential for Augur is really about the distributed participation from the exchange operators as well as from the exchange users and the ability to distribute that in the way that they propose has never been done,” Bernstein said.
A tumultuous history
At present, there are more immediate hurdles for Augur. One of which is ensuring that the public can get behind a prediction market, especially when their rocky history has clouded public perception about what they are and what they aim to achieve.
Prediction markets allow their users to buy and sell shares in the outcome of an event. The current market price of a share is then an estimate of the probability that event will occur. Already, many academic researchers attest that such platforms, while incorporating aspects of gambling, do have practical value.
“Prediction market prices have informational value because they aggregate the beliefs of market participants and reveal what the market overall forecasts are the odds of the event at hand occurring,” a 2014 report by Mercatus Research explains.
Though it goes on to note that primary reason the market exists is speculation, the report does speak to the positive benefits such a platform can have by noting its use in US presidential elections dating back to the 1800s.
Gardner attests to being an Intrade user, placing bets during the 2008 and 2012 elections. He explained the appeal of the service, adding:
“It wasn't gambling, there was no risk if you thought you were well-informed and that to me was a really powerful notion.”
Finding a gray area
Just as powerful a roadblock may be historical issues prediction markets have faced on a regulatory front, particularly from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the body that oversees the US futures market.
In 2005, for example, the CFTC granted Intrade an exemption to operate, providing it limited participants to those with assets between $5m and $10m. By 2013, dogged by lawsuits in the US and issues abroad, Intrade shut down. Notably, its website currently promises “announcements coming soon”.
Further laws were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which sought to limit betting that was not deemed to be in the public interest. However, some prediction markets have been able to prosper, most, like the Iowa Electronic Market, under academic exemptions.
Yet these problems, Augur contends, are solved by the decentralized nature of blockchains and the overall lack of regulatory guidance.
“There's no law that prevents us from doing what we're doing. We're just writing code. There's also no law that allows us to do what we're doing. We recognize that it's a gray area, but it's a gray area we're very much comfortable with,” Gardner said, adding:
“Very clearly we write this code, we put it into the cloud and like Satoshi [Nakamoto] we could disappear.”
Gardner discussed conducting the company's in-house legal research prior to the launch of the venture, asserting that the project should not fall under securities laws as “people aren't partaking in a common enterprise and they're not expecting profits from the work of others”.
Still, he admits the CFTC is “a huge concern”, though one that will be alleviated by the fact that no one involved with the project will operate a prediction market.
“It's about narrowing down who we might piss off and reducing the likelihood of that happening,” Gardner said.
Harnessing blockchain tech
Questions of market viability aside, Augur is already at work on its technology, though even its construction remains in flux. Augur intends to use two types of tokens to facilitate its market.
First, it will plan to use the as-yet-unlaunched sidechains technology to transfer bitcoin to addresses that can be held while a user is actively holding shares as part of a wager. Second will be the token of focus during its upcoming crowdsale, Reputation, which is set to be sold over 45 days in May.
Reputation tokens will be sold during the crowdsale in part to raise money for the completion and continued development of the platform, but be used by Augur in practice to incentivize users to reliably report on the outcome of events, say that Hillary Clinton is elected president in 2016.
“After the election happens, because there's not a centralized source that confirms that it's happened, there has to be a decentralized reporting system. That's where reputation comes in. Reputation holders are asked to report on the outcome of events and that ensures the integrity of the system,” Gardner said.
Those who are dishonest, in turn, have a percentage of their tokens redistributed among the trustworthy users in the network. How much will be distributed is determined by an equation, and will vary depending on factors such as how many people report on the event and how accurately.
Lastly, there will be a ‘seigniorage modeled coin' that will help ensure that long-term bets can be made without being subject to the volatility of bitcoin. For example, if a user wanted to bet on the 2020 election, he or she would need to know the funds would retain value at this time.
“What we'll probably do,” Krug continued, “is there is a thing called the subcurrency API on Ethereum, and we'll probably support the best seigniorage out there, so we'll probably use the best of them.”
Already in place, according to Krug, is the equation that would allow for the exchange of shares in event outcomes, and the consensus mechanisms that determine binary outcomes.
“You can even have up to 75% liars and get the correct outcome reporting,” Krug said, though he noted the project is still working on how to deal with multidimensional outcomes.
Educational marketing
Connecting with potential users will be another challenge, as evidenced by the somewhat lackluster reception of the group at The North American Bitcoin Conference's Startup Stage.
Recalling the event, Gardner remarked: “I think there is a huge gap that keeps people from understanding the project.”
Focusing on this question will be the job of director of marketing Tony Sakich, a former marketing manager at payment processor BitPay.
Describing the project's members as a “dream team”, Sakich indicated that he intends to focus his efforts on keeping Augur's ad campaigns “old-school”, while appealing to a broad base beyond those in the bitcoin community.
“We're hoping to go to a lot of a school, academia has wanted something like this for a while. I think the people who are into prediction markets are not the crypto types, and we're trying to make that crossover,” Sakich said.
Calling the project a “real challenge” when compared to BitPay, Sakich said he's in the midst of lining up conferences and events that will allow Augur to reach audiences outside of the bitcoin community.
Although he said he won't be using the betting platform, he added he expects Augur to “become one of the definitive prediction markets”, provided it can be maintained by its decentralized community.
Sparking change
Despite these challenges, the Augur team is confident their product can solve real problems.
For example, Krug mentions that Augur could be used by farmers in Argentina to hedge against weather cycles or by Chinese traders who are unable to access the US stock market.
“Take the problem of asking your own employees for information,” Krug continued. “Say you're a fashion company and you want to see what will be the best-selling product of that year. You can ask your employees. What you could do is ask the general public and get a much more accurate result.”
On an even more abstract level, Krug went so far as to suggest that prediction markets could be used by doctors to more accurately diagnose patients.
Perhaps most notably, Krug and Gardner aren't interested in turning Augur into a long-term endeavor or even a business, or at the very least, that matter is still up for debate.
“A lot of team members are pretty young, this is really an intellectual experiment. Let's say that Augur is successful, there are all sorts of consumer applications, there will be consulting opportunities,” Gardner said, comparing the career path to those blazed by bitcoin developers like Peter Todd.
Gardner added:
“If Augur is successful, there's a huge opportunity to make money, but we believe that if this succeeds, we'll have created this world-changing forecasting tool.”

CHICAGO (STMW) – A man filed a federal lawsuit Friday claiming that he was beat up last year by an off-duty Chicago Police officer working as a security guard at the Rock ‘n' Roll McDonald's restaurant in the River North neighborhood.
Jefton McCallister claims that he and a friend were leaving the McDonald's restaurant, 600 N. Clark St., after finishing a late meal on Dec. 18, 2009, according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court.
The suit claims Officer John Long was working as a security guard at the restaurant and was not in uniform. Long followed the pair outside and cursed at them to get back inside and pick up their stuff. Long did not identify himself.
McCallister and his friend assumed Long was drunk and ignored him, the suit said. McCallister went back into the restaurant to use the bathroom where he again saw Long who said, “Oh, it's you again.” When McCallister asked him what was his problem, Long replied, “I thought I told you to get the f— out of here.”
Once outside the bathroom, Long grabbed McCallister who tried to free himself, according to the suit. Long then punched him in the forehead. Frank Mejia, a security guard at the restaurant who was in street clothes then jumped on McCallister and both guards slammed McCallister face first into a wall and handcuffed him.
While searching McCallister, Long identified himself as a police officer and told McCallister that he was going to jail, according to the suit. Long then kicked McCallister's friend and used profanity to tell him to leave or he would get beat as well, according to the suit. McCallister's friend went outside and called police.
When McCallister said he did not believe Long was a police officer, Mejia grabbed him by the throat and both guards pulled McCallister into the bathroom, according to the suit. When police officers arrived, Long and Mejia told them that McCallister and his friend had thrown condiments all over the floor and accused McCallister of assault.
The suit claims that video security cameras in the restaurant captured part of the incident that occurred outside the bathroom.
McCallister appeared in court eight times about the incident before the case was dismissed in Dec. 2010, according to the suit.
The ten-count suit claims excessive force, battery, assault, false arrest and malicious prosecution. The suit also seeks a jury trial and names the city, McDonald's restaurant and the restaurant owners, Marilyn Wright and Ralph Wright.
A Chicago Police spokesman said the department does not comment on pending litigation.
A spokesperson for McDonald's was not immediately available for comment.

A couple of weeks ago at the NFL Rookie Premiere, SB Nation interviewed many of the players in attendance, including Cleveland Browns rookie RB Terrance West. Watch the video below as Shaw talks with SB Nation's Dan Rubenstein; I have transcribed most of the Browns-related parts beneath the video.
Dan: "What was your reaction when you found out you were going to Cleveland?"
West: "It was exciting, just to get the opportunity to go to any team. Any team that would have called me, I would have felt the same way -- excited. "
Dan: "When you actually did get that call, what was that initial conversation like?"
West: "It was kind of weird because when I got the phone call, the 49ers were on the clock, but when my phone rang, it said Ohio. I thought that somebody was playing around on my phone, making a joke. When the coach called, he said, 'are you healthy, are you ready?' I said, 'yeah.' They said, 'This is the Cleveland Browns, we just traded the 94th pick with the 49ers to get you.'"
Dan: "What were the conversations like after the draft, just in terms of getting a sense of the coaching staff and how they wanted to use you?"
West: "I'm playing a big part in the system right now. They've got big goals for me this year."
Dan: "Obviously, they were sort of the story with the first round, with Johnny Manziel and Justin Gilbert. What have your conversations been like with other rookies that Cleveland is bringing in?"
West: "We're all on the same page. We all want to come in and help change the organization around into a winning program. That's our mentality."
Dan: "What have the conversations been like with regards to how you are going to be used? What is your role, as the team sees it, early on with the offense?"
West: "I'm going to play a big role running the ball this season. They've got big expectations for me, they want me to play this year."
Dan: "What is the playbook like? How much is new, how much is familiar with what you did in college?"
West: "Everything is new. I mean, we do the same things, but the terminology is different."
Dan: "What do you know about the city of Cleveland, your new home?"
West: "I know nothing. Just LeBron...that's it."

Speaking at the VO5 NME Awards 2017 last week, Healy said that he and the grime star have plans together for an unlikely team-up.
“Me and Skepta know each other,” Healy told NME. “We tried working with each other recently but it just didn't work out. Just for loads of reasons – but we're going to do something in the future.”
He continued: “We're going to do a tune together. We want to do like a ‘West End Girls' Pet Shop Boys [kind of thing]. Maybe start a band, just me and Skepta do a band. Well we're talking about it, so let's see what happens.”

Jesusemilore Talodabijesu "Semi" Ojeleye ( SHEM-ee OH-jə-lay;[1] born December 5, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for both Duke University and Southern Methodist University.
Early life and college career [ edit ]
Ojeleye's parents emigrated from Nigeria to Kansas.[2] He starred at Ottawa High School and in 2013 was named the Parade Magazine National Player of the Year.[3] He chose national power Duke for college, but played sparingly for two seasons. Looking for a larger role, he transferred to SMU, and in 2016–17 he led the team to both American Athletic Conference (AAC) regular season and Tournament Championships. Ojeleye averaged 18.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game and was named AAC Player of the Year.[4]
Professional career [ edit ]
Following the close of his redshirt junior season, Ojeleye entered his name for the 2017 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, leaving open the possibility of a return to the Mustangs.[5] Ojeleye was invited to the 2017 NBA Draft Combine, one of 67 participants. After some promising performances he announced that he would commit to the draft, ending his college career. Ojeleye was chosen by the Boston Celtics in the second round.[6]
Ojeleye made his professional debut on October 17, 2017 in a 102–99 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[7] During the regular season, he averaged 2.7 points per game and shot 34.6 percent from the field, but emerged as a defensive presence. He started in Game 5 of the playoff series versus the Milwaukee Bucks and held Giannis Antetokounmpo to 16 points.[8]

When scientists take to the streets it's time to listen up
Posted on 20 June 2011 by John Cook
CLEARING UP THE CLIMATE DEBATE: Dr Michael Brown exposes the tactics used by purveyors of “non-science” to attack climate change research.
It takes a lot to get scientists out of their offices and marching on Parliament.
But in recent weeks that's exactly what some of Australia's top researchers have taken to doing.
Former Governor of Victoria and scientist David de Kretser brought an open letter to Parliament House last week and just today the Federation of Australian Science and Technological Societies (FASTS) has launched its Respect the Science campaign from the same location.
The Federation claims that attacks on climate scientists are “undermining the national building work of all scientists.”
The Conversation has also hosted an open letter from dozens of concerned scientists trying to get the message across that human-induced climate change is a real threat.
So what is it that has got our science community so riled up?
It might be something to do with the death threats many climate scientists have been receiving. CEO of FASTS Anna Maria Arabia was on the wrong end of one just this morning.
But for many, it's simply the tactics of “the other side” of the climate change debate that has spurred on their public demonstrations.
When the forces of non-science are this strong, it's time for scientists to respond.
Cherries and missing ingredients
Those denying the science of climate change present arguments that appear scientific, with measurements, theories, statistics and jargon.
But many of those denying climate change are not truly doing science.
Science tries to provide the simplest explanation for a wealth of measurements in the natural world.
Non-science, on the other hand, cherry-picks evidence. A classic example is only plotting a few years of temperature records, rather than the past 150 years.
When non-science tries to describe all the observations, it requires contrived explanations as it attempts to avoid the simplest scientific explanation. Ian Plimer invokes underwater volcanoes to increase atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the numbers required are vast compared to the actual number of volcanoes.
Purveyors of non-science charge that thousands of scientists are ignorant of basic science.
This would be shocking, if it were not patently false.
A central claim of climate change denial is that the physics of thermodynamics is in conflict with climate models. Even a quick Google search reveals that this claim has been refuted many times.
So why is this false claim continually repeated?
I can only speculate. Perhaps it is now a negative political catchphrase, which is repeated often so it can be confused with truth.
Practitioners of non-science loudly proclaim that climate models cannot be trusted, as they are missing key components.
When subjected to scrutiny, these supposed key ingredients are often speculative and not backed by robust evidence. To include speculative theories in climate models would only make the models less trustworthy, not more so.
The medium, message and messenger
The practitioners of non-science claim peer review is used to enforce groupthink. This is not the case.
Most scientists review as thoroughly and impartially as possible because peer review is central to the health of science.
Many scientists will recall reviewing papers where they doubted the conclusions but accepted the paper, as there were no obvious flaws in the method, data and theory used.
Both sides of the climate debate communicate to the public via the media, and this is at the crux of recent activism on the part of Australian scientists.
Science uses media to communicate results from science journals to the public and policymakers. Non-science uses the media as its principal means of communicating its conclusions. But often, both get equal play.
Press releases, popular articles, books, letters, websites and think tank reports do not undergo peer review. Conclusions may not be backed up by sound methodology, accurate data and appropriate use of theories.
Personal attacks, rhetorical flourishes, witticisms and point scoring make good copy, but do not alter the basic science.
If the media is the only means being used to present supposed scientific results, there are good reasons to be suspicious.
Letters signed by esteemed scientists can highlight that an issue is important. But there are millions of scientists, so it is not surprising each side can muster hundreds of signatories.
Think tanks are often present in the climate debate, but these organisations are often ideologically driven and associated with particular political beliefs.
At best, think tanks present science that is consistent with their political beliefs. At worst, think tanks commission reports and books that are politically motivated non-science.
A sceptical view of think tanks is probably better justified than a sceptical view of climate science.
It's all a mistake
Non-science claims science is not to be trusted.
To back this claim they provide examples of where there have been paradigm shifts in science; relativity, dinosaur extinction, plate tectonics and the causes of ulcers.
But there are stark differences between these paradigm shifts and the current climate debate.
When paradigm shifts have occurred, often the evidence for the prevailing theory had been weak.
Paradigm shifts have also been accompanied by robust evidence contrary to the prevailing theory. For example, relativity was preceded by precision measurements of the constant speed of light.
In contrast, those denying climate change only use weak evidence.
Classic non-science evidence includes plots where temperature appears to vary along with something other than carbon dioxide. Such plots can be suspect.
If one generates large numbers of plots, one can find apparent correlations between two unrelated quantities.
For example, the increasing number of HIV infections has been accompanied by an increasing number of personal computers. Only a fool would suggest one directly causes the other.
In contrast to randomly generating plots, climate science makes predictions for the relationship between carbon dioxide levels, air temperature and sea level rise.
Observations are then be used to test these predictions and significant discrepancies are always investigated.
This is how good science is done.
If it takes a march to the halls of government to highlight the different between good science and non-science, then that is what the scientific community must do.

A group of lenders has filed an objection in a Delaware court over the quick sale of THQ's assets to Clearlake Capital Group following the struggling video game publisher filing for bankruptcy protection last month. But THQ says it's likely to run out of cash this month, necessitating the short sale window of just 30 days.
The lenders say the quick turnaround on the sale of THQ's studios and game franchises doesn't afford other potential buyers the opportunity to make competitive bids and that the publisher's stable of franchises — Saints Row, Darksiders, Homefront, Company of Heroes, et al. — should be considered for sale on a title-by-title basis, not as a whole.
The lenders, which hold $41 million in convertible notes, say in a court filing that the bidding on THQ's assets "appear to have been designed specifically to thwart any potential bidders from stepping forward to compete with Clearlake's bid." The "unjustifiably accelerated sale timeline," originally planned to close in about 30 days, will prevent prospective bidders from having an opportunity to perform diligence on THQ's assets before submitting a bid, they say.
The objection lists three notes holders: Silverback Asset Management, Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund and Wolverine Flagship Fund Trading Limited.
In addition to objecting to the speed and comprehensive nature of the sale, the lenders allege that THQ president Jason Rubin and Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kay orchestrated a sale with the help of Centerview Partners to exploit the "significant upside" of THQ. The lenders further allege that THQ management manufactured a liquidity crisis, leading to the chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing.
According to Distressed Debt Investing, Roberta DeAngelis, a U.S. trustee overseeing the bankruptcy case, also filed an objection, citing the short sale window and arguing that bidding procedures limit the number of potential buyers.
During a hearing, THQ counsel Jeffrey C. Krause said the quick turnaround on the sale was necessary, based on the terms of certain financing agreements, reports Law360. Krause reportedly said THQ would run out of cash by Jan. 15.
THQ announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection and planned to sell its studios and assets to stalking horse bidder Clearlake Capital Group in December. Following the announcement, THQ president Jason Rubin wrote that the process represented "a new start" for the publisher. The Agoura Hills, CA based publisher was recently delisted from NASDAQ.

It's always exciting to hear a trade announced live at the draft, but let's be honest, as it stands, this was an incredibly shocking trade.
“Hells Bells” was playing at The Rock as New Jersey was on the clock for the 9th selection overall in the NHL Draft in Newark, NJ. Completely out of nowhere, the goaltending saga in Vancouver ended (or transitioned) and Schneider became a New Jersey Devil at the hands of Lou Lamoriello in exchange for the ninth overall pick, the pick that the Canucks would go ahead to select Bo Horvat.
First thing is first. It is always difficult to analyze a trade right after it happens because in most cases deals like these tend to pan out over the course of years and years. This trade is nothing more than swapping a prospect for a mildly NHL established goaltender. However, Schneider was Vancouver's starting goalie and Horvat was a very big cog for the London Knights in their run to the Memorial Cup Championship. He also scored the game winning goal for the team against the Barrie Colts in game 7 to win the OHL's J. Ross Robertson Cup.
It is the Devils, however, that will get the immediate benefit. New Jersey gains a goaltender who has been elite status at the top of the NHL's goaltender rankings. Schneider during his tenure with the Canucks recorded a record of 55-26-8, booking nine shutouts with an average GAA of 2.20 and a save percentage of .927.
That is unbelievable.
Schneider has not been a starter for most of those games played and he played on a very strong Canucks team, one that won back to back presidents trophies between 2010 and 2012. However, it has become clear that he will be the direct successor to Martin Brodeur if both he and the Devils agree to extend his contract.
Schneider is a very dynamic goaltender, making use of a butterfly style that is fitted almost specifically for him. Schneider's initial saves take more effort than the average goaltender due to the fact that he takes away nearly the entire bottom of the net, but he's very good at moving laterally across the crease and making saves on second chances.
The one thing he happens to share with Martin Brodeur from his limited trials is his weaker blocker side as well as his strong glove hand. Schneider is only 27 which is very raw for a goaltender. The Devils go from having the league's oldest goaltending tandem to one that has an average age of 34. On top of that, Schneider can take a heavy workload, taking pressure off of Martin Brodeur, an aging hall of famer.
Brodeur is the number one goaltender (he's on the cover of NHL 14 by EA Sports, as well) in Lou Lamoriello's mind but there's nothing that is stopping Schneider from taking away that role. Regardless, Brodeur's contract is up after this upcoming season where the net will almost certainly become Schneider's.
Johan Hedberg will be bought out of his contract and it will not count against the team's cap. We can all thank Moose for his service but it is clear that both he and Brodeur are not getting any younger and the Devils need to think about the best moves for their future.
It's very simple to say that Devils have upgraded at the goaltending position and that they have possibly found the next king in the New Jersey goaltending monarchy.
Martin Brodeur finally has a clear heir to his throne.
There's something wonderful about magic shows. The idea that the world is actually far more strange and mysterious than we thought is an enticing one – maybe that's why belief in ghosts, gods and UFOs is so popular. I mean, tell me you didn't knock on the back of a wardrobe when you were a kid with the tiniest piece of hope that you might get to Narnia. But there's an odd tension with magic shows in particular. We want to believe it's real – if only for as long as we're in the auditorium – but at the same time we steadfastly avoid thinking of what it would mean for these wonders to be more than tricks. Because if that was true, it wouldn't be entertaining. It would be horrifying. For rabbits and pretty women, anyway.
↓ Transcript A stage magician produces a rabbit out of his top hat. The rabbit is disoriented and in awe of its surroundings.
“Wow, so I guess I'm alive now? Awesome!”
The magician has dropped the rabbit back into the hat and is in the act of making a gesture above it. The rabbit's voice comes from inside the hat.
“This is so cool. I wonder what I was created fo-”
The magician turns the hat toward the audience so everyone can clearly see - it's empty. Applause.
Lonely people may just be terrible under pressure. A new study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin finds that lonely people aren't lacking in social skills. Rather, they may be able to decode social cues just as well as a non-lonely person, but choke under the pressure of performing in social situations, researchers led by Megan Knowles at Pennsylvania's Franklin and Marshall College found.
As it turns out, “choking” is a scientifically validated concept. When people pay too much attention to what should be automated processes, like in professional sports, it can interfere with what should be a subconscious performance. Freaking out over a task, like a math test, can also overload working memory, causing people to flub.
In four different tests, participants who described themselves as lonely performed as well or better than non-lonely participants, as long as the tasks weren't couched in terms of social suavity. In one, for instance, some participants were told that a particular lab task would measure their performance in social situations, while another group was told that it was merely a measure of problem-solving. Lonely people in the former condition tended to perform worse than non-lonely people, while in the second condition, there was no difference. In other words, when they felt their social skills were being put to the test, lonelier people choked. However, in a subsequent study when participants were primed to attribute their feelings of anxiety to a caffeine buzz (from a fake energy drink that in reality contained no sugar or caffeine), lonely individuals performed better.
“Apparently, allowing the lonely to dismiss their anxieties as stemming from another task or being side effects of caffeine enabled them to avoid choking under pressure,” the researchers write. “Altogether, these findings suggest that the pressure of social challenges causes anxiety that impairs the performance of lonely people.”
This is in line with previous research suggesting that reframing the way people think about anxiety can help with all kinds of performance anxiety. Leaning into those butterfly feelings—by concentrating on feeling excitement before a big speech for example—can improve performance more than trying to fight the anxiety and calm down. Now, just figure out a way to self-administer placebo shots of caffeine, and you'll be the life of the party.

'Thief' Delivers An Unfiltered Depiction Of Life In Lagos
Let's get the negative stuff out of the way first. Teju Cole's Every Day Is For The Thief is not much of a novel. Forget plot or character development: This is a piece of writing that's all about setting. If you take what Cole is offering here and value it on its own terms, you'll probably appreciate the curious magic at work in this slim not-quite-a-novel. In chapters that stand as separate, short vignettes, Every Day Is For The Thief describes a young New York doctor's visit back to his hometown of Lagos, Nigeria. It's a Clockwork Orange world where policemen routinely stop traffic to collect bribes, where the electricity sputters out at nightly intervals and where 11-year-old thieves are necklaced with kerosene-soaked tires and burned to death. Amidst all the corruption and misery, Cole also makes readers understand the narrator's longing for a Nigeria he thinks he remembers from childhood.
Every Day Is For The Thief technically predates Cole's celebrated 2011 debut novel, Open City, and bookends it. Open City followed a Nigerian doctor — a psychiatric resident named Julius — as he worked off stress and stoked his alienation by walking all over the island of Manhattan at night. Open City was a fresh meditation on what E.B. White, another walker in the city, called "the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy. " The narrator of Every Day Is For The Thief isn't given to contemplation like Julius, and he wouldn't dare walk alone through Lagos at night; but this guy is also very much the outsider, separated from his home city by the many years he's spent living in New York. Maybe that's why the format here of short disconnected chapters doesn't bother me so much: This guy is so overwhelmed by the strangeness of life in his old hometown, he's not capable of piecing together a coherent narrative that makes sense of what he's experiencing. So, instead, we get entries that read like a travel journal. To add to that Lonely Planet Guide effect, Cole includes moody black and white photographs he's actually taken of sites in Lagos: a black goat standing alone in a rubble strewn building lot, a swampy deserted outdoor market, a concrete cityscape as seen from behind the grimy windshield of a car.

The prose snapshots of Lagos are just as off-kilter. The minute our narrator lands at the airport, he's accosted by an official who presses him for a bribe: "What have you brought me for Christmas?" this man asks in Yoruba. During his stay, our narrator visits the National Museum, a mildewed place where the few artifacts "are caked in dust and [displayed] under dirty plastic screens." The museum unintentionally testifies to the colonial and post-colonial pillaging of Nigerian art. And in one of the most finely etched vignettes, the narrator visits an Internet café, which, he assures us, is a sign of the newly vital Nigerian economy. But, the Chamber-of-Commerce-type description quickly takes a downward turn:
"The availability of computers is ... an index of progress. But while India is an emerging software player, and countries like China, Indonesia, and Thailand have successfully staked claims in manufacturing, Nigeria's contribution is much more modest. In fact it is, for now, limited to the repetition of a single creative misuse of the Internet: advance fee fraud."
What follows is our narrator's droll description of the café — one of hundreds in Lagos — filled with young men busy sending out scam e-mails all over the world. You know what I'm talking about: Those e-mails that sometimes pop up in your inbox from "Nigerian princes" promising a share in a multi-million dollar account in exchange for your help in the form of a small advance fee. That internet cafe is a masterful vision of barely-checked Third World enterprise.
Every Day Is For The Thief isn't uniformly bleak — there are fleeting moments of grace, for instance, in a music store — but its unfiltered depiction of life in Lagos is something only an insider/outsider like Teju Cole could write and hope to get away with.
A recently published study suggests a mother's depression may affect her ability to successfully parent.
Researchers learned that depressive symptoms seem to focus mothers' responses on minimizing their own distress, which may come at the expense of focusing on the impact their responses have on their children.
The research is published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.
Experts acknowledge that depressive symptoms are common among mothers, and these symptoms are linked with worse developmental outcomes for children.
The new study, which followed 319 mothers and their children over a two-year period, helps to explain why parenting competence seems to deteriorate as parents' symptoms of depression increase.
“Children can often be demanding, needy, unpredictable, uncooperative, and highly active,” said lead researcher Theodore Dix, Ph.D.
“The task of parenting, particularly with children who are emotionally reactive, is especially difficult for mothers experiencing symptoms of depression because they are continually attempting to regulate their distress and discomfort.”
Researchers say that previous studies have yielded conflicting findings, indicating that depressed parents are both more negatively responsive and more unresponsive to their children than parents without depression.
Dix and University of Texas colleagues Edward Anderson, Ph.D., and graduate student Anat Moed hypothesized that depressed mothers may respond to their children in different ways, depending on the child and the situation, but that these responses reflect the same underlying process:
“Attempting to minimize immediate distress or discomfort may sometimes prompt mothers to avoid conflict with their children, leading to unresponsive and lax parenting,” said Dix.
“At other times, it may lead them to accelerate that conflict to address their child's aversive behavior, leading to over-reactive parenting.”
The researchers conducted periodic home visits with the mothers and children participating in the study over a period of two years.
The longitudinal data showed that as mothers' symptoms of depression increased, they became less responsive to their children's behavior, but only when that behavior wasn't overly unpleasant. When the children's behavior was particularly unpleasant, the mothers' symptoms of depression predicted increasingly negative responses.
The findings indicate that as long as the child's behavior stays below a certain threshold of unpleasantness, not reacting to that behavior is perhaps the easiest way for mothers to keep the peace, avoiding further negative reactions from their children and minimizing their own distress.
But, as the behavior becomes more difficult to tolerate, mothers are more likely to overtly disapprove of or resist the behavior as a way of quashing it entirely.
“Ultimately, depressive symptoms seem to steer mothers' focus toward minimizing their own distress and away from the impact that their behavior has on the child and the child's needs,” said Dix.
“Given links between lax and over-reactive discipline to child abuse, coercive family process, and developmental problems in children, understanding basic mechanisms that promote these problematic forms of parenting is important,” he said.

Depressed Moms May Focus on Self Rather than Kids' Needs
A US couple have lost custody of their children after featuring them in allegedly abusive prank videos. They're not the first to go too far in search of hits
Pranks have been a booming part of YouTube's scene for years – but it's a subculture prone to attracting controversy. The latest incident has led to a US father and a stepmother losing custody of two of their children as a result of some of their prank videos.
Mike Martin of Baltimore ran a channel named DaddyOFive, featuring his wife, Heather, and their five children. At the height of the controversy, but before his videos were made private, DaddyOFive had more than 750,000 subscribers and the clips were viewed more than 176m times.
Family YouTube channels are not uncommon – but the Martins were accused of child abuse because they regularly made their children the subject of their pranks.
One video uploaded earlier this month showed Heather spraying disappearing ink on the floor of the bedroom of the youngest child, Cody. The Martins scream at him: “What the fuck did you do?” as Cody breaks down in tears, thinking he's in trouble, and maintains he didn't do anything. His parents reveal the whole thing is a joke. “It's just a prank, brah,” Martin tells him, still filming.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It's just a prank.'
Commenters were unimpressed. So were other YouTubers – Philip DeFranco, with more than five million subscribers to his channel, was among the first to criticise the parents, calling their treatment abuse. Others said Cody seemed to be the target of most pranks, such as one in which his dad pushed him into a shelf, appearing to cause him to bleed.
The Martins' response was initially defiant. They posted a video defending their content and prompted their children to do the same. But later they backtracked, declaring the videos to be fake and scripted, and issued an apology.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The couple apologise.
“We did do pranks, but most of the time the kids knew about them and they were planned,” Heather Martin told Good Morning America. “The characters you see on our YouTube channel is not a reflection of who we are. It's a character, it was a show. A bad show, but it was a show.”
Last Monday, the controversy reached a new level after Rose Hall, the biological mother of Mike Martin's youngest children, Cody and Emma, said she had been granted emergency custody of them.
In a YouTube video uploaded by her lawyer, Tim Conlon, she said: “Emma and Cody are with me, I have emergency custody – they're doing good. They're getting back to their playful selves.”
YouTube didn't have a specific comment on the DaddyOFive case, but it confirmed that ads were removed from the channel.
DaddyOFive is far from the only prankster YouTuber. The genre has grown on the site since its inception. YouTube itself has acknowledged and profited from this. In the grand tradition of You've Been Framed!, the videos are hugely popular and often rack up millions of views.
Last year, it created a series called Prank Academy for its paid streaming subscription service, YouTube Red, which showed Jesse Wellens and Jennifer Smith teaching other YouTuber stars how to pull off pranks.
Tony Blockley, a criminologist at the University of Derby, sees people's obsession with YouTube pranks as part and parcel of a society that increasingly lives its life online, but also enjoys engaging in a particular kind of schadenfreude.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Prank Academy.
“We celebrate what people post online and we live our lives on social media,” he says. “And there's this kind of voyeurism. There are people who like to see others at times of distress or coming to harm. “The question is,” he says, “is the problem with the person who creates the content, or the people who watch it?
“Absolutely, the creators have to take responsibility, but if nobody watched it, then nobody would make these videos. When people see they can get views, it becomes a competition to see who can get more, which leads to more extreme pranks.”
One YouTuber who has become infamous for his pranks is former Big Brother contestant Sam Pepper. In 2014, he came under fire for a video called “Fake Hand Ass Pinch”, which showed him grabbing women while wearing a fake hand. He claimed the video was a “social experiment”. After the controversy, some young women came forward and accused Pepper of sexual assault, accusations he has denied.
Pepper got into more hot water in 2015, with a prank in which he tricked a vlogger into believing his best friend was murdered in front of him.
Amelia Tait of the New Statesman points out that there is no regulation for prank videos online. “Though YouTube removes videos that breach its ‘community guidelines', it seems illogical that we trust the service to police itself,” she writes.
“Since the invention of the radio, we have assumed that independent bodies are needed to scrutinise the media – so why you should the largest video-sharing platform on the planet be exempt?” In DaddyOFive's case, other YouTubers seem to have acted as their own form of regulation, ensuring the videos were brought to the authorities' attention even when they were all made private.As yet, there has been no update on DaddyOFive's social media channels, and the Martins' lawyers have declined to comment. Further court hearings on permanent custody of the children are pending.
There are cases where police have become involved with pranks which have gone too far. UK-based YouTube channel Trollstation regularly fools passersby, and often the internet, with its staged prank videos.
Last year, members of the group were jailed after they staged a fake robbery at the National Portrait Gallery and a fake kidnapping at Tate Britain.
“If the police get involved, then it will be because of a statutory or legislative criminal act, or if someone reports it to them,” says Blockley. “But just because a crime hasn't necessarily taken place, doesn't mean it's not harmful.”
Fans are breathlessly anticipating the Tragically Hip concert tonight in Victoria.
It's the first show of the band's latest tour following late May's shocking revelation that frontman Gord Downie, 52, has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
The Hip has been perfecting its artistry for decades, entertaining millions with crowd-pleasers like Bobcaygeon, At the Hundredth Meridian, and Ahead by a Century.
But, given the demands of the road, and with Downie's dire prognosis, people are wondering just how this tour will unfold.

"I don't know how they're feeling [gearing up to] the launch of the tour, but I imagine they're excited. I know their fans are excited," said Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer, who has collaborated with the Hip in the past and says the group has been "firing people up" for years with "amazing" energy at live shows.
(CBC)
"I think they're doing what they do, living in the moment, playing shows, making it unique every night," she told CBC News.
Friday's show will be emotional, "not only for the fans, but for the crew, for the promoters, for the buildings, for anyone who is there," predicted Victoria-based music promoter Nick Blasko, who's worked with the band a number of times.
"I think that there's no hiding behind the reason why this tour is happening and, for a lot of people, this is a goodbye."
In an online statement, the band was careful when referring to the tour, avoiding terms like final or farewell when discussing hitting the road for the Hip's 14th studio album, Man Machine Poem.
"We've decided to do another one," the band members wrote, adding they would "try to make this our best tour yet."
On Friday, they're scheduled to take the stage at Victoria's Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre at 8:30 p.m. PT and greet up to 9,000 concertgoers in an arena usually reserved for junior ice hockey games.
"There's a lot of people arriving in Victoria from all over the country, all walks of our industry — whether it's promoters, agents — people that are in our business are descending on Victoria right now to be a part of this first show," Blasko said.
Over the next month, the band will then continue through a 15-date concert tour across the nation, concluding with a grand finale in its hometown of Kingston, Ont. that will be broadcast and streamed live on CBC.
Toronto singer-songwriter Justin Rutledge is one of many musicians who have been influenced by the iconic band. His 2014 album Daredevil consists strictly of cover versions of Tragically Hip songs.
"There will be sadness among the madness. Most of us simply want to thank them for their contributions to our lives," he said.
"Disbelief, tears, frustration — no one wants Gord to leave. No one knows what to do. We look up to the Tragically Hip as songwriters, musicians, and people."

Health concerns
Any musical tour requires stamina and focus, but for Downie — diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma — the physical toll is likely considerable.
How will he withstand this month's travel and performances? Will anything be visible to concertgoers: headaches, physical weakness or changes in personality? Is there a back-up plan if, for instance, he feels too ill to perform?
Discussing the rocker's state in late May, neuro-oncologist Dr. James Perry said that following surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, Downie's primary symptoms seemed to be fatigue due to his illness and its treatment. The singer-songwriter would likely need more "maintenance chemotherapy," he added at the time.

Ken McLeod, an associate professor specializing in popular music history at the University of Toronto, expects that fans will be respectful of whatever may come during the concerts.
"People are really excited to see them play, but also conscious of Downie's health situation," he pointed out.
"It's almost, ironically, an emotional embodiment of the contradiction in the band's name itself. It's cool that they're touring, but the circumstances are tragic."
Unprecedented demand
The tour's coveted tickets sold out in seconds in June and though additional dates were added, it soon emerged that computer bots had scooped up a large quantity of available seats, and scalpers were caught posting fake tickets on resale websites.

This week, a newly announced lottery is giving fans fresh hope for the opportunity to buy tickets on the day of each show.
Also, since the announcement that CBC would broadcast and stream the final show, nearly 100 organizations across Canada have submitted requests to host public screenings, with nearly 40 of them — from Penticton, B.C. to Winnipeg to Glace Bay, N.S.— granted permission thus far.
After years of touring, racking up millions in record sales as well as numerous awards and achievements, the Hip — one of Canada's most iconic and influential musical acts — faces perhaps its most difficult road trip yet.

Emotions are high and all eyes are on Downie, but only time will tell how the tour will unfold, as Courage becomes more than just a song.
​
Where to watch
The Kingston concert will begin at 8:30 p.m. ET, and will be broadcast and streamed — commercial free — on CBC Television (main network), CBC Radio One, CBC Radio 2, cbcmusic.ca and CBC's YouTube channels.
It will also stream online at the following destinations:

Supporters of disability rights took to Twitter this week to criticize Anderson Cooper's 60 Minutes report about lawyers who may be exploiting the Americans with Disabilities Act by targeting businesses with frivolous “drive-by-lawsuits.”
Individuals with disabilities complained that the plight of the business owner was the focus of the story:
Dear @60Minutes,#Inaccessibility remains a major issue, far greater an issue than lawyers “taking advantage.” #Ideas4Anderson — Mike Mort (@MikeeMort) December 6, 2016
Oh this @60Minutes @andersoncooper #ADA story makes me cringe. I should have to BEG every single business to comply? Thanks, Anderson. #fb — Sue Kerr (@PghLesbian24) December 5, 2016
Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, called Cooper's piece “informative and enlightening” in one tweet, but she also questioned the broadcast's balance of coverage on the matter:
#60minutes @60Minutes where are the stories of how people with disabilities continue to be discriminated against and the #ADA is ignored? — Marlee Matlin (@MarleeMatlin) December 5, 2016
Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake spoke up to tout his bill, the ADA Education and Reform Act, which he says “gives small businesses a chance to fix problems” before a lawsuit is filed against them.
My bill stops frivolous #ADA lawsuits featured on @60Minutes by giving small businesses a chance to fix problems https://t.co/hBkWvWjl4W — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2016
One viewer with a disabled son fired back at Flake:
ADA has been around 25 years. How much more chance? Meanwhile, places remain illegally inaccessible to our family, but that's frivolity? https://t.co/mgIYLqppYS — Elizabeth Picciuto (@epicciuto) December 6, 2016
Are some people taking advantage of disability access laws?
One viewer encouraged others to voice their support of the Americans with Disabilities Act by getting in touch with Anderson Cooper directly:
Have you benefited in some way from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)? Let @andersoncooper know why #WeNeedADA by sharing your story — Dominick Evans (@dominickevans) December 5, 2016
An especially popular tweet came from a law student who came to a different conclusion from the piece: an existential crisis of career choice.
The US Department of Homeland Security has revealed further details today on its decision to ban most electronic devices from the cabins of certain US-bound flights.
Reports emerged yesterday that US government agencies e-mailed some airlines about a new requirement that they ban passengers from bringing devices larger than a cell phone into airplane cabins. Now, DHS has revealed certain details of how the new rules will work. It's still unclear just why the ban is being imposed now or the reasoning behind where it's being imposed.
"Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation and are aggressively pursuing innovative methods to undertake their attacks, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items," explains a DHS fact sheet distributed to reporters. The agency will impose "aviation security enhancements" requiring any device larger than a cell phone to be put in checked baggage at 10 selected airports worldwide—that's down from reports yesterday, which indicated up to 13 airports could be affected. The banned devices include laptops, tablets, e-readers, cameras, portable DVD players, and any electronic game bigger than a smartphone.
The affected airports are: Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan; Cairo International Airport; Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul; King Abdul-Aziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Kuwait International Airport; Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca, Morocco; Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar; Dubai International Airport; and Abu Dhabi International Airport.
The fact sheet emphasizes that only "a small percentage of flights" to the US will be affected, since there are more than 250 international airports that offer flights to the US. Only US-bound flights will be affected; passengers on flights from the US to the 10 airports in question can carry devices as normal.
The new rules will apply to all passengers boarding in the 10 airports in question, regardless of citizenship.
Terror FAQ
An FAQ sheet handed out by DHS asks many of the pertinent questions but provides vague answers in response. For instance, the answer to the question "Why is DHS/TSA doing this now?" is that DHS "continuously assesses and evaluates the threat environment."
"We have reason to be concerned about attempts by terrorist groups to circumvent aviation security and terrorist groups continue to target aviation interests," added DHS in response to a question about whether there was a specific threat against aviation.
In response to the question "How did you select these airports?" DHS answered that the agency selected the airports "in close cooperation with our intelligence community partners... based on the current threat picture."
To answer the question, "Could more airports be added in the future?" DHS offers this abstraction: "As threats change, so too will TSA's security requirements."
DHS doesn't give a specific answer to one of the most practical questions begged by the rule: what's the definition of smartphone-sized? In a world of big phones, tablets of all sizes, and "phablets," there's no obvious answer.
"The size and shape of smart phones varies by brand," states DHS. "Smartphones are commonly available around the world and their size is well understood by most passengers who fly internationally."
The agency says that terrorist threats "are intensifying, given that aviation attacks provide an opportunity to cause mass casualties and inflict significant economic damage, as well as generate overwhelming media coverage." The FAQ continues:
Terrorist propaganda has highlighted the attacks against aircraft in Egypt with a soda can pack with explosives in October 2015, and in Somalia using an explosives-laden laptop in February 2016. Terrorists have historically tried to hide explosives in shoes in 2001, use liquid explosives in 2006, and conceal explosives in printers in 2010 and suicide devices in underwear in 2009 and 2012. Within the last year, we have also seen attacks conducted at airports to include in Brussels and Istanbul.
Airlines have 96 hours to comply with the new directives, which will be in effect indefinitely.
Update: The United Kingdom has imposed a similar set of rules banning larger-than-cell-phone electronics on board flights from Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

“When the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.”—Richard Nixon
Presidents don't give up power.
Executive orders don't expire at the end of each presidential term.
And every successive occupant of the Oval Office since George Washington, who issued the first executive order, has expanded the reach and power of the presidency.
The Constitution invests the President with very specific, limited powers: to serve as Commander in Chief of the military, grant pardons, make treaties (with the approval of Congress), appoint ambassadors and federal judges (again with Congress' blessing), and veto legislation.
In recent years, however, American presidents have anointed themselves with the power to wage war, unilaterally kill Americans, torture prisoners, strip citizens of their rights, arrest and detain citizens indefinitely, carry out warrantless spying on Americans, and erect their own secretive, shadow government.
These are the powers that will be inherited by the next heir to the throne, and it won't make a difference whether it's a President Trump or a President Clinton occupying the Oval Office.
The powers amassed by each successive president through the negligence of Congress and the courts—powers which add up to a toolbox of terror for an imperial ruler—empower whomever occupies the Oval Office to act as a dictator, above the law and beyond any real accountability.
Consider some of the presidential powers—which have been acquired through the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements and can be activated by any sitting president—that have allowed past presidents to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution.
The power to kill. As the New York Times concluded, “President Obama, who came to office promising transparency and adherence to the rule of law, has become the first president to claim the legal authority to order an American citizen killed without judicial involvement, real oversight or public accountability.” Obama's kill lists—signature drone strikes handpicked by the president—have been justified by the Justice Department as lawful because they are subject to internal deliberations by the executive branch. “In other words,” writes Amy Davidson for the New Yorker, “it's due process if the President thinks about it.”
The power to wage war. Ever since Congress granted George W. Bush the authorization to use military force in the wake of 9/11, the United States has been in a state of endless war without Congress ever having declared one. Having pledged to end Bush's wars, Barack Obama has extended them. As the New York Times notes, “He has now been at war longer than Mr. Bush, or any other American president… he will leave behind an improbable legacy as the only president in American history to serve two complete terms with the nation at war.” More than that, as theAtlantic makes clear, “Obama is inaugurating an era of unbridled war-making by the commander in chief, without any of the checks and balances contemplated by the American constitutional system.”
The power to torture. Despite the fact that the Bush Administration's use of waterboarding as a torture tactic was soundly criticized by Obama, the Obama Administration refused to hold anyone accountable for participating in the rendition and torture programs. In the absence of any finding of criminality, the authorization of such torture tactics remain part of the president's domain—should he or she ever choose to revive it.
The power to spy on American citizens. In the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to carry out surveillance on Americans' phone calls and emails. The Bush Administration claimed that the Constitution gives the president inherent powers to protect national security. The covert surveillance has continued under Obama.
The power to indefinitely detain American citizens. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring that all Japanese-Americans be held in internment camps. While that order was later rescinded, the U.S. Supreme Court declared it to be constitutional. The ruling has never been overturned. Pointing out that such blatantly illegal detentions could happen again—with the blessing of the courts—Justice Scalia warned, “In times of war, the laws fall silent.” In fact, each National Defense Authorization Act enacted since 2012 has included a provision that permits the military to detain individuals—including Americans citizens—indefinitely without trial.
The power to strip American citizens of their constitutional rights.The Bush Administration claimed it could strip American citizens of their constitutional rights, imprison them indefinitely, and deny them legal representation simply by labeling them as enemy combatants. While the Obama Administration jettisoned the use of the term “enemy combatant,” it has persisted in defending the president's unilateral and global right to detain anyone suspected of supporting terrorist activities.
The power to secretly rewrite or sidestep the laws of the country.Secret courts, secret orders, and secret budgets have become standard operating procedure for presidential administrations in recent years. A good case in point is Presidential Policy Directive 20, a secret order signed by President Obama as a means of thwarting cyberattacks. Based on what little information was leaked to the press about the clandestine directive, it appears that the president essentially put the military in charge of warding off a possible cyberattack. A FOIA request by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) seeking more details on the directive was allegedly denied because doing so could cause “exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” However, EPIC believes the order allows for military deployment within the United States, including the ability to shut off communications with the outside world if the military believes it is necessary.
The power to transform the police into extensions of the military and indirectly institute martial law. What began in the 1960s as a war on drugs transitioned into an all-out campaign to transform America's police forces into extensions of the military. Every successive president since Nixon has added to the police's arsenal, tactics and authority. In fact, the Obama Administration has accelerated police militarization by distributing military weapons and equipment to police and incentivizing SWAT team raids and heavy-handed police tactics through the use of federal grants and asset forfeiture schemes.
The power to command the largest military and intelligence capabilities in the world and, in turn, “wag the dog.” As law professor William P. Marshall points out:
In his roles as Commander-in-Chief and head of the Executive Branch, the President directly controls the most powerful military in the world and directs clandestine agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. That control provides the President with immensely effective, non-transparent capabilities to further his political agenda and/or diminish the political abilities of his opponents. Whether a President would cynically use such power solely for his political advantage has, of course, been the subject of political thrillers and the occasional political attack. President Clinton, for one, was accused of ordering the bombing of terrorist bases in Afghanistan to distract the nation from the Lewinsky scandal, and President Nixon purportedly used the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate his political enemies. But regardless whether such abuses actually occurred, there is no doubt that control of covert agencies provides ample opportunity for political mischief, particularly since the inherently secretive nature of these agencies means their actions often are hidden from public view. And as the capabilities of these agencies increase through technological advances in surveillance and other methods of investigation, so does the power of the President.
Thus, it doesn't matter what the pundits predict, the candidates promise, and the people decree.
It doesn't even matter whether the people elect Trump or Clinton. After all, politicians sing a different tune once elected. For instance, the Chicago Tribune editorial board observed that although Barack Obama opposed the imperial tendencies of George W. Bush, once in office, Obama “wound up behaving as if he had a scepter and throne.”
What matters is that the damage has already been done.
As Professor Marshall explains, “every extraordinary use of power by one President expands the availability of executive branch power for use by future Presidents.” Moreover, it doesn't even matter whether other presidents have chosen not to take advantage of any particular power, because “it is a President's action in using power, rather than forsaking its use, that has the precedential significance.”
In other words, each successive president continues to add to his office's list of extraordinary orders and directives, granting him- or herself near dictatorial powers.
So let's not have any more talk of which candidate would be moredangerous with these powers.
The fact that any individual—or branch of government—is empowered to act like a dictator is danger enough.
This abuse of presidential powers has been going on for so long that it has become the norm and it will continue no matter which corporate puppet wins the election. The Constitution be damned.
The government of laws idealized by John Adams has fallen prey to a government of men.
As a result, we no longer have a system of checks and balances.
“The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned now lacks effective checks and is no longer in balance,” concludes Marshall. “The implications of this are serious. The Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence. They also believed that, in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure, such ills would inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however, power once taken is not easily surrendered.”
The solution is far from simple but it's time, as Marshall suggests, to recalibrate the balance of power. This will mean putting an end to the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements as a means of getting around Congress and the courts. It will mean that Americans will have to stop letting their politics blind them to government wrongdoing. And it will mean holding all three branches of government accountable to the Constitution (i.e., if they abuse their powers, vote them out of office).
Thus far, Congress, with little spine, less integrity and too busy running for re-election, has offered little attempt at oversight, enabling the president to ride roughshod over the Constitution. The media—the perfect accomplice in this stealthy, bloodless coup—continues to inundate us with the latest celebrity scandal, says virtually nothing about these burgeoning powers. All the while, most Americans continue to operate in blissful near-ignorance, unaware or uncaring that the republic is about to fall.
Yet as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, it will be “we the people”—not the president, the politicians, the corporate elite or the media—who will suffer the consequences when freedom falls and tyranny rises. They may justify violating our freedoms in the name of whatever phantom menace-of-the-month threatens “national security,” but we will always be the ones to pay the price.
Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.
A churning crisis in Spain looks set to reach yet another turning point this weekend, as the cabinet gathers to decide the government's response to Catalonia's push for independence.
Ministers are expected to set the wheels in motion to suspend the autonomy of the wealthy northeastern region, a move not undertaken in the country's last 42 years of modern democracy.
What's the latest? On Saturday, the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy began holding an extraordinary cabinet meeting to decide the measures that may be taken the next few weeks to enact Article 155 of the federal constitution against Catalonia.
Reunido el #CMin extraordinario con el fin de aprobar medidas para restaurar la legalidad en el autogobierno de Cataluña pic.twitter.com/3DWeD5KoWv — Mariano Rajoy Brey (@marianorajoy) October 21, 2017
The move comes after an unauthorized referendum on secession held in the region on Oct. 1. That resulted, in addition to clashes between police and voters, in a strong majority for independence from Spain. After days of back-and-forth over the matter, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont refused to heed the government's warning to back down by Thursday, prompting Rajoy to call the special meeting of ministers.
Article 155 gives the government power to strip powers of autonomy from a region and to take control itself, if certain conditions are met.
If that “nuclear option” is triggered, the consequences could include the dismissal of the Catalan government and new regional elections. On Friday, Spain's main opposition party, the Socialists, said they would support a move by the ruling Popular Party to hold new elections in Catalonia, according to Reuters and other media outlets.
What is the intent of Article 155? Just two paragraphs in Spain's 1978 constitution, the article basically gives the central government the necessary powers to take over a region.
Article 155 is referred to as the “nuclear option” because of its last-ditch nature and politically explosive potential. The provision was put in place as the country made its transition from Franco's dictatorship to democracy. It aimed to help maintain a power balance between the central government in Madrid and its 17 different regions, including Catalonia — “Catalunya,” in the local language
The article simply states that if an autonomous region acts in a manner that has “gravely attacked the general interest of Spain,” the government could adopt measures needed to force the region to comply.
But the government must win approval in the Senate to put such measures in motion, and Rajoy's party holds a slim majority in that chamber. A vote on the matter could take place as early as Saturday, it is believed.
What happens next? If the central government gets approval, that doesn't mean a takeover of Catalonia would be immediate, noted Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at Teneo, in a note. The process by which the government can put Article 155 into effect takes about a month to complete.
Puigdemont said Catalonia will declare independence if the government goes forward with triggering Article 155. “As both sides battle for control of the narrative, there will be no quick resolution to the ongoing standoff between the central government and the Catalan authorities,” said Barroso.
To be clear, not everyone in Catalonia wants separation. There have been pro-unity protests since the referendum, in which 90% voted for independence, but turnout was under 50%.
Puigdemont himself is being pulled in several directions — under pressure from hardliners who want to press ahead with separation, and from others who seek dialogue. The Catalan president has repeatedly asked for dialogue with Madrid, to no avail.
As Barroso theorized, Rajoy may be hoping to drag the situation out for some time. In that way, he could exploit for political advantage the damage occurring on an economic level, as well as emerging fractiousness in Barcelona and throughout Catalonia. Several major companies, prominently banks, have announced their intention to look into, at a minimum, moving headquarters out of the region.
Among items that Rajoy could ask the Senate to vote on Saturday, many believe, is a call for early elections to Catalonia's regional parliament, while others have speculated that he could ask to take control of the local police force there.
Reuters People line up outside a La Caixa bank branch to withdraw money as part of a protest against a move of the bank's HQ out of Barcelona.
What's the atmosphere in the streets? In Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia, as well as in Madrid, protests have been held on both sides of the crisis. Protests in Barcelona have been seen this week over the detention of two political activists arrested by the central government. Madrid has been criticized for its heavy-handed action — via the federal police force — prior to and during the October referendum.
A separatist group in Catalonia was calling for a “run on the banks" on Friday, in which Catalans would withdraw as much as they could from banks that have threatened to pull headquarters out of the region. (Some participants opted to withdraw the symbolic figure of 155 euros, as in Article 155.)
Some separatists are saying they have withdrawn the symbolic amount of €155 from the bank today, in reference to the Article 155 process. https://t.co/3gUnVOuOgq — The Spain Report (@thespainreport) October 20, 2017
A CaixaBank branch tells us it is not likely people are withdrawing €155 from cash machines because they are not loaded with €5 notes. https://t.co/OXRYSBNKGh — The Spain Report (@thespainreport) October 20, 2017
“As far as we can see, the bank run did not have a great success rate. Not too many people participated in the idea. It would be like shooting themselves in the foot, so I guess most people are still reasonable,” said Predrag Dukic, senior equity sales trader at CM Capital Markets in Madrid, in emailed comments.
Dukic said his firm did not forecast any immediate implementation of Article 155, given the procedural requirements. But he added that he didn't expect a “positive surprise,” under which the Rajoy government avoids activating that nuclear option.
Analysts expect only further social unrest if and when Article 155 is put into play.
What's been the reaction?
Spain's IBEX 35 index IBEX, +0.25% has had its ups and downs as the crisis has evolved, most recently drifting between gains and losses on Friday.The euro EURUSD, -0.0966% has also come under pressure as the standoff continued.
“With uncertainty potentially mounting after Spain's government triggers Article 155 this weekend, the euro remains exposed to downside risks,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note to clients on Friday.
“Investors should keep in mind that although the Catalan drama is limited to Spain, it could still spark fears over the rise of other separatist movements in Europe. Such a situation is likely to threaten the stability of the European Union,” Otunuga added.

GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) - About 5,500 more people could survive a major tsunami hitting the Pacific Northwest if they just walk a little faster to higher ground after roads are knocked out, a new study shows.
The report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looked at 73 communities along 700 miles of coastline in Oregon, Washington and Northern California. The area is considered most at risk from the next major earthquake and tsunami in the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where two plates of the Earth's crust come together miles off the coast.
Emergency preparedness experts generally agree that after the quake and tsunami, most roads will be too damaged for driving, so people will have to walk to safety.
Geographers estimated 21,562 residents would not make it to safety if they walk slowly - at about 2.5 mph. But if they walk faster, at about 3.5 mph, the death toll drops to 15,970. About 70 percent of them would be in Washington, nearly 30 percent in Oregon and only 4 percent in California.
The study said people working or staying at motels in the tsunami area also will be at risk, but it didn't say how many. It also noted where communities have dependent-care facilities, where residents might have trouble walking.
Lead author Nathan Wood, a geographer for the U.S. Geological Survey in Portland, Oregon, said the findings show tsunami risks are a public health issue as well as an emergency preparedness issue. Promoting healthy lifestyles that help people walk faster would save lives.
Wood added the study provides the most detailed look yet at tsunami risks, and should help in planning evacuation strategies and educating the public.
"People kind of know that Ocean Shores and Long Beach, Washington, and Seaside, Oregon, have issues" because higher ground is too far to walk in the time before a tsunami hits, he said.
"What we wanted to show is that all the communities have issues from Cascadia, but they are different issues," Wood said.
The Cascadia Subduction Zone runs offshore from Cape Mendocino, California, to Vancouver Island, B.C. It is the place where the rocky plate underneath the Pacific Ocean pushes under North America. On average, it breaks loose every 300 to 600 years, and it last released 315 years ago, generating a magnitude-9 earthquake and a tsunami that washed away houses in Japan.
After feeling the quake, people in the tsunami area have about 15 minutes to reach higher ground before a wall of water 30 to 40 feet high washes ashore.
Althea Rizzo of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management said the study offered the best look yet at how many people might be in the highest-risk tsunami zones.
"Most of our evacuation modeling is based on an average," she added. "Nate's work gives us a better look at how different speeds (of walking) affect survivability.
"It really gives the individual a lot of information about how to survive these types of events."
The study also provides better information to look at which communities might consider strategies like vertical evacuation, where buildings or mounds of earth are constructed as places to escape the tsunami, said John Schelling, earthquake, tsunami and volcanoes program manager for Washington Emergency Management.
Schelling noted Ocasta Elementary School south of Westport, Washington, is building a new gymnasium tall enough for the roof to serve as a tsunami evacuation structure. Pacific County is seeking a grant to build a large berm next to Long Beach Elementary School for the same purpose.
The study said evacuation training might be the focus for Aberdeen, Washington, and Eureka, California, which have the highest numbers of people in tsunami zones, but they have time to reach safety. Vertical evacuation structures might be considered in Ocean Shores, Long Beach and Pacific County, Washington, and Seaside, Oregon, because many people in those cities lack enough time to reach safety.

The words “outsourcing” or “virtual assistants” don't sit well with the majority of people.
That's no surprise provided that most of us have had a really bad experience trying to find even one person who is reliable and willing to help our business grow, let alone a team of them. We've all found that person who seems pretty skilled but one day they just don't show up, never to be heard from again. You've probably tried several solutions, looked in various places… only to end up with the same lackluster results.
But I'm here to tell you that there is a solution. I've been able to build three (3) multi-million dollar businesses with outsourced teams, and in this post, I'm going to lay out exactly how we do it the right way.
The truth is that there are millions of people all over the world who are incredibly skilled and willing to work for rates that you can afford. When done right, you can have a team (small or large) of highly-skilled, trained pros cranking on your business while you are sleeping.
Over the years, I've hired around 30 virtual assistants and, historically, the success rate has been about 50%. I've had my fair share of failures. However, at this point, I've got a process where the success rate is getting closer to around 90%.
Sounds good? Read on to learn how we do it.
Let's start at the beginning.
Why you need a virtual assistant
Most people hear the term “virtual assistant” or “VA” and they think this is about hiring someone to help with tasks like email handling, scheduling meetings, etc. I do that stuff myself. Instead, when I hear the term “virtual assistant,” I think marketing, customer support, design, SEO, and outreach.
Email handling and scheduling are not repeatable tasks in my world. Most of them require direct answers from me to my contractors or to real people looking for a real response from me. I don't know how I could outsource that.
What I do know how to outsource are repeatable processes in my business that produce ROI and growth. Here are the way the numbers break down:
We pay on average $4 USD/hour for our virtual assistants whom we typically hire full-time and who are mostly based in the Philippines.
$4 an hour * 8 hours a day = $32 a day.
CLV of a client at Hubstaff is over $500.
$32 per day * 20 working days in a month = $640.
So if each VA can get Hubstaff 1.28 ($640/ $500) paying clients per month we are at breakeven, not taking any viral growth into account.
So the takeaway here is that we are using VA's for marketing and support related tasks that help us grow profitably (support is a growth channel at Hubstaff).
Outsourcing is not just about getting your email and scheduling done. It's about running and growing your business at scale.
What tasks can a VA do?
Virtual assistants are best suited for tasks that can be blueprinted and done on a repeatable basis. I believe that almost anything can be blueprinted given enough effort (OK, maybe without scheduling and answering emails).
At Hubstaff, we have process maps and blueprints for the majority of marketing and support functions our team performs. These include:
Obtaining feedback from customers upon cancelation and organizing the data
Creating blog images and infographics
Answering customer support questions
Finding potential clients to reach out to
Adding comments to relevant conversations online (producing traffic and links)
Creating support articles
Minor video editing
Content recycling (creating graphics, slideshares, video, etc. out of existing content)
Any kind of research (finding potential clients, Twitter accounts, any kind of lists, keyword research)
The great part is that, in most cases, the same person can do all of the above so there is very little downtime for each virtual assistant. We keep all the documentation and tasks a VA can work on in a Trello board. We let VAs know what the main priority is and then allow them to work on any of the items they want after their main job is done.
For example, we will tell a VA that their primary job is support and that if a support question comes in they need to get on that question immediately. If there are no support questions in the queue, then they can take their pick of the extra tasks to work on. This has the effect of giving each person plenty to work on, but also mixes things up a bit so that they stay happy working for us.
The key thing here is that you can't just say, “I need you to do keyword research.” They generally need an exact process to follow. This means documenting in very clear terms how you define success and how to perform the process in a step-by-step manner.
We do this through blueprinting.
Blueprinting and processes make it possible
The bad experiences I mentioned in the opening paragraph above happen for one of 2 reasons in most cases:
Poor skills on the VA side Poor blueprinting and documentation on the management side
Blueprinting and documentation should be done before finding the VA so that you can confirm you have the right person who can complete the tasks.
Our hiring process involves what we call “assigning test tasks” and we find it that to do this trial effectively, we need to have a blueprint for the task at hand.
For example, here's an example of a live testing document that our team used to vet two different support agents. When we go through this process, we are looking at the general quality of the answer, the ability to solve the user's problem, and the level of English.
Support is a little different because all we have to do is take real questions that we are asked in our support system (in a Google doc so that we don't need to provide live access to our tools), provide them with training on how to answer the questions, and then let them do it in the Google doc.
Here's what the beginning of our support document looks like:
If you are hiring for marketing, the process would be similar. You would have a process document for a particular task, say finding and reaching out to potential clients that fit your customer persona. Then you would have the agents start to go through the process of finding potential fits, and then you could even have them start reaching out to these leads.
Note that we usually test two or three people for each position and then choose the best. Many times what seems like the best fit in the interview will not be the best fit when it comes to getting work done. I would say that more than 40% of the time this is the case.
When developing the blueprint for a process, it's important to document 100% of what needs to be done from the contractor's perspective. This includes login information for the tools they need to use, recorded videos of how to complete the process, examples of what you consider success and anything else the team member needs to complete the process from start to finish.
The cool thing about developing these blueprints is that you can take a first shot at completing them, and then give a contractor the ability to go through the process. Ask them to make comments in the Google document when they have questions (this means that your process doc was not clear enough). Instead of just answering in the form of a comment, simply adjust the process document so that it clearly answers the question. Now have them go through the process until they can get through it 100% from start to finish.
Now you're ready to scale the process. Select the VA that you feel the most comfortable with and hire them full-time (8 hours a day). The key is that since you now have a process document that clearly documents success, any shortfallings should be on the contractor. You cannot judge the quality of the contractor's work until you have a process for them to follow, but once you do have that process and they've confirmed they understand it, it's on them to complete it consistently.
How to find great virtual assistants
Now that you have the documentation for a specific task (or several tasks preferably) laid out, the next step is to find someone to do the work.
It's important to have the documentation done first because it provides a very easy way for you to write a job ad to post on one of the freelancing sites or to describe the work that needs to be done to the people you'll be interviewing.
Here's a quick list of where you can find virtual assistants / marketers to work for your company:
Hubstaff Talent – this is a completely free directory, which we created with the aim of connecting the best talent in the worls with the most interesting projects
Google search – a simple google search for ‘virtual assistant firms in the Philippines' for example can lead you to potential partners or help you get an idea about market rates and other critical information.
Linkedin – Here's a search you can do on Linkedin:
If you have the premium account it's easy to contact people. You can reach out and ask about rates, describe what tasks you need help with, and so on. If you do not have a premium account, it's a bit trickier, but still doable. You can proactively ask to connect with people, use the invitation to include a short message about the purpose of your request (you would like to work with them). You can also message your 1st connections and in addition, many of the profiles have other accounts listed on LinkedIn (twitter and personal blogs).
AngelList – We've had great luck on AngelList posting positions and starting conversations with marketing and development pros
Freelancer
Virtual Staff Finder is a service founded and run by Chris Ducker that helps with finding VA's from the Philippines. They have a structured process for sourcing, interviewing, and hiring workers. They charge $300 per staff member hired
Outsourcely – Probably the easiest platform to find talent by skill or skill rating and immediately start a conversation with them. Best of all Outsourcely allows you to hire workers directly and pay them directly. Outsourcely does not charge any fees.
Facebook groups – Another great place to look for team members. In the past, I've found the groups for entrepreneurs and/or marketers to be a great place to post that you're looking to hire. On top of those who reach out to apply directly, recommendations by previous employers can be a great way to find team members.
We did an in-depth post on how we find and recruit virtual talent. In summary, we look equally for specific personality types and the skills that we need. To pass our screening process, a hiree needs to be a fit for the team personality-wise first, and then they must pass our skills requirements. The two very much go hand in hand.
Managing your Virtual Assistant
The final piece after you've documented the tasks and you've found a few people to test is to manage the work they do. Naturally, we do this through Hubstaff, but there are other options.
No matter which solution you choose, the important part is that you collect:
The hours that your team spends working
What projects they are working on
Automatic updates of what your team is doing
You need to gather this information because the work for virtual assistants should be hourly instead of on a full-time basis. Having access to this data not only ensures that you only pay for the work completed, but it also makes it easy to understand what to pay your team because the hours are there at a fingertip, and it helps you understand what was actually worked at at a glance. Here's a screenshot of the data captured by Hubstaff:
Here are some of the frequently used tools that gather this data for you:
Hubstaff ($5 or $10 per user flat depending on what you need to track) Time worked, screenshots, websites visited, applications used, integrations with your project management software, automatic payments to your team
Upwork (10% of payroll) Time worked, screenshots, automatic payments to your team, find workers
Harvest ($10 per user flat) Time worked, invoicing, integrations with project management software. You won't get screenshots and monitoring with these solutions but some companies are not looking for those features.
Outsourcing can make or break your business
It is really hard to make outsourcing work if you don't have a structured approach to follow. The one I shared with you in this article is what I learned and developed thanks to my experience as a remote entrepreneur. Getting it right is what has allowed me to grow my businesses and I believe this can also be the case for you.
If you have any questions about outsourcing and hiring VAs, please don't hesitate to post them in the comments section – I would be happy to answer them. I would also love to hear about your experience with hiring virtual assistants – what was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?

The big summer sports stories involving Ray Rice, Tony Stewart and LeBron James aren't surrendering their hold on pop culture.
In a new cypher to support “Shady XV,” Eminem manages to touch on all three in his lyrics (see the full NSFW video here). James gets off easiest of the three after leaving the Miami Heat to join his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow, it's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul cuz … I'm thinking about should be illegal. I need my headband like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio and went to South Beach with his talents, screamed [expletive] you on the way out and winked with a smile.
He uses the incident in which Rice knocked out his then-fiancee Janay Rice in an elevator to take a verbal swing at Lana Del Rey:
But I may fight for gay rights specially if they …, its more of a knockout than Janay Rice, play nice … I'll punch Lana Del Rey right in the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight, in plain sight of the elevator surveillance till the head is banged on the railing and then celebrate with the Ravens.
And then there's Stewart, who was cleared of wrongdoing after he drove over a driver who was walking on the track during a race:
The new paint job on Prime Minister Stephen Harper's plane won't be cost neutral after all.
Repainting the grey Polaris CC-150 military aircraft, red, white and blue, will cost taxpayers an additional $50,000, The Huffington Post Canada has learned.
Although officials in the Prime Minister's Office and at National Defence pledged for more than two years that the move would be cost neutral, the price of the schematic, the large stencil used to paint designs on the plane and the coloured paint drove the cost up.
The final design, by Royal Canadian Air Force graphic designer Jim Belliveau, features a white plane with a blue underbelly, a thin red swoosh line above it. The words: “Government of Canada, Gouvernement du Canada'” are printed above the passenger windows separated by a small maple leaf.

Under the window of the cockpit, in italicized script, are the words: “True North Strong and Free” and “Une épopée des plus brilliants exploits” in French. There is a flag on the front door next to Canada's coat of arms and the RCAF logo near the back of the plane. The white tail, which has a thick blue line and thin red line, features a large drawing of the Canadian flag and its military identifier number 150001.
The design is less labour intensive than others Belliveau suggested, but he did warn government officials the cost of the paint job would make a substantial dent in the budget.
“FYI, there is about a 400 dollar price difference PER GALLON in the cost of red paint versus the cheaper blue. Yellow or orange are up there too,” he warned at one point, according to documents released under Access to Information.
Harper's office had insisted there would be no additional cost to repaint the Airbus, regardless of the design, and that any paint job would be cost-neutral.
“As we have consistently said, any change would only be contemplated if it were cost neutral, and performed as part of DND's regular maintenance cycle,” Harper's spokesman Andrew MacDougall told HuffPost last summer.
The Airbus is currently undergoing routine maintenance. It went in for servicing on Jan. 26 and was scheduled to be repainted regardless of the new design. The new paint job should be finished by May, but it's unclear when Canadians will have their first peek.
Top staffers in the Prime Minister's office have been working on changing the colour of the utilitarian-looking Airbus for several years. They battled National Defence officials who argued the Airbus should be kept grey for safety purposes during military operations. The government insists the white plane will still be used for military operations and that the paint job will have no impact on DND's operations.
The prime minister's Airbus is a thirty-year-old aircraft used to transport the prime minister, Governor General and other dignitaries, such as the Queen and Will and Kate when they honeymooned in Canada in 2011.
A senior government official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Airbus' new design will return the prime minister's aircraft to its traditional paint scheme.
“This decision is consistent with past Canadian practices and will better promote Canada's image at home and abroad,” the official said. The cost of repainting the Airbus aircraft is “modest,” and represents only 2 per cent of the total maintenance cost, according to the official.
HuffPost has also learned the federal government believes it will save $3.5 million by retiring four of the six challenger jets used by the prime minister, the Governor General and top military brass. The government says cabinet ministers do not use the jets as often as in the past, flying commercial instead, and that the planes are no longer needed
“Our Government has reduced average annual spending on ministers' use of challenger flights by over 80% compared to the previous Liberal government,” the official said.
In a likely effort to win over her rival's supporters, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rolled out a tuition-free public college proposal before a campaign stop Wednesday in Atlantic City.
While Clinton has maintained a promise throughout her campaign to make public college debt-free if elected president, her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, has taken the idea one step further by vowing to make all public colleges tuition-free.
“[Sanders has] pretty clearly said in interviews that he is interested in seeing some progress on this topic.”
[RELATED: Clinton proposes $350 billion plan for ‘debt-free' college]
Now, following a meeting between the two candidates last month in Washington, CBS News reports that Clinton has adopted a variation of her staggering opponent's tuition-free college proposal, adding it to the existing elements of her approach.
Under Clinton's revised plan, prospective students from families with an annual income of $85,000 or less would be exempt from paying tuition at in-state public colleges or universities, a campaign aide told CBS. Over the next four years, the income requirement would increase by $10,000 annually, with that number capping out $125,000 by 2021.
Sanders has estimated that his tuition-free plan would cost $750 billion over a 10-year period, while Clinton has estimated that her debt-free plan would cost $350 billion over 10 years, but the Clinton campaign has yet to indicate where her revised proposal might fall on that spectrum.
"American families are drowning in debt caused by ever-rising college costs," Clinton said in a statement Wednesday. "It is imperative that the next president put forward a bold plan to make debt-free college available to all. My New College Compact will do just that—by making sure that working families can send a child or loved one to college tuition-free and by giving student debt-holders immediate relief."
Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Sanders praised the move as “very, very significant” and a “revolutionary step forward,” but continued to refrain from offering any sort of endorsement, even though Clinton has all but clinched the nomination.
[RELATED: Sanders says Clinton's tuition-free college plan is too complicated]
The Wall Street Journal reports that Sanders is holding off on an endorsement until he sees Clinton come around on issues such as healthcare.
“He's pretty clearly said in interviews that he is interested in seeing some progress on this topic [college costs] and on health care,” spokesman Michael Briggs told The Journal.
Clinton's modified education proposal also includes a promise of “immediate” executive action to provide all indebted graduates with a three-month moratorium to sort out their repayment plans, as well as to restore Pell Grant funding for summer classes.
A Clinton aide did not respond to inquiries from The Journal about how much her new plan would cost or how she plans to pay for it.

Shrine Preface
Although I am a magician of some power, Apprentice, I have seen things that even I can not understand.
I was in the Arcanum Majoris, browsing a less travelled corner of the spell library when I saw a door open to the right of me and a strange trio enter its inviting portal. They were of a race I was not aware of. They had large twisted horns and radiated an aura of power. But this was not the beings that confused me, it was the portal itself for beyond it was not the archives I knew to be there, but a grand stair made of oak enclosed and stretching up as if the library were but a landing on its journey.
I immediately stood and ran for the door. Something told me that if I let it close this vision would be gone forever. I made it just in time and as I slipped through the portal, pulling close the door beside me I heard the travelers moving up the stair and so I followed them. I cast the spell that allowed me to understand their language but it did not work! The only time that spell had ever failed me. Their language was rough, barbaric even but they spoke in such an assured and confident way.
I must say that I was so perplexed with the failure of the spell that I did not notice when the oak stair in a comfortable corridor turned into a stone stair twisting its way across the air from one mountaintop to another! Yes, as I said, I have seen things I do not understand. I also failed to notice that the trio ahead of me had stopped and I almost ran into them. They snarled at me and looked at me as if I were some kind of ant under their heel, but they did not strike out. One at a time each of them leapt so far, high into the air to land on a central dais with a lonely enclosed shrine.
I was shocked to finally see my surroundings! I stood on a circular plateau of grass, surrounded with the tops of trees, for I saw no trunks and assumed them to be lower than this area. The centre was dominated by a set of stones, expertly chosen to fit together in a large square with each stone perfectly placed in what seemed to be an Obsidian square of immense size. At the centrer of the square was a much smaller circular dais of granite. It was perhaps twenty feet across and made of a grey hard rock I have never found again in my travels. Atop this sat a strange little shrine, square and enclosed, but on each 10′ wall, sitting centrally was a door. Each door was fashioned differently though surely it could only enter the one room.
The trio of travelers had each leaped straight to the central dais without setting a foot on the central stones. The leap was at least thirty foot from the top of the stair and twenty feet up. I marvelled at these creatures strength and yet unsure of why they stood there and shook arms as if they were parting. Unsure, for each then turned and entered the shrine via a different door, but surely they met in the middle.
I was perplexed of course, and being inquisitive I ran toward them. Each step that landed on the stones of the central square played a different note and a cacophony of sounds scared strangely plumed birds from the tree tops. I ran up a stair to the central dais and pulled at the handle of a door but it would not budge. I spoke the words of the spell that would open it and yet again it would not budge. I would have investigated further but I had awoken the guardians of the shrine.
Being alone here and a scholar rather than a fighter I fled. I heard the guardians behind me but I had to run. I saw the stone stair continued on the far side and I ran, never looking back for fear of being caught. One day I hope to find that stair again, Apprentice if you ever find mention of it in your readings you will find me, no matter if I am dead or alive, and satisfy my curiosity.
Pathfinder Encounters: Shrine on the Stair (CR 1)
This encounter offers you the ability to add it into any campaign as a side quest. A player may notice a door closing that leads to an area they know it did not lead to before and it places them on a Grand Stair filled with strange and powerful vistas. The shrine in the center is indeed as described in the flavour text and the walls around the door have scripts of varying languages written there. The writing can be deciphered if you wish to add clues to locations that each door leads to. You may also have the players able to open the doors or have them tantalizingly shut fast with attractive locales behind each. Perhaps doors that they can open later when they are a greater level.
The center square appears to be a glass like obsidian substance with a number of stones of varying size and type inserted into it. Every time that a PC steps on this area it makes a different musical tone as the stone shifts against its encasing glass like obsidian around it. Normally this offers a cacophany of varying sound but a bard may use any musical instrument perform based skill (apart from singing) to actually perform a pleasant melody which will in fact appease the guardians. The music is what alerts the guardians of the shrine to intrusion and it takes them 10 rounds (1 minute to arrive).
The guardians are in fact four monkeys that see the shrine as their home. Nothing more than that. Regular travelers of the stair know this and respect the monkey's territory in as much as they try to avoid making them climb the (exceptionally) tall trees that they spend much of their time into. The monkeys can come from any one tree or any number of trees (up to 4 for 1 per guardian) as you see fit. Have fun with the monkeys. Play up their hooting and noises as they run to harass the PC's! Stats come from the Pathfinder PRD site.

June is Pride Month — and while it's certainly a time to celebrate and reflect on the progress made in LGBTQ rights and visibility over the last several decades, it's also a time to raise awareness about how greatly LGBTQ people are still threatened the world over. And unfortunately, 2017 hasn't exactly been a banner year for LGBTQ rights thus far. While Taiwan's forthcoming legalization of same-sex marriage marks a watershed moment for LGBTQ rights in Asia, there is a climate of rising oppression elsewhere. While greater LGBTQ representation in media and vigorous activism around the world may make many of us believe that LGBTQ rights are a settled issue, that's actually quite far from the truth — and threats to rights and wellbeing vary greatly depending on where in the world you're standing.
The world remains, on the whole, a place where LGBTQ people must fight constantly for personal rights, freedoms and acceptance. Even many highly publicized progressive moments don't actually yield much fruit when it comes to real advances in rights; for instance, while Pope Francis said in 2016 that gay people should be "accepted and embraced" by Catholics, he has still continued to advocate against teaching about LGBTQ issues in schools. Elsewhere in the world, religious beliefs and personal prejudice continue to make living life openly as an LGBTQ person difficult, and, in some cases, extremely dangerous. It's important that as we celebrate at Pride marches and drape ourselves in our best rainbow finery, we also take in the worldwide picture and make ourselves into activists as well as partiers.
So how can you help? Spread the word, stay aware, and donate to organizations that do work to help LGBTQ activists worldwide. The Human Rights Campaign often focuses on the US, while Amnesty International, the ILGA, Human Rights Watch and specific national organizations work in other countries to help fight discrimination and protect vulnerable LGBTQ people.
Indonesia: Raids On Gay Men Are Legally Permitted In Some Regions As CNN reported, Indonesia has seen a rapid change in its attitudes towards LGBT people in the past 18 months, with a sudden rise in imprisonments and anti-gay violence. One of the most upsetting and widely reported incidents involved the public caning of two men allegedly caught having sex; the caning was staged in front of a crowd and filmed. The province of Aceh, in which the caning occurred, is one of the biggest flashpoints for violence in the area, with vigilantes empowered by the police to "raid" areas looking for gay men; these kinds of actions are permitted by local law. However, the capital of Jakarta is also seeing a big shift, with a recent raid arresting 114 men at a gay sauna.
China: An LGBTQ Event Was Cancelled, With Organizers Detained Under Questionable Circumstances In China, the news of Taiwan's LGBT rights victory brought hope to activists, and there have been some small triumphs — but it remains a problematic place for LGBTQ people in many ways. Homosexuality was only removed from the nation's official list of psychological conditions in 2001, and he "conversion industry," where Chinese families pay for their children and relatives to be "converted to straightness" using occasionally brutal methods including beatings and electroshock therapy, is a huge business. However, in the past decade or so, there have been some moves forward; some transgender celebrities have managed to make a splash in the media, and there's a rise in the number of LGBTQ discrimination cases being heard by courts, even if they don't win. However, all is not well; a big LGBTQ event due to be held in Xi'an in May was cancelled and the nine organizers arrested under spurious charges. They were only let go after they gave up their mobile phones and the contact details of all the speakers at the event.
WASHINGTON — The still-emerging Tea Party movement is not merely waging war against the Republican establishment this year. Some of its more heated disputes are coming from within.
That struggle is playing out vividly in Nebraska, which will hold a Republican Senate primary on Tuesday between former State Treasurer Shane Osborn and Ben Sasse, the president of Midland University.
Mr. Osborn, who has the support of activists in the state, secured a major endorsement last November from FreedomWorks, the organization that helped vault the Tea Party to prominence. Mr. Osborn, the group said, stood “with the grass-roots uprising before it was cool.” But in March, FreedomWorks rescinded its support of Mr. Osborn and backed Mr. Sasse.
Ever since, Nebraska's Tea Party members have been battling national Tea Party donor groups.
“We are not million-dollar Washington, D.C., special interest groups with strong ties to Capitol Hill. We are simply Nebraskans who are fed up,” a group of 52 activists wrote in an open letter protesting FreedomWorks's about-face, adding, “We were not consulted, polled, or contacted by these Washington, D.C., groups.”
0 Ross Harris sentenced to life in prison in son's hot car death
COBB COUNTY, Ga. - A Cobb County father who intentionally left his son to die in a hot SUV will spend the rest of his life in prison.
A judge sentenced Ross Harris, 36, to life without parole plus 34 years, but he will get credit for the two years he has already served.
[READ: DA says life sentence is justice for Cooper Harris]
Last month, a jury convicted Harris on eight counts: malice murder, two counts of felony murder, cruelty to children in the first degree, cruelty to children in the second degree, criminal attempt to commit a felony, to wit; sexual exploitation of children and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors.
Sentencing breakdown:
Count 1 - Life without parole
Count 4 - 20 years to serve
Count 6 - 10 years to serve
Count 7- 12 months to serve
Count 8 - 12 months to serve
Harris left his 22-month-old son, Cooper, inside his car for nearly seven hours outside his Cobb County office building in June 2014. The toddler died of hyperthermia.
“(This was) a horrendous, horrific experience for this 22-month-old child who had been placed in the trust of his father and in violation and dereliction of duty to that child, if not love of that child, callously walked away and left that child in a hot car in June in Georgia in the summer to swelter and die," Judge Mary Staley said in court Monday.
Police were suspicious from the start and took Harris into custody in the strip mall parking lot where he had pulled over and removed his son's lifeless body from the SUV. Harris' defense attorneys argued that he was a loving father and that while he was responsible for the boy's death, it was a tragic accident.
"I went back and reviewed your statements to police and your statements to your wife when you were taken into custody. And it stood out to me that both of those you took the occasion to express your wish that you would be an advocate so that people would never do this again to their children. And I would say, perhaps not in the way that you intended, that you have in fact accomplished that goal," Staley told Harris after reading the sentence.
Harris' defense team vowed after the trial to appeal the verdict and to seek a new trial.
THE DEATH
Cooper died after sitting for about seven hours in the back seat of his father's vehicle outside the office where Harris worked in suburban Atlanta on a day when temperatures reached at least into the high 80s.
Harris said he forgot to drop his son off at day care that morning, driving straight to his job as a web developer for Home Depot, not remembering that Cooper was still in his car seat.
Investigators found evidence that Harris was engaging in online flirting and in-person affairs with numerous women other than his wife, including a prostitute and an underage teenager. They concluded that Harris intentionally killed his son to escape the responsibilities of family life.
THE TRIAL
Harris' case received an enormous amount of media attention from the very beginning.
After determining during nearly three weeks of jury selection in April that pretrial publicity had made it too difficult to find a fair jury in Cobb County, where the boy died, Superior Court Judge Mary Staley granted a defense request to relocate the trial.
RELATED CONTENT:
A jury in Glynn County, located on the Georgia coast about 60 miles south of Savannah, spent about a month listening to evidence in the case and deliberated for four days before finding him guilty last month of all eight counts against him. In addition to malice murder and felony murder charges, Harris also was found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and sending her nude photos.
Jury selection began in Glynn County in September and a jury was seated in less than two weeks. The trial began on Oct. 3.
After 22 days of testimony and 70 witnesses, 52 for the state and 18 for the defense, the jury began its deliberations.
DAILY SUMMARY STORIES:
LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE
Jurors found Harris guilty of malice murder, which means they believed not only that he should be held criminally responsible for his son's death, but that he left the young boy die on purpose. Malice murder carries a sentence of life in prison. The state recommended Harris not be given the opportunity for parole and the judge agreed.
In 2014, the state announced it would not seek the death penalty against Harris.
“After reviewing Georgia's death penalty statute and considering other factors, the State will not seek the death penalty in this case at this time. I cannot and will not elaborate at this juncture of the case," Cobb District Attorney Vic Reynolds said in a statement.
We will stream sentencing LIVE on WSBTV.com/Ross-Harris-Trial. There you can also find minute-by-minute coverage as well as a daily summary from each day of the trial. Like Ross Harris Updates on Facebook and follow @RossHarrisTrial on Twitter for updates.

It has been a little over a week since we lost transgender lesbian activist Leslie Feinberg to a long battle with Lyme Disease. In the last few days, our team has talked a lot about what Feinberg's work meant to us as we wrestled with our own ideas about the spectrum of sex and gender, and about how those ideas have manifested themselves in our identities today. It is truly remarkable how many queer women were fully emotionally and intellectually transformed by reading Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues at formative moments in their lives. We hope you'll share your feelings with us, too!
It seems cheesy to say that Leslie Feinberg changed my life but ze did. The nuance and aplomb with which ze approached gender makes my daily living feel valid and strong. Whether it was the semi-fictional Stone Butch Blues or the accessible academia of Transgender Warriors, I have embraced Feinberg's writing in ways that have made me both cry and cry “yes!” Ze has never shied away from complication and imperfection and I have appreciated that as much as Feinberg's brilliance.
I'm not a good decision maker. I think and overthink every tiny decision I make from what ice cream flavor to order to whether to buy that new pair of shoes (usually yes in that case) to what tattoo to put on my body forever more. So when it comes to my gender identity it's been something I've been thinking about for over half my life. I have questioned who I am and who I want to be since I first met other trans youth nearly 20 years ago at age 13 or 14. And, I'm not sure quite how to express this, but in some ways I am still not sure.
It's not that I don't know who I am. I am quite secure in who I am. It might not make sense to anyone else. And I might change my mind some day about what pronouns I may go by, what hormones I add to my chemical composition, what surgeries may be important for me to feel like my body is my own. Feinberg also doesn't always make sense to others. I, myself, was confused by the term “transgender lesbian” when I first heard it because it can mean something very different to others that apply the label to themselves. But according to Feinberg we can all live in our own definitions.
Feinberg's bravery, humor, kindness, articulate allowance for for intersectionality, love and acceptance has allowed me to live, to be me.
Feinberg has said that pronouns are important to hir but that at the same time respect can come even from someone that falters with language and disrespect even from someone saying just the right thing.
This resonates especially with me. I have been heard saying that I don't care what pronouns the world uses for me, and on a simplistic level I don't. But I do care that people care about each other and what matters to each of us. I tend to use female pronouns for ease of use but also because I feel that it is important to promote and default to that which is female in this world that so often degrades and downplays all that is female. It's my own tiny, private war against the patriarchy. And Leslie Feinberg is the kind of person that would have understood and supported that.
Feinberg's last words were “Remember me as a revolutionary communist.” That is a level of badass I can't even begin fathom. I'm not that badass. My last words are most likely to be something akin to, “I'm scared.” But Feinberg's insane courage in this world and entering the next, has allowed me to be brave at least in this life. Feinberg's bravery, humor, kindness, articulate allowance for intersectionality, love and acceptance has allowed me to live, to be me. Feinberg will not only be missed but will be thought of every day as I move through this world as a nonconforming individual, as an activist just for being myself. I, like many people, owe my very existence to Feinberg others like hir.
Leslie, you have given me strength; you have given me voice; you have given me life, and I will hold space for you in my heart, and my head, for the rest of that life. I only hope that we can continue to do you proud as we struggle with how to move forward without you.
The first girl I loved gave me a Bible. The second girl I loved gave me a copy of Stone Butch Blues. You can guess which one changed my life forever. (The second one.) Growing up in rural Georgia in the '80s and '90s, my understanding of gender was girls in pink dresses on one side and boys in blue suits on the other and anything else was just weird and wrong. I was weird, weird, weird and wrong, wrong, wrong. People coughed “butch” at me on the school bus and “dyke” at me on the basketball court and “lesbian” in church and sang “Walk Like a Man” at me when I walked down the hallway. The message wasn't coded; I was an outcast.
Leslie Feinberg introduced me to a whole new world, where gender wasn't a set of poles with a minefield in the middle, or a mind game of black and white. Leslie Feinberg was like a prism in the sunshine, showing me gender as a cacophony of color, the “poetry each of us makes out of the language we are taught.” Feinberg's writing and lived example taught me that my masculine leanings weren't things I should hide or be ashamed of, that gender wasn't something I was, but something I could choose to do, however I wanted.
Leslie Feinberg was like a prism in the sunshine, showing me gender as a cacophony of color, the “poetry each of us makes out of the language we are taught.”
When I was a little kid, my wonderful grandma bought me a beautiful, frilly, lacy dress to wear for Christmas, but I didn't want to wear it. I never wanted to wear dresses. They made me feel like I was trying to live my life in someone else's skin. My parents yelled, they spanked me, they forced me into that dress — but my grandma said, “No, honey, take that off and wear what you want. You should look like you.” This summer, at my dad's third wedding, I wore a suit and bowtie. When my grandma saw me in it, she smiled so big and wrapped me up in a giant hug and said, “That's my girl.”
It made me think about Feinberg. So many things make me think about Feinberg. I thought about how ze said, “You're more than just neither, honey. There are other ways to be than either-or. It's not so simple. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who don't fit.” And I realized choosing not to fit actually is what made me fit, and I never would have had the courage (or knowledge) to do it without hir.
I was a junior in college when we brought Leslie Feinberg to speak at our campus. A small group of student leaders from the Rainbow Alliance and Women's Center, including my future partner, went out to dinner with Leslie before hir talk. We filled a small wood-paneled banquet room at Canale's, one of the few semi-fancy restaurants in our small, working-class college town.
I honestly hadn't read any of Feinberg's books yet and I didn't know much about hir. It was later, when ze spoke about hir intersectional theory of trans liberation, that I became a Feinberg convert. I doubt Leslie remembered any of this, but I remember so much about that night: the way ze spoke truth so effortlessly about the inherent connections between oppression, the need for theory to include the lived experiences of directly affected people, and about radicalizing our understanding of gender. I went on to read all of hir books and became a follower of hir activist work.
I remember so much about that night: the way ze spoke truth so effortlessly about the inherent connections between oppression, the need for theory to include the lived experiences of directly affected people, and about radicalizing our understanding of gender.
My partner, when we got together, brought his own copy of Stone Butch Blues to the relationship. When ze and Minnie (who is a badass in her own right) moved back upstate, I got updates on hir through my Syracuse, NY friends. As a writer, I am so grateful for the literary work Leslie has done, for the words ze leaves that are part of our collective queer and trans history. As an activist, I will strive to live into the values Leslie lived by, to fight for the rights of all, to be a true comrade to other communities, to forge new futures and connections. My heart goes out to Minnie and their chosen family. I hope Minnie knows and Leslie knew that hir legacy will live on in the hearts and minds and actions of the many who were inspired by hir. As ze once said, “Join us in the front ranks. We are marching toward liberation.”

For me, Leslie's book Stone Butch Blues invented butch identity. If I had the word before the book, it was only as a slur, only as something nobody should want to be. If I had the word before Jess's story and her tortured restraint of passionate love, it was only used to describe ugly women, unattractive and unwanted. It wasn't until I read Stone Butch Blues that I realized it described me.
I could feel the power that came from being butch, the paradox of growing up a girl and then becoming the suited partner of a beautiful woman, the torture of being such a social outcast, and the deep craving hunger for being accepted.
I'm not sure I wanted it to, but I knew that it did. That book made me feel exposed, like someone had found me out. Vulnerable, like someone could come along and pluck my heart from my unguarded chest to do with as they pleased. But also, strangely, it made me feel powerful. I could feel the power that came from being butch, the paradox of growing up a girl and then becoming the suited partner of a beautiful woman, the torture of being such a social outcast, and the deep craving hunger for being accepted.
I have heard so many butches cite this book as their coming out root, as finally recognizing who they are by reading Jess's story (Leslie's story), and so many femmes cite this book as finally feeling like they could be queer and crave a masculine partner, or that it's the “heartbreaking holy grail of butch perspective.” They have told me they see themselves in Theresa's butch devotion. For so many of us, Feinberg's book made our secret budding desires make sense.
Read more of Sinclair's thoughts on Leslie Feinberg at Sugarbutch.net.
Like a lot of people I've spoken to about the book over the years, Stone Butch Blues really did change my life when I read it. It's not an exaggeration. It was around the time I started university, I was maybe 18 or 20, a baby butch, finding my feet in a new city and discovering my radical pinko commie leftist feminist politics for the first time. I had never read a book before that so profoundly resonated with me, never felt anything like what I felt reading Leslie's story.
Before I read that book I thought I'd maybe known, but I just didn't know. I didn't know at all.
There were times when it felt like my heart was going to burst right out of my chest. “YES, THAT,” I'd think, heart pounding, practically unable to believe what I was reading. I would be sitting on the bus and start looking around me, suddenly feeling exposed, like everyone else could see inside my soul. Stone Butch Blues made me feel seen for the first time; it brought my own experiences with gender into focus for me and gave me a sense of belonging. And even more than that, it opened my eyes to the brutal struggles that our community faced in the generations before me, that some of us still face now. It filled me with rage and righteous anger and bewilderment and sadness. Before I read that book I thought I'd maybe known, but I just didn't know. I didn't know at all.

The following article about the implications of the cyberattack on Sony — regardless of who the real perpetrators turn out to be — was published recently by the Center for Security Policy.
Warnings of Post-Sony Cyberattacks on U.S. Grid Underscored by Penetration of South Korean Nuclear Plants' Computers
(Washington, DC): In the aftermath of the devastating attacks on Sony Pictures computers, there is a heightened recognition that other information technology systems may be at risk of what President Obama last week depicted as “cyber vandalism.” Others call it an act of war in the new domain known as the cyberbattlespace.
Increasingly, national leaders are recognizing that one of the prime targets for such attacks in the future may be the control systems of the U.S. electric bulk power distribution system, better known as the electrical grid. The salience of those concerns has only been intensified by today's news that computers have been hacked at the company that runs South Korea's nuclear power plants.
A report from Reuters quotes a South Korean specialist in nuclear designs, South Korea University's Su Kune-yull, as saying: “This demonstrated that, if anyone is intent with malice to infiltrate the system, it would be impossible to say with confidence that such an effort would be blocked completely. And a compromise of nuclear reactors' safety pretty clearly means there is a gaping hole in national security.”
The Secure the Grid Coalition — a group of American national security practitioners, scientists and engineers co-chaired by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Clinton Director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey — has long believed that the vulnerabilities of the U.S. grid pose an existential threat to the United States. That is a finding confirmed by no fewer than eleven different studies performed or commissioned by the federal government over the past decade.
Unfortunately, cyberattacks are not the only manner in which large regions of the country could be subjected to disruption or destruction of the electric grid. These include: physical sabotage of the kind seen notably at the PG&E Metcalf Substation outside of San Jose, California on April 16, 2013; the danger of strategic electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strikes involving the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons high above the United States; the use of radio frequency weapons (RFW) to do locally what an EMP would do over large areas, weapons that can be built using readily available hardware or adapted from commercial technology; and naturally occurring intense geomagnetic disturbances (GMD) that produce potentially devastating electromagnetic solar storms.
In connection with the last of these threats, NASA marked last July the second anniversary of a very close call: A so-called Carrington-class GMD missed the earth by one week in the summer of 2012. The NASA press release noted that the probability of such an event hitting us in the next decade was twelve percent.
One of the preeminent leaders in Congress championing corrective measures to protect the nation's grid against EMP and these other hazards is Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ). He appeared today on Secure Freedom Radio, a syndicated talk radio program sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, which also hosts the Secure the Grid Coalition. Congressman Franks' call-to-arms could not be more clear:
There is a moment in the life of nearly every problem when it is big enough to be seen by reasonable people and still small enough to be successfully addressed. Those of us across America live in a time when there still maybe opportunity for the free world to address and mitigate the danger that naturally occurring or weaponized EMP represents to the mechanisms of our civilization. This is our moment.
Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., President of the Center for Security Policy, added:
The vulnerability of America's electric grid is a ticking time-bomb. Our government knows that, if that vulnerability is exploited by enemies or afflicted by space weather, we could experience the end of our nation as we know it. Many of our foes are aware both of the grid's susceptibility to attack and the potentially catastrophic consequences for this country and its people should it happen. Only the public is still largely in the dark about these dangers. If something is not done promptly to rectify this situation, our countrymen and women risk being kept in the dark permanently. We must secure the grid now.
An important step in that direction was the unanimous adoption by the House of Representatives late in the lame duck session of legislation lead-sponsored by Rep. Franks: The Critical Infrastructure Protection Act (H.R. 3410). It would require that: electromagnetic pulse threats — both man-induced and naturally occurring) become the subject of a national planning scenario; research and development into the techniques needed to protect the grid; and a plan to be drafted and presented to Congress for achieving that protection.
Unfortunately, the Senate did not consider this legislation before it recessed, meaning both houses will need to take it up afresh in 2015. There is, however, an evident determination on the part of both the chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), respectively, to do just that early on. The Secure the Grid Coalition stands ready to support that effort.
Secure the Grid Coalition members are available for comment on the electric grid's susceptibility to cyber warfare and other threats — and what needs to be done to protect it against all hazards. More information can be found at www.securethegrid.com.
Lake Hillier is a bubble-gum-pink lake right on the edge of Recherché Archipelago's largest island in Australia. It's literally just a few steps away from a “normal” coloured Southern Ocean, but despite the pressure from its neighbour it refuses to compromise its pink colour. Scientists cannot figure out why Lake Hillier is pink, speculating that it's caused by a reaction of sea salt and sodium bicarbonate (which you know as baking soda), or caused by red halophilic bacteria in the salt crusts. But, it is equally likely that there is a giant underwater strawberry farm.
Farm or not, you're probably just wondering whether or not you can swim in Lake Hillier. Well, good news: as any Aussie will attest, it's really just a salt lake; really salty, but perfectly safe to swim in. At the same time, being Australian toughens one up to swim in just about anything, including molten lava. We were also unable to find any photographs of Aussies swimming in Lake Hillier, but that could be just because they are too tough to swim in a pink lake in the first place. Presumably their only use for this pink lake is to bottle and export it as treatment for non-Australian problems like upset stomachs, nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, and indigestion.
It is often remarked that Americans will elect almost anyone except an atheist. Only one of the 535 members of the current Congress professes to be religiously unaffiliated.
Polls consistently show Americans want their political leaders to be religious. This applies even to the purportedly secularist Democratic Party. Though the figure has been declining, no less than 53% of Democrat supporters still say it is important for their candidate to have strong religious beliefs.
This should be yet another advantage for Hillary Clinton. Of all the qualities she brings to the election race, one of the least-remarked-upon is her religiosity. A lifelong Methodist, she is by all accounts a committed and sincere churchgoer.
The contrast with Donald Trump is stark. He might call himself a Presbyterian, but few can recall seeing Trump in the pews. The twice-divorced casino magnate regularly muddles his scriptural citations. And at one church in Iowa, he almost put money in the communion plate.
Yet here, as elsewhere, the race has defied conventional wisdom. Evangelicals are flocking to the Republican. Meanwhile, the so-called “nones” – those who identify as atheists, agnostic or nothing in particular – are siding with the Democrat.
Religion in the Clinton campaign
Clinton's failure to win over religious voters has not been for lack of trying. At key moments through her career she has spoken openly of her faith. In a 2014 interview, she named the Bible as the biggest influence on her thinking.
At other times Clinton has described the role of theologians such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich in driving her commitment to social justice. Unlike Trump, she knows scripture well enough to impress religiously minded voters at campaign stops. Put simply, she is fluent in religion in a way that her opponent is not.
Furthermore, her campaign has reflected this commitment, even if in a muted tone. Religion was everywhere at the Democratic Convention. The Democratic Faith Council held panels on religion and politics while Catholic nuns drew attention to the problem of social injustice.
Using religiously inflected language, a Protestant minister called on delegates to:
… shock this nation with the power of love.
Vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine spoke at length about his Roman Catholic faith and his missionary work in Central America.
Clinton herself summed up her credo with a Methodist motto:
Do all the good we can, in all the ways we can, for all the people we can.
In the midst of all this God-talk, it was revealed that the Democrat National Committee had been using religion in a more negative way. Hacked emails showed that committee members tried to discredit Bernie Sanders during the primary campaign by drawing attention to his supposed atheism.
Trump and the religious right
In the heady post-convention days, the Democrats dared to dream of peeling off elements of the religious right from their opponents. This dream is now clearly over.
With only a few exceptions, leaders of the religious right have endorsed Trump. One survey from mid-August shows Trump beating Clinton by a margin of 63-17 amongst white religious conservatives.
This has occurred despite the fact that hardly any voters see Trump as particularly religious. During the primary season, only 5% of Republican voters described Trump as “very religious”, compared to 47% for Ben Carson. There is little evidence that Trump's belated attempt at Jesus-speak since then has shifted their opinion.
Explaining this evangelical embrace of Trump might be one of the larger puzzles of this campaign. One solution is that evangelicals have morphed into values voters instead of faith voters. Conservative Christians will now turn out for any candidate offering a return to a past America where discipline and order reigned, and where white lives mattered most.
It helps that Trump has promised the religious right much of what it wants. Under a President Trump, bakers will never be forced to sell wedding cakes to gay couples.
Even more than the plight of pious cake-makers, the religious right has been fretting about an obscure clause in the federal tax code, Section 501 c(3). Passed in 1954 at the urging of Senator Lyndon Johnson, the clause bans tax-exempt organisations such as churches from overtly supporting candidates for political office. Become too partisan, and you start paying tax.
Trump has promised to rescind this troubling restraint on religious freedom.
The times they are a-changin'
In the end, the fact that so much of the religious vote will go to the obviously less religious candidate says a lot about this race.
For much of the right, dislike of Clinton outweighs everything else. At the same time, very few appear to believe her when she talks about her faith.
The religious vote is typical in another way as well. Just as growing racial diversity has helped the Democrats, a steady decline in religiosity amongst young Americans might be having the same effect.
The latest survey shows the number of young Americans who are religiously unaffiliated is on the rise. Only 27% of young millennials (born 1990-1996) attend a weekly religious service compared to 51% of the so-called “silent generation” (born 1928-45).
Clinton has tried to win over the faith community. But if the trend towards a less religious America continues, future Democrat candidates may not even need to bother.
Some craters and other surface features spotted on Pluto by NASA's New Horizons probe in 2015 may end up bearing the name of "Star Trek" characters, as this screenshot from a Google+ Hangout demonstrates.
While the naming gods have swatted away an attempt to christen one of Pluto's newfound moons "Vulcan," the "Star Trek" universe may still leave its mark on the dwarf planet soon enough.
After NASA's New Horizons spacecraft gets the first up-close views of Pluto in 2015, craters, mountains and other features spotted on the dwarf planet's surface could bear the names of famous "Star Trek" characters, researchers said.
"We might have craters called Sulu and Spock and Kirk and McCoy and so on," Mark Showalter of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View, Calif., said during a Google+ Hangout today (July 2). [Photos of Pluto and Its Moons]
Craters and other features spotted on Pluto by NASA's New Horizons probe in 2015 may end up being named after Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, researchers say. (Image: © SETI Institute (via Google+/YouTube))
Showalter led the team that used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to discover Pluto's two smallest known moons, which were announced in 2011 and 2012 with the pedestrian names P4 and P5, respectively. P4 is thought to be 8 to 21 miles (13 to 34 kilometers) wide, while P5 is tinier still at 6 to 15 miles (10 to 25 km) across.
The SETI Institute sponsored an online poll called Pluto Rocks to come up with better monikers for the two natural satellites. The runaway winner of the poll was Vulcan, which snagged 170,000 of the nearly 500,000 votes cast after it was suggested by actor William Shatner (who played Capt. James T. Kirk in the original "Star Trek" TV series). In the "Star Trek" universe, Vulcan is the name of both a planet and the pointy-eared beings who evolved there.
However, the International Astronomical Union — the organization responsible for naming celestial objects — nixed the name.

According to IAU rules, Pluto's moons must be named after characters associated with the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This connection was deemed too tenuous in the case of Vulcan (the ancient Roman god of fire and volcanoes), SETI officials said, adding that the name has also already been used in astronomy. (For example, Vulcan was a hypothetical planet once thought to orbit between Mercury and the sun.)
The IAU accepted the second- and third-place finishers in the Pluto Rocks poll, so P4 and P5 are now officially known as Kerberos (the three-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld) and Styx (the river separating the land of the living from that of the dead), respectively.
Some of the other candidates from the contest will likely find new life as the names of Pluto surface features spotted by the New Horizons probe, which is slated to fly by the dwarf planet in July 2015.
For example, Showalter said that if a large mountain exists on Pluto, it should bear the name of Sisyphus, a human condemned for all eternity to push a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down again.
Scientists have much more freedom in naming the surface features of planets and moons than they do in attaching monikers to the celestial bodies themselves, Showalter added. So craters, valleys and plains may get all sorts of interesting names, some of them of much more recent origin.
"We know there are a lot of fans out there of the animated works of Walt Disney, and I'm hoping that someday Pluto will give us a place in which we can put the name of Mickey [Mouse] into the Pluto system as well," Showalter said.
Pluto has five known moons. The largest by far, Charon, was discovered in 1978. Hubble detected the other four, finding Nix and Hydra in 2005, Kerberos in 2011 and Styx in 2012.
There could be more Pluto satellites out there waiting to be discovered and named, however.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if we pick up a few more as the New Horizons spacecraft gets a little closer," Showalter said.

A great man, a fantastic composer and a good friend passed away yesterday. Rest in peace Kirill Pokrovsky – we will miss you.
And thank you for all the gifts you've given us. We each have our own Kirill story and many of us have Kirill presents on their desks. All of them demonstrate how rich a person you were.
We've all hummed your music and we have marvelled at how far your virtuosity went. You were truly somebody unique, a true artist, and we were very lucky to have you as a colleague.
Your greatest gift to us of course was your music that you shared with us on many occasions. The following concert in particular was really special for us, in the midst of a chaotic Kickstarter campaign, you brought us a moment of peace and joy.
What few people saw was exactly how cool you were behind the scenes as this piece of unreleased footage shows:
Larian will never be the same again without you.
We will remember you always. .
Kirill Pokrovsky 1965 - 2015
We've posted a photo album on our Facebook page of Kirill throughout the years.
The conservative-controlled U.S. Commission on Civil Rights says it has spent $173,653 investigating an incident involving voter intimidation by members of the New Black Panther Party — a case in which no voters have alleged they were intimidated.
That's according to data provided by the Commission on Civil Rights in response to Freedom of Information Act request by TPMMuckraker. As of Sept. 30, the obligations for the project stood at $173,653, up from $141,357 as of Aug. 2.
But given that entire 2010 Statutory Enforcement Report — the biggest project of the year for the Commission — centers on the incident in Philadelphia on Election Day 2008, the actual dollar amount spent is likely higher. Several meetings of the Commission have centered exclusively on the New Black Panther Party case — and the commission's budget for 2010 totals in at $9.4 million.The $173,653 total does not include costs in the new Fiscal Year 2011, which began in October. Commissioners discussed the case at a meeting on Oct. 8 and will approve the final version of the 2010 Enforcement Report — expected to slam the Justice Department's decision in the case — on Friday.
Abigail Thernstrom has been the one Republican dissenter from her colleagues' focus on the New Black Panther Party case. She has said that her colleagues have been driven by fantasies of using the issue to topple Holder and the Obama administration.
Documents also show that the Commission received 3,786 complaints and requests for assistance from the public and members of Congress in Fiscal Year 2009, an increase of about 4 percent over FY 2008. Most complaints, which are usually referred to other federal agencies, involve discrimination in the administration of justice and employment, law enforcement misconduct, and the rights of institutionalized persons, according to the Commission's report.
The New Black Panther Party case has riled conservatives, who allege that the first African-American Attorney General, Eric Holder, is not enforcing the law in a race neutral manner. It led to the resignation of one Civil Rights Division attorney, who testified before the commission.
Conservatives on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights first began looking into the New Black Panther case back in 2009, and began discussing hearings last October. They ended up holding several hearings throughout 2010. The Department's decision to drop the civil case against all but one of the members of the New Black Panther Party and the fallout that followed were the subject of the story in the Washington Post over the weekend.
After intentionally slamming his car into another vehicle in downtown Chicago, a west suburban man stabbed a security guard who tried to help at the crash scene before a police sergeant shot the assailant as he threatened her, prosecutors said.
Nomad Khan, 20, of Westmont was charged with four counts of attempted murder — two involving the crash and two involving the knife — after the incident early Saturday morning in the Loop. He was in fair condition Sunday afternoon at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, officials there said.
The security guard, 32-year-old Elizabeth Jackson of Melrose Park, was released from Northwestern after suffering a slash in the shoulder and a stab wound about an inch deep in the back, she said.
"I was just trying to be a good Samaritan and help out because there was a car accident," she said, "not knowing that I was going to get hurt."
As Khan was hospitalized Sunday morning, Cook County Judge James Brown ordered him held on $900,000 bond on the four attempted murder charges and a count of aggravated assault on an officer.
About 2 a.m. Saturday, Khan sped a Nissan Maxima into the rear of a vehicle preparing to turn at Monroe and LaSalle streets, hurling that automobile through the intersection and into a light pole, authorities said. The Nissan also sailed through the intersection and hit the vehicle a second time, trapping the two occupants of that automobile inside, said Assistant State's Attorney Terry Clancy.
Jackson, a security guard who patrols banks in a vehicle, was passing by and stopped to help, she said. She asked Khan if he was OK, but he responded by shouting and then advancing on her, she said. As he attacked, Jackson put her arm up to block him and saw that he held a knife, so she turned to run, she said. She knew immediately she was hurt because she could feel that her shirt was wet with blood, she said.
Jackson locked herself in her vehicle, she said, and watched as a Chicago police sergeant arrived. Khan charged at the sergeant with the knife and threatened to stab her, Clancy said. After repeatedly demanding that he drop the knife, the sergeant shot him in the hip, Clancy said.
Khan, of the 1000 block of Beninford Lane in Westmont, later told paramedics he intended to crash the vehicle, Clancy said, though the prosecutor did not explain any potential motive. The occupants of the vehicle suffered minor injuries, Clancy said.

For months, issuers have raised credit card rates and fees at a dizzying pace. Now, a growing number are starting to tack on new card fees for inactivity or purchases made outside the U.S.
In June, Fifth Third Bank began charging a $19 fee if credit card borrowers have no account activity in 12 months. Discover now levies a 2% fee on purchases made outside the U.S., and Chase has introduced a $30 annual fee on its popular Freedom credit card for certain cardholders.
Citigroup, meanwhile, has rolled out a policy where certain credit card borrowers who pay late are subject to a "reinstatement fee" to be able to redeem accumulated points for rewards. This fee is currently $0. But it won't stay that way, predicts Robert Hammer, who consults with the industry, if Citigroup finds cardholders aren't objecting to the policy. Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang says, "We currently have no plans to raise it."
The fees represent issuers' latest attempt to mitigate the effects of a credit card law passed in May, which restricts rate increases and marketing to college students. Analysts say that because most provisions don't take effect until February 2010, issuers are finding ways now to bolster their income despite consumers' precarious financial situations.
Issuers are "hoping to slip in fees where they're least likely to be noticed," says Adam Jusko, founder of IndexCreditCards.com, a card comparison site.
One fee making a comeback is the annual fee. In this economy, issuers are sending fewer credit card offers to U.S. households, yet a higher proportion of the offers have fees, according to Synovate, which tracks direct mail.
Issuers justify the new fees as a way to respond to the tough economy or keep their prices on par with their competitors. Chase also points out that Freedom card borrowers who don't want to pay an annual fee still get a reward program with 1% cash back on purchases. This new program, however, tends to be less generous than the old one, analysts say.
The changes in card terms mean that consumers need to read their credit card bills and notices extra carefully, says Curtis Arnold of CardRatings.com.
Many of the same banks are also extending some of their most profitable — and controversial — credit card fees to bank accounts. One way they're doing so is making it easier or costlier for consumers to spend more than they have in their checking accounts, just as they allow borrowers to spend past their card limits and charge them a fee.
In June, Bank of America raised its monthly fee on certain checking accounts and imposed a fee on accounts that remain overdrawn. (Bank of America did, however, lower its fee on overdrafts of $5 or less.) Citigroup, meanwhile, has raised foreign-transaction fees on debit cards.
Ask UFC flyweight Ian McCall whether he wants to return to the cage, and you might get an honest answer.
Or maybe, you'll get a version of the truth, an inkling that came to him in the moment and passed his lips without much thought. It varies by the hour.
“As much as I like to mess with the media and say I'll never fight again, I don't know if you guys realize I'm totally full of (expletive),” he told MMAjunkie. “I don't know what I'm going to do.”
Benched since January 2015 by a series of injuries, McCall (13-5-1 MMA, 2-3-1 UFC), 31, has tried a few things. He announced this past winter he would be a co-manager at a medical marijuana facility. He started coaching. He started a podcast. And recently, he invested in a salon offering cryotherapy and other high-tech machines that help athletes and regular people recover from injuries and medical conditions.
All the while, he's declared a career in fighting to be a bad investment at this point in his life, though he remains under contract with the UFC.
“Financially, my contract isn't anything special,” McCall told MMAjunkie Radio. “I don't want to say anything bad against the UFC because I would probably run my business the same way. I get it. But from where I'm at, physically, I'm tore up, my body's broken. If I had proper motivation, then sure (I'd fight again), but it's hard to peak for a training camp when there's nothing behind it.”
McCall said he “misjudged” the medical marijuana industry and isn't ready to commit. But he is all in at the salon and spends much of his time helping others recover there.
And yet, in spite of his feelings, McCall can't bring himself to distance himself from MMA, much less utter the “R” word. He admits he is married to the sport and sees no other pursuit that offers the same rush – and he's tried a few, to his own detriment.
“I am sick,” he said. “That drug of walking out for a UFC fight, you can't find it anywhere else.”
Not long ago, he started training for a comeback, putting in the hours necessary to compete at the highest level in the UFC's octagon. All the while, he suffered numbness in his arm, a possible complication from shoulder surgery and sudden stress on the joint. He told himself he was done fighting and focused on coaching. Then his arm started working again.
The relative health led to a few offers from the UFC, and another discovery by McCall – that he couldn't accept just any fight to get back into action.
“I have turned down a couple of fights since this year started because I haven't felt physically OK,” he said. “Let's say I fought a kid like (Justin) Scoggins, or some hungry young fighter. If I go in there and get obliterated by some young guy, and I don't give it 100 percent, whether it's motivation or physically, that's not fair to me, it's not fair to my brain, it's not fair to my opponent, and it's not fair to the adoring public.
“Maybe somebody needs to light a fire under my ass, or some young fighter needs to talk (expletive). Someone, please motivate me to get in shape and fight.”
You don't need to remind him that UFC flyweight champ and pound-for-pound great Demetrious Johnson once said he changed his approach to fighting in part due to a pair of close fights with McCall. It's one of the things “Uncle Creepy” holds on to as he figures out his next move.
“I feel like I'm the only person on the planet who can talk (expletive) to D.J., but I've stopped because everybody needs to show him some respect,” McCall said of Johnson. “That guy needs to be put on a pedestal because he's special. Of course, I still think I can beat him if I get my act together.”
But for now, he is content spending time with his young daughter and nurturing his cryotherapy business while training at the gym. He needs something to upend his current routine – something attractive both competitively and financially.
Anything less won't light the fire.

Computer Science Professor Francesco De Comité has a fantastic gallery of mathematical images on Flickr. As part of this collection, he has a few hundred images of real or rendered polyhedra made out of paper or playing cards which he calls "slide togethers." These are constructed by making cuts and then sliding one component into the other, creating a shape without using any glue. He constructed the entire set of the platonic solids—the cards form their edges—which can be seen in the image below. I became intrigued by these and had to figure out how to make them myself. Francesco did leave some templates and other clues behind. Using some creativity and trigonometry, I managed to construct my own templates and my own set. Note: The second from the right isn't a platonic solid. It's a truncated icosahedron, and you can see how to make one of those in my other post. Here's a downloadable template for the platonic solids so you can construct your own set. I recommend making the cube for ease of use and coolness factor. I would also recommend the dodecahedron. The others are great, but the aforementioned two are my favorites. Here's a short little tutorial on how to construct them.
Materials Playing cards (the constructions and number of cards required are: 6 cards for the tetrahedron, 12 cards for the cube, 12 cards for the octahedron, 30 cards for the dodecahedron, and 30 cards for the icosahedron)
Downloadable template
Scissors or X-Acto knife
Cutting mat or board if using an X-Acto knife
Step 1: Download and Print the Template Download the template by clicking on the link above. Once you're in Google Docs, go to the upper left-hand corner, and click on "File" and then "Download". Print the PDF scaled at 100%. Do not leave the scaling at "Fit on Page". This will not work. Alternatively, click on "File" and then "Print PDF" in the Google Docs menu if you don't want a local copy. Again, remember to change the scaling to 100%.
Step 2: Use the Template to Make Cuts in the Playing Cards Cut out the template card. You should try to cut down the center of the line. Small errors shouldn't matter much to the end product. Place the template as perfectly as possible on top of the playing card, and cut through the template and card on the marked lines, making sure that the template doesn't move relative to the card. (Note: when cutting the cards make sure to always cut either the front or the back of the card. It doesn't matter which one you choose, but you must be consistent by either choosing the front or back.) You can see the card behind the template. Showing the slots cut out on the card. Repeat until you have enough identical copies to make the desired polyhedra.
Step 3: Begin Placing the Cards Using the slotted cards, slide one card into the other. For the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron, you should always have 3 cards coming together to form a point. For the octahedron, there should be 4 cards together to form a point. For the icosahedron, there should be 5 cards coming together to form a point. Putting the last card together at the point is always the hardest part because you have to slide two different slots into each other at the same time. Placing the first card, shown below. (Note: You could decide to have the patterned side up instead of the face. Whatever you choose, you must be consistent.) Placing the second card forming the full vertex (point) for the tetrahedron, cube, or dodecahedron. For the octahedron, it would look like this (4 to a vertex): For the icosahedron, it would look like this (5 to a vertex): After you form one point, just continue making more points at the other ends of the cards. This will result in a polyhedral ball. If it starts looking lopsided, you probably miscounted. Forming the second vertex for a cube: Forming vertexes so you get a square in the middle for a cube (at this point it finally begins to stabilize!): The cube is done!
Media playback is not supported on this device FA Cup: AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United highlights
Non-league Sutton set up a glamorous FA Cup fourth-round home tie against Leeds with a thrilling replay win at 10-man League One side AFC Wimbledon.
The Dons made a perfect start when Tom Elliott rose above the away defence to nod in Dean Parrett's free-kick.
But they were left a man down for more than 75 minutes as Paul Robinson was sent off for hauling down Matt Tubbs.
Roarie Deacon's stunner levelled before late goals from Maxime Biamou and Dan Fitchett caused an upset.
The National League side will host Leeds at Gander Green Lane on Sunday, 29 January (14:00 GMT).

More than just money for Sutton
Sutton were the lowest-ranked team left in the draw for the fourth round, but knew they had to overcome their near-neighbours - 51 places above them on the league ladder - before they could even think about hosting Championship promotion chasers Leeds in a money-spinning tie.
The non-league club have reached the fourth round on two previous occasions, the last time coming in the 1988-89 season, when they memorably beat then-top flight opponents Coventry in the third round.
But the reward for beating Wimbledon was worth much more to the Greater London club than that famous win 28 years ago.
Sutton manager Paul Doswell compared winning the third-round replay to the Championship play-off final in terms of financial importance, estimating it would take their earnings from this cup run to about £500,000.
This victory was more than just money.
The jubilant celebrations from the away players and officials, plus their 300-odd travelling supporters, showed how much the victory meant.
Leeds-born Tom Elliott put AFC Wimbledon ahead, but missed out on a tie against his home-city club
Analysis
Former Tottenham manager David Pleat on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra:
"It was an extraordinary night. We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor.
"It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides.
"Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge."
What the managers said:
Sutton manager Paul Doswell spoke of his "unadulterated joy" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United.
"I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players.
"Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance."
Dons boss Neal Ardley meanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result.
"You prepare for the game with 11 men but for most of it we had 10," he said. "Credit to Sutton, they kept going and got their just rewards in the end.
"But we'll never know what would have happened if it was 11 versus 11. It's a big judgement call, to say that is a cast-iron sending-off early in the game.
Party-time for Sutton!

Over the holiday weekend we gorged on movies; Sherlock Holmes, Broken Embraces, a few others. One that got decidedly mixed reviews was Up In the Air. Personally, I liked it. The New Yorker explains it very well.
But you don't have to agree with me for us to use the metaphor. George Clooney plays a globe-trotting firer-for-hire; an outsider hired by management to terminate people at arm's length. (Never mind such jobs basically don't exist, this is Hollywood).
On a dozen levels, the movie deals with the issue of intimacy in business. Firing people by proxy; quitting a job by texting; romance in the friendly skies—or is it romance? And throughout it all, can we tell the difference?
Intimacy in Business
Also over the weekend, I had a cuppa with a client, a partner at a large global professional services firm. Call him Ishmael.
We talked about his business and mine, mine consisting in part of selling to his. Like many large firms, his has cut back virtually 100% on internal travel.
Ishmael: A global business of collegial professionals can exist for a year without mixing with your partners. Maybe even a little longer. But at some point it begins to exact a toll. We've been webinared to death. Worse, we only have two-dimensional, sensory-deprived images of each other.
There's only so much you can do to maintain a connection without the physical, breathing presence of each other. Avatars and holograms and con-calls don't do it. Cultures don't live by cloud-computing alone. To make a firm, you've got to drink beer together, play golf together, smell each other, laugh and cry in the same room at the same time.
Is that a real poncho, or is that a Sears poncho? (Frank Zappa)
Up in the Air Management
What I liked about the movie was that the Clooney character actually does have the ability to be real: he shows it in a scene where he cuts through the cynical hatred of a terminated employee (the talented J.K. Simmons) to jarringly put him back in touch with his youthful dreams. And yet Clooney's character is so practiced in the Plastic Ways that he ultimately can't recognize when he's lost touch with that ability.
The best movies are metaphors for life. There's fodder enough here to rail against the twittering, ADD-ridden, thumb-dancing toys that threaten to reduce our attention to a tiny screen. But that's not all.
Those new technologies are also metaphors in addition to being virtual reality centers. They are metaphors for other forms of anti-intimacy management tools–blind auctions; outsourcing; management by process; modular design; over-use of legal agreements; online employment search.
There's nothing wrong per se with any of these tools. But taken uncritically, and at too great a strength, you end up with Clooney in the skies, aiming at what you think is real, but which ends up being just a pale reflection.

BOSTON — The American Unitarian Association, peopled and powered by this city's Brahmin elite, announced its presence here in 1886 with a grand and stately headquarters at the very top of Beacon Hill, right next door to the Statehouse.
If anyone doubted the denomination's might, its next move made it clear: In 1927, strapped for space, the Unitarians finished building a new home next to the capitol on the other side, even persuading the legislature to change the street's numbering so they could take their address with them.
But the Unitarian Universalist Association, as the denomination is now known, is selling its headquarters building, as well as two grand homes and an office building it owns in the same neighborhood. It is leaving behind the red brick sidewalks, gas streetlamps and superrich neighbors for a section of South Boston the city has designated an “innovation district,” home to up-and-coming technology and arts businesses.
Image Work continued last month on the association's new headquarters in an “innovation district” in South Boston. Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times
The move — expected to bring tens of millions of dollars to the denomination — puts the Unitarians in increasingly familiar company. Multiple religious denominations, citing everything from diminished financial resources to a need for more contemporary office space, are simultaneously downsizing and raising money by selling longtime headquarters in expensive neighborhoods. The moves come at a time when increasing secularization in the United States is taking a toll on many religious institutions, although most say the reasons for their relocations are not solely financial.

Intravenous drip bags pictured on the Hangover Bus in the Manhattan borough of New York on Friday. Flashgap's "Hangover Helper Pop-Up," however, isn't associated with the Hangover Bus. Carlo Allegri/Reuters A new company is hoping you'll ditch your favorite greasy spoon and Gatorade combo in favor of hooking up to an IV on New Year's Day after a big night out.
Flashgap— a photo-sharing app that saves group photos from a night out and keeps them locked until the next day around noon — said it was hosting a "Hangover Helper Pop-Up" featuring free IVs that deliver a cocktail of nutrients, including vitamins B and C, electrolytes, antioxidants, and anti-nausea medication.
Hangover sufferers will be hooked up to an IV by a nurse and can then relax for about 20 minutes while the nutrients flow, a Flashgap spokesman said. There will also be a doctor on site.
The free event is happening on a first-come-first-served basis at the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and West 15th Street on New Year's Day from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., according to the company.
Participants should bring their IDs and health-insurance information, if they have it, and will have to fill out medical forms before the IV is administered, the company said. Health insurance is not mandatory, however, to receive the IV drip.
Sunglasses, water, and bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches will also be given out at the pop-up, the company said.
"Partying and nights out with friends is a huge part of the spirit of Flashgap and the inspiration behind creating the app," company CEO Julian Kabab said in a statement.
"We know our users are young and energetic, with active social lives on and offline. This pop-up will hopefully allow people to extend that good time on one of the biggest party nights of the year without any regrets the next day."
The mood at HP Field House gradually improved as reports of Wichita State University basketball player Anton Grady's health grew more encouraging throughout Friday night. Grady was unable to move when he left on a stretcher during Friday afternoon's game. By the evening movement began to return, slowly, to his extremities.
Grady suffered a spinal concussion in Friday's game, according to the results of an MRI. Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall told ESPN's Jeff Goodman that Grady would be better in a day or so. Maggie Marshall, daughter of the coach, Tweeted that “Anton has a spinal concussion and he will be out for a few days. Thankfully he is okay.”
WSU athletic administrators, however, declined to confirm those reports. In a release Friday night, WSU said Grady's MRI came back negative and a neurosurgeon is scheduled to review the results and prepare a diagnosis on Saturday.

SHARE COPY LINK Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall talks about the Shockers' loss to Alabama in the losers bracket of the AdvoCare Invitational on Friday. Marshall also talked briefly about the injury to Anton Grady.
Spinal concussions are a temporary injury to the spinal cord, caused by the neck bending or twisting sharply. Recovery is expected within 24 hours.
Earlier Friday, Grady was “alert and responsive, has feeling in his extremities and is in overall good spirits,” according to a news release from the WSU athletic department.
Grady was taken from Friday's game on a stretcher after collapsing on the court. Grady, while turning to run, collided with a University of Alabama player.
He took a few, stumbling steps before falling to the court. In the news release, WSU describes Grady hitting Alabama's Dazon Ingram with his chin, causing his head to rotate.
“A CT scan came back negative,” according to the release.
A CT scan would be used to rule out broken bones. An MRI would be used to further investigate damage to soft tissue and nerves.
WSU coach Gregg Marshall, during a postgame news conference, described Grady as alert.
“Anton is alert, awake and talking,” Marshall said. “He said he has feelings in his extremities, but can't move.”
Marshall visited Grady in the hospital after leaving the HP Field House.
Grady, after losing the ball, ran into Ingram with 3:07 remaining in the game. He fell after a step or two and didn't move.
WSU trainer Todd Fagan and other medical personnel attended to him. They fitted him in a neck brace, loaded him on a stretcher and wheeled him to an ambulance for transport to a nearby trauma center.
A fan yelled, “We're praying for you, Anton,” which brought applause from players and other fans.
“Seeing your brother on the court like that, obviously it's more than the game at that point,” WSU senior Ron Baker said. “It's life. It's frightening.
“It's hard to focus on the game itself because you could be in his shoes just like him.”
Grady, a senior from Cleveland, is playing his first season at WSU.
University of Southern California players, waiting in the arena's interior before the start of their game, applauded for Grady as the stretcher passed by.
Alabama coach Avery Johnson said he did not see what happened.
“I did hear what hospital he's going to, so I'm going to be on standby and see whenever I can go and visit, if they would allow any visitors,” Johnson said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with him,” Alabama guard Riley Norris said.
Alabama defeated No. 20 Wichita State 64-60.

Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly, who has worked at the channel for 12 years, is leaving the network to join NBC, her publicist has confirmed.
Ms Kelly will host her own daytime news and discussion programme at NBC, as well as presenting an in-depth Sunday night news show.
The move deprives Fox News of its second most popular host after Bill O'Reilly.
Ms Kelly's contract with Fox was due to end later this year.
She was pushed into the international spotlight in 2015 when she accused Donald Trump of misogyny during a Republican presidential debate.
She later said that she would "not apologise for doing good journalism", following criticism from Mr Trump's supporters.
NBC News chairman Andrew Lack called Ms Kelly "an exceptional journalist" who has "demonstrated tremendous skill and poise".
"We're lucky to have her," he said.
Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 20th Century Fox, thanked her for 12 years of service.
"We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best," he said.

Further details of Ms Kelly's news programmes will be unveiled by NBC in the coming months, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Ms Kelly, a lawyer-turned-journalist, joined Fox News' Washington bureau as a correspondent before being given her own prime-time show, the Kelly File.
The mother-of-three, from New York, began her career as a local news reporter in 2003, after nine years in law.

During the US election campaign, Ms Kelly challenged now President-elect Donald Trump on his statements about women.
Her accusation of misogyny against the New York billionaire made her a target for his supporters and the subject of attacks from Mr Trump himself.
He accused the presenter of having "blood coming out of her wherever", later denying he was referring to menstruation.
In a move described by Fox News as "unprecedented", Mr Trump later refused to participate in shows hosted by Ms Kelly.
SUPPLIERS to Woolworths claim they have been given two weeks to cut their prices by up to 10per cent or have their goods removed from shelves — with no commitment from the supermarket giant to lower prices to consumers.
The squeeze on suppliers — described by one of them as "the most brutal negotiations... in my three decades in the industry" — is being mounted by Woolworths to help fund its price war with Coles.
Independent senator Nick Xenophon, an outspoken critic of the combined 80 per cent market share of Woolworths and rival Coles, said yesterday he would be calling for Woolworths to be pulled before a Senate inquiry to explain its actions.
Woolworths and Coles are already facing scrutiny from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which, The Age can reveal, has been contacted by more than 50 suppliers in response to its call for confidential complaints.
In Las Vegas at CES, Oculus has unveiled the latest prototype of its virtual reality head-mounted display hardware, codenamed "Crystal Cove."The new iteration of the system has received some significant upgrades from the HD headset the company showed last year; most notably, it now comes paired with an external camera to allow for accurate head tracking (via LED markers on the exterior of the HMD itself, pictured below.) Thanks to this, the system now tracks three supplemental "degrees of freedom" -- forward/backward, left/right, and up/down.Meanwhile, the 1080p screen in the unit has been upgraded from LCD to OLED, a display technology capable of much faster refresh times. Thanks to its low image persistence, the new display allows for images to be shown in a way that is more like natural vision in the real world. "With low persistence, you can continue to stare at an object or read text while you�re moving your head," CEO Brendan Iribe tells Wired Gamasutra is meeting with Oculus today at CES and will have more on the company's latest developments soon.
Last month, I discussed the top six underhanded tactics used by husbands during divorce.
As a quick recap, let me remind you that those dirty tricks are:
“Conflicting out” all the top divorce lawyers.
Stalling and delaying.
Exerting pressure to proceed too quickly.
Denying access to financial resources.
Hiding assets.
Failing to pay court-ordered support or refusing to relinquish assets.
Now, I'd like to add to that list with two more devious strategies, both of which hinge on the manipulation of domestic violence laws –the very laws that, ironically, were implemented to protect women, not harm them. Here are the two “new” underhanded tactics which divorce professionals are seeing crop up with increasing frequency:
1. Husbands claiming their wives are abusers.
This ploy is just as ugly as it sounds. Some men are upending domestic violence laws so that their wives (who are the true victims) are arrested, prosecuted and even sentenced as abusers.
In the foreword to the new book, Hanging On By My Fingernails: Surviving the New Divorce Gamesmanship, and How a Scratch Can Land You in Jail, written by Janie McQueen, Tamara N. Holder, a Chicago criminal defense attorney, explains how the scam works:
“Unfortunately, many abusive men have learned to reshape domestic violence laws into another weapon of abuse. They are turning police and court protections upside down: The abusers themselves call 9-1-1; they have the women arrested for domestic violence; and then they do everything they can to try to have the women prosecuted and sentenced. In this way, the true victim is painted as the abuser.
There is a deeper motivation in using this ploy; to show a pattern of "violent conduct" on the woman's part so that the abuser can use it as evidence against her in a divorce or child custody battle. And this form of abuse is permanent. A bruise heals after a few days, but a conviction for a violent crime mars her record forever.
The set-up: A couple has a fight. Either the wife calls 9-1-1 in a desperate plea for police intervention, or the husband makes the call first in a preemptive attack. When the police arrive, the woman is visibly upset. The man, on the other hand, is extremely calm as he switches off his anger. The husband tells the police that his wife is delusional, crazy, and violent. Depending on how convincing the man's story is to the police officer, and the state's law on domestic violence, either both people are arrested or the woman is arrested.
In the case of a dual arrest, which some states discourage, the woman often tells prosecutors she doesn't want to testify against her husband, so the case is dismissed. Meanwhile, the husband is determined that she be prosecuted. Instead of the prosecutors looking into the history of the relationship before proceeding with the criminal case, they move full speed ahead. The wife is usually cut off from her husband's financial support so she cannot pay for defense against him. As a result, she is forced to take a plea to the charges because she cannot afford to defend herself. She fears taking the case to trial, losing, and going to jail.”
Just last month, the divorce between Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders and his wife Pilar made headlines when police responded to a disturbance call at the Sanders' home. The next day, Pilar was arrested and charged with simple assault. Now, her attorney says Pilar's arrest following allegations that she attacked the former NFL cornerback was "a complete setup."
Clearly, the courts will have to decide who's guilty of what in the Sanders' case, but the attorneys I talk to tell me circumstances like these are becoming more and more prevalent. Sadly, an arrest ploy as Ms. Holder describes above can have devastating consequences for the woman involved, including criminal trials, lingering criminal records, distorted custody battles and financial losses.
“Victims of these increasingly common set-ups face criminal charges alongside their emotionally depleting divorce and custody cases, which are, of course, by now stacked against them,” Janie McQueen, the author of Hanging On By My Fingernails: Surviving the New Divorce Gamesmanship, and How a Scratch Can Land You in Jail, told me. “Even if the victim is able to gather the resources to hire a criminal defense attorney and get the charges dropped, she remains tied up with clearing her name and repairing all the damage while her spouse goes about setting up the rest of the divorce.”
Ms. McQueen, a former crime reporter, was once a victim of these ploys herself.
“There is far more to this ploy than someone going from minding her household to sitting in jail,” she explained. “The emotional trauma can't be overstated. What is happening is, the abuser is using the system to perpetuate the abuse. She thinks: who, then, is on her side?”
Unfortunately, these scams undermine sound public policy and create confusion that, paradoxically, ends up protecting abusers.
“Domestic violence issues have become so heated and politicized that it's difficult to make people even listen to what is really going on, to realize there is a difference between a true DV situation and this scam that manipulates the stiff arrest laws,” Ms. McQueen concluded. “This is a situation that carries a ‘guilty until proven innocent' stigma. Even strong proponents of the Violence Against Women Act seem not to understand this backlash effect of the perpetrator playing the victim, or they perceive exposure of these very real set-ups as criticism that would weaken their lobbying efforts. I think swift arrest laws through VAWA are needed—but we need to figure out how to tweak the system to identify the true perpetrator.”
2. Coerced debt.
As the name implies, “coerced debt” occurs when the abuser in a violent relationship uses fraud or coercion to obtain credit in the victim's name. For example, the abuser (typically the husband) might:
Secretly open credit card accounts in the victim's name
Trick the victim into relinquishing her rights to certain marital assets
Coerce the victim into signing financial documents
As a result, the victims of coerced debt often are left with the devastating consequences of negative credit. They have difficulty opening credit card accounts, obtaining loans, renting, even finding a job –not to mention the time and expense required for credit repair.
The problem of coerced debt is quickly emerging as a significant threat for divorcing women, and unfortunately, it appears that current laws are far from sufficient to deal with this growing problem. In fact, current laws may be exacerbating the problem. As Angela Littwin explains in Coerced Debt: The Role of Consumer Credit In Domestic Violence:
“For its part, the credit reporting system is singularly unprepared to handle issues at the intersection of debt and domestic violence. In theory, a credit report should be an accurate testament to an individual's creditworthiness. But in practice, credit reports are notoriously error-laden, and there are three major reporting bureaus, which each require separate advocacy. Most importantly for survivors of coerced debt, the forums available for resolving these errors are lacking in any procedure by which a consumer can argue that an item on her report does not predict her future riskiness as a borrower, tenant, or employee.
In other words, marriage law does not allow for the resolution of coerced debt, because creditors are involved. And the credit system – to the extent that it acknowledges family issues at all – operates under the assumption that family law has already settled any marriage- or relationship-based questions of legal rights and duties. The legal system that acknowledges domestic violence cannot effectively adjudicate matters of consumer debt, and the consumer credit system currently has no mechanism for addressing questions of domestic violence.
This combination of legal gaps has left victims of coerced debt in an untenable position. Debt about which they did not know or to which they did not consent is marring their credit reports and increasing their already-high barriers to obtaining housing and employment – two essential building blocks to economic self-sufficiency. In this way, coerced debt may be directly contributing to domestic violence, by undermining victims' ability to leave and remain free of abusive relationships.”
Even under the best of circumstances, divorce is complicated and emotionally trying. For women who are victims of abuse, the process is exponentially more difficult --and growing more so, now that husbands are trying to manipulate domestic violence laws and coerce debt. As I have mentioned in a previous article, if you are involved in an abusive relationship, please seek help. There are community-based organizations, private counselors and therapists and other professionals who can offer the immediate assistance you need. They can help you create a plan that will keep you and your children safe. Once you are safe, you can start to take even more steps toward a brighter and financially secure future.

ISLAMABAD: Around 5,000 Hindus migrate from Pakistan to India and other countries every year due to religious persecution, ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) lawmaker Ramesh Kumar Wankwani has told the Pakistani National Assembly.“During last two months, six incidents of religious desecration happened only in Sindh province. In all incidents, religious books of Hindu minority and their places of worship were burnt,” said Wankwani, who also heads the Pakistan Hindu Council.He said the government has so far neither made arrests nor taken action against any extremist group involved in attacks. “No one from the minority community feels safe in Pakistan,” he said on Monday while commenting on law and order situation in the country.He blamed the government for failing to control frequent attacks against Hindus and maintained it was the community's constitutional right to practice its religion freely in Pakistan.“But the rights of Hindus have never remained a priority here. The problems of Hindus are multiplying in Pakistan instead of decreasing. Are we not part of this country?” he questioned.He said it was the teaching of all the religions to respect other faiths but the minorities had failed to get equal rights in Pakistan.The lawmaker informed the house that scores of Hindu women have been abducted in last few years in Sindh province and later married to their kidnappers after forcible conversion. He urged the government to take steps to counter it.Wankwani asked why issues of minorities never came up for discussion in the house. “When Jinnah's residence was attacked and destroyed in Ziarat town of Baluchistan, the National Assembly had debated on the issue for four consecutive days,'' he said.“I request the house to spare some time for taking up the problems faced by minorities.'' He said Hindus are also equal citizens of Pakistan and their holy books should also be considered equally respectful.Wankwani suggested the government to set up a parliamentary committee to discuss issues related to minorities in this regard.There was a pin-drop silence in the house as all legislators attentively listened to his emotional speech.Later, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Sheikh Aftab Ahmed said the government will ensure the protection of minorities at all cost as it is mentioned in the Constitution.
It has become fashionable in some Catholic quarters these days to question where there are now or will ever be any souls populating hell. Hell, it is taught, is a “real possibility,” but whether there are any souls actually there, or whether there will ever be any souls there, is unknown to us.
It is, of course, true that hell is a “real possibility” for each of us. And that is a sobering thought. But it is also true that souls are actually in hell now, and will be for all eternity. This is a teaching of our Catholic Faith.
Au Contrair!
No less of a luminary than Fr. Robert Barron, following the great Hans Urs von Balthasar, from his famous book on the topic, Dare We Hope That All Men Be Saved?, writes in his book, Catholicism , on pages 257-258:
If there are any human beings in hell, they are there because they absolutely insist on it. The conditional clause with which the last sentence began honors the church's conviction that, though we must accept the possibility of hell (due to the play between divine love and human freedom), we are not committed doctrinally to saying that anyone is actually “in” such a place. We can't see fully to the depths of anyone's heart; only God can. Accordingly, we can't declare with utter certitude that anyone—even Judas, even Hitler—has chosen definitively to lock the door against the divine love. Indeed, the liturgy compels us to pray for all of the dead, and since the law of prayer is the law of belief, we must hold out at least the hope that all people will be saved. Furthermore, since Christ went to the very limits of godforsakenness in order to establish solidarity even with those who are furthest from grace, we may, as Hans Urs von Balthasar insisted, reasonably hope that all will find salvation…
Let me just say at the outset here that neither Hans Urs von Balthasar nor Fr. Robert Barron are “universalists,” as they are sometimes accused of being. Both taught hell as a “real possibility” emphasizing the fact that we just can't know with “utter certitude”—to use Fr. Barron's words—whether anyone is in hell. Neither ever taught we can know with that same “utter certitude” that everyone is going to be saved. For an excellent defense of von Balthasar's teaching, I recommend Mark Brumley's article, “Did Hans Urs von Balthasar Teach that Everyone Will Certainly Be Saved?” found in The Catholic World Report, November 21, 2013.
Having said that, this does not mean there are not problems with both von Balthasar and Fr. Barron's teaching. There are. We'll focus now on Fr. Barron's above-quoted statement.
The central problem comes from the statement, “If there are any human beings in hell…” And then also with the claim that “the church's conviction” is that we are not committed “doctrinally” to saying anyone is “in” such a place (hell). These are problematic. There are four points that I think we need to consider:
1. The First Constitution of the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 at the very least alludes to the fact that folks then living in AD 1215 would be in hell. This was the opening statement of the Council and its “Profession of the Faith.” The implication is that people from every generation would finally be eternally separated from God, not just people from the 13th century. But, at the very least, for the strict interpreter of the words of the Council, it seems inescapable that the Council taught souls are in hell now:
Indeed, having suffered and died on the wood of the cross for the salvation of the human race, he descended to the underworld, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven. He descended in the soul, rose in the flesh, and ascended in both. He will come at the end of time to judge the living and the dead, to render to every person according to his works, both to the reprobate and to the elect. All of them will rise with their own bodies, which they now wear, (Latin text reads quae nunc gestant—which they are now bearing or wearing) so as to receive according to their deserts, whether these be good or bad; for the latter perpetual punishment with the devil, for the former eternal glory with Christ.
The present tense indicates that some folks then living—now wearing their bodies—would go to hell. Thus, the Church is here teaching there are people “in” hell.
2. We have a more recent magisterial statement from Pope John Paul II with, shall we say, an interesting history. It was originally recorded in the L'Osservatore Romano, August 4, 1999, and it read:
Eternal damnation remains a real possibility, but we are not granted, without special divine revelation, the knowledge of whether or which human beings are effectively involved in it.
This sounds like it agrees with Fr. Barron and von Balthasar, doesn't it? However, when this statement was placed in the AAS (Acta Apostolicae Sedis?all of the official statements of our Popes are placed there in their official form), “whether or” was edited out. This is most significant. The Pope's original statement seemed to lend itself to questioning whether or not any souls are in hell. At the time, it was met with serious blow-back. But it was purposely amended, it appears, to eliminate those two problematic words. Thus, the official statement of the Pope reads:
Eternal damnation remains a real possibility, but we are not granted, without special divine revelation, the knowledge of which human beings are effectively involved in it.
The official statement of the Pope indicates the traditional Catholic teaching that there are human beings in hell, but that we just do not know “which human beings” they are.
3. Pope John Paul II, in his book, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, provides:
Can God, who has loved man so much, permit the man who rejects Him to be condemned to eternal torment? And yet, the words of Christ are unequivocal. In Matthew's Gospel he speaks clearly of those who will go to eternal punishment (cf. Matt. 25:46). Who will these be? The Church has never made any pronouncement…” (pg. 185)
Though not a magisterial document, this does give us some insight into the mind of our former Pope. The unresolved question for John Paul was not whether folks are in hell or not, but who they will be individually. That is what the Church has not defined or taught officially. In other words, there is no “anticanonization” process where someone is declared to be in hell infallibly.
Thus, it seems the Church's Magisterium has, in fact, taught that there are souls in hell now, and that there will be for all eternity. “Which human beings” we do not know without special divine revelation. With all due respect to von Balthazar's “Dare We Hope,” I would say that kind of “hope” would be to hope against the sensus ecclesiae, if by that he meant, or if by that Fr. Barron means, that there could even be a possibility that no one is or ever will be in hell. Jesus' words are, as Pope John Paul II said, “unequivocal.”
And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life (Matt. 25:46).
Jesus seemed as certain that there will be souls in hell as he was that there will be souls in heaven.
Thus, in Fr. Barron's statement, “If there are any human beings in hell…” he seems to be confusing the idea that we don't have definitive knowledge of an individual soul being in hell by name, and our not knowing whether there are any souls in hell. We don't know the former; we do know the latter as a matter of Church teaching.
Dare We Hope?
Finally, I want to consider Fr. Barron's argument that the Church's prayer for all of the dead means “we must hold out at least the hope that all people will be saved,” based upon the principle of lex orandi, lex credendi. This seems to be a non sequitur. Because we cannot know who will be saved, and who will be lost (apart from a private revelation, as Pope John Paul II said), it stands to reason we would pray for all. In other words, we would not pray: “Lord, because we know some will end up in hell, I pray Eggbert McGillicutty will be one of them.” Absolutely not! Just as God “wills all to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (I Tim. 2:4), so must we. But a hope or desire does not necessitate even the possibility of a strict fulfillment.
As an analogy, because I know my six children either have sinned (those over the age of accountability), or will sin (those under the age of accountability), that does not mean my prayer, “Dear Lord, keep my children from the ‘sin which clings so closely…'” is somehow void of hope. My desire, my hope, is that they never sin, but there is nothing in that desire, or hope, that means I must then hold to the possibility that all of my children will actually be sinless.
Neither is there anything in the Church's prayer for all souls that necessitates a doctrinal stand of the Church that says we “must” hold out hope that we will discover “hell” empty in the afterlife. In fact, that would contradict both the words of our Lord I cited above and the teaching of the Church in CCC 1034:
Jesus solemnly proclaims that he “will send his angels, and they will gather… all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,” and that he will pronounce the condemnation: “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire” (Matt. 25:41)!
Notice, the Church declares that “Jesus solemnly proclaims” and “pronounce[s]” that some will indeed be lost.
What Do We Conclude?
While we did not broach the topic of “how many” will be saved; that is for another time, our focus here has been on the question of whether there are and whether there will be souls in hell for all eternity. Greater minds than mine, like the aforementioned Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Fr. Robert Barron, have posited the possibility that all men could well be saved. Indeed, Fr. Barron even claims that as Catholics we “must” hold this to be a real possibility.
In a word, both of these great men are wrong. The teaching of the Church is clear. CCC 1034 teaches us that Jesus “solemnly proclaim[ed” that Christ will, in fact, “pronounce the condemnation: ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!'” And the Church can do nothing, but repeat her Lord's solemn words.

Hello,
The Aviation Herald had researched this occurrence and dismissed the whole story. According to radar data the aircraft, departing Mumbai on Aug 8th, was enroute over Turkey on Aug 9th at FL340 but never busted the flight level (in other words, according to transponder data always was between 33975 and 34025 feet). (The flight departing Aug 7th and being over Turkey on Aug 8th was cruising at FL320 and had no altitude deviation, too).
The Times of India, in their always so extremely reliable information (that out of several hundreds of aviation stories only as many as the fingers of one hand can count have actually been verified), claim however, that the occurrence came to light by an anonymous SMS to the DGCA.
The fact, that the DGCA reacted and opened an investigation whether there is any substance to the claims in that SMS, was taken as full confirmation of the report by the ToI and their big story now makes the rounds throughout the globe.
An anonymous SMS thus is the only foundation of this story!
In October of last year, shortly before the launch of the Surface RT tablet, Microsoft revealed that the 32GB version of the device actually included just 20GB of free space for users. The tech community erupted into a fit of collective outrage, with many insinuating that Microsoft was somehow misleading users with how it was advertising its devices.
The fact remains, of course, that devices that come with operating systems, restore partitions, and pre-installed software of any kind, don't avail the full advertised storage space to users. Even so, some users may be frustrated to learn that the cheapest version of Samsung's new Galaxy S4 comes with almost half of its onboard storage consumed.
The S4 offers a range of storage options, including 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. The smallest of these is heavily impacted by the large footprint of pre-installed software, which collectively eats up around 45% of the handset's integrated storage, as Geek.com notes. Of the 16GB of space, just 8.82GB remains for users, with the rest being consumed by the Android OS, and an extensive list of pre-loaded apps, including some of Samsung's own software such as its S Voice, S Translator and S Health apps.
Let's try not to overreact here though. This is precisely why Samsung provides a choice of storage options; if that 8.82GB of onboard storage isn't enough for you, then you can always opt for one of the models with more space for your files - and don't forget that the handset offers a microSD card slot to allow you to flexibly extend your storage at a later date.

In the summer of 2005, Jamie Pigman was deployed as a Navy medic to the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan with a scout sniper platoon. His three-man team ventured out on missions ranging from a few hours to a few weeks, with minimal resupply. “The mission always dictates the equipment needed and hence the weight carried,” he says. With a baseline weight of 30 to 40 pounds for body armor, weapons, ammunition, and survival gear, plus supplies for extended missions, he and his team were often carrying to 70 to 100 pounds each.
The gear was loaded into a modified ALICE pack—that's All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment, a vintage external-frame carrying system adopted by the military in the 1970s and still favored by some units for its ruggedness and versatility. But Pigman, an experienced hiker and outdoorsman who had joined the Boy Scouts at age 9 and hiked 120 miles across the New Mexico desert, noticed something odd: “No one I worked with used a hip strap,” he recalls. “You really can't use the hip strap with all your kit on.”
That observation was the spark behind a study published last month in the journal Human Factors, on the energy savings from using a hip strap while carrying a load. After being shot in the left knee during a firefight, Pigman decided to pursue exercise science and biomechanics as a post-military career. His masters research, with Peter Hosick at Montclair State University, focused on better ways of carrying the loads he'd humped in the Korengal Valley—a topic that turns out to be surprisingly understudied.
The hip strap study was fairly straightforward. Pigman had 15 men carry a 53-pound ALICE pack on a treadmill for 10 minutes at a self-selected pace, with and without the hip strap done up. Sure enough, oxygen consumption and subjective perceived effort were both slightly lower by the end of the walk with the hip strap. While the differences after 10 minutes were subtle, they add up quickly when you're walking for hours or days. “If the reduced energy expenditure is great enough,” Hosick says, “it could allow people to walk longer, or faster, or even reduce how much food they have to pack.”
What caught my attention most, though, was all the gaps and uncertainties in the existing literature on backpacks. To support the seemingly obvious claim that it takes more energy to carry a heavier pack, Pigman and Hosick cited a relatively recent paper from 2014. When I looked up that paper, its first sentence was: “Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase.”
Really? I found it hard to believe that we don't know why carrying a heavy backpack is harder than a light one. So I called Max Donelan, the head of Simon Fraser University's Locomotion Laboratory in Vancouver.
The problem, Donelan explained, is that the act of walking is way more complicated than most of us realize: “Because it's subconscious, we think walking is easy.” In Isaac Asimov-era science fiction, he pointed out, everyone assumed that in the future we would have athletic but dumb robots. Instead, we have Deep Blue and Watson, but walking robots can't yet out-toddle a 2-year-old.
The key point about walking, from a physics perspective, is that you don't perform any overall mechanical work if you're traveling at a steady speed over level ground. You have the same amount of kinetic and potential energy at the start of a hike as you do at the end—which means that, despite how you may feel, you haven't done any net work, since work is the change in energy. That still holds true if you strap on a pack, Donelan points out: “In theory, you can make the extra weight ‘disappear,' because you don't need to do any net mechanical work on it.”
In practice, of course, walking—with or without a pack—does take effort. With each step, your center of mass rises and falls in an arc, like an upside-down pendulum. Back in 2002, Donelan and his colleagues showed that much of the energy you burn while walking comes from the transition from one pendulum swing to the next: negative work by the knee joint to brake as your foot lands, then positive work by the ankle to push off again.
So when you strap a pack on, the actual cost of supporting the pack against gravity isn't a big deal. Instead, it's decelerating and then reaccelerating it with each step that costs energy—which is why some researchers are pursuing ideas like suspended packs that counteract some of this up-and-down motion. That can offer big savings on level ground; once you start climbing a hill, though, then you can't avoid spending energy to hoist the pack against gravity.
Of course, energy cost isn't the only consideration in backpack design. Pigman, who is now working on a Ph.D. in biomechanics at the University of Delaware, has further data coming out soon on force transmission to various parts of the body. Hip straps are supposed to redistribute force from the shoulder muscles to the much larger muscles around the hips, which should improve comfort and fatigue resistance, even if you burn the same amount of energy overall. They also reduce the risk of “rucksack palsy” resulting from compressed nerves under the shoulder strap.
But even those factors aren't as straightforward as I might have thought. Digging into some of the military literature on load carrying, I found that there's a massive body of research that, as a longtime backpacker, I'd never encountered, answering questions I'd never even thought to ask.
Where is the most efficient place to position a load? Believe it or not, it's on your head. Women in Kenya and other East African countries, researchers reported in the 1980s, carry up to 20 percent of their body weight either balanced on their heads or supported by a strap around their foreheads (like porters in Nepal sometimes use) without expending any extra energy. The problem, as a review in Military Medicine points out, is that it takes too long to learn how to do this.
There's a lot of interesting stuff here that I hope to dig into in future columns. For now, suffice to say that you should make sure your pack has a properly fitting hip strap, and buckle it up.
“I know the use of a hip strap is quite universal in the recreational world,” Pigman says. “But in the military, it's not used, and I feel pack designs for combat use should focus on creating a better pack-to-body interface for our fighters.”

Delusional Childress blames refs for loss
Not only did Brad Childress (sort of) call out his quarterback for his poor decision-making, he complained ad nauseum about the officiating.
“That's the worst officiated game I've seen,” Childress said during his postgame intervieew with KFAN. “That referee came over and apologized to me for not calling a hold on the scramble by [Packers quarterback Aaron] Rodgers. And I'll tell you what, that's his job. Protect the quarterback and look at the left tackle. Look at the left tackle hold his tail off.” Childress also criticized the Loadholt penalty during his KFAN interview. “The umpire standing on that side, they called a penalty, the guy hadn't called a penalty all night long and then I don't know if he got religion or what happened but Bruce whatever his name didn't make a [expletive] call all night long,” Childress said. “Now we're going to get a facemask. I mean c'mon now. C'mon.” Said Loadholt: “I didn't feel it. I couldn't tell. I thought I had his shoulder and kept pushing him by. We just have to look at the film and see. They thought I did.”
Childress has a right to complain about the non-holding call, but the facemask was obvious. Obvious.
Below are a few screen captures of the facemask call. The first shows Loadholt's hand in Matthews' facemask…
The second shows Matthews' helmet starting to turn…
More helmet turning…
Loadholt wouldn't still be attached to Matthews if he didn't have a hold of his facemask. (Or, at the very least, his shoulder pad.)
Now, from a different angle, you can see Loadholt's glove up in Matthews' face. If it were on his shoulder, you'd see the green from Matthews' facemask over the white of his glove…
A closer view…
And, finally, the helmet turning…
The guy doing the highlights on the video over at NFL.com said the call was “clear as day.”
Childress should think before he speaks, or at least look at the game tape. It's fine to vent about blown calls, but let's not forget the horrible spot that Greg Jennings got when forward progress easily should have garnered him a first down or the refs' decision not to let the second 4th-and-1 John Kuhn run go to completion. (He kept driving his legs and eventually got past the first down marker.)
Besides, during the game, Twitter was atwitter with complaints about Childress's playcalling in the second half, so maybe he should look in the mirror before slamming his quarterback or the officials in the media.
An independent thinker is an incredible threat to the state.
For this reason, statists throughout history have attempted, through propaganda and brute force, to shape and subdue society by controlling the education of the rising generation. As Hitler himself said, “He alone who owns the youth, gains the future.”
Of course, the oppressive state is not threatened by an ignorant, innocent, and vulnerable child. The child is no match for the state's subtle tactics, wherein it wraps its power grabs in emotionally persuasive language. A child does not have the wisdom and experience to understand history and recognize its repeatedly occurring patterns today. He is not aware of how despots and central planners have worked throughout the ages, and therefore is unable to resist their efforts in his own life.
As I explain in Latter-day Responsibility, the nuclear family has long been the interposing institution to protect children from the state. Strong families defend their young from the state's attempts to snatch them away—physically, intellectually, or morally. They provide an environment in which the innocent child can better learn truth, and prepare to combat falsehood.
The prolific cultural commentator Michael Novak observed it this way:
Between the omnipotent state and the naked individual looms the first line of resistance against totalitarianism: the economically and politically independent family, protecting the space within which free and independent individuals may receive the necessary years of nurture.
This is truth. Its application is not relegated to the repressive regimes of history. Out of many modern examples that might be shared, a recent one stands out. Melissa Harris-Perry, a talking head for MSNBC, recently recorded a promo for her employer in which she advocated against the family and for the state. She said:
We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had a private notion of children, [that] your kid is yours and totally your responsibility. We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities. Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the household's, we start making better investments.
Of course, her remarks are framed in the context of increased funding for public education (a tool used by the state to create conformity). But they are a shadow of the statist belief regarding the individual.
To such persons, the individual is secondary in importance. The collective is the optimal organization, say the statists, and deserves our primary focus and support. Individuals must acquiesce to the will of the collective, and their efforts must be made to fulfill the collective's goals, ideals, and priorities.
To diminish or discard parental stewardship over and responsibility for children is to directly attack the most fundamental and originating institution in existence: the family. Our independence from the state cannot be secured unless this interposing shield between the child and the state fulfills its duties. Sadly, most families willingly place their children into the care of the state from an early age, surrendering and subjecting them to its daily influence.
The collective strengthens itself by such actions. Like the machines in the Matrix surviving and thriving by harvesting humans and molding children into mere cogs of the machine, the collective in our day lives only by making sure that the individuals who comprise it remain submissive and even supportive.
Suggesting that a child is the collective's responsibility is, in the end, an argument in favor of no responsibility. There is no such entity as a community or collective—there are only individuals, who can group together for various purposes. As such, when individual accountability is removed, when the parent-child stewardship relationship is altered or altogether severed, then the child becomes nobody's responsibility.
This is not a rhetorical flourish. It is demonstrated fact. Consider this idea's application to police protection. As I further document in my recent book, the government has no legal obligation to protect people from crime. One lawsuit after another by individuals against the state have concluded with the judges affirming that police officers are not obligated to help individuals, but rather to provide services to the “public at large.”
There exists a “fundamental principle,” one court said, “that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any particular individual citizen. Accordingly,” they continued, “courts have without exception concluded that when a municipality or other governmental entity undertakes to furnish police services, it assumes a duty only to the public at large and not to individual members of the community.”
Individuals have delegated their protective care to an institution that turns around and tells them that it is under no obligation to actually protect them. The state has assumed the responsibility of police protection for its citizens, and then refuses to use the police to protect each of them.
Such circumstances stand as a warning against government encroachment into other areas, including and especially education of children. The argument that children should become everybody's responsibility—effectively, wards of the state—likewise affirms that the state actually bears no responsibility for your child, or my child, but only is involved in caring for children in general. With that understanding, the collective assuming responsibility for a certain child is in fact an abdication of any sort of responsibility for the child.
Predictably, Harris-Perry has responded to the outcry her commercial generated. She “doubled down” on her message, while aiming to clarify that she's not looking to take away anybody's children. How comforting. It is important to note that her response deals with superficiality and strategy, not substance; she still wants the state to bear the burden of responsibility and care for your child.
If families are to fulfill their intended objective by repositioning themselves as the “first line of resistance against totalitarianism” then they must emphatically and proactively object to the collectivist arguments the state uses to justify its incremental and ever-increasing intervention into the lives of those over whom it governs.
The fact that so many families have remained silent and subservient for so long speaks volumes regarding the current situation and what the future relationship of our children and the state will one day (soon) become.
The Matrix example used above is important to ponder, and that movie's story is alarmingly accurate, much like some of George Orwell's “fiction”. Those already free from the system work tirelessly to identify and liberate those who are ready to live independent of the machine. Our task is, or should be, the same.
Korean Optimus G Pro Updated To Android 4.4.2 KitKat
By Joshua Levenson
Two of the most popular Korean operators, SKT and LG U+, are in the midst of pushing out an unexpected over-the-air (OTA) update to all Optimus G Pro handsets located in South Korea. In terms of functionality, the upgrade brings Android 4.4.2 KitKat and Sense 5.5 to the device, complete with the usual plethora of bug fixes, speed optimizations and stability improvements that we've grown to expect from any major software update.
Android 4.4.2 is an incredibly major upgrade from 4.3, packing a completely redesigned user interface, SMS message integration in the standard Hangouts application, Google Now on the home screen, Wi-Fi printing capabilities for HP ePrinters and Google Print customers, autocomplete for the traditional telephone dialer, Emoji integration for Google Keyboard, built-in word processing software and lots more — to view the full list of improvements click here.
The full changelog for the rather hefty 300MB update can be seen below:
Android 4.4.2 OS upgrade.
Improved system performance.
Increased transfer speeds via MTP.
Hangout has been named as the new default messaging application.
Transparent notification bar.
Improved RAM management.
For those of you who need a refresher on the handset's profile, the Optimus G Pro was released back in February, 2013, and packs a beastly 5.5-inch Full HD IPS+ LCD capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, a Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600 chipset, 2GB of RAM, an Adreno 320 GPU, a 13-megapixel rear-facing shooter with OIS and, finally, a 3,140 mAh Li-Ion battery.
If you're in South Korea and own either a SKT or LG U+ branded Optimus G Pro and haven't yet received the OTA update, you can head into “Settings,” then “About Device,” and select “Check for Updates” to manually scan for the upgrade.
Image caption Labour has based its proposals on the Commission on Local Tax Reform
Scottish Labour has pledged to scrap the council tax, saying the current system is "unfair".
The party unveiled plans for a new form of local government tax based on property value which it said would make 80% of households better off.
Announcing the policy in Edinburgh, party leader Kezia Dugdale also proposed a tourist tax and a tax on vacant, economically inactive land.
The SNP announced planned reforms of its own earlier in the month.
Its leader Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to end the council tax freeze from 2017 and raise the four highest bands to generate funds for services.
'Fix local services funding'
Opposition parties pointed out that the SNP had pledged to abolish the tax in its 2007 manifesto, leading Ms Sturgeon to challenge them to set out their own proposals.
Ms Dugdale said Labour would "make good on the SNP's broken promise and scrap the council tax", basing her plans on the Commission on Local Tax Reform.
She said: "We will fix the funding of local services for good. It's a fair plan which means millions will pay less and those who can afford to will pay a little more.
"The SNP commissioned a report into replacing council tax and then bottled it when it was time to be radical. We have taken that report, and its research, and voters can now choose a fairer alternative to council tax."
Image caption Labour said the current system of council tax was "unfair"
How will Labour's plan work?
Under the proposals, properties worth £180,000 or less would be taxed £450, plus 0.35% of the property value.
For properties worth more than this, the portion of the value above £180,000 would attract a rate of 0.9% of the property value.
The maximum charge would be capped at £3,000, with a cap on year-on-year increases at 3%.
Labour said this would leave nearly two million households better off, with 80% paying less than they currently do.
The party's plans involve carrying out a revaluation of properties in Scotland, costing £8.5m, which the SNP decided against in its proposals. The last valuation was carried out in 1991.
'Back to the 1970s'
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the plans would "tax Scotland back to the 1970s".
She said: "Scottish Labour has become the enemy of aspiration. Going into this election, we have a government promising to put up taxes and a main opposition party saying taxpayers should be hammered even harder.
"Only we are standing up for Scotland's workers."
The Scottish Greens, who are to publish their own council tax reform ideas next week, said Labour's proposals were "welcome", but questioned the £3,000 cap.
The SNP has also to set out its plans for income tax reform, proposing to freeze rates.
Labour and the Lib Dems have both proposed immediately raising the Scottish rate of income tax by 1p across all bands to raise money for education and other local services.
Labour has also proposed a freeze on the 40p threshold throughout the next term of parliament, and wants to restore a 50p rate of income tax for people earning more than £150,000.
This summer's episodes of wildfire smoke drifting from the B.C. Interior into the Lower Mainland were “unprecedented” in their duration and the geographic area they affected, according to a Metro Vancouver staff report.
The report, which senior project engineer Francis Ries prepared for the climate action committee, noted that the regional district issued five air-quality advisories during the summer of 2017, resulting in advisories being in effect for a record 19 days.
Metro Vancouver operates the air-quality advisory service for the entire lower Fraser Valley airshed, including the Metro Vancouver region and the Fraser Valley Regional District. The B.C. Ministry of Environment issues air-quality advisories for the rest of the province.
An advisory for ground-level ozone — a main constituent of smog that is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react in sunlight — was in place July 6 and 7. An advisory for fine particulate matter from forest fires was in place July 18 and 19. Three advisories for both ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter were in effect Aug. 1-12, Aug. 29-30 and Sept. 4-9.
Hotter than usual weather combined with wildfire smoke from the Interior resulted in the high number of days with advisories.
The report compared this year's smoky conditions to what the region experienced during the 2015 wildfire season.
The levels of fine particulate matter in the air were “somewhat” lower than those measured at the height of the July 2015 wildfire advisory, “but both the duration and geographic scope of wildfire smoke impacts in 2017 significantly exceeded those experienced in 2015.”
Similar to 2015, ground-level ozone advisories had to be added to wildfire-smoke advisories. However, despite reductions in temperature and solar radiation, ground-level ozone production actually increased during two of the smoke-related advisory events. Both hot temperatures and solar radiation, which contribute to ground-level ozone production, are often reduced by the presence of smoke in the air.
The report said that the smoke may have been carrying pollutants that accelerated ozone formation.
The record-breaking season is now prompting Metro Vancouver to explicitly consider the effects of wildfire smoke when updating its Air Quality Management Plan.
“Metro Vancouver's overall air quality program will likely need to adapt in response to the regional air quality impacts of wildfires outside the region, especially if the changing climate results in increased frequency and severity of wildfires in the future,” the report stated.

Scientists monitoring the Larsen C Ice Shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula have released a startling new aerial video showing in stark relief just how wide a crack in the ice has become.
The crack is expected to give rise to one of the largest icebergs on record, sometime within the next few months, though the precise timing of the breakup is unclear.
SEE ALSO: One of the largest icebergs ever seen is even closer to breaking off Antarctica
The crack is up to 1,500 feet wide, which is slightly wider than New York's Empire State Building is tall.
The iceberg, as tracked by aerial observations and satellite data, that is likely to break off is about 1,930 square miles, or about the size of Delaware.
Researchers from Project MIDAS, led by Swansea University, have reported several rapid elongations of the crack in recent years. This footage was shot by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey as they flew over the Larsen C Ice Shelf to collect research equipment, according to a press release.
Icebergs calving off of glaciers and floating ice shelves are not by themselves unusual events.
However, many Antarctic ice shelves have been thinning as a result of climate change and other factors, and this particular iceberg is expected to be unusually large.
Malia Bouattia says it's “problematic” to consider the destruction of Israel only by means of “non-violent protest.”
The UK based National Union of Students (NUS), which speaks for seven million students and is comprised of 600 students' unions, recently elected Malia Bouattia as president (NUS's first black female Muslim president). However, the election did not come without controversy. Bouattia's radical past has been called into question as top universities in Britain look to split ties with NUS. Details of Bouattia's prior statements include:
In 2014, while speaking at a “pro-resistance” event celebrating “Gaza and the Palestinian revolution,” Bouattia asserted that it is “problematic” to consider that “Palestine will be free” only by means of “non-violent protest.” In 2011, while attending the University of Birmingham, she called the school “a Zionist outpost” with the “largest [Jewish Society] in the country.” Bouattia has also previously attacked what she called “Zionist-led media outlets,” the report said, and more recently, voted against a NUS motion condemning ISIS because it would be “blatant Islamophobia.”
Here is a video of her 2014 speech.
Bouattia tries to explain to The Guardian why she did not vote for the NUS motion to condemn ISIS, saying, “two years ago I delayed a National Executive Council motion condemning Isis – but that was because of its wording, not because of its intent. Its language appeared to condemn all Muslims, not just the terror group. Once it was worded correctly I proposed and wholly supported the motion.”
It sounds like Bouattia wants to separate ISIS from anything Islamic. The main goal is to absolve Islam from terrorist groups that claim an Islamic identity. Last year, Brigitte Gabriel, a national security expert, claimed that 15-25% of the Muslim world population is radicalized. Gabriel added, “You're looking at 180 million to 300 million people dedicated to the destruction of Western civilization.” This points to a systemic problem within Islam, not a few outliers.
Bouattia uses another common scheme of the Left, separating anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. While the two terms are not exactly identical they are often the products of the same viewpoint. Individuals that are truly anti-Semitic will often direct their hatred toward the state of Israel in order to avoid having their views dismissed. Hamas does this all the time, disguising their ‘struggle' out to be political rather than anti-Jewish.
Malia Bouattia is an example of how educational centers of higher learning are being saturated with a new kind of activism, radical Islamic apologetics. The Islamic world has a lot of youth and the jihadists know how crucial it is in reaching that sector for their mission to be successful. It is time to stop this jihad.
Recent discussions, such as Ukrainian journalist Velentina Samar's article, Russia has Opened a Crimean Front, assert that experts are now seeing the necessary preconditions for Russia engaging in a ‘Georgian scenario' with regard to Crimea. In the aforementioned article, Samar claims that there is clear evidence that such an Anschluss is already being carried out. American analyst Paul Goble was kind enough to offer translation and commentary on the scenario as well in his own article.
Samar points out the ongoing Russian pressure from trade wars to act as a lever in the region, its current involvement in the formation of a ‘fifth column', and the laying of groundwork for military deployment.
With regard to the emergence of a fifth column in Crimea, possible suitors could be neo-Cossacks, the use of Russian biker gangs, or neo-Soviet radicals in general. The issue here which requires further study is just how much popular support such groups could rally, or how effective their mobilization could be. By and large, the majority of the nation's so-called Antimaidans outside of Kiev have taken place in the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol, but not much has else has taken place in the rest of the republic. While incredible for their visual symbolism, the effectiveness of these groups remains to be seen. As Goble pointed out recently, “ethnic Russians in south-eastern Ukraine haven't pushed their own agenda or organized their own groups to push either changes within Ukraine or their own social issues.” The Russian Bloc, if used as a measure of political radicalism in Crimea, is for all intents and purposes is fringe even in the regional scene. While Ossetia was in crisis, Crimea is comparatively sleeping.
With regard to potential military involvement, Samar does allege what would be troubling developments in Crimea at the moment. Vladislav Surkov, former Deputy Prime Minister and noted supporter of Chechen leader Kadyrov, who is also known for his his involvement in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, has recently been visiting Crimea to speak with the political leadership. The discussions, she says, concern the construction of a bridge across the Kerch Strait, connecting Crimea to Russia. This, while potentially a long-term play, would allow for theoretical troop movements to take place. When Russia invaded Georgia, it did so via the Roki Tunnel.
Umland's recent article The EU should prevent the “Georgian scenario” in Ukraine, also weighs in on this topic, pointing out that notable pro-Russian politicians and activists has begun petitioning for Moscow to intervene in Ukraine to “protect” the inhabitants of the Black Sea peninsula, which holds a Russian ethnic majority. The echoes of the need to protect Russians abroad misleadingly points to the Georgian scenario and here is why: South Ossetia's population prior to invasion was 3% Russian (2,100) citizens. Abkhazia, by comparison, also had no ethnic Russian minority of note. The pretext, instead, was that much of the population (illegally) held dual Russian citizenship. A much better historical comparison of ethnic liberation as a pretext for invasion would be the Nazi occupation of the Sudetenland, in Czechoslovakia. Also, a Georgian scenario would require an armed civil conflict between the Ukrainian military and Crimean separatists, a Sudeten scenario would only require allegations of oppression.
So, is Russia really opening a Crimean Front?
Motyl illustrated recently the ineffectiveness of a separatist or occupation scenario. The ruling regime benefits more from the threat of separatism in order to receive concessions, than from actually leaving the country. The Crimea is an economic sink on the state budget, receiving considerable subsidization from Kiev. A pseudo-independent Crimea would require substantial investment and subsidization from Moscow – a Crimea within the Russian Federation would be even costlier. South Ossetia has a population of 55,000 people, while Crimea's population is nearly 2 million. That is also 2 million potential less pro-Russian voters in Ukrainian borders.The realpolitik conclusions here are straightforward from Russia's perspective. Perhaps it is too early, and sensational, to speak of a ‘Crimean Front' having already been opened.
People who wear headphones might want to ditch them while walking outside. A study finds that accidents involving pedestrians wearing the devices have tripled in recent years.
Researchers combed several sources to find incidents in the U.S. of crashes involving pedestrians and vehicles between 2004 and 2011. Searching the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google News archives and Westlaw Campus Research. They found 116 cases of death or injury involving pedestrians wearing headphones. Cases in which people were using mobile phones (including hands-free devices) were excluded.
Over the years the number of cases increased, from 16 in 2004 and 2005 to 47 in 2010 and 2011. The victims' average age was 21 and most (68%) were male. The majority (67%) were under the age of 30. Most (55%) were hit by trains, and 70% of the crashes (the bulk of which were in urban areas) ended in death.
In 74% of the cases police or eyewitness reports said the pedestrian had headphones on when hit. And 29% of reports made mention or horns or sirens going off before the crash.
China has been running the world's largest and most successful eugenics program for more than thirty years, driving China's ever-faster rise as the global superpower. I worry that this poses some existential threat to Western civilization. Yet the most likely result is that America and Europe linger around a few hundred more years as also-rans on the world-historical stage, nursing our anti-hereditarian political correctness to the bitter end.
When I learned about Chinese eugenics this summer, I was astonished that its population policies had received so little attention. China makes no secret of its eugenic ambitions, in either its cultural history or its government policies.
For generations, Chinese intellectuals have emphasized close ties between the state (guojia), the nation (minzu), the population (renkou), the Han race (zhongzu), and, more recently, the Chinese gene-pool (jiyinku). Traditional Chinese medicine focused on preventing birth defects, promoting maternal health and "fetal education" (taijiao) during pregnancy, and nourishing the father's semen (yangjing) and mother's blood (pingxue) to produce bright, healthy babies (see Frank Dikötter's book Imperfect Conceptions). Many scientists and reformers of Republican China (1912-1949) were ardent Darwinians and Galtonians. They worried about racial extinction (miezhong) and "the science of deformed fetuses" (jitaixue), and saw eugenics as a way to restore China's rightful place as the world's leading civilization after a century of humiliation by European colonialism. The Communist revolution kept these eugenic ideals from having much policy impact for a few decades though. Mao Zedong was too obsessed with promoting military and manufacturing power, and too terrified of peasant revolt, to interfere with traditional Chinese reproductive practices.
But then Deng Xiaoping took power after Mao's death. Deng had long understood that China would succeed only if the Communist Party shifted its attention from economic policy to population policy. He liberalized markets, but implemented the one-child policy —partly to curtail China's population explosion, but also to reduce dysgenic fertility among rural peasants. Throughout the 1980s, Chinese propaganda urges couples to have children "later, longer, fewer, better"—at a later age, with a longer interval between birth, resulting in fewer children of higher quality. With the 1995 Maternal and Infant Health Law (known as the Eugenic Law until Western opposition forced a name change), China forbade people carrying heritable mental or physical disorders from marrying, and promoted mass prenatal ultrasound testing for birth defects. Deng also encouraged assortative mating through promoting urbanization and higher education, so bright, hard-working young people could meet each other more easily, increasing the proportion of children who would be at the upper extremes of intelligence and conscientiousness.
One of Deng's legacies is China's current strategy of maximizing "Comprehensive National Power". This includes economic power (GDP, natural resources, energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, owning America's national debt), military power (cyberwarfare, anti-aircraft-carrier ballistic missiles, anti-satellite missiles), and 'soft power' (cultural prestige, the Beijing Olympics, tourism, Chinese films and contemporary art, Confucius Institutes, Shanghai's skyscrapers). But crucially, Comprehensive National Power also includes "biopower": creating the world's highest-quality human capital in terms of the Chinese population's genes, health, and education (see Governing China's Population by Susan Greenhalgh and Edwin Winkler).
Chinese biopower has ancient roots in the concept of "yousheng" ("good birth"—which has the same literal meaning as "eugenics"). For a thousand years, China has been ruled by a cognitive meritocracy selected through the highly competitive imperial exams. The brightest young men became the scholar-officials who ruled the masses, amassed wealth, attracted multiple wives, and had more children. The current "gaokao" exams for university admission, taken by more than 10 million young Chinese per year, are just the updated version of these imperial exams—the route to educational, occupation, financial, and marital success. With the relaxation of the one-child policy, wealthier couples can now pay a "social fostering fee" (shehui fuyangfei) to have an extra child, restoring China's traditional link between intelligence, education, wealth, and reproductive success.
Chinese eugenics will quickly become even more effective, given its massive investment in genomic research on human mental and physical traits. BGI-Shenzhen employs more than 4,000 researchers. It has far more "next-generation" DNA sequencers that anywhere else in the world, and is sequencing more than 50,000 genomes per year. It recently acquired the California firm Complete Genomics to become a major rival to Illumina.
The BGI Cognitive Genomics Project is currently doing whole-genome sequencing of 1,000 very-high-IQ people around the world, hunting for sets of IQ-predicting alleles. I know because I recently contributed my DNA to the project, not fully understanding the implications. These IQ gene-sets will be found eventually—but will probably be used mostly in China, for China. Potentially, the results would allow all Chinese couples to maximize the intelligence of their offspring by selecting among their own fertilized eggs for the one or two that include the highest likelihood of the highest intelligence. Given the Mendelian genetic lottery, the kids produced by any one couple typically differ by 5 to 15 IQ points. So this method of "preimplantation embryo selection" might allow IQ within every Chinese family to increase by 5 to 15 IQ points per generation. After a couple of generations, it would be game over for Western global competitiveness.
There is unusually close cooperation in China between government, academia, medicine, education, media, parents, and consumerism in promoting a utopian Han ethno-state. Given what I understand of evolutionary behavior genetics, I expect—and hope—that they will succeed. The welfare and happiness of the world's most populous country depends upon it.
My real worry is the Western response. The most likely response, given Euro-American ideological biases, would be a bioethical panic that leads to criticism of Chinese population policy with the same self-righteous hypocrisy that we have shown in criticizing various Chinese socio-cultural policies. But the global stakes are too high for us to act that stupidly and short-sightedly. A more mature response would be based on mutual civilizational respect, asking—what can we learn from what the Chinese are doing, how can we help them, and how can they help us to keep up as they create their brave new world?
As I drearily trekked to at 8 a.m. midterm, certainly not in the best of spirits, Great Comet's "Dust and Ashes" started playing on my phone. Feeling overwhelmed and a bit more sleep deprived than I'd care to admit, it almost brought me to tears. While the exam itself was far from the success I was hoping for, at least I was able to get a little chuckle at the fact that "Dust and Ashes" lyrics are a huge mood during times like those. Here are a few:
1. "Oh why have I been sleeping?"
You take one glance at the test and realize you should have studied infinitely times more. Who needs sleep, right?
2. "Oh God, was there something that I missed?"
You paid attention in class and studied ahead of time... so where exactly did you go wrong?
3. "Is this how I die?"
Dread and panic set in.
4. "I taste every wasted minute."
You start feeling guilty for all the time you spent watching YouTube videos of Josh Groban instead of studying.
5. "All that I know is I don't know a thing."
Yeah, that line quite accurately sums it all up.
6. "Frightened like a child, lazy and dumb."
You thought that you would know at least something. Yet alas, there you are with a blank paper and a blank mind.
7. "Furious and reckless."
Now, the anger kicks in. Why in the world did your teacher/professor have to give such a ridiculously difficult exam?
8. "Was there ever any other way my life could be?"
Would it have been better if you started studying even earlier? Should you have reread the notes just one more time?
9. "I just don't care."
You actually do care a lot, but it can be easier to act like you don't.
10. "Don't let me die while I'm like this."
You just want to make it through the exam in one piece and hope that your final grade-- and you-- can stay strong.

The People Vs the NSA
There is a tablet in my house that blinks whenever my roommate has a message. I know this because for some reason it's my job to keep it charged for her. It has front and back cameras. The built-in microphone and speakers are capable of holding a conversation in English–probably other languages as well. With what we know now, I must assume that the NSA has the ability to activate the cameras and microphone to run silently in the background, bypassing the light that indicates when the camera is in use.
The same is true of the other computers in my home, but to a lesser degree.
The desktop I'm using to write this article doesn't have a camera or a microphone. Nor does the old Dell laptop that gets used occasionally around the house. My other laptop, a newer Gateway, is equipped with a built-in camera and microphone, but I've never managed to get the microphone to work under Bodhi Linux. Not that I've tried very hard. I don't Skype or anything, so a microphone is of very little use to me.
This is probably a good thing as it means the NSA can't watch or listen to me as I use my desktop or Dell and they can't eavesdrop when I'm on the Gateway. They can only steal my bank passwords, learn where I store data online and what social networking accounts are connected with me.
If you own a computer of any type that connects to the Internet, you too have to assume the NSA is collecting your data–watching you. They are turning your computer against you. It works for them now; it's no longer your tool. This kind of takes the fun out of visiting Facebook, reading the news and, especially, sending emails.
Tommorrow, February 11th, is The Day We Fight Back. Along with at least 4,000 other sites, we'll be running a big banner at the bottom of our pages from which U.S. residents can contact their local representative to urge them to enact legislation to stop the NSA's unconstitutional spying. Those who reside outside the U.S. will be given a petition to sign which will be sent to representatives in their respective countries urging stronger Internet privacy regulations.
No matter how great our win however, it will be a hollow victory. We're coming very close to living in a police state and the damage that's already been done may take years to repair–if ever. No backing down by the spy agency or enacting of legislation by our governments will restore our assurance. Lines have been so thoroughly crossed that we can never be sure they won't be crossed again. Promises and laws are both easily broken–especially by government agencies.
The free software people's argument really look good right now. This would be the opinion, espoused by Richard Stallman and others, that all software should be totally free and include source code that is open for inspection as protection against spyware, secret back doors and the like.
Alas, even that bastion of computer freedom has been made suspect by the NSA.
As deep as the NSA has dug its tentacles into the likes of industry giants such as Microsoft, why would we assume they haven't managed to get inside some of our favorite Linux distros and/or free software applications? I would be willing to bet they have. I have no evidence; I figure it's a numbers game. Somewhere along the line, the NSA has to have been able to make the right threat or the right offer to get some developer to send our right to privacy to storage on a government server.
The only way to be sure that hasn't happened would be to examine each and every line in a GNU/Linux distro, and then compile from that examined source code. With the Linux kernel alone having over fifteen million lines of code, this task would be impossible even for someone with the technical know-how to pull it off. For humans, time is not an infinite commodity.
I no longer feel like a free citizen. I no longer feel as if this country belongs to me, my friends or my little nieces and nephews. With good reason, I feel as if I'm being watched. I feel as if we're all being watched.
At present we can find some shelter in the old axiom concerning safety and numbers. Collectively, all of our computer use is being channeled into a river of data that's too immense for even the NSA to handle, meaning that nothing I write in an email is likely to bring me to the attention of our intelligence agencies. As I write these words, however, the IT guys and gals at the NSA are busy developing better systems for processing megadata more efficiently. Safety in numbers won't last forever.
Even now, there's no shelter for those who have already fallen under the suspicious eye of our intelligence folk. All of their data is already sitting on a server somewhere ready to be sifted through. None of us can stand that scrutiny. Every single one of us has written something somewhere, on Facebook or in a private email perhaps, that can be construed as proving us guilty of any crime the government can make up, especially thought crimes that are tied to patriotism. Remember, we're supposed to love Big Brother.
I am frightened, both for my country and the world. What manner of men do things like these? To what lengths will they go? Who is there to rein them in?
Tommorrow is “The Day We Fight Back.” I expect we will win at least something from our efforts. Again, it will be a hollow victory. I will never again feel safe from the prying eyes of my government when online–no matter what assurances I am given. Remember, to the NSA, the CIA, the CSEC and GCHQ, we are each and every one of us potentially the next Osama bin Laden.
Meanwhile, every night my roommate brings me the Android tablet she received for Christmas. I dutifully plug it into the charger and leave it overnight on my desk. It's dark in my room as I sleep and the front camera points up at the ceiling and the back camera is obscured by the top of my desk, so I'm safe from being watched. But the microphone works. Sometimes I wonder if the NSA has audio files of me snoring as I sleep. Do they count the number of times I get up and go to the bathroom each evening?
Maybe I should start talking to them as I lie in bed waiting for sleep to come.

Imagine a huge electronic vacuum cleaner that would simply suck in smog, cleaning up polluted city air.
It's still a small scale model for now, but Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde says he has reached an agreement with Beijing's leaders to test his prototype in a city park next year.
The park would have a vacuum tower in the centre, fitted with ionic filters that charge and remove smog particles, blowing fresh air out of the tower's side vents. Copper coils buried underground would generate an electromagnetic field that attracts the smog particles.
“By creating a field of ions, all the particles on the nano scale get positively charged, therefore when the ground is negatively charged, you can drag them to the ground, and purify the air – 75 percent, 80 percent more clean. The great thing about the technology is that is safe. It's already being used in hospitals and it's very energy-friendly, so to have 30,000 cubic metres of clean air purified, it only uses like 30 Watts, which is like a light bulb,” says Daan Roosegarde.
And there are few cities in the world in need of cleaner air than Beijing. Decades of unrestrained growth have produced an air pollution crisis that city leaders have struggled to address.
Roosegaarde says his technology would help by producing corridors of clean air that would allow the sunlight to shine through. The version he has planned for Beijing should have a cleaning diameter of about 50 metres which would produce results almost immediately, he says. And the artist wants to take his plan one step further. Rather than waste all that smog, he wants to turn it into jewellery.
“We started to look at the smog particles and realised that most of it exists out of carbon. And what happens when you put carbon under a lot of pressure for two or three weeks, you get… diamonds. We are taking a thousand cubic metres of smog air and compressing this in a sort of smog ring, and there will be different versions, so if we compress it really, really a lot, you get like a real diamond-diamond. The largest series will be that we compress it a little bit less so it gets crystallised, so you still see it's smog, but it's beautiful and by sharing or selling a diamond ring like that, a smog ring, you donate a thousand cubic meters of clean air to the city of Beijing.”
Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a viable solution to Beijing's air pollution. Real answers would require large scale efforts to create cleaner industry, cleaner cars, and adopt an altogether different lifestyle.
He hopes, however, that his project will make a “radical statement” by allowing the city's residents to realise the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air. Furthermore, he adds, Bejing is a good place to test his technology, because it is in a valley so there isn't much wind.
Daan Roosegaarde is not new to weird ideas: he has already worked on several projects to recycle energy in unusual ways, for example this plan for a road that charges electric cars as they drive or a floor that would generate electricity when danced on.
Whether we will truly manage to make diamonds out of smog remains to be seen. In any case, for Roosegaarde, this project is a powerful symbol, an example, he says, of how one person's trash can be another person's treasure.
Most other advanced economies don't have negative gearing. The Henry review concluded that ''some people [are] likely to reduce their level of work as a result'' of these very high effective marginal tax rates. This may be one reason why the workforce participation rates of women with children, and older people, are lower in Australia than in other OECD countries. By contrast, income from most forms of investment, other than interest-bearing deposits, is typically taxed at lower rates than similar amounts of income derived from working. Income from saving through superannuation funds, and from ''geared'' investments (that is, the purchase of assets funded by borrowing) is especially lightly taxed. The Henry review calculated that, for a top-rate taxpayer, the real effective marginal tax rates (that is, after taking account of inflation assumed to average 2.5 per cent a year, and the time at which tax is payable) on income earned from superannuation savings or highly geared property investments are actually negative; while the real effective marginal tax rate on interest income from deposits can be as high as 80 per cent. As the Henry review noted, ''retirement savings are generally lightly taxed around the world'', for<!-- orginalstoryid:23715891 continue pg 4-->the good reasons that these savings are usually not as readily accessible as other forms of saving before retirement age, and that encouraging self-provision for retirement reduces the cost to other taxpayers of providing age pensions. Whether the taxation treatment of superannuation saving needs to be as generous as it now is in Australia to achieve those objectives is a moot point: in particular, it's hard to think of any compelling economic or social policy reason why income paid out of superannuation funds to people aged over 60 should be free of any income tax.
By contrast, very few other ''advanced'' economies are as generous in their tax treatment of geared investments as Australia is. In the United States, for example, investors can only deduct interest incurred on borrowings undertaken to buy property or shares up to the amount of income (dividends or rent) earned in any given financial year; any excess of interest expense over income (as in a negatively geared investment) must be ''carried forward'' as a deduction against the capital gains tax payable when the asset is eventually sold. In Australia, by contrast, where interest on borrowings undertaken to finance the purchase of a property or shares exceeds the rent or dividend income generated by those investments, that excess can be deducted against a taxpayer's other income (such as wages and salaries) thereby reducing the amount of tax otherwise payable on that other income. The Howard government's 1999 decision to tax capital gains at half the rate applicable to wage and salary income, converted negative gearing from a vehicle allowing taxpayers to defer tax on their wage and salary income (until they sold the property or shares that they had purchased with borrowed money), into one allowing taxpayers to reduce their taxation obligations (by, in effect, converting wage and salary income into capital gains taxed at half the normal rate) as well as deferring them. As a result, negative gearing has become much more widespread over the past decade, and much more costly in terms of forgone revenue.
In 1998-99, when capital gains were last taxed at the same rate as other types of income (less an allowance for inflation), Australia had 1.3 million taxpaying landlords who in total made a taxable profit of almost $700 million. By 2008-09, the latest year for which statistics are available, the number of taxpaying landlords had risen to just under 1.7 million: but they collectively lost $6.5 billion, largely because the amount they paid out in interest rose almost fourfold (from just over $5 billion to almost $20 billion over this period), while the amount they collected in rent ''only'' slightly more than doubled (from $11 billion to $26 billion), as did other (non-interest) expenses. If all the 1.1 million landlords who in total reported net losses in 2008-09 were in the 38 per cent income tax bracket, their ability to offset those losses against their other taxable income would have cost more than $4.3 billion in revenue forgone. If, say, a fifth of them had been in the top tax bracket then the cost to revenue would have topped $4.6 billion. (The revenue forgone through negative gearing was lower in 2008-09 than it was in 2007-08, because the number of taxpayers reporting rental income fell by about 51,000 (presumably as a result of the global financial crisis prompting some landlords to sell their properties), and because the substantial decline in interest rates after the onset of the financial crisis meant that fewer landlords paid more in interest than they received in net rent. The figures in the previous paragraph also exclude revenue forgone through negatively gearing of share portfolios or other investments, on which no details are available. This is a pretty large subsidy from people who are working and saving to people who are borrowing and speculating (since those landlords who are making ''running losses'' on their property investments expect to more than make up those losses through capital gains when they sell the properties.
And it's hard to think of any worthwhile public policy purpose that is served by it. It certainly does nothing to increase the supply of housing, since the vast majority of landlords buy established properties: 92 per cent of all borrowing by residential property investors over the past decade has been for the purchase of established dwellings, as against 82 per cent of all borrowing by owner-occupiers. Precisely for that reason, the availability of negative gearing contributes to upward pressure on the prices of established dwellings, and thus diminishes housing affordability for would-be home buyers. Supporters of negative gearing argue that its abolition would lead to a ''landlords' strike'', driving up rents and exacerbating the existing shortage of affordable rental housing. They point to ''what happened'' when the Hawke government abolished negative gearing (only for property investment) in 1986, claiming it led to a surge in rents, which prompted the reintroduction of negative gearing in 1988. This assertion has attained the status of urban myth. However, it is not true. If the abolition of negative gearing had led to a landlords' strike, as proponents of negative gearing usually assert, then rents should have risen everywhere (since negative gearing had been available everywhere). In fact, rents (as measured in the consumer price index) actually only rose rapidly (at double-digit rates) in Sydney and Perth. And that was because in those two cities rental vacancy rates were unusually low (in Sydney's case, barely above 1 per cent) before negative gearing was abolished. In other capitals (where vacancy rates were higher), growth in rentals was either unchanged or, in Melbourne, actually slowed. Notwithstanding this history, suppose that a large number of landlords were to respond to the abolition of negative gearing by selling their properties. That would push down the prices of investment properties, making them more affordable to would-be home buyers, allowing more of them to become homeowners, and thereby reducing demand for rental properties in almost exactly the same proportion as the reduction in the supply of them.
It's actually quite difficult to think of anything that would do more to improve affordability conditions for would-be home buyers than the abolition of negative gearing. It would certainly do more than continuing to give large amounts of cash to would-be first-time home buyers through grants or stamp duty concessions, which historically have served only to increase the prices of existing dwellings and ended up in the pockets of vendors. There's absolutely no evidence to support the assertion made by proponents of the continued existence of negative gearing that it results in more rental housing being available than would be the case were it to be abolished (even though the Henry review appears to have swallowed this assertion). Most other advanced economies don't have negative gearing: yet most other countries have higher rental vacancy rates than Australia does. In the US, which doesn't allow negative gearing, the rental vacancy rate has in the past 50 years only once been below 5 per cent (and that was in the March quarter of 1979); in the 10 years before the onset of the most recent recession, it has averaged 9.1 per cent. Yet here in Australia, which does allow negative gearing, the rental vacancy rate has never (at least in the past 30 years) been above 5 per cent, and in the period since negative gearing became more attractive (as a result of the halving of the capital gains tax rate) it has fallen from more than 3 per cent to less than 2 per cent. During that period, rents rose at a rate of 0.8 percentage points a year faster than the CPI as a whole, whereas over the preceding decade, rents rose at the same rate as the CPI. I'm not advocating that negative gearing be abolished for property investments only, as happened between 1986 and 1988. That would be unfair to property investors. I think negative gearing should be abolished for all investors, so that interest expenses would only be deductible in any given year up to the amount of investment income earned in that year, with any excess carried forward against the ultimate capital gains tax liability, rather than being used to reduce the tax payable on wage and salary or other income (as is the case in the US and most other ''advanced'' economies). But I'd settle for the recommendation of the Henry review, which was that only 40 per cent of interest (and other expenses) associated with investments be allowed as a deduction, and that capital gains (and other forms of investment income, including interest on deposits) be taxed at 60 per cent (rather than 50 per cent now) of the rates applicable to the same amounts of wage and salary income.
This recommendation would not amount to the abolition of negative gearing - it would just make it less generous. It would be likely, as the Henry review suggested, ''to change investor demand towards housing with higher rental yields and longer investment horizons [and] may result in a more stable housing market, as the current incentive for investors to chase large capital gains in housing would be reduced''. I could even accept the Henry review's recommendation that ''these reforms should only be adopted following reforms to the supply of housing and reforms to housing assistance'' that it makes elsewhere, even though I disagree with the Henry review's concern that these reforms ''may in the short term reduce residential property investment''. Sadly, these recommendations were among the 19 that the Treasurer explicitly ruled out when releasing the Henry review in May. That makes it hard to believe that this government (or indeed any alternative government) is serious about increasing the incentives to work and save - or at least, about doing so without risking the votes of those who borrow and speculate, in effect subsidised by those who don't, or can't.

Everything about this song is peak Hotep. The conspiracies about 9/11 and the Holocaust. References to Free Masons and the Illuminati. A bar where he calls science a "cult." Which is like calling gravity a "nice idea." I'm 99% sure he recorded this while rocking a tinfoil beret.

Anyway, while there's no question B.o.B. is basking in his hotepian glory, as one of America's most prominent HHNCs (head Hoteps in charge), he merely represents one end of the spectrum. Which begs the question: How exactly does one determine exactly how Hotep one is? Is there a rubric? A guidebook? If you suspect you possess some latent or Darth Hotep tendencies, how can you be sure?
I don't have any answers to any of these questions. (I'm apparently not Hotep enough to know everything.) But I do have a 10 question quiz! When done, check out your score to see where you rate!

A man left a seven-year-old girl on a street median after he fled two DUI crashes, deputies said.
Grant Mulder, 41, was arrested in Madeira Beach, Fla., after he struck a telephone pole, left the scene, left the girl on the median, hit two cars and left that scene, according to a Pinellas County Sheriff's Office news release.
Deputies first responded to the telephone pole crash at 131st Avenue and Pelican Lane, officials said. Witnesses told deputies that the airbag to Mulder's Toyota 4Runner went off, hitting the child. When witnesses tried to help the girl out of the car, Mulder drove away with the girl still inside, the release said.

Mulder then drove to Duhme Road and the Tom Stuart Causeway, where the girl got out of the SUV onto a median, and he left her there, the release said.
After leaving the girl, Mulder headed north on 113th Street where he tried to pass between two cars stopped side by side at a light at Park Boulevard, but instead hit them, according to authorities. Mulder backed up, went around the cars and continued north on 113th, the release said.
The two drivers, 18-year-old Zachary Barrett and 21-year-old Rebekah Trout, were treated on scene for minor injuries and taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment, according to the release.

Mulder was arrested after conducting a traffic stop on 113th Street and Ulmerton Road. When he was placed in the deputy's car, he tried to kick out the windows, the release said.
Mulder was charged with leaving the scene of a crash with property damage, child abuse, leaving the scene of a crash with injuries, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended or revoked license. He was released from the Pinellas County Jail on $16,750 bond.
Officials said the seven-year-old girl is known to Mulder, but are not releasing any other information that would identify her.
More South Florida Stories:
A $2 million boondoggle—er, "security system"—placed in New Jersey's Belleville High School proved its merit and unerring wisdom when it locked a teacher in a bathroom. According to NutleyWatch.com:
Since school policy is to not allow the use of cell phones, no one knew where she was, or what happened to her until they went looking for her. Luckily, the teacher was carrying her purse, with her phone inside. When her co-workers retrieved their phones to try to call her, they found that she had been frantically trying to call and text people to come help her. By the way, this is the same RFID system that the Board of Education pushed through as part of their controversial surveillance system, installed and managed by Clarity Technologies Group, at a cost of $2 million. Even worse, when they actually discovered that she was locked in the bathroom, they could not open the door by swiping with their own RFID cards because the system had malfunctioned. Apparently someone had to come and pry open the door to finally get her out.
While this particular incident occurred in April, it was apparently just one of several such mishaps. The system was ostensibly put in place to prevent another Newtown, though how it would actually accomplish that, I have no idea. A gunman bursting into the school would show up on the monitors, yes, but would also be pretty visible even without monitors.
A malfunctioning security system is a danger in and of itself, as NutleyWatch pointed out:
What if this had been a child locked in a bathroom late on a Friday afternoon, just before everyone left for the weekend? Just imagine the fear and the trauma that child might endure as a result, not to mention the ensuing lawsuit. What if this system locked 30 kids inside their own classroom during a fire? What happens to all the doors in the school when a fire knocks out the network, or melts some of the cabling? Does the entire building become a deathtrap for everyone now locked inside?
It seems like this is what happens when a school suddenly decides it needs a security system and signs a contract with a particular company—the only one that managed to get in a bid—two weeks later. (You can read about that hasty business decision here.)
Note that while the school district managed to find $2 million for the safety of its dear children, the history books it provides those same kids are so old, they don't even cover 9/11.
Odd for a school so focused on terror, isn't it?
Arizona Senator Jeff Flake (Shutterstock)
Political junkies' dreams of a contested Republican convention this year seemingly died when Texas Sen. Ted Cruz dropped out of the race after being defeated by Donald Trump in the Indiana primary. However, The Associated Press reports that GOP Sen. Jeff Flake on Tuesday raised the prospect that Republicans might still overturn the wills of their own voters by launching a challenge to Trump at this year's RNC.
“Where there's no talk of a convention challenge or anything else, this might spur it,” Flake said in talking about Trump's racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel.
Flake also dismissed any notion that Trump might really be planning to moderate himself now that GOP voters have rewarded his poor behavior by nominating him to be the most powerful man on the planet.
“Let's face it: meet the old Trump, just like the new Trump,” Flake said. “We've got what we've got. That's not somebody who can win the White House.”
Flake, for the record, is still saying that he can't support Trump right now, although he'd be open to it if Trump shows the ability to drastically change everything about his personality and temperament at the age of 69.
But that's not all: Embattled Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk said on Tuesday that he would flat-out not vote for Trump because he did not trust him with the nation's nuclear launch codes:
Given my military experience, Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or our nuclear arsenal. — Mark Kirk (@MarkKirk) June 7, 2016
Given this, it will be interesting to see how Trump responds: Will he back off… or will he is octuple down on his plans to bash Curiel for his Mexican heritage?

LOS ANGELES — In a small, shoulder-to-shoulder cubicle connected to EA Sports' other major franchises at this year's E3, fans and media alike had the opportunity to get their first glimpse of FIFA 15. It was there that producer Sebastian Enrique spoke about the rise of Major League Soccer and its transformation in their award-winning video game franchise.
Enrique is certainly no stranger to the league. He moved to America a little more than a decade ago before moving to Canada to help work on the the FIFA series at EA Vancouver. He's seen MLS at its worst — when teams were more concerned about staying afloat financially than winning a title. Now, like us all, he's witnessing a sort of “soccer renaissance” in this country where the name “MLS” carries much more weight than it once did. That may very well be one reason why EA is talking MLS more than ever before.
EA's reluctancy to focus on the league in previous years has been well documented. Licensed American stadiums have been non-existent. Players, second-rate models of their European counterparts. And who could forget blunders like “Sporting Kansas”? Enrique wouldn't say it directly, but the league's popularity has made it easy to overlook in past installments.
“We have a really good partnership with MLS,” Enrique told SBI. “MLS is always looking forward to doing things with us, and we're always looking forward to doing things with them. The reality is that we have 16,000 players in the game and we have more than 500 teams, so it's impossible to go and capture every single player.
“But for the World Cup games the entire World Cup squad for the U.S. was captured — that was a step forward. Even though I cannot tell you what is the new licensed content, in terms of faces and all of that, for (FIFA) 15, we're going to be talking about that in August.
“It's not that we are limited (though). MLS is extremely important to us, it's certainly our league. It's just tough to produce all the content in a year.”
It's getting tougher for EA to ignore MLS, however. More youth are playing the sport than ever before. More than half of the league's teams improved upon its 2012 attendance last season. Then 10 MLS players made the 2014 U.S. World Cup roster in May — up from four in 2010. It's a culmination of interest that Enrique says his team has taken notice of.
“I think there are a lot of people in the U.S. that are not super fond of the sport, but they pick it up because it's a good game to play, and they get into soccer because of that. They use that as an entertainment thing that is safe and good fun, especially with kids, and they get into the sport because of it.
“For me, it's fantastic to see, especially coming from somebody who's not originally from North America. (I'm) a South American guy whose lived football all his life. I moved to the U.S. 12 years ago, then I moved to Canada to work on FIFA. I've seen the growth in these past 10-12 years of soccer within North American and it's amazing to me.
“There are two teams coming in March, so the growth of MLS is amazing. The followers of MLS are amazing. It's something that we're not leaving behind by no shape or form.”
Enrique wouldn't budge when asked about the specific MLS content coming this year, but he was adamant that there's a clear focus on bringing a more authentic feel across the board for MLS in FIFA 15.
A boy outside the EA Sports booth was asked what he'd do if EA deliver on that promise. “I'd lose my mind,” he said with a smile on his face.
Vince McMahon has not been at any RAW and SmackDown tapings over the past two weeks, which is very out of character for the 70 year old WWE head honcho. According to the latest Wrestling Observe Newsletter, he's not expected back until next weekend's SummerSlam PPV (8/21). Vince missing multiple TV tapings is news, but it's especially noteworthy that he'll also be missing the final week of television before one of WWE's biggest shows of the year.
The Observer notes that Vince has still been in communication with his key people and called in to participate during recent production meetings. Despite not being present at the shows, Vince has continued to micro-manage virtually every detail of RAW and SmackDown throughout the day before the shows shoot.
No word yet on why Vince has been absent, but we covered back in June that he also missed the 6/20 and 6/21 tapings.

The CSU men's basketball season hasn't gone the way folks anticipated after getting off to a 5-0 start, including a win at Northern Iowa in the opener. That being said, there is still plenty for the Rams to play for during the final two months, including a conference championship.
And if Colorado State University wants to shake up the Mountain West standings, much like Wyoming did a year ago, it starts with knocking off the conference's perennial power San Diego State at 8 p.m. Wednesday inside Moby Arena.
It will be a matchup of contrasting styles. CSU is one of the highest-scoring teams in the country, averaging 82.8 points per game, while the Aztecs run more of a slow-tempo approach with a strong emphasis on defense. Their 64.5 ppg average ranks 311 out of 351 teams in the country and is down slightly from the previous three seasons.
If you're looking for something to do this week and are a fan of basketball, check this game out. With students still out of town, the Rams are going to need all the support they can get to give Moby a home-court edge.
WHEN: 8 p.m. Wednesday
WHERE: Moby Arena
Six women and a man, working for a health and education charity, have been shot dead in a drive-by shooting after they left a community centre in northwest Pakistan, police say.
The victims of Tuesday's attack were all Pakistanis attached to the community centre in a Swabi village.
The incident occured close to a junction for the highway which connects the northwestern city of Peshawar to the capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore.
Swabi district police chief Abdul Rashid Khan confirmed the seven deaths.
"They were on their way back home when unknown gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on their vehicle," he told the AFP news agency. "Six women and a man have died.
"The driver is injured. We are investigating the motives of the attack."
At least five of the women were teachers.
Last month, six women working to vaccinate children against polio were killed in co-ordinated attacks in Karachi and Peshawar.
Health officials said the team had received telephone calls warning them that they would regret helping the "infidel" campaign against polio.
The owner of a Texas mattress store has closed his store after apologizing for what he called a "tasteless" advertisement promoting a 9/11 anniversary sale.
The online ad for Miracle Mattress in San Antonio featured a woman screaming as two towers of mattresses topple.
In a statement posted to the store's social media Friday, owner Mike Bonanno said the store "will be closed indefinitely." He said the company also "will be silent through the 9/11 anniversary to avoid any further distractions from a day of recognition and remembrance for the victims and their families."
He repeated his Thursday apology, saying the online ad was produced without his knowledge by employees in San Antonio.
San Antonio Mattress Store Promotes 'Twin Towers Sale'
Cherise Bonanno, with Miracle Mattress in San Antonio, says an ad promoting the store's "Twin Towers sale" was not meant to be offensive. (Published Friday, Sept. 9, 2016)
Bonanno says he will announce next week "accountability actions" taken with the employees responsible for the ad that drew widespread criticism on social media.
In a statement titled "An Apology to All the Victims and Families of 9/11," Miracle Mattress owner Mike Bonanno wrote Thursday, "I say this unequivocally, with sincere regret: the video is tasteless and an affront to the men and women who lost their lives on 9/11. Furthermore, it disrespects the families who lost their loved ones and continue to struggle with the pain of this tragedy every day of their lives."
The video shows store manager Cherise Bonanno standing in front of two piles of stacked twin beds. She says, "What better way to remember 9/11 than with a Twin Towers sale?" Then, two men fall into the beds, causing them to tumble, while Bonanno mock yells in terror before uttering, "We'll never forget."
Mike Bonanno said the video, which has since been removed from the company's Facebook page, was posted without his knowledge or approval and that, "Over the next several days, we will determine an appropriate response to express our regret and support for the 9/11 victims and their families."
Cherise Bonanno said the 20-second ad was a bad idea and they didn't realize it would cause controversy.
"We are not hate, we are love. We are somebody that stands out. We're Miracle Mattress, we make miracles happen. For our lives to be in danger, that's no what we ever wanted," Cherise Bonanno said. "It was stupid. It was a stupid idea that we sent out. And we apologize for our stupidity and we really hope you can forgive us for what we've done."
The company said they'll donate 30 percent of their sales this weekend to the 9/11 Foundation.

The first modern Olympic Games was held in the summer of 1896 in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens, that saw the participation of 241 athletes from 14 nations. It was the largest international sporting event till date, and the Panathinaiko Stadium, which had a capacity of 80,000 at that time, overflowed with the largest crowd ever. The main events of the competition were athletics, gymnastics, weightlifting and wrestling, with the highlight being the marathon, held for the first time in international competition, and won by a Greek and the only sporting event to be won by the host. But the stadium's history goes far beyond the 19th century. Indeed, it is one of the oldest stadiums in the world.

The current Panathenaic Stadium is believed to be located on the site of an ancient stadium that hosted the Panathenaic Games, modeled after the ancient Olympic Games and held every four years in honor of the Goddess Athena. The games incorporated religious festival, ceremony and cultural events, aside from athletic competitions such as boxing, wrestling, mock infantry and cavalry battles, javelin throw on horseback, and a peculiar chariot racing where the driver had to jump out of the chariot, run alongside, and jump back in. These games started in 566 BC and continued into the 3rd century CE.
Originally the stadium was a small natural valley between the two hills of Agra and Ardettos, the slopes of which were fitted with wooden seating for the spectators. It was transformed into a proper stadium built completely with marble in 329 BC, by Lycurgus when he assumed responsibility for the finances of Athens.
Between 140 and 144 AD, the stadium was enlarged and renovated by Herodes Atticus, who spent part of his vast fortune on erecting splendid buildings in many sanctuaries and cities around the Roman Empire. Herodes changed the original rectilinear shape of the stadium to a horseshoe shape, characteristic of Greek stadia in Roman times, and installed rows of seats of white marble. A vaulted passage under the east retaining wall terminated at the back of the stadium. A triple-arched marble bridge spanning the the Ilissos River provided access to the stadium from the city. The whole space, and primarily the portico at the level of the sphendone, was adorned with statues of marble, bronze and even gold. The Athenians were justly proud of the Panathenaic Stadium, which was unrivalled in the world.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the stadium gradually fell into disrepair. It wasn't until 1,500 years later that Greek philanthropist and businessman Evangelos Zappas provided the funds to excavate and refurbish the stadium as part of a goal to revive the Olympic Games. Panathenaic could not be made ready in time for the first Olympic Games in 1859, and it had to be held in a city square in central Athens. But by the time for the 1870 games, Panathenaic was restored with wooden beaches having a seating capacity of 30,000. The stadium went on to host the 1875 and 1888-89 games as well.
Unfortunately, Evangelos Zappas didn't live to see any of the games at the Panathenaic, but the immense fortune he left behind made it possible for the Panathenaic to undergo a second repair. This time the wooden seats were removed and replaced with white marble, just like in the original stadium. The International Olympic Committee was created in 1894 and the first modern Olympic Games was held here in 1896. Panathenaic held its second Olympic Games in 2004. The archery finals took place here, and the marathon race terminated inside the stadium. It's unlikely, that the Panathenaic will ever hold athletic events as its running tracks are curved at awkward angles that doesn't conform to today's standards. Today, the stadium regularly holds musical concerts.

Tuesday marks the launch of the U.S.–China Climate Leaders Summit, a two-day bilateral meeting that will recognize and cement the climate contributions of American and Chinese states, municipalities, and companies. The summit follows November's agreement between the world's two largest polluters: a deal that could turn the U.S.–China climate game from finger-pointing to one-upmanship.
Among other steps, the Climate Leaders Summit promises to deliver a declaration signed by a slew of American and Chinese cities and states that will commit the signatories to “ambitious, verifiable” climate actions, according to a White House fact sheet. Subnational and non-state actors are becoming increasingly important in the fight against climate change, especially as climate hawks urge faster progress in what can be a “painfully slow” diplomatic approach to the problem. While the traditional solution to anthropogenic global warming is often conceptualized along these lines — that is, as a multilateral Holy Grail for legally compelling governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an equitable, planet-saving manner — international agreements are hard to strike, and meanwhile, plenty of local governments and private sector players are already pulling their climatic weight.
For its part, China is expected to announce peak emission dates for several heavily polluting cities, including Beijing and Guangzhou. In particular, these cities have declared they will reach an emissions crest “by the end of or around 2020,” reports the White House. While China recently told the U.N. it would endeavor to reach a maximum rate for its national carbon emissions by 2030, it's easy to feel a twinge of skepticism toward this claim. (The country is, after all, the largest emitter in the world, and economic slowdown — not that six or seven percent growth is particularly slow! — is perhaps cause for quick and dirty solutions.) If China does indeed peak its Beijing emissions in five years, however, the nationwide 2030 number is a lot more credible.
Other expected announcements include Chinese carbon-market training programs, smart-grid pilot projects in Wuhan, the design and construction of a version of Berkeley's building-energy simulator in China, and expanded clean-energy trade initiatives between Los Angeles, Guangdong, and Shenzhen. Additional U.S. declarations include Seattle's commitment to complete carbon neutrality by 2050 and California's commitment to an 80–90 percent cut of 1990 emission levels by the same year. Given that the California state legislature just voted to not actually do that, though, some of the announcements can still rub as a bit more aspirational than genuine.
But subnational action does add up quickly: July summits in Lyon and Toronto brought forth joint commitments between 20 state and regional governments representing 220 million people and over $8 trillion in GDP. “And since these Summits we've got double that amount of governments coming forward with climate commitments,” said Libby Ferguson, States & Regions Director for The Climate Group, an international clean technology and climate policy advocacy group, in a video interview. Serious climate action on behalf of cities could save up to $17 trillion globally by 2050, according to a recent report.
The Obama administration's recent push on climate contributions notwithstanding, the Climate Leaders Summit is the first time the White House has acknowledged that the state and local level is “where they matter most.” In late August, the White House called for 100 U.S. cities to sign on to the Compact of Mayors, an international climate coalition of local governments, before the U.N. climate negotiations in December of this year. Despite relentless Republican obstructionism at the national level, subnational coalitions and NGOs like Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), C40, and the Compact of Mayors continues to register climate actions, and current commitments represent governments responsible for nearly two gigatons of CO2 equivalent annually.
Yet while subnational and non-state actions can indeed help turn the tide, they, too, require organization, accounting, and accountability. Above all else, then, the Climate Leaders Summit is the latest push toward ensuring these criteria are met. And by actually getting some action on the table, governments can demonstrate that entities within their borders are working toward closing the woefully gaping chasm between current national declarations and the commitments necessary for limiting warming to below two degrees Celsius. If we want a meaningful global deal, that chasm needs to be bridged.
The Nationals have little in the way of glaring needs and could seek to defend their NL East crown with relatively few moves. But some big-picture issues are now squarely in focus, and significant change could occur for the first time in several years.

Free Agents
Another NL East crown, another gut-wrenching loss in the NLDS. That scenario pains Nationals fans, but probably does little to dissuade GM Mike Rizzo from his path. After all, most of his recent moves have turned out swimmingly for Washington. Brimming with talent at nearly every position, most of it still in prime years, the Nats would undoubtedly be among the favorites to take the 2015 World Series even if they did not make a single outside addition to the roster.
But as three straight years of disappointment – twice in the playoffs, once in failing to make them – have demonstrated, no assembly of talent is good enough. That alone is motivation for change. More significant, though, is the ticking of the service clocks of several core players who have driven the most successful run of any Washington, DC-based MLB team since the mid-1920s Senators.
As always, payroll is an important factor as well. Owner Mark Lerner said early in 2014 that the club was “beyond tapped out” in terms of player salary, but it is already on track to top last year's nearly $137MM Opening Day tab. As things stand for 2015, the club has about $94MM in guarantees on the books before adding in the approximately $50MM in arb commitments outlined above. Of course, public statements must be taken with a grain of salt, particularly for a team with an ongoing TV rights fee dispute (the results of which could make a big difference in spending capacity) and many potential extension discussions to be had. But it remains to be seen what kind of flexibility Rizzo will have to work with.
Ultimately, the Nationals could just plug needs while exploring a few extension scenarios. Or the club could pursue bold, opportunistic moves that could serve the present while setting things up down the line. Let's canvas the roster to identify the areas of opportunity and pressure points.
The outfield is the most straightforward area. Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth are locks for the two corner spots. And center fielder Denard Span's $9MM option is certain to be exercised after a quality season from the 30-year-old. Youngster Michael Taylor is waiting in the wings up the middle, and the more advanced Steven Souza seems ready to contribute in a corner role, and Nate McLouth is set to return from a disappointing, injury-shortened first season in D.C. That group offers sufficient flexibility that trade possibilities cannot be discounted; the likeliest scenario, perhaps, would involve Souza going as part of a deal to address another area, though there could be some temptation to explore a trade involving Span to take advantage of a weak free agent crop of center fielders. (Of course, there are not necessarily that many teams in position to aggressively pursue new center fielders, either.)
In the infield, Wilson Ramos remains entrenched behind the plate, with Jose Lobaton locked in as the back-up. And Ian Desmond is unquestionably set to play short, though he will be entering his final year of team control. One of several still-youthful veterans who will reach free agency after the coming season, Desmond appears the most likely to ink a long-term extension. (Desmond has said he expects to stay with the team for the long run, though he reportedly turned down a seven-year extension last offseason that would have guaranteed him somewhere in the range of $85MM to $98MM.)
Ryan Zimmerman figures to move from his natural third base across to first, taking over for Adam LaRoche. Zimmerman's inability to stick at third represents a significant downgrade in his value, though his bat is still solid and he has shown some promise of playing a serviceable corner outfield if need be. As for LaRoche, his $15MM mutual option seemed a reasonable value, but he just did not fit on the roster and will be allowed to walk (unencumbered by a qualifying offer) as a free agent.
The Nats would surely prefer to be weighing their options at first while fielding Zimmerman at third and emerging star Anthony Rendon at second. But that is not to be, and the resulting situation is not without its flexibility. Rendon's bat is good enough to play anywhere on the diamond, and he showed the ability to add value with his glove at both second and third over the course of 2014. Washington will probably angle to add a player to take over at the keystone, keeping Rendon at his natural third base for the long haul, but could jump on a third baseman if the right opportunity presented itself. (The team was said to have interest in Adrian Beltre at the trade deadline, and I believe it could likewise be interested in an option like Chase Headley if he could be had on a short-term contract, though that seems unlikely.)
If the Nationals go looking for a second baseman, while keeping their eye on third, what are their options? The only internal option – former starter Danny Espinosa — is not reliable in the batter's box against righties, though he could theoretically form a very good left-handed side of a platoon. His offensive upside, defensive prowess, young age, and relatively low cost makes him a player that the Nationals will not give away in trade, but neither is he a full-time option for a contender.
The free agent market is largely unappealing, being headed by players such as Asdrubal Cabrera (who had a late run with the Nats after the trade deadline) and Jed Lowrie. I do not see Rizzo committing to that kind of player on a lengthy deal, though he could jump on a shorter pact if it becomes an option. (Rizzo was willing, for instance, to give two years to Nate McLouth as a fourth outfielder, and could theoretically add a second baseman who would eventually become more of a utility option.) Bounceback candidate Stephen Drew could make sense, as the righty-masher would pair nicely with Espinosa.
There are more intriguing names that will at least potentially be available on the international scene. Korean star Jung-ho Kang could be posted, while no fewer than three well-regarded Cuban second baggers — Jose Fernandez, Hector Olivera, and Andy Ibanez (links to posts)– have (or may have) left their home island with intentions of ultimately landing MLB contracts. It is hard to know at this point what level of interest the Nationals, or other teams, will have in that group, however, and it remains to be seen precisely which of those players will be ready not only to sign but also to contribute on the MLB level in 2015.
Another possibility, of course, is for the Nationals to explore the trade market. Ben Zobrist of the Rays and Howie Kendrick of the Angels would seem to be fits, if they are made available, while Brandon Phillips is at least a hypothetical possibility if the Reds eat a good bit of salary. Alternatively, the Nationals could look to kill two birds with one stone. The team has indicated it is interested in adding a young shortstop to serve as depth and provide an alternative if a long-term deal cannot be reached with Desmond. While there may be an element of posturing there, the fact is that the system lacks any plausible younger options at the spot. A player such as Brad Miller of the Mariners or Didi Gregorius of the Diamondbacks could slot in at second while also serving as a long-term shortstop option. (Again, it does not hurt that Espinosa constitutes a platoon option to both of those left-handed hitters.)
What could the Nationals deal to bring such a return? Other than Souza — who could be a long-term piece but who does not have a path to a starting job for some time — pitching seems the likeliest area. The Nats could dangle any number of their better young arms, depending upon the return and the team's overall strategy, and Rizzo has shown a willingness to use his prospects to barter. Among the prospect crop, high-upside Lucas Giolito, top-100 arm A.J. Cole, an emerging (and perhaps underappreciated) Blake Treinen, and several younger hurlers all hold appeal.
Of course, it bears noting that last year's two most effective starters, Jordan Zimmermann and Doug Fister, are each playing on expiring contracts. If an extension is not to be had, then the possibility of movement must at least be considered. Zimmermann, in particular, spiked his performance level last year after turning down a reported five-year, $85MM extension offer. While it would be tough to deal away the homegrown star, it could make sense if he brought back a useful big league piece with greater control rights. The Mariners (Miller) and Red Sox (Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts) would presumably have both the interest in the arm and the types of chips that would interest the Nats, though it is far from clear that a mutually agreeable swap could be arranged. Chances remain fairly low that any of the Nats' starters will be dealt, though if a blockbuster did go down, I would expect the Nationals to immediately become a player for a high-upside arm of some kind in free agency.
In all likelihood, last year's front five will remain in place. In addition to Zimmermann and Fister, Stephen Strasburg could also be approached about an extension, though it's not clear how much traction can be expected given that he is represented by Scott Boras. Otherwise, the team will probably hope for a rebound from Gio Gonzalez (though his 3.57 ERA was hardly poor, and was backed by a 3.02 FIP) while crossing its fingers that Tanner Roark does not turn into a pumpkin.
Of course, five is never enough pitchers for a full season. A significant free agent addition seems unlikely unless a trade or injury intervenes, though a minor league depth signing would make good sense. First up among internal options may be Treinen, the righty with a huge sinker who impressed in spot duty in 2014. Ross Detwiler is still under club control, though he has occupied an increasingly marginal position and could be trade fodder. Otherwise, Taylor Jordan will look to return from season-ending elbow surgery to remove bone chips and the Nats will continue to filter up a fairly promising set of young arms.
The bullpen, too, could carry forward in much the same form or could see some changes. Rafael Soriano is out at closer, and is all but certain to find a new home. Drew Storen, with Tyler Clippard behind him, remain the likeliest late-inning pairing, though this could theoretically be the year that the rumors come true and one is dealt. (Certainly, they will not be cheap to keep in tandem.) It would also not be surprising to see the Nationals try to add to a strong group; indeed, MLBTR's Steve Adams suggests the team as a reasonable bidder for top relief arm David Robertson, and I agree that is a possible area that the Nats could look to upgrade — as they did two years ago with Soriano — given its lack of obvious areas for improvement. Otherwise, Craig Stammen and Aaron Barrett should form a solid middle-inning grouping, with Treinen also potentially a factor in the pen. Some combination of Jerry Blevins, Matt Thornton, Detwiler, and Xavier Cedeno will do the left-handed relieving. At least one right-handed addition would make sense, and the club could consider pursuing a solid veteran such as Burke Badenhop or Casey Janssen to add some solid depth.
Once again, 2015 provides ample opportunity for Rizzo to get creative. His sweet spot has been high-value, above-average regulars (Span, Fister, Blevins) and buy-low, high-ceiling prospects (Rendon, Cole, Giolito, Erick Fedde). I expect that he will again go hunting for value, while preparing for unexpected opportunities to arise, as he figures out how to fill the hole at second and deal with the running service clock of some of the team's best players. But the pressure is on now to win while also keeping the window open for a still-young roster, and Rizzo will need to do it without trusted lieutenant Bryan Minniti. In a way, it's his greatest challenge yet.
For two years, Impossible Foods founder and CEO Patrick Brown managed to keep a pretty good secret.
While food industry analysts guessed at when innovative meat-alternative companies would be able to scale their production, Brown and his team quietly continued tinkering away at the taste of their faux-beef product—made of wheat, coconut oil, potatoes, and heme, an iron-containing compound found in plants and meat.
But Brown has now decided to pull the trigger. In an announcement today, the Bay Area company said it was close to finishing a large-scale production facility in Oakland, California that can produce as much as 1 million lb (454,000 kg) of meatless meat a month. Assuming a patty that's the same weight as what's in erstwhile rival McDonald's famous flagship bun… well, that's a lot of burgers.
“We score zero points if a vegan or vegetarian buys our burger.”
And Brown intends to be aggressive. “We'll probably be within an hour's drive of most of the US population by the end of the year,” he told Quartz, but declined to say which restaurant chains have agreed to incorporate Impossible Foods burger into their menus. “We're dead serious about our mission. That means any food product that currently is produced using animals, we intend to create a product that can compete.”
The new facility is not only a milestone for Impossible Foods, but also an inflection point for the fledgling industry that produces meat alternatives. In constructing an operation that can churn out that much non-meat meat, Impossible Foods has upped the ante for its closest rivals, sending a signal that it's ready to enter the market with full force, with a focus on supplying its product to fast casual restaurants and chains.
The new space will allow Impossible Foods to produce 250 times more product than it's currently making, enough to service 1,000 restaurants.
The future is coming
Brown and his team will have plenty of competition. In restaurants alone, more than 5 billion lb of ground beef are consumed every year. And then there's the other meat-alternative companies that have charged into the space. Beyond Meat is another high-profile faux-beef company that's looking to make inroads into the retail market, and Memphis Meats announced last week it created the world's first meatless chicken tenders made from self-reproducing cells.
Until now, Impossible Foods has slowly entered the market by popping up in high-profile restaurants in New York City and San Francisco. The goal, though, is to get in front of the most devout meat lovers. In fact, that's part of Brown's metric for success. Forget the people obsessed with vegetables.
“Our definition of success is: we score zero points if a vegan or vegetarian buys our burger,” Brown says. “The more of a meat lover they are, the more they are our target customer.”
The company's market research has shown that even the most devoted American meat eaters will never stop wanting it—but they would be interested in a product that tastes just as good and is also made of plants, Brown says. In other words, a product that comes from an animal is not part of the intrinsic value of a burger. It's more about how delicious, nutritious, and affordable that product is.
As for getting in front of people, Impossible Foods' scale-up comes just in time for baseball season, which begins April 3. The company's product will be served at Public House in AT&T Park in San Francisco, as well as KronnerBurger and Vina Enoteca starting this week. It will also soon be on the menu at Bareburger locations along the East Coast.
Chef Rocco Scordella, of Vina Enoteca, says he's been cooking for Impossible Foods' private events for months, and that he's looking forward to adding the beef alternative to his menu—initially as burger sliders, with plans to expand upon it.
“I use it in many different ways,” Scordella says. “I make burgers, I make meatballs, we make bolognese sauce with it.” And he's optimistic about what he's working with. “It's the future of food, personally,” he adds.
Demographic Decline Feeds into the Global Skills Shortage
The skilled worker pinch is being felt from Europe to the Anglosphere to Asia to Africa to Russia to Latin America. An increasingly high tech global economic base requires large numbers of well trained and adaptable workers to support the needed infrastructures. But in a world where more capable peoples are dying out and less capable peoples are moving in to take their places, it will become more difficult to find skilled, adaptable workers of high aptitude and reliability.
In Russia
While Russian officials and international commentators are noting increased concern at the state of the Russian economy and the worsening situation for its vast labor force, numerous jobs have gone unfilled, even in national security-related enterprises. … Dmitry Medvedev noted in 2014 that “trained and skilled workers and laborers are now sorely lacking in virtually all (industrial) sectors…We need to change stereotypes about the low prestige of these professions.” __ http://www.realclearworld.com/blog/2016/03/russia_cant_find_enough_skilled_workers_111746.html
This lack of skilled workers is only a part of Russia's ongoing demographic tragedy, which is simultaneously seeing a significant shrinkage in the number of women of child-bearing age and the number of healthy men able to serve in Russia's struggling armed forces.
In Asia
A Manpower Group survey shows that 48% of employers had difficulty filling vacancies in Asia in 2015, compared to 28% in 2006. Meanwhile, university graduates, including 45% in South Korea, are struggling to find jobs. __ http://economia.icaew.com/opinion/february-2016/addressing-the-skills-shortage-in-asia
In the US
The US falls near the middle of the pack in terms of difficulty filling skilled worker jobs. The problem is finding qualified and experienced applicants for particular jobs. Many people with academic credentials may lack the experience, professionalism, and work ethic required to see a difficult job through to the finish.
The US has the advantage of being able to attract skilled applicants from around the world. But due to a sub-par government educational system — and the lack of meaningful apprenticeship positions and secondary level vocational training — much local talent is being squandered.
Average Global IQ is In Steady Decline
The Lynn – Flynn effect is unable to counteract the global decline in average human IQ, for many reasons. As a result, the skilled manpower shortage is likely to grow steadily worse over the next several decades. Intelligent and skilled workers from the third world and emerging nations such as Russia are likely to continue to flee their homelands for more profitable pastures abroad. Poor and low IQ nations will lose their most talented people at an accelerating rate.
If Putin and Xi can be prevented from starting World War III, we are likely to see an increasingly stratified global picture, with the Anglosphere pulling ahead of an increasingly multicultural Europe, followed by China, Japan / South Korea, then India, then Turkey / Russia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, with Africa and the rest of the third world acting as a growing drag on the global economy and human progress.
Online Training Will Prove a Stopgap Measure
For persons with aptitude and self-discipline, online training can overcome difficulties of transportation, high tuition, and the need to work set hours. This will help to offset some of the human skills shortages. In addition, trained mid-level persons will increasingly substitute for higher level professionals as needs develop, using both online and offline training.
But when the human substrate cannot comprehend the necessary knowledge, nor develop the crucial competencies needed for the job, skills shortages will grow — and the infrastructure will suffer strain and eventual breakdown.
Resilient and Dangerous Communities Can Form Nuclei of Competence
As the dysgenic Idiocracy grows and infrastructures collapse, islands of competence can bridge the quagmires of decay and degeneracy. These islands — or nuclei — of competence need to be built now, while there is the time and talent to do so.
Dangerous Children learn how to build Networked Dangerous Communities in their childhood training, and how to instill robust resilience and anti-fragility into such networked communities. These are not easy or prevalent skills, and many of the skills involved will seem counter-intuitive and even extreme to most complacent persons of the modern age. For many, it is too late to introduce them to the problems, much less to convince them.
Time is passing, and the need to prepare — to make provisions — for the future grows.
Nearly three out of four Canadians oppose the idea that government employees should be fired as a result of Quebec's proposed Charter of Values, according to a poll released Tuesday.
The CTV-Ipsos Reid poll, surveying more than 1,000 people online across the country, found that 72 per cent of Canadians disagreed that "public servants like teachers, health-care workers and others should be fired from their jobs if they insist on wearing religious symbols and clothing at work," and 28 per cent were in agreement.
Support was highest in Quebec, where the proposed ban would be in effect, with 38 per cent agreeing workers should be fired. Still, 62 per cent disagreed.

"I think it's a question that the [Parti Québécois] hasn't fully laid out for anybody," John Wright, senior vice-president at Ipsos Reid, said. "What is the consequence of a public servant defying the charter?"
He said Quebec's governing party should clarify whether workers who breach the charter rules would be fired, fined, ticketed or charged with an offence.
"It kind of puts it in perspective that the Charter of Values has been a conceptual debate," Mr. Wright said. "But the rubber has to hit the road at some point."
Outside of Quebec, support for firing employees remained the same – at about 28 per cent – in all provinces except British Columbia and Atlantic Canada, where only 22 per cent and 16 per cent agreed, respectively.
Foreign-born Canadians were more likely to agree that public servants should lose their jobs for wearing religious symbols. About 35 per cent agreed, seven points higher than the national average.
A larger percentage of men also agreed that public-sector workers should be let go for defying the charter. While only 22 per cent of women agreed, the number was at 35 per cent for men.
The online survey has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points nationally. The credibility interval for Quebec is 6.0.

Mr. Wright said the poll results show that, though it may be favoured by some in theory, the Charter of Values has little support when it comes down to actual consequences.
"You don't even really have a strong conviction among those in Quebec that this should be the case," he said, pointing out that among supporters in Quebec, only 13 per cent were "strongly" in favour of firing. "I think that it's a soft agreement."
SS Tjisalak SS Tjisalak in 1917 History Owner: Java-China-Japan Lijn Launched: 1917 Fate: Sunk 1944 General characteristics Tonnage: 5,787 tons
SS Tjisalak was a 5,787-ton Dutch freighter with passenger accommodation built in 1917 for the Java-China-Japan Lijn and used by the Allies during World War II to transport supplies across the Indian Ocean between Australia and Ceylon. On 26 March 1944, she was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-8 while traveling unescorted. The freighter's crew were subsequently massacred in an infamous naval war crime.
The Sinking [ edit ]
Tjisalak was sailing from Melbourne and Colombo with a cargo of flour and mail.[1] The crew of 80 consisted of Dutch, Chinese and English merchant seamen, plus ten Royal Navy gunners manning the ship's four-inch gun. Also on board were five passengers (including an American Red Cross nurse, Mrs. Verna Gorden-Britten) and 22 Laskar sailors returning to India after the loss of their ship. Tjisalak had been travelling for 19 days, when her captain became confused by an unusual wireless message from Perth, and changed his course, sailing at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph) to conserve fuel. At 5:45 am on 26 March 1944, she was struck by a torpedo from I-8.[2]
One passenger, a Lieutenant Dawson from Australia, was killed instantly, and the ship began to list to port. The order was given to abandon ship. Most of the crew obeyed, taking to the ship's boats and liferafts, but the British gunners and the Dutch gun commander, second officer Jan Dekker, remained on board, waiting for the Japanese submarine to appear and opened fire. I-8 responded with her own deckgun, forcing the gunners to abandon ship.
The Massacre [ edit ]
Once in the water, the 105 survivors were collected by the Japanese, who placed them on I-8's deck and ordered Captain Hen into the conning tower to confer with the Japanese commander, Tatsunosuke Ariizumi. Survivors reported Hen as shouting "No, no, I don't know." At that moment, a Chinese sailor slipped into the water and was shot.
The Japanese then tied the survivors together in pairs and walked them aft around the conning tower, where they were attacked with various weapons. Four men jumped or fell from the submarine while being attacked and survived the random gunfire from three Japanese sailors seated behind the conning tower. These were Chief Officer Frits de Jong, Second Officer Jan Dekker, Second Wireless Operator James Blears and Third Engineer Cees Spuybroek. A Laskar named Dhange also survived the massacre.
After the Japanese had killed all but about twenty of the prisoners, they tied the remainder to a long rope, pushed them overboard, and then submerged. Dhange, the last man on the tow rope, managed to free himself before he drowned.[3]
The Survivors [ edit ]
The survivors swam several miles through the open ocean back to the location of the sinking, where they found an abandoned liferaft. Three days later they spotted a distant shape, which approached them. She was an American Liberty ship, SS James O. Wilder. After briefly firing on them by mistake, the Americans rescued the survivors and took them to Colombo.
As merchant seamen, the Tjisalak survivors were ineligible for treatment at both the British military and civilian hospitals, and had to arrange for accommodations at their own expense.
Aftermath [ edit ]
The crew of I-8 committed similar atrocities against the crew of the Liberty ship SS Jean Nicolet, and possibly other ships from which no one survived. Captain Ariizumi committed suicide when Japan surrendered in August 1945, but three members of the crew were located and prosecuted for their participation. Two were convicted and served prison terms which were commuted by the Japanese government in 1955. The third was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against his former shipmates.

Most of those inside the mosque were young boys and girls, local media said At least 12 people have been killed and 160 wounded in an explosion at a mosque in southern Iran, local media reported. Authorities in the city of Shiraz were investigating the blast, which some early reports had blamed on a bomb. But a local police chief told Fars news agency that he had ruled out sabotage, and that "negligence" involving old war munitions might be the cause. The explosion occurred at about 2100 (1630 GMT) on Saturday and was heard a mile (1.5km) away, the agency reported. "The incident could have happened as a result of negligence. A while ago at this site there was an exhibition commemorating the [1980-1988] Iran-Iraq war," Commander Ali Moayeri, police chief of Fars province, told Fars news agency. "The munitions left at the site could have the been the reason for this explosion," he added. The agency said he ruled out any act of sabotage. Weekly meeting Most of those inside the Hoseyniyeh Shohada mosque when the explosion took place were young boys and girls affiliated to the Rahpoyan-e Vesal Association, which "holds weekly meetings every Saturday regarding misguided groups, including Wahhabis and Bahais", Fars said. The Irna news agency said the blast broke the windows of many nearby houses. Television channels urged people in Shiraz to donate blood for the injured Members of the Law Enforcement Force and the Basij militia placed a cordon around the mosque, while ambulance and fire crews worked to help the victims. Television channels urged people in Shiraz to donate blood for the injured, adding that all nurses in the city had been called in on duty. Shiraz, about 900km (560 miles) south of the capital Tehran, is a major tourist destination because of its closeness to a number of important ancient sites. It has not been a target of the isolated bomb attacks which have occurred in Iran in recent years. The last major bombing, in the south-eastern city of Zahedan in February last year, is believed to have been carried out by the Sunni Baluchi militant group, Jundallah. Thirteen members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed when a car bomb exploded next to the bus in which they were travelling. The south-western city of Ahwaz, close to the Iraqi border, has seen sporadic anti-government violence since 2005, allegedly by its ethnic minority Arab population.

This article details the number of coins in each roll for all denominations as well as the face and melt value for those coins where applicable.
5 of the rarest and most valuable U.S. Coins
The US has produced a large number of coins in its history, with many of them discontinued due to age or mint errors, and sometimes even as part of a change in government policies. Various collectors around the world now possess many of these historic coins, and some of them are so rare that for a long time their existence was considered folklore.
However, the advance of time and the growing interest in numismatics has brought some of these rare coins back into the fore, as more people start to dig them out of their collections. Below is a list of some of the rarest US coins you can find to date and their values.
U.S. Coin Market Is Strong & Vibrant
If you had to picture one of the fastest growing markets in the country, perhaps the last thing you would think about is the rare coin market - yet it is undoubtedly one of the largest growing investors markets in the country. Every year billions of dollars change hands as coins are bought and sold by collectors in both public and private auctions.
The market is hard to follow as not many people are interested in the strength of the market or how trade was affected on a month-to-month basis. It is possible though, to paint a picture of what the market looks like today, and what it may evolve into in the future as it continues to grow.
Collecting coins is slowly becoming one of the world's greatest past times. As more and more people get involved in this lucrative hobby, buying and selling rare coins is becoming all the rage in certain circles, especially as many coins are hard to find.
Knowing the value of your coins is essential when you want to sell or even purchase them. That is where coin grading comes into play. Before you begin a lucrative coin exchange, you need to understand exactly what coin grading is and why it is important. This article will shed some light on the subject.
OK you've spent years possibly decades creating a collection. Or maybe you've just inherited a few coins from Grandma, Grandpa, or your Aunt Mildred.
Whatever the case may be you are interested in trading them in for for cash. Let me first tell you what not to do. Don't take them to a pawn shop, don't take them to a "Cash 4 Gold" type of store (unless they are Cull), and for heavens sake..don't spend them at face value.

Merry Christmas and/or Happy Holidays to everyone! With the 2014 NFL regular season nearly complete, and the Miami Dolphins eliminated from the playoffs (though within reach of their first winning season since 2008), I thought it might be time to put together my wish list for 2014.
Free Agents to Re-Sign
Samson Satele, center - One of the top needs for the Dolphins this year has to be adding depth to the offensive line, and, hopefully, finding a guard or two who can slide into the starting lineup. Mike Pouncey should be moved back to his center role, with Satele a depth option if/when needed.
Jared Odrick, defensive tackle - Odrick is only 26 years old. Miami has to bolster their defensive interior this offseason, something that is letting them down this last portion of the season. Re-signing Odrick could prevent a complete re-build of the unit.
Charles Clay, tight end - There is no question the Dolphins need to re-sign their starting tight end. Clay has been invisible for much of the year as he has battled injuries, but the Miami offense needs Clay.
Jimmy Wilson, safety - The Dolphins have been grooming Wilson as a safety while using him as a nickel cornerback. The 2015 season may be the year that Wilson actually becomes a permanent safety. Even if he is still a reserve at the position, he gives the team flexibility.
A.J. Francis, defensive tackle / Derrick Shelby, defensive end / Michael Thomas, safety (Exclusive Rights Free Agents) - Francis has shown potential when he has been healthy. Shelby is a solid depth player at defensive end. If he was an unrestricted free agent, I probably would allow him to sign somewhere else, freeing up playing time for Dion Jordan and/or Chris McCain, but signing Shelby to a ERFA tender makes sense. Michael Thomas gives the Dolphins flexibility similar to Wilson above.
Salary Cap Cuts
(Some of these contracts could be restructured, allowing the team to retain the player.)
Dannell Ellerbe, linebacker - Savings: $5.65 million
Brian Hartline, wide receiver - Savings: $3.15 million
Randy Starks, defensive tackle - Savings: $5 million
Brandon Gibson, wide receiver - $3.26 million
*Note - Philip Wheeler could also be released, but he would only save the team about $200,000, so I would not count him as a salary cap cut.
Free Agent Signings
The Dolphins are not going to be big spenders this offseason, but they could make enough space to pick up a key free agent or two.
Nick Fairley, defensive tackle
Mike Iupati, guard
Jordan Cameron, tight end
Draft Needs
I'm not going to project specific picks for the Dolphins yet, but I will list positions I would consider positional needs I would want to see the Dolphins target.
1. Defensive tackle - Even if the Dolphins sign someone in free agency like Fairley, drafting a young defensive tackle who can be the heir apparent for Odrick and/or Mitchell would make sense.
2. Linebacker - Depth at a minimum, potential starter if possible. Miami's starting linebackers next year should be Jelani Jenkins, Koa Misi, and, potentially, Dion Jordan. Adding someone who could challenge Misi or Jordan would be the move.
3. Wide receiver/tight end (This is most likely a WR, since Miami's TEs should be Clay, Dion Sims, Arthur Lynch, while the team is looking for the replacement for Hartline and Gibson who were salary cap casualties.)
4. Running back - A power running back to compliment Lamar Miller.
5. Cornerback - Depth.
6. Offensive tackle - Depth.
7. Quarterback - Depth. Assuming Miami does not re-sign Matt Moore this year, this could be for the second-string position.
What does your wish list for Miami this offseason?
Beef Ban
‘What kind of deranged and twisted minds want to organise a beef fest?' C T Ravi tweeted.
After the Students' Federation of India (SFI), Kerala set up beef stalls, as a form of protest against the Centre's regulations on the sale of beef, the SFI's Karnataka wing, is organising a beef fest in Bengaluru on Monday.
The event “Mooment Bengluru” will begin at 4:30 pm, at the Puttannachetty Townhall. However, the feast will begin at 6:45 adhering to Ramzaan fast breaking time.
According to the event organiser, Vyshakh Thaliyil, “The SFI, DYFI and students of Bengaluru are organising this event. Protestors can bring their own beef if they want and there will also be a few beef stalls which we will set up,”
“Of course, there will be opposition to our protest. We do expect a fallout but we have police protection,” Varkey Parakkal, organiser of the event had posted on his page.
Reacting strongly to the Karnataka government's opposition to the Centre's new rules and the students' movement in Kerala, Chikkamagaluru MLA, C T Ravi, took to Twitter and lashed out at the idea of a beef fest.
“What kind of deranged and twisted minds want to organise a beef fest and slaughter innocent cows just to make a political statement?” CT Ravi's tweet reads.
What kind of deranged & twisted minds want to organize a #BeefFest & slaughter innocent cows just to make a political point? #StopBeefFest — C.T.Ravi (@CTRavi_BJP) May 29, 2017
He called for Bengaluru City Police Commissioner, Praveen Sood, to put a stop to the event.
Request @CPBlr to stop this event as this is not only against the law but also a very sensitive subject. #StopBeefFest at any cost. pic.twitter.com/RV1cZU5E7s — C.T.Ravi (@CTRavi_BJP) May 29, 2017
Denying that any permission was granted for the beef fest, DCP Central Chandragupta requested the city residents to refrain from succumbing to rumours.
"No permission given for any protest or beef fest at Town hall today. Pl don't heed to rumours. We suggest people to refrain visiting there," he tweeted.

The BJP leaders also submitted is also going to submit a memorandum to DCP Chandragupta, demanding the cancellation of the beef fest.
Stating that the permission was obtained for a protest and not a beef fest, Varky Prakkal said that the SFI and DYFI had obtained the permission letter from the ACP on Sunday.
"The media is portraying this event as a beef fest. It is not. It is a protest against the new rules imposed by the Centre regaring the sale of beef. We do have permission for the protest," Parakkal added.
Ravi's tweets come just a day after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah opposed the ban on the sale of beef.
“It is not binding on the state to implement the Centre's curbs on sale of cattle for slaughter as it is a state subject,” Siddaramaiah had said.
However, the CM said that the state would respond only after examining the newly notified rules.
The state's law minister T B Jayachandra also opposed the move.
Jayachandra said that restrictions should be placed in coherence with the views of Mahatma Gandhi instead of targeting a particular community.
On Saturday, Kerala witnessed a number of beef festivals across the state conducted by different political organisations that were protesting against the central government's new rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
SFI had organised beef festivals in all districts at their different units.
"We do expect a fallout at the protest as the BJP has quite a strong presence in Bengaluru," Vyshakh said.
Model Fabio says he is buying a gun after more than $200,000 in gold coins and watches were stolen from his home.
He said the suspects who targeted his home entered through the one area of his property where there was no security camera. He stressed that there is a camera in that location now.
He also made clear that he is getting a gun.
Speaking to Access Hollywood, Fabio said, “I came home and I saw one of the windows [broken]. I knew right away [that] something [had] happened.” He said he had trained rottweilers, but had left them outside that day; the only day that the burglars could have entered the home without facing the security dogs.
He said the burglars lifted his 200-pound safe off the floor, even though it was bolted down. The safe contained over $120,000 in gold coins and approximately $80,000 in watches.
Fabio said he has so many friends who say they were walking down the street and “got mugged” or they describe how someone just walked up and snatched their computer. He said, “The system is a total failure. And I've said this before, coming from Europe it's like a movie, I already saw the freaking movie.”
He added, “It's a real mess. California's a mess.”
Fabio urged his fellow celebrities to come and be vocal in their support of the police. He said, “The police [are] the ones who serve us, not the criminal. So we have to take a stand, we have to help the police.”
He added, “The police right now [are] demoralized. They are like, ‘Why should I stop some criminal and risk my life, and then maybe get into trouble with the law because now the law is on the side of the criminal.'”

New York advertises its desperation
Here in the Lone Star State, we've had lots of recent success stories about bringing in many new businesses from California and New York, where the business climate is increasingly hostile due to higher taxes and increased regulations and restrictions. Businesses and citizens continue to leave by the droves. Enter New York state, in an attempt to stop the bleeding, now running ads for "Tax Free Zone" in local Texas television markets. The ads brag that new businesses will operate "tax free" for 10 years. The ad follows up the START-UP NY program put in motion by Governor Andrew Cuomo on October 22, 2013. The ads have been running in major Texas cities and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
A May 2013 press release states, "Under Tax-Free NY, Any New Business Will Be Able to Operate Tax Free on a SUNY Campus for Ten Years." That's all well and good, but most businesses plan to be around longer than 10 years. They also like to be flexible about location. More to the point, they don't like surprises, even ones they might plan for. The New York state taxes in question are significant -- state income tax; business tax; corporate, state, and local taxes; property tax; and franchise tax. Businesses will still have to contend with federal regulatory and tax laws anywhere they set up, but they'll have to plan out the big state tax hit in 10 years. If the startup works, great, but I wonder: if you have to shut down and leave before 10 years are up, do you also get hit with the back taxes? Texas opted out of ObamaCare, there is no state income tax at all, and there are fewer regulations (as a whole) and far less "political correctness" to contend with than in New York State. Texas also offers a logistically central location for national distribution -- Dallas is a primary air, rail, and truck hub, and Houston is the #1 international and #2 total cargo tonnage shipping hub in the U.S. Ironically, START-UP NY does offer one unique opportunity. For Texas companies wanting to initiate new startup ventures in New York, they've made it easier than ever.
What a lovely book!(2002) is a translation of Soko Morinaga's spiritual autobiography - presented to encourage the ordinary human being that also he/she can attain enlightenment - and the iconoclastic, direct and pointedly humorous nature of Zen practice and pedagogy suffuses the text to guarantee the reader's great pleasure and profit from this description of an unexpected trajectory from a totally disillusioned, defeated young soldier at the end of World War II to an internationally renowned Renzai Zen master, head monk at the venerable Daitoku-ji and head of Hanazono University, affiliated with the Rinzai sect. Morinaga Roshi was also closely engaged in the growth of Zen Buddhism in the United States and Great Britain.(*)In a simple, direct and very telling manner Morinaga portrays the unusual life of a practicing Zen monk with an emphasis on the travails and challenges of a novice along with the curious and often apparently cruel rites of passage of Zen training and on the unique relationship between a master and his disciple. What is striking is that Morinaga makes these seem to be natural to the reader by personalizing every bit of it from his own experience; one grasps the internal logic of it all not in the abstract but in the very concrete and personal. The austerities of the strict practice Morinaga describes are remarkable, and one wonders how widely they are observed, for in Japanese literature Buddhist priests and monks often are evoked in quite a different light indeed.(**) Remarkable also are the compassion and concern manifested in this text. No fire and brimstone here.Whether one is interested in the goals and practice of Zen or not, this text does contain elements of quite general interest, as suggested in this passage:The Buddhist way to meet these facts of life (and others) is to posit the nonessential nature of all beings, who arise out of the essential and dynamic No-Form, strut across a stage for a while and return to that churning void, only to generate yet more impermanent forms, all proceeding according to immutable laws.The Buddhist vision is awe-some and hardly comfortably reassuring.(***) Nonetheless, even Zen Buddhism turns back to life and the world of ten thousand things out of compassion, like the Boddhisatvas who have attained enlightenment but have chosen to remain on the Wheel of Life to help others.(*) I recently revieweda translation of the Buddhist dialoguethat includes a very useful commentary by Morinaga as well as excerpts fromthat convinced me I wanted to read this book.(**) Morinaga writes "This style of training is found particularly in monasteries of the Rinzai sect as opposed to Soto Zen monasteries." Long ago, I practiced in a Soto Zenbut excepting theleader we were all laypeople. Austerities were only sampled during retreats, and those were held within bounds.(***) There are more popular forms of Buddhism in which salvation and eternal life in the Western Paradise are promised if, for example, one repeats the name of Amida Buddha.(!) Of course, most human beings everywhere have struck their own bargains with the awe-some.
A spending push in key infrastructure sectors, such as roads and railways, may be at the heart of the Centre's efforts to rekindle the economy but attempts to prod the private sector to invest in core sectors seem to be floundering — if lending by banks is anything to go by.

Bank credit to the infrastructure sector, which had been steadily sliding over the first eight months of the current financial year, has recorded its sharpest contraction of 6.7 per cent in November.
The latest data released by RBI Tuesday shows that credit outstanding to the infrastructure sector has slipped from Rs 9,64,800 crore in March 2016 to Rs 9,00,700 crore in November 2016.
The power sector, which accounted for almost 55 per cent of the infra credit demand, saw a contraction of 10.4 per cent in November — down from a decline of 4.8 per cent in April 2016.

And, the road sector, which has seen significant government push, has witnessed a sharp decline in credit offtake over the last few months.
In October and November, bank credit slipped to a low of 2.9 and 1.3 per cent, respectively, suggesting a decline in private sector demand for credit and a corresponding aversion by banks in lending to the sector.
The decline in infrastructure credit growth has also pulled down the overall bank credit to the industry as it contracted by 3.4 per cent in November, which is the worst in at least a decade. Even the gross bank credit expanded by only 4 per cent in November, down from 9 per cent growth in March 2016.
Recent data on highway construction show that the pace of construction has not picked up.
In December, Minister of State in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Mansukh L Mandaviya, informed Rajya Sabha that in the first seven months of FY'17, the length of highway construction stood at 3,591 km against the target of 15,000 km. In 2015-16, the length of highway construction stood at 6,029 km.
Among several reasons cited by Mandaviya for the slow pace were land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregates, poor performance of contractors, etc.
In his budget speech 2016-17, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced a total outlay of Rs 97,000 crore for the road sector.
However, private sector involvement seems to be very low. In the first eight months of the FY'17, the banks credit outstanding for the road sector rose by only Rs 2,700 crore from Rs 1,77,500 crore in March 2016 to touch Rs 1,80,200 crore in November 2016.
Economists say the environment for private sector investment is “very weak” as of now and may remain out of the system for some time.

“While government investment is one factor to crowd in private sector investment, there are other factors also required and they are not favourable as of now. There is too much debt in the books of infrastructure companies and also, a lot of companies are saddled with overcapacity. Even the banks are not very keen on lending to the sector as they have a lot of bad loans in the sector,” said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
The same Chinese research group which came up with a "Terminator-like" liquid metal is now suggesting it might be the right choice to use in the development of quantum computers, reports the People's Daily.
Liu Jing, professor at Tsinghua University and researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is suggesting the liquid metal his research group developed a few years ago could help make quantum computers highly flexible and more able to process data more efficiently than semi-conductors.
Liu argues that traditional semi-conductors and transistors are reaching their physical limits in supercomputers. He suggests the liquid metal they've been working with could help advance a super-computer's architecture, essentially allowing it to take in multiple instructions, creating a faster computing speed.
"Different from traditional computers, quantum computers compute through quantum superposition and entanglement. By replacing the solid-state core devices which compose the quantum computer with pure liquid quantum devices, and control them via force fields, electric field and magnetic fields, it could be possible to achieve quantum computing with more flexibility and controllability," said Liu.
Liu's team has already made progress with its liquid metal. The group was able to create a liquid metal-printed electronic circuit in 2013. The group was also able to use the liquid metal to help power a humanoid robot which can run, jump and carry things.
Liquid metal is officially known as Galinstan, which is an alloy derived from gallium, indium, and tin. Combined correctly, the compound stays in a liquid form at room temperature.

A bipartisan effort to release more federal spectrum for commercial use is getting all kinds of praise—including from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.
The Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Viable Electromagnetic Spectrum (AIRWAVES) Act, introduced by Senators Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), encourages the federal government to continue to free up spectrum for commercial licensed and unlicensed use and includes a proposal to take a portion of the spectrum auction proceeds to fund wireless infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas.
Pai said in a statement that he's grateful to Sens. Gardner and Hassan for introducing the AIRWAVES Act. “This bipartisan bill addresses an issue that's critical to continued American leadership in wireless innovation: making available more spectrum for commercial use," he said.
Mobile World Congress 2019 Attend the 2-Day Executive 5G Panel Series FierceWireless is returning to Barcelona, Spain, during Mobile World Congress 2019 with a two-day Executive 5G Panel Series at the Fira Congress Hotel, conveniently located across the street from the MWC Convention Center.

The senators said their legislation establishes a spectrum pipeline that will provide more capacity for wireless providers to improve existing service and expand to new areas. The AIRWAVES Act aims to motivate industry and federal agencies to find ways to better use spectrum and avoid a spectrum crunch and lay the groundwork for 5G technologies.
The legislation also aims to free up additional unlicensed spectrum to support wireless devices like tablets, as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies.
It's the “rural dividend” component that Pai seemed particularly jazzed about. The chairman has often talked about how closing the digital divide and making broadband more widely available in rural areas is a top priority.
“I'm also very pleased that they have proposed a ‘rural dividend,' under which 10 percent of proceeds from spectrum auctions would be devoted to increasing wireless Internet accesses in rural areas,” he added. “This provision would go a long way toward closing the digital divide, which has left too many rural Americans in the analog era. I look forward to working with Senators Gardner and Hassan on their forward-thinking legislation.”
The AIRWAVES Act is garnering support from groups as diverse as CTIA, the Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) and Public Knowledge—groups that don't always see eye to eye on spectrum issues.
“CTIA applauds Senators Gardner and Hassan for their forward thinking, bipartisan leadership in introducing the AIRWAVES Act,” said Kelly Cole, senior vice president of Government Affairs at CTIA, in a statement. “This legislation provides a much-needed long-term plan to unlock valuable licensed spectrum as demand for wireless data and content continues to skyrocket. A predictable spectrum pipeline is vital to meet consumers' need for new and innovative services and sustain U.S. global leadership in a fast-approaching 5G world.”
CCA President and CEO Steven K. Berry commended Sens. Gardner and Hassan for introducing the bipartisan act. “I applaud Senators Gardner and Hassan for recognizing that many rural areas do not have mobile broadband services comparable to their urban counterparts, and for their focus on ensuring no rural area is left behind,” he said in a statement. “CCA supports the AIRWAVES Act and looks forward to continued work to move this legislation forward.”
Michael Calabrese, director of New America's Wireless Future Program, said the senators deserve credit for proposing an ambitious spectrum pipeline bill, but there's an opportunity to improve upon it.
“We look forward to working with the senators to improve the bill's potential impact on the rural broadband gap,” he said. “There is an immediate opportunity to share 500 megahertz of underutilized satellite spectrum above 3.7 GHz for more affordable rural and small town broadband that will be lost if the sole focus is raising one-time auction revenue that requires clearing satellite incumbents off the band and takes a decade to implement.”
His group is among those that submitted a Petition for Rulemaking seeking to add a new, licensed, point-to-multipoint (P2MP) fixed wireless service in the underutilized 3700-4200 MHz band used primarily by fixed satellite services (FSS). Their proposed licensing scheme and operating rules would enable gigabit and near-gigabit broadband service in rural and underserved areas, and they say it promotes competition for broadband delivery among various technologies and licensees.
Muslimgauze was the main musical project of Bryn Jones (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British ethnic electronica and experimental musician who was influenced by conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never made mainstream success due to his work being issued mostly in limited editions on small record labels and being deeply experimental in style. His music has been described by one critic as "among the most startling and unique in the noise underground."[1]
The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word muslin (a type of gauze)[2][3] combined with Muslim, referring to Bryn Jones' preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world.
Biography [ edit ]
Early musical career [ edit ]
Jones first released music in 1982 as E.g Oblique Graph on Kinematograph, his own imprint, and the independent co-op label Recloose, run by Simon Crab. E.g Oblique Graph came from the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos of the time and was musically composed of electronic/experimental drone with occasional synth-melodic hooks and use of radio broadcast samples.
Releases at the time were occasionally on cassette, more often vinyl EPs and LPs; the longest running of Jones' label monikers, Limited Editions, started with Hunting Out with an Aerial Eye (1984) followed by Buddhist on Fire, put out by Recloose the same year. Since then, Jones roughly released an album a year, given scarce financial resources until 1988, when he began making inroads with then-emerging labels Staalplaat, Soleilmoon, and Extreme Records.
By the late 1980s, Jones ran out of funding to self-release, and other labels that did put out Muslimgauze releases such as Recloose and Permis De Construire (which put out Coup d'Etat) did not pay promised royalties. Recloose head Simon Crab cited lack of sales and damaged records from fire bombing as his reason.
The neighbouring Thomas a Becket pub run by East End gangsters—common-or-garden low-level vicious thugs (years before the species was romanticized by Lock Stock and Mona Lisa)—unable to control our unlicensed trade in alcohol and other illicits, firebombed the building one night and attacked the crew on a regular basis (Many of the new pressings of Muslimgauze's Buddhist on Fire stored in the Recloose offices were destroyed during this attack). Stalker blog post[4]
The deal with Recloose was that we paid 50 percent of the profits to the artist and 50 percent went to the label, which was a pretty good deal, especially since we didn't sell that much. We put a lot of energy into marketing, and most of the artists signed to the label sold off the back of Bourbonese Qualk anyway. He assumed we sold loads of albums but we didn't even cover the costs. Simon Crab[5]
At this time, distributors Soleilmoon, Staalplaat, and Extreme Records transitioned to becoming labels with the advent of the compact disc format, which became less expensive to produce and ship than vinyl over time and gradually became a physical staple of the Muslimgauze catalogue.
Later musical career [ edit ]
It was with the release of the United States of Islam (1991) a formalised agreement was reached with Extreme Records, which helped fund professional studio recordings, designed attractive packaging, and used a more extensive distribution network. Though pleased at first, Jones was frustrated with Extreme's one-release-a-year policy and in 1993 signed with then-sibling labels Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, which offered a more frequent release schedule. 1993 saw the release of Vote Hezbollah, Veiled Sisters and a re-release of Iran on Soleilmoon and Hamas Arc, Satyajit Eye and Betrayal on Staalplaat.[5] His 1998 record Mullah Said on the label has been critically acclaimed.
Jones additionally released material on nearly any small label that approached him. A drawback with releasing on so many labels was gratuitous editing by producers and, through design or circumstance, no royalties. Extreme cited betrayal by distribution networks that were unscrupulous or filed for bankruptcy and could not pay—though they also claimed to have eventually remunerated Jones. Lack of due royalties was a source of ongoing stress throughout Jones's career.
He once stated that he never had time to listen to other people's music, although in a 1992 interview with Impulse Magazine, he mentioned that he enjoyed traditional music of Japan, the Middle East, and India, as well as the works of artists such as Can, Throbbing Gristle, Wire, and Faust.[6]
Death [ edit ]
On 30 December 1998, Jones was rushed to A&E in Manchester with a rare fungal infection in his bloodstream, for which he had to be heavily sedated. His body eventually shut down, and he died on 14 January 1999.[7]
Legacy [ edit ]
Since Bryn Jones's death in 1999 at the age of 37, his music under Muslimgauze has continued to be released. He often inundated labels and collaborators with music, and consequently the latter had to be selective of what was eventually put out. Labels, including Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, continue to publish unreleased albums, as well as releases of demos, his own reworked tracks, and abandoned full-length tapes. Jones' posthumous discography is known for including many studio variations of nearly all his music.[8][9][10]
In April 2014, Vinyl On Demand released Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones 1983–1988, a 10 LP box set reissueing early albums originally released by Product Kinematopgraph, Recloose Organisation, and Jones' own Limited Editions. Each LP includes bonus tracks taken from period compilation albums. The release was also accompanied by biography written by Ibrahim Khider titled Muslimgauze: Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones.[11]
Musical styles [ edit ]
Muslimgauze's music is often difficult to describe due to sheer volume, content diversity and often singular stylings; Jones never produced any hit albums or songs. However, it's possible to describe common features of his music as he tended to use many of the same strategies, modified from album to give each release a distinct feel or concept.[12] The music often is heavily electronic and strongly rhythmic (sometimes including live studio percussion), though tempos can vary from very fast to slowly driving and almost ambient, making frequent use of gradually-changing structures or melodic motifs. Critic Ned Raggett of reviewed a number of Muslimgauze albums for Allmusic.com, noting the diverse styles of Jones's recordings: United States of Islam (1991) featured layered percussion and "a muted techno pulse",[13] Hamas Arc (1993) touched on a menacing "ambience that is not so far removed from the likes of [industrial metal acts] Godflesh or Scorn",[14] and Gun Aramaic (1996) blended atmospheric sounds and vocal samples that "almost turns the album into a soundtrack for a non-existent film."[12]
Political beliefs [ edit ]
I would never go to an occupied land, others shouldn't. Zionists living off Arab land and water is not a tourist attraction. To have been in a place is not important. So you can't be against apartheid unless you have been in South Africa? You cannot be against the Serbs killing Muslims in Bosnia unless you have been there? I think not. Bryn Jones Chain D.L.K. interview[15]
Jones originally claimed Muslimgauze was formed in response to Operation Peace of the Galilee, Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon[16][6] to stem attacks from Palestinian Liberation Organization guerrillas stationed in South Lebanon. This event inspired Jones to research the conflict's origins, which grew into a lifelong artistic focal point, and he became a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause,[17] and often dedicated recordings to the Palestinian Liberation Organization or a free Palestine.[18] Jones's research further grew to encompass other conflict-ridden, predominantly Muslim countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Chechnya, Iran, and Iraq. He concluded that Western interests for natural resources and strategic-political gain were root causes for many of these conflicts and should Western meddling halt, said regions would stabilise.[16]
Jones frequently netted criticism for never having visited the Middle East. He said in a 1994 interview, "I don't think you can visit an occupied land. It's the principle. Not until it's free again."[19]
Dedicated to the unknown Palestinians buried in mass graves in Al-Riqqa cemetery, Kuwait city. Zul'm (1992)[20]
References in dedications, album, and track titles suggest Jones had researched the conflict regions in the Middle East, as well as Chechnya, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, among others.[21] Musical references also extended to other creeds and ethnicities including Hindus, Tibetan Buddhists, and Sri-Lankans.[8]
When asked what he would do if conflicts in the Muslim world were peaceably resolved, Jones replied his music would champion other conflict regions such as China's occupation of Tibet.
Interviewer: Do you believe it is absolutely necessary, to take these political aspects into account? Or can one also uncouple the politics and music from each other?
Jones: Yes, one can do that. It is music. Music with serious political facts behind it. There are no lyrics, because that would be preaching. It is music. It is up to you, to find out more. If you don't want that, it is up to you. You can listen to only the music or you can preoccupy yourself more with it. Artefakt interview[22]
Discography [ edit ]
He released over 90 original albums on 32 different record labels, creating nearly 2,000 original compositions. Many of his pieces were inspired by political facts or events. Many of his releases have been re-pressed as, after 1994, most of his albums were released in limited editions of 200–1,000.
Live performances [ edit ]
During the early phase of his career, Jones was known to have performed only one live show in 1986 at the V2 in s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. At the behest of Bourbonese Qualk, of the Recloose label, Jones performed a half-hour set. The show consisted of Jones singing to a backing track while Simon Crab then members of Bourbonese Qualk added instrumental accompaniment. By all accounts the show went reasonably, but Jones was traumatised by the experience enough to swear off live performance until the 1990s.[5]
Jones resumed live performance in 1995 at the behest of record store owner and DJ Simon Scott. Part of Jones's apprehension with live performance was in trying to figure out how to present the music. He concluded the best way was refrained from vocals with lyrics and instead play live percussion atop a backing track. He also did DJ sets that consisted of exclusively his own material. Contrary to his 1986 experience, Jones did enjoy doing live shows and frequently did them in his last years in diverse places such as the UK, throughout mainland Europe, and even Japan.[23][24]

The Supreme Court's decision to lift some of the restrictions on Donald Trump's travel ban gives at least a partial victory to the Trump Administration. But, buried within the decision is what can only be considered a jab at liberal activist groups.
Supreme Court, writing unanimously in the travel ban case, is wise to how liberal activist groups operate pic.twitter.com/Nu97q4omkY — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) June 26, 2017
Dan McLaughlin, our old friend and colleague, hits the nail on the head here, because you just know every liberal activist group that is absolutely outraged over this executive order and the court's decision was going to start prowling for “clients” in order to try and circumvent this decision.
It's how liberalism works, isn't it? If a law stops them from doing something they don't like, they go to the courts. If the courts, don't stand with them, they try to circumvent the courts in “creative” ways. They have always disliked what prevents them from doing what they want, but they try to dress it up as some sort of “justice.”
But, that's not how the rule of law works. This is a solid and, most importantly, unanimous decision that stops these old tactics right in their tracks. Good on the Supreme Court for making this call and supporting the rule of law in this country.
Following the Bernie Sanders campaign since day one has been an eye-opening experience. I remember ever since the rumors were circulating about a potential Sanders run, I was immediately enthralled with the idea that there would be another candidate to choose from other than the Clinton machine.
Before entering college, I stumped for Obama's reelection bid in 2012 as I became more and more interested in politics. At the time I was just a young 17 year old who despised the likes of Republicans who were anti-gay, anti-women, and deniers of climate change. I didn't know a lot about President Obama, but I knew that Romney would only take us backwards. I knocked on doors and I made hundreds of calls for Obama mainly because of my strong opinions on these selective issues. I had little understanding of the economy, foreign policy, and other more complicated subjects. After Obama had beat Romney, I felt a sense of fulfillment that translated to my decision to major in political science as I entered my first year of college.
I began taking a variety of political science classes that interested me. However, something happened. As I began to uncover fundamental issues about how our government operates, I no longer identified with Democrats or Republicans. Sure, my views on social issues more aligned with Democrats, but neither party had addressed my newfound disgust. Every political science class I took made me more and more disillusioned with the fact that our government, Republicans and Democrats, represented the rich and powerful rather than those who need political representation the most. It became clear to me that although these social issues were important, they ultimately distract us from the fundamental issue of our time: legalized political corruption.
I decided for the time being to explore my more artistic side. I found that taking Film and English courses functioned as a sort of escape from the harsh realities of a political system that I once felt passionate about. My interest in politics started to subside as I explored other interests that I found more fulfilling. However, that all changed when Bernie Sanders made his announcement to run for president. I immediately gave his campaign a modest five bucks and got on social media to promote the ideas of someone who was truly and radically different than any other politician. At the time, my friends around me scoffed at the idea of a candidate who could possibly stand a chance against the well known Hillary Clinton. I exposed my friends to what Bernie stood for and they caught on quick.
Over the summer my newfound obsession was with the Bernie Sanders campaign. Everyday I read as much as I could about how his campaign was doing and how people were responding. It seemed like with everyday that went by more and more people started to take notice. Bernie climbed up the polls fast as the summer came to an end and I was never more invigorated. I watched all his youtube videos, his stump speeches, and every one of his media appearances. When Bernie speaks about the issues that often get tossed aside, it gives me hope that our country will slowly but surely evolve.
What many people don't realize about America's economy is that it is controlled and exploited by those who influence our politicians with campaign contributions. This corruption has created an oligarchy where we have the highest level of income inequality than any other developed nation. Instead of helping the most vulnerable in our society, our bought and paid for politicians fight for the moneyed interests that control them. This isn't about Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. It's about a fundamental change in how our government operates. Bernie Sanders happens to be the only candidate that understands this. He refuses to accept any money from large corporations and instead has raised millions of dollars from people. Nothing can get done until we rid our government of the powerful interests that seek to serve themselves.
Bernie Sanders has restored the energy that I once felt during my time with the Obama campaign. He has spoken to the very problems that caused my disillusionment. He is the voice that I didn't think could even exist in such a corrupt institution. To me, Clinton is a name of the past. She's obviously very capable of leading our country, however, she represents small change in the shadow of a more progressive option. Clinton would be better than every Republican running for president, but she would continue to allow corporate interests to come first just like every other establishment politician. This is not about being anti-Clinton or anti-Republican. It's about uniting everyone against the true culprit behind most of the issues we face in America: the immense political power of large corporations, banks, and billionaire families. Until we recognize this issue head on, real change will never come.
Correction appended
Micaela Bartram first became interested in Paganism while she was in middle school after her friend suggested they look up a love spell.
Despite her friend's eventual loss of interest, Bartram continued to look up information on Paganism. After years of research, Bartram, a sophomore studying studio art, now practices a combination of earth religions and witchcraft.
Subsections of Paganism Wicca: Based on pre-Christian beliefs, Wicca is a religion that draws power from nature, and is said to be growing steadily, and festival culture is thought to have brought attention to Wicca. Shamanism: An ancient tradition that comes from the power of nature and focuses on healing of self and others. Druidism: A spirituality that focuses on nature. There are differing opinions on what “God” is, but all are accepting of diversity. Druids also believe that there are •worlds other than the one we live in. Heathenry: Modern groups practice a polytheistic religion that worship the Norse gods, and celebrate rites of passage and seasonal holidays. Hellenism: The reconstruction of religious practices of the worship of ancient Greek gods and Goddesses. Offerings and festivals are a common way to honor the gods.
“I'm a weird eclectic mix of a few different things. … I'm definitely Pagan and a witch, but not Wiccan.” Bartram said. “You have a preconceived idea of something that everyone talks about, but then when you experience it for yourself, it's disappointment and not what you thought.”
Bartram knows only two other Pagans on campus, but according to the Pagan Federation International, the religion is growing, and the organization has more than 4,000 members. Among Pagans, there are are multiple definitions of what the religion is.
A nature-based religion
Pagans are individuals who follow a polytheistic and pantheistic nature-based religion. Polytheism is the belief in multiple deities, and pantheism is the belief a god or gods and the universe are the same entity, and the belief in “rejection of any view that considers God as distinct from the universe,” according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
“Neo-Paganism is a recent development where people have begun to identify themselves with reconstructed classical European religions,” Brian Collins, the Drs. Ram and Sushila Gawande, Chair in Indian Religion and Philosophy, said. “What's interesting about Paganism is it's kind of based on the hundreds of years of scholarship of religion.”
Some Pagans follow ancient traditions, like the ones that come from ancient Greek and Norse mythology.
“(Ancient religions) were dead, and that's why we're (trying to) revive them," Bartram said. "It feels like, culturally, we were forced to lose them.”
Paganism is very connected with nature, and honoring the Earth is an easy way for Bartram to practice.
“Usually I meditate, but simple things like taking a walk through nature and recycling are other things I do,” Bartram said. “Aside from practical spellwork, we care a lot about the Earth.”
Pagans may fall under the same name, but their beliefs on deities and spirit heads may differ.
“It's all connected and we can agree and disagree,” Bartram said. “I personally do not (believe in a spirit head), but a lot of Pagans do. One person will believe in the Greek gods and that they have real personality, while someone else will just think of them as cosmic energy that is just given a name to use.”
Reverend Crow Swimsaway has been a practicing shaman for more than 30 years and has also practiced aspects of Paganism.
“Pagan is a huge bag that all kinds of interesting stuff gets tossed into,” Swimsaway said. “Paganism is nature; it's not a religion of structure, and there is no book … It's not so much of a belief as an experience. Spirit exists. Spirit is in all things. Spirit manifests in different ways, each of which is valid."
Practicing Paganism
Different Pagans have different practices. Collins said some see the religion as communing with nature, while others perceive Paganism as a feminist religion, and some practitioners believe it can connect them with their ancient pre-Christian roots.
Many Pagans have tools of trade they use in their practice, Bartram said, including runes and herbs.
Something that interested Bartram in Pagan beliefs is the prominence of feminist ideologies. In many cases, females hold major leadership roles in the church.
Collins said there are some Neo-Pagans who will focus only on goddesses from different religions as one “divine feminine power.”
“(Paganism) is a nature religion. It has a body and structure and is about honoring the god, the goddess and the creative spirit in the world,” Herron, who has been practicing Paganism for more than thirty years, said. “There's duality in this reality. We balance ourselves to the masculine and feminine.”
When shamans are practicing, Swimsaway said their work is assisted by “allies”, which are spiritual guides seen during trances, which could appear as plants or animals. A trance is a natural hallucinatory state usually induced through repetitious sounds.
“The trance state can be induced by all kinds of things, but drumming and rattling are the most (commonly used),” Swimsaway said. “Something about steady repetition helps you leave ordinary reality and go into the shamanic reality.”
Swimsaway also helped begin The Church of Earth Healing. The church offers “teaching, healing and spiritual counseling within a shamanic framework,” according to its website.
“The church is not a building. It's a church of minds and of spirit,” Swimsaway said. “As a church, we have a weekly service called a shamanic journeying circle, and people who know how to do this get together and do the journey to help ourselves and others.”
“Journeying” is the core practice used in healing work, Swimsaway said. It's the use of trances to make a connection with the spirit, and that's where one meets their ancestors and guides.
Points of Power
Halloween falls on one of the eight holidays of the year for Pagans, called Samhain. The holiday begins Oct. 31, and lasts until sunset Nov. 1. It marks the beginning of winter.
“I personally will light a candle (for Samhain), pray and meditate after that,” Bartram said. “A lot of people will get together in a coven and will have a ritual and chant and pray to the goddess.”
Herron said that the Halloween most non-Pagans celebrate is a “candy-coated version,” because Halloween marks the new year for modern Pagans.
“We celebrate our ancestors, and the veil of the spirit world is very thin, and we can more easily contact them,” he said.
During the full moon and new moon, many will do spellwork at “points of power” in the universe, Bartram said.
“Mostly it's just telling yourself something will happen. It's like positive reinforcement,” Bartram said. “People do them to attract love and money and to pass a test. It makes you feel better.”
Herron said he normally performs spells of protection as well as ones focusing on money and self-esteem.
“There's a process and a circle that I bring people in and perform a rite,” Herron said. “The circle is a barrier of protection.”
Perceptions of Paganism
Heather Greene, the managing editor of The Wild Hunt, a news blog on modern Paganism, said Paganism is not seen as a serious religion and is not given respect.
“The communities may look different or feel different than many mainstream religious communities, but they are just as serious and just as deserving of respect,” Greene said in an email.
Negative stereotypes of Pagans mean many practitioners don't feel comfortable sharing their religious beliefs.
“We're put down upon as weirdos and evil,” Herron said. “(Current beliefs often) put us in a bad light.”
Despite the negative perceptions of witches and Pagans, Herron said that they are very open and down-to-earth people who want to share their abilities.
“Don't be afraid of the shamans and witches,” Herron said. “We want to heal this planet, so that we can heal others.”

Correction: A previous version of this article misquoted Gary Herron. The article has been updated to show the most accurate information.
All around the Motor City, people are starting to talk transit.
In 2013,
Now, public officials and developers across the region are readying themselves to reap the economic potential of functional transit -- something many cities across the country have already done.
Take Atlanta, for example.
"Atlanta was the poster child for sprawl," says Chris Leinberger, Research Professor at George Washington University School of Business. "The metro area grew from 50 miles north to south in 1970 to over 120 miles today, sprawling farther and faster than any city in human history."
Leinberger authored
"Now Atlanta is witnessing the end of sprawl," he says. "If it's happening in Atlanta, this is a significant national real estate trend. The market is saying no more sprawl."
Leinberger expects that trend to take place in Metro Detroit -- both in the city and in the suburbs.
"Probably 40-50 percent of walkable urban development will be in the center city," he says, "but the majority of it -- 50 to 60 percent -- will be in surrounding suburbs like Birmingham, Ferndale, Royal Oak, and Ann Arbor."
A
"We're behind the curve in starting this process," says Richard Murphy, Programs Director at the
In 2012, Murphy worked with five southeast Oakland County communities to develop a
"The plan is a good example of how we should be approaching TOD in the region," says Murphy.
The City of Dearborn is also planning for TOD. Working with the Michigan Municipal League to develop a place-based
"The plan orients development to rail commuters, calling for a mix of uses like a coffee shop, a dry cleaner, and a newsstand, anchored by housing," says Forrest. "It also connects with west downtown Dearborn, which is only a couple of blocks away but feels much farther because today it's hard to walk to from the train station."
Meanwhile in Detroit, Dan Gilbert's Rock Ventures continues to
"What we have seen around the country is tremendous economic development on transit routes," says Matt Cullen, CEO of Rock Ventures and M-1 Rail. "The benchmarks suggest four to as much as eight times the investment in transit, you get back in economic development. So that puts us into the billion-dollar range."
M-1 Rail worked in collaboration with multiple partners to complete a
One of those partners was the
"It will be an enormous tax revenue generator," says Goodwin. "We're not currently meeting the demand for housing, so we need mixed-use with a healthy housing component."
Sue Mosey, President of Midtown Detroit Inc., sees an urgent need for more mixed-income housing in the Woodward corridor, something she thinks will only increase after rail begins operating in 2016. But even though Midtown is currently 97 percent occupied, Mosey says a financing gap remains because the market is so undervalued.
That gap is narrowing, according to Cullen.
"The gap is much smaller now than it used to be," he says. "Market rents are increasing, and plenty of people want to live along the Woodward corridor."
But as rents rise, low- and moderate-income residents can be pushed out.
"We need mixed-income development," says Cullen. "Before there wasn't any demand, but now we have an opportunity for the same kind of mixed-income housing as many areas across the United States."
Ensuring commercial development within a TOD serves mixed incomes is critical, according to Scot Spencer, transit equity expert and Associate Director at the
"In many places with TOD, there's no provision that the mix of uses allows for a mix of incomes," says Spencer. "The services along transit stops are important to someone for whom transit is not a choice or luxury. Are there day care centers or social services agencies helping folks who are transit-dependent?"
DEGC sees a need to offer a diverse suite of residential options and services to meet residents' needs.
"We want to encourage products from the market that help to sustain the community that we already have and enhance their quality of life," says Goodwin. "So we are looking for win-win situations where we can do that and also attract more population density into that area. It's not a simple thing to do but we are committed to ensuring equity."
As surface lots are developed, parking decks will be needed, says Mosey. Midtown Detroit Inc. recently completed an analysis of sites for future parking decks and is looking into financing options to put decks in place.
"As new businesses are opening up in the neighborhoods, none of them have dedicated parking," says Mosey. "They are all struggling to find parking alternatives. We want to get people off surface lots and into decks with ground-floor retail to help build back a street wall throughout the neighborhood. That's probably the highest priority for us."
To help bridge the financing gap, investors have established a
"Our investors have stepped up to make the longer-term commitment," says Ian Weisner, Senior Loan Officer with the fund. "We are willing to take the risk of a 20 percent loan-to-value ratio over 30 years, because we have faith that the market is undervalued."
The $30-million fund already has $54.5 million in applications that would create 540 units, says Weisner. The first projects are expected to be announced in 2014.
Leinberger calls this long-term investment strategy "patient equity."
"Ten years from now, those investments will look inspired," he says. "It's your classic buy-low and sell-high scenario."
This story was published, with an emphasis on metro area transit development, earlier this month in Metromode.

Federal employees enjoyed a Christmas Eve off from work in 2012... but they're not so lucky this year.
While millions of people are already at their holiday destinations, it's business as usual for federal workers.
The Office of Personnel Management announced Monday that federal employees should report to work Tuesday as usual.
That's been their standing policy when Christmas falls on a Wednesday, the OPM said. The government has remained open 6 of the last 9 times it's happened since 1946.
White House Holiday Decorations
In 2012, just a few days before Christmas, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to give federal workers the day off. But that year, Christmas Eve fell on a Monday, which turned the holiday into a long weekend.
Then, there are the voices of the people to consider. Last year, a petition on WhiteHouse.gov collected more than 28,000 signatures from users who believed the Monday before Christmas should be a work holiday. A similar petition this year garnered just a fraction of that.
As a dance maker I've long been drawn to solo work, both for myself as a performer and also as a means of choreographing on others. I love the immediacy and personality of them. I love being able to drink one performer in at a time. I am also fascinated with observation, and how our observation skills shift depending on context. Funsch Solos: One on One offers audiences a rare opportunity to view solos up close and in private in viewing booths designed for Z Space at Theater Artaud in San Francisco.
Running Thursday through Sunday, March 8-11, 2012, Funsch Solos celebrates my prolific and intimate approach to solo dance with four new and 11 repertories works (15 solos in total, split onto two programs). Act I of each program features one-on-one viewings of the solos, and the audience will be in three-quarter seating for Act II to view all of the eight solos. Each audience member will see one solo twice: first on her/his own and later than part of the larger crowd.
Although I've been fortunate enough to receive support for this project through Dancers' Group and the MetLife Foundation's New Stages For Dance Initiative, I'm still short $3,000 in my budget. This is my most ambitious project to date: it involves 14 dancers, four musicians, and an extensive technical crew. I'm committed to paying all of these incredible folks as sufficiently as I can for their tireless contributions. I humbly and truly appreciate any support you can offer me towards this end. Please know that your donation will go directly to artist stipends, and that it will greatly impact these concerts.
Many, many thanks for making this project possible!

Introduction
Channels, ES6 generators and CSP in general enable powerful features that we can already use in JavaScript today. I will not go too much into detail about coroutines, promises, generators as this has been covered in my previous post. Read it here in case you need an update.
In the following section we will figure out what transducers are by creating a low-level naive implementation and then exchanging the low-level implementation with the transducers.js library, which offers a number of functions optimized for real world usage.
Once we have an idea of what transducers are and what they should accomplish, the next step will be to explore why channels are useful and create an example or two just to get things off the ground.
Finally we will see how channels and transducers fit together and what powerful pipelines we can create by combing the two. While the initial introductory post Channels and Generators in JavaScript already showed how React and channels can interact, we will take a step back this time and only focus on channels and transducers. Demonstrating how the two fit together and what benefits we can leverage by taking this approach.
All this should be the building block for a another post, where we will try to build more advanced UIs with React, Rebass, Recompose, transducers and channels. This is when we will put our acquired knowledge to use. It makes sense to break the topic up, just to focus on the basics first.
Transducers
Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element.
Transform + Reduce = Transduce
A function you pass into a reducer is a reducing function. It takes the current result and a new input and returns the next result. Just think about reducers in redux. A reducer in redux expects the current state and an action and returns a new state based on the given inputs.
(state, action) -> state
A function that transforms a reducing functions can be expressed as:
(xForm, reducingFn) -> reducingFn
A transducer can be described as taking one reducing function and returning another reducing function.
((acc, input) -> acc) -> ((acc, input) -> acc)
Let's note some important facts:
Transducers have no knowledge of the context they're being applied in and where the inputs come from nor do they have an idea what the reducing function actually does. Transducers decouple the data structure, enabling us to compose complex transformations. They ask a collection to reduce itself and will work with any reducing function transformer.
Let's see how we can implement our own transducer.
Any transformation can be expressed with reduce as base, think filter and map f.e. But how, you might be asking. To figure it all out, let's implement map.
const map = mapFn => (xs, x) => [...xs, mapFn(x)]
const inc = map(add(1))
console.log(reduce(inc, [], [1, 2, 3, 4])) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
map expects a mapping function, and returns a new function that takes two arguments and returns a single result. How can we use reduce to recreate the map function efficiently? Currently we're assuming that we're dealing with an array, but what we really need to do, is enable the passing of a reducing function to map.
const map = curry((mapFn, redFn) => (xs, x) => redFn(xs, mapFn(x)))
const inc = reduce(map(add(1), concat), [])
console.log(inc([1, 2, 3, 4])) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
So this actually works. We created our own map function that expects two arguments, a mapping as well as a reducing function.
We can do the same with filter.
const filter = curry((predFn, redFn) => (xs, x) =>
predFn(x) ? redFn(xs, x) : xs)
const greaterThanOne = reduce(filter(x => x > 1, concat), [])
console.log(greaterThanOne([1, 2, 3, 4])) // [2, 3 ,4]
We can even combine filter and map.
const xForm = compose(
filter(x => x > 1),
map(add(1))
)
console.log(reduce(xForm(concat), [], [1, 2, 3, 4]))
This is interesting. Transducers can be easily composed , enabling complex transformations. Also interesting to note is that they compose from left to right.
Compose itself with starts with the right most function and passes the result to the next function on the left side. The difference here is that we're returning a function. At the end of the composition we have a new function. For an easier understanding of what happens when we compose reducers, take a look at the following.
const xForm = redFn => filter(x => x > 1, map(add(1), redFn))
reduce(xForm(concat), [], [1, 2, 3, 4])
We can still do one more refinement though, by creating a transduce function, which will hide away having to call xForm with the reducing function.
const transduce = curry((xForm, f, init, coll) =>
reduce(xForm(f), init, coll))
console.log(transduce(map(add(1)), concat, [], [1, 2, 3, 4]))
// [2, 3, 4, 5]
The last example is based on the final example in Transducers.js: A JavaScript Library for Transformation of Data by James Longster, who also implemented a library called transducers.js. But effectively you can choose and mix any library that implements the transducer protocol.
We will see an example later on where we use Ramda's compose, with map and filter from transducers.js. Transducers can work with arrays, streams, channels and any iterable including immutable-js collections.
I also highly recommend reading CSP and Transducers in JavaScript by Tom Ashworth and Understanding Transducers in JavaScript by Roman Liutikov. Both give a very clear walkthrough on how to create transducers. Also check the links at the end of this post for more great explanations including a thorough explanation by Drew Tipson.
Channels
I have written about channels in a previous post, but we'll quickly run through channels and generators just to gain a solid basis on what we want to do next, which is combine channels with transducers.
This is one of the introductory examples from the js-csp documentation.
const ch = csp.chan(1);
yield csp.put(ch, 42);
yield csp.take(ch); // 42
ch.close()
yield csp.take(ch); // csp.CLOSED
The aforementioned library offers a number of useful functions for creating and interacting with channels.
js-csp enables to create a new channel via the chan function with a buffer size of 1, which is optional, as long as you don't pass in a transducer as second argument.
We can run put operations on the newly created channel by calling put, prefixed by yield, and passing in the channel and the value 42. We yield the value with take and then close the channel .
Typical channels offer a set of functions, but knowing about put and take as seen in the previous example will take you a long way.
Processes communicate via channels. We can push to the queue via put, and retrieve via take. All we need to think about to begin with, is that we have a channel and a consumer.
Here's one more example from the js-csp documentation.
var ch = go(function*(x) {
yield timeout(1000);
return x;
}, [42]);
console.log((yield take(ch)));
We spawn a goroutine by calling the go function with a generator function. The go function will immediately return a channel, enabling us to retrieve any values from the channel via take.
Extending this idea onto the UI enables us to create a function like the following listen.
const listen = (el, type) => {
const ch = chan()
el.addEventListener(type, e => putAsync(ch, e))
return ch
}
listen enables us to convert any event on an element into a channel.
For a more detailed write-up on channels and generators, read the previous post Channels and Generators in JavaScript.
Channels and Transducers
If you can recall, I mentioned that transducers also work with channels. So now that we have seen the two powerful concepts in isolation, it's time to figure what combing the two concepts brings us.
import { chan, go, putAsync, takeAsync } from 'js-csp'
import { filter, map } from 'transducers.js'
import { add, compose } from 'ramda'
var ch = chan(1, compose(
filter(x => x > 1),
map(add(1))
))
const logValue = v => console.log("Received", v)
putAsync(ch, 1)
putAsync(ch, 2)
putAsync(ch, 3)
putAsync(ch, 4)
putAsync(ch, 5)
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received 3
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received 4
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received 5
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received 6
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received null
takeAsync(ch, logValue) // Received null
ch.close()
We can create a channel via chan and pass in buffer and transducer. It's important to note that you have to define a buffer to work with transducers. Now calling putAsync multiple times will result in the inputs being transformed. You might have noticed that we're using Ramda's compose because it plays nice with map and filter from transducers.js, which also comes with its own compose.
Here's a second example, which is inspired by an example in CSP and Transducers in JavaScript, which explains stateful transducers. We detect if a keydown took place and check if the keys pressed are either ‘z' or ‘x'. Pressing ‘z' starts logging the x and y positions of any mousemove event and pressing ‘x' stops the logging again.
import { chan, go, putAsync, take } from 'js-csp'
import { compose, filter, map } from 'transducers.js'
import { equals, head, indexOf, lte, prop, } from 'ramda'
const listen = (el, type, c) =>
el.addEventListener(type, e => putAsync(c, e))
const filterMouseEvents = (k, v) => e => e[k] && e[k] === v
const filterKeyEvents = (...keys) => {
let open = false
return e => {
return (
open = lte(0, indexOf(prop('key', e), keys)) ?
equals(prop('key', e), head(keys)) :
open
)
}
}
const xForm = compose(
filter(filterKeyEvents('z', 'x')),
filter(filterMouseEvents('type', 'mousemove')),
map(function (e) {
return [e.pageX, e.pageY]
})
)
const c = chan(1, xForm)
listen(document, 'keydown', c)
listen(document, 'mousemove', c)
go(function* () {
while(true) {
console.log(yield take(c))
}
})
Although we didn't cover advanced topics like merging channels and more advanced transformations, these two examples demonstrate what is possible when we use channels and transducers quite well.
I think this should suffice for now. The best advice from here on is to really try to re-implement the transducer function and the channel/transducer example as a starting point.
Outro
We should have a general understanding of channels and transducers now. This combined with the initial post Channels and Generators in JavaScript should be enough to figure out how we can use these concepts with React, Rebass, Recompose to build advanced UIs. This is what the next post in this series will be all about.
If there is some interest for a more thorough walkthrough of transducers including more advanced implementations, let me know. I might create a gist showing a more fine grained approach and cover more details a long the way. Let me know.

…it's driven by the same old media love affair with distribution lock in. I've been on about this ever since I studied Google in 2001: Media traditionally has gained its profits by owning distribution. Cable carriage, network airwaves, newsstand distribution and printing presses: all very expensive, so once you employ enough capital to gain them, it's damn hard to get knocked out.
The web changed all that and promised that economics in the media business would be driven by content and intent: the best content will win, driven by the declared intent of consumers who find it and share it. Search+Social was the biggest wave to hit media since the printing press. And the open technology to make better and better experiences has been on a ten year tear: blogging software, Flash, Ajax, HTML 5, Android, and more and more coming.
But the iPad, just like the iPhone, is designed for vertical integration and distribution lock in. Apple is building its own distribution channel, just as it did with iTunes, and media companies are falling over themselves to make an app for that. Why? Well sure, for once, it's sexy and cool and hip. That's why everyone loved the Wired demo.
But the real reason media companies love the iPad is the same reason I don't: It's an old school, locked in distribution channel that doesn't want to play by the new rules of search+social. Sure, you can watch a movie on it. Sure, you can read a book on it. And sure, you can read a publication on it. But if you want to use the web natively, with all the promise that the web brings to media? Not so much. Apple will include a browser, of course. But will media you find through that browser be able to interact with the iPad platform so as to bring full value to you, the consumer? Nope. Not unless that same media is approved by Apple and makes it into the iPad app store.
And that's why I don't like the iPad. Don't tell me, as a media maker, what I can make and how I can leverage the technology in my audience's hands. And don't tell me, as a media consumer, what's OK for me to interact with, and how.
Yep, I really don't like what the iPad augurs. And I hope, in the end, it's consigned to what it should be: A sexy version of a portable DVD player-cum-Kindle. Nice to have. Not a game changer. Certainly not revolutionary. Unless you're longing for yesteryear, when owning distribution meant owning audiences. Oh, and by the way, Traditional Media Folk: This time Apple owns that distribution channel, not you.
Harumph.

What about all the money I've spent on other people's accounts? Can you see that too, from your lofty behind-the-scenes perch? Can you see the number of times my debit card was used to buy patron or credits for my boyfriend's account? Or that I bought him the game in the first place?
I'm going to tell you my most embarrassing Rift-spending secret now. It's the thing I'm really ashamed to admit. But here goes.
I recruited my boyfriend, four of his brothers, and all of their girlfriends/wives to play this game. Only my boyfriend and one brother lasted, the rest couldn't handle the game's poor performance. After awhile the brother left too, and then it was just my boyfriend, and he was getting more and more frustrated with trying to play the game.
So... I bought him a computer. A good one. One that I really couldn't afford, but I just really wanted him to be able to play Rift with me and be happy, because I love Rift so much, and I love him, and I just so wanted it to work out.
I bought him a computer. To play Rift on. He already had a computer. But I bought him a whole NEW computer. That he didn't need, and I couldn't really afford. For Rift.
So there's my secret. That's how much I love the game, and what I was willing to spend to get somebody I loved to play it with me.
It's not easy moving on, but for me, this is the straw the broke the camel's back. If I can't get the people I love to play the game I love with me - because they can't afford it, because poor performance, because whatever - then I can't love this game anymore. Simple as that.
The current-generation of consoles is currently filled with huge sprawling open-world games, but the developers behind Shenmue 3 said its game won't directly compete against those titles.
Aside from being the most expensive video game developed during its time, Shenmue was the most ambitious, revolutionizing the open-world genre with a living, breathing world. Non-playable characters would have their own daily routines based on the game's day-and-night system, and the open-world environments were filled with activities to partake in.
Speaking to GamesCentral, director Yu Suzuki believes Shenmue 3 remains a ‘unique' game in a time where gamers are not accustomed to playing story-focused games with few action elements.. Due to the team's budget constraints, Shenmue 3 won't compete against huge open-world games and will instead focus on other elements that aren't money-hungry on resources. “I believe the open-world of Shenmue is very different from the other open-world games that exist,” said Suzuki. “Although Shenmue was the first open-world title it is still very unique and so we can focus on other things that do not depend solely on money. So I think there is a lot of playable and very unique elements in the open world that mean I don't need to compete against other big open worlds.”
Suzuki said getting Deep Silver as a publisher was crucial to help them have more resources in developing Shenmue 3. “Even after we completed the Kickstarter project I have been looking for other partners to join us and as you know we have now partnered with Deep Silver. So I'm now comfortable in saying, ‘Don't worry, I can make the whole game you imagined!' Even if the sense of size cannot compare with the biggest open world games, that is impossible without a much bigger budget.”
At present, Suzuki wants Shenmue 3 to retain 70 percent of the elements that defined the original games, while the rest are for newer concepts and natural changes to adapt to the current generation of consoles. “The style of game will be very similar to the original, but we will of course be adding some new features as well,” said Suzuki. “At the moment we are trying to keep it to 30% new and the keep the other 70% of the game similar to the original. But the design is constantly changing and I am always coming up with new concepts that we can try to add to the game if there is the opportunity.”
While Suzuki is open to ideas for adding new elements, he believes changing the core gameplay isn't necessary and doing so might upset the fans. However, some changes were necessary to fit the modern era as well as the current technology for developing games.
“When we started to work on Shenmue III I realized I needed to pick up some of the elements of the original games to please fan, but other elements have become changed or removed. I adapt the story to fit the modern era and to my own changing influences. But also I have to make sure that it is a good fit for Shenmue. So certain aspects of the story have remained constant but Shenmue III has become a new game over time.”

Jennifer Joy "J. J." Philbin[1] (born August 30, 1974)[2] is an American producer and screenwriter. She is best known for her work on the drama series The O.C. and is the daughter of television stars Regis and Joy Philbin.
Career [ edit ]
Philbin's career began soon after she graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1996 when she became a writer for Mad TV, and then joined the script department of Saturday Night Live until 1999. In 2002 she moved on to That Was Then, an ABC drama series, as a writer, and in 2003 began work on the comedy-drama series Dead Like Me, for which she served as both writer and script supervisor for several episodes. She had a meeting with the executive producers of The O.C. in late 2003 and was keen for a job, but another job came up and so she worked shortly as story editor for the sitcom Coupling. In 2004 she joined the O.C. crew after Coupling was canceled and The O.C.'s producers offered her a writing position.[3] For 2004, she served as story editor, but was promoted to executive story editor for the remainder of the show's duration, from 2005 to 2007, and during that time wrote twelve episodes and co-produced another four.[3] Following The O.C.'s end, she became a co-executive producer and writer on the first season of the science fiction drama Heroes.
She and the other Saturday Night Live writers were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in 2001 in the category of "Comedy/Variety Series". In 2018, Philbin is a Consulting Producer on the TV series New Girl. She is also co-creator of the ABC sitcom Single Parents.
Personal life [ edit ]
Philbin was born in New York City to Regis Philbin and Joy Philbin. She attended the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.[1] She says that, growing up, she always wanted to be a writer of some sort, but she particularly enjoyed writing scripts for amateur short films she made with her friends.[3] While working on Saturday Night Live in January 1998, she met The Office writer Michael Schur, who had also been hired to write for the show.[1] The couple married in October 2005 in New York and have two children.[1][4][5]
Why Everyone Should Care About DRM's Punishment Of The Visually Impaired
from the our-problem-too dept
Techdirt writes a lot about the problems with DRM, and how inefficient and inconvenient it is. But for millions of visually-impaired people, those "inconveniences" represent something much deeper, and much worse. Somebody who has started writing eloquently about this issue is Rupert Goodwins. He is one of the UK's most respected technology journalists and also, sadly, is losing his sight. As he points out in a powerful new piece, things ought to be getting better for the visually impaired in the Internet age: there's never been a better time to go blind: we are busy converting the world to digital, and digital is supremely easy to convert. Of course, it hasn't worked out like that, thanks to the widespread use of DRM on ebooks: With DRM, the commercial model of the provider goes beyond an application or a service. It is designed to constrain the customer to using something in only the way approved by the content provider, and it has legal backing.
If I can't use a particular word processor, I can find another. But if I can't read a particular book because it is only readable on a particular platform and that platform isn't readable to me, I'm stuck. He goes on to describe his attempts to get an ebook he had bought into a form that he could read. After half an hour of fruitless efforts -- which included receiving some rather ironic marketing messages telling him to "enjoy the experience" and "enjoy your book" -- he did what most people would have done at the start: he cracked the DRM. As he points out: I dare say this is against the terms and conditions of one or more of the many impossible-to-read EULAs I clicked on in the process of trying to be a responsible digital consumer. But the author got paid and nobody lost out -- except for me, in terms of time lost and mental misery endured. He also mentions something important that everyone working at companies employing DRM might like to consider: This is the reward you get for being disabled and wanting to do the right thing. This is how the world's most splendid machine for freeing our minds from our physical shackles is itself being shackled. This is what will happen to all of you reading this as you get old. I know this, I've done the research: most of you will start to go blind before you die. Ultimately, then, DRM is a problem for all of us. Maybe we should fix it sooner, rather than later, so that people like Goodwins can read the books they have bought without resorting to methods that are illegal, and we can read texts when we're old and increasingly blind ourselves.

You know who Adolf Hitler is. The Fuehrer needs no introduction.
Here are 10 inspirational quotes from the man who changed the course of history, in no particular order :
Only those who are passionate themselves can arouse passion in others.
Struggle is the father of all things. It is not by the principles of humanity that man lives or is able to preserve himself above the animal world, but solely by means of the most brutal struggle.
People may not always believe what you say, but they will believe what you do.
Life is like a mirror, if you frown at it, it frowns back; if you smile, it returns the greeting.
When you are in light, everything will follow you. But when you enter dark, even your own shadow will not follow you, that is life
Never deprive someone of hope; it may be all they have.
If you want to shine like the sun, first you have to burn like it.
Obstacles do not exist to be surrendered to, but only to be broken.
To be a leader means to be able to move masses.
Never trust a person who isn't having at least one crisis.
Feel inspired? Heil Hitler!
The Haqqani network is still fighting against NATO forces in Afghanistan.
Last week the US designated the group as a terror organisation and pushed through a resolution at the UN targeting it for global sanctions.
Western leaders believe the network is based across the border in Pakistan and may even to some extent be protected there.
But if you ask Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan's foreign minister, she will tell you her country has nothing to do with the group, and resents implications that it is not doing enough to fight extremists:
"My country has lost as much blood as anyone else ... I am opposed to the narrative that Pakistan is somehow not doing enough,” she says.
The ability of extremists to keep fighting for their agenda in Pakistan was highlighted recently when Malala Yousafzai, a school girl, was shot in the head by the Taliban for her campaign to bring education to little girls.
Again, many were left wondering why the government had not done more to protect her.
Asked if they felt "guilty" for failing to keep Yousafzai safe, Khar says: "The government on at least three different occasions offered to provide security. Now, that was a girl and a family who wanted to live a normal life ...
"This is a huge wake-up call and when I say that we did whatever we could, and we are doing whatever we can, I am understanding the enormity of the challenge, and seeing that. But I would refuse to have my country be blamed for not standing up enough, when we are a country which has had more losses than any other country."
But these are issues that are affecting the perception of Pakistan abroad, at a time when there are also tensions with the US about its use of drone strikes on Pakistani territory as part of the war against extremists in Afghanistan.
"There are two elements to this war," Khar says. "One is the war that you have on the field ... but the more important war that we are still fighting is, I think, against the mindset that we have allowed to develop. What is happening in Afghanistan is the ideological space that has been provided ... The contraction of this ideological space requires that people must not feel that they are being unfairly dealt with - that nations are being unfairly dealt with - the Afghans must not feel that, Pakistan must not feel that."
Meanwhile domestically, the country is also facing stark challenges. Millions of people live in poverty, while at the same time Pakistan spends massive amounts on a strong defence system that includes a large arsenal of nuclear weapons. And Pakistan's different state institutions appear to be at war with each other.
"These are growing pains. This is a country which has suffered for almost 36 years of non-democratic rule, non-constitutional rule. It is a country which is just getting out of four-and-a-half years of democratic rule; give it some time. Every country, every nation, deserves some time."
In this episode of Talk to Al Jazeera, Hina Rabbani Khar sits down with Taymoor Nabili and talks about the challenges facing her country.

Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle's campaign is banning two Las Vegas television stations from covering the candidate's election night party as punishment for asking questions without permission.
The episode that sparked the media ban was caught on video and posted online by the Las Vegas CBS affiliate. In the video, Angle literally runs from reporters asking questions about her views on foreign policy and the economy, saying only that she wanted reporters to focus on increasing voter turnout, not asking her policy questions.
After about four minutes of refusing to answer any questions, Angle was finally whisked away by her campaign staff. Fortunately, there wasn't any head stomping or private security arrests, but shortly after the incident, the Angle campaign announced the media ban, proving that just like Joe Miller, she too learned something from the East German government.

UTC−12:00 is a time offset that subtracts 12 hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is the last to celebrate a New Year, and it is sometimes referred to as the International Date Line West time zone (IDLW).[1]
As standard time (all year round) [ edit ]
Oceania [ edit ]
UTC−12 is a nautical time zone comprising the high seas between 180° and 172°30′W longitude, and the time is obtained by subtracting twelve hours from Coordinated Universal Time. Ships using this time are the last to begin each calendar day.
Characteristics of the time zone that observes UTC−12 [ edit ]
A number of inhabited islands lie within the longitudinal limits of this time zone, but none of them keeps the date and time of UTC−12. Instead, they keep the time and date (or just the date) of one of the neighbouring zones, usually because they belong, politically, to an island group whose other members lie mostly in the neighbouring time zone.
Since the International Date Line West (IDLW) time zone represents the last place on Earth where a particular date exists before rolling over to the next date, it is sometimes used for deadlines and referred to as Anywhere on Earth (AoE). This means that if the deadline has not passed in the UTC–12 zone, the deadline has not yet passed.[1]

Supporters of a new ecocide law also believe it could be used to prosecute “climate deniers”. Effort started by Club of Rome lawyer.
Excerpts from the Guardian article:
A campaign to declare the mass destruction of ecosystems an international crime against peace – alongside genocide and crimes against humanity – is being launched in the UK.
The proposal for the United Nations to accept “ecocide” as a fifth “crime against peace”, which could be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC), is the brainchild of British lawyer-turned-campaigner Polly Higgins.
The radical idea would have a profound effect on industries blamed for widespread damage to the environment like fossil fuels, mining, agriculture, chemicals and forestry.
Supporters of a new ecocide law also believe it could be used to prosecute “climate deniers” who distort science and facts to discourage voters and politicians from taking action to tackle global warming and climate change.
“Ecocide is in essence the very antithesis of life,” says Higgins. “It leads to resource depletion, and where there is escalation of resource depletion, war comes chasing behind. Where such destruction arises out of the actions of mankind, ecocide can be regarded as a crime against peace.”
Higgins, formerly a barrister in London specialising in employment, has already had success at the UN with a Universal Declaration for Planetary Rights, modelled on the human rights declaration. “My starting point was ‘how do we create a duty of care to the planet, a pre-emptive obligation to not harm the planet?'”
After a successful launch at the UN in 2008, the idea has been adopted by the Bolivian government, who will propose a full members' vote, and Higgins has taken up her campaign for ecocide.
See the Guardian article for the rest
==================
Polly Higgins, the lawyer behind the idea of ecocide, is on the board of DESERTEC (www.desertec.org). As press releases make clear [quote] “The DESERTEC Foundation is a charitable initiative of the Club of Rome” Polly Higgins can be seen listed as a board member on the press releases of DESERTEC.

The questionable associations and actions by many of its leaders cast serious doubt on CAIR's claims of moderation and restraint. Some have committed criminal acts themselves; others have ties to organizations with connections to Islamic extremism.
Those convicted of direct criminal activity include Ghassan Elashi, a founding board member of CAIR-Texas; Randall (Ismail) Royer, once a communications specialist for the national group, and Bassam Khafagi, the organization's one-time director of community relations.
In the more egregious cases, the organization has tried to distance itself from the individuals, contorting both logic and the English language. As the IPT's series on CAIR's history and activities continues, we look at the suspect nature of these examples and others close to the organization.
• Ghassan Elashi, who attended a 1993 Philadelphia meeting called by Hamas to discuss derailing U.S. peace initiatives, was convicted in 2004 on six criminal counts, including making false statements, conspiracy to violate the Export Administration Regulations and the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, and conspiracy to file false shipper's export declaration forms. He was a defendant again in the 2007 Hamas-support trial of the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), where jurors were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on the charges against him.
Elashi served as HLF chairman and treasurer and vice president of Infocom, a computer export company. He was sentenced to 80 months in prison for making illegal computer shipments to Libya and Syria and conspiring to send money to Mousa Abu Marzook, an admitted Hamas leader.
Seeking to minimize Elashi's ties to CAIR, Executive Director Nihad Awad assured U.S. senators in 2003 testimony, "Mr. Elashi was never an employee or officer of our corporation. The fact that he was once associated with one of our almost twenty regional chapters has no legal significance…"
• Randall Royer, the former CAIR communications specialist, has a more colorful criminal history. Police who stopped his car for a traffic violation in 2001 found an AK-47-style rifle and 219 rounds of ammunition inside. Then, in 2003, he was indicted on charges stemming from participation in the ongoing jihad in Kashmir -- specifically, doing propaganda work for Lashkar-e Taiba, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group, and personally firing at Indian positions in Kashmir.
Pleading guilty to weapons and explosives charges in 2004, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In later grand jury testimony, Royer admitted that the cell's primary goal was to fight with the Taliban against United States forces in Afghanistan
Again, CAIR reacted defensively, seeking to downplay both his ties to the organization and, indeed, the nature of his crimes. "Notwithstanding the fact that any criminal action to which he pleaded guilty was done when Royer was no longer employed with CAIR and not at CAIR's direction," the group said, "it is important to note that the only crimes that he pleaded guilty to were weapons charges, not charges of terrorism."
CAIR's timing point contradicts media reports indicating that Royer still worked for the group in October 2001; while the charges to which Royer pleaded guilty do not directly contain the word "terrorism," they involved his activities in support of a conspiracy against the United States.
Bassam Khafagi pleaded guilty to bank and visa fraud charges in September 2003, after his arrest and indictment earlier that year. "At the time of his arrest," the Associated Press reported, "he was community affairs director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations."
Khafagi also served as a founding member and president of the Islamic Assembly of North America. That group was investigated on charges of money laundering and recruiting terrorists over the Internet and the FBI raided its offices in February 2003.
Trying to put the best face on the situation once again, Awad claimed in Senate testimony, "Khafagi was never an ‘employee' of CAIR," but rather an "independent contractor for CAIR."
Among other CAIR officials:
• Nabil Sadoun, currently on CAIR's board and chair of CAIR-Texas, helped found the United Association for Studies and Research (UASR). While there has been no criminal prosecution of the UASR, Sadoun founded it along with Hamas leader Marzook. Internal records show the UASR was a founding member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Palestine Committee in America. Federal prosecutors say that committee's "designed purpose was to support Hamas."
Sadoun also co-founded the Muslim American Youth Association. MAYA's conferences, many of which it co-sponsored with IAP, have long supported Hamas.
• Mohammad El-Mezain, the former chairman and director of endowments for HLF, conducted fundraising at a 2004 CAIR-New York event, soliciting over $100,000 for CAIR. He was indicted soon afterward for providing material support to Hamas. Acquitted of most counts against him in the HLF trial, he faces retrial on a charge of conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist group.
• Rabih Haddad served as a fundraiser for CAIR's Ann Arbor chapter. He co-founded the Global Relief Foundation (GRF), one of the largest Islamic charities in the United States -- but one that the U.S. government has investigated of funding violent jihadism.
In December 2001 the FBI raided GRF's headquarters and arrested Haddad, then its chairman, on a visa violation. He was deported to Lebanon after an immigration judge found that he presented "a substantial risk to the national security of the United States." The Treasury Department said Haddad had been a member of Makhtab Al-Khidamat, the precursor organization to Al Qaeda.

With so many sensitive “politically correct” problems now, we're now living in a society where even FOOD can be deemed racist. I'm not kidding!
Principal Verenice Guiterrez, who certainly voted for Obama, runs the Harvey Scott School (K-8) in Portland, Oregon. And she has made an announcement that peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist!
More from The Political Insider
Why? Because, as Principal Guiterrez explained, this effort was made to, “improve education for students of color.” She noted that some students – such as those from Mexico or Somalia – haven't eaten bread in their culture. Instead, they eat pitas, tortas, and other bread substitutes.
Therefore, the serving of delicious PB&Js is a brazen display of white privilege. The Principal wants to cancel out this supposed racial privilege and “change their teaching practices to boost minority students' performance.”
How is this possible? Food can't make racial comments… And a sandwich can't even watch The Dukes of Hazzard. It is two slices of bread, with your favorite jelly and crunchy or creamy peanut butter. Most children think they are delicious, and I bet you probably still eat them.
They are nutritious, full of energy, and are cheap. That's why millions of people eat PB&Js every day!
I wonder if I should rush to the store and buy whole grain wheat bread. Perhaps that would boost my kitchen's racial diversity?
This has gone too far. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are not racist and children should be allowed to eat them.

Mazda has finally announced how much it will charge for the 2016 MX-5 Miata Cup race car, the factory track animal that will compete in the brand's newly global MX-5 Cup racing series. Before we reveal the price, keep in mind that this is a one-stop-shop race car, an MX-5 fully outfitted with a safety cage, racing brakes and suspension, and stripped of all unnecessary hardware while being fully compliant with MX-5 Cup rules, as well as remaining eligible for SCCA club races and NASA racing. Are you ready?
The Miata race car will cost $53,000, or $27,265 more than a base, street-legal 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Sport. Keep in mind, however, that the Miata Cup car comes with a full complement of track safety gear, an optimized suspension, tires and wheels, and a sealed engine, differential, transmission, and ECU. Racing teams and drivers intent on competing in the MX-5 Cup racing series need only provide their own racing seat, a choice Mazda acknowledges differs among racers "due to varying customer preference." Given that used Spec Miata race cars can run more than $40,000, $53K for a brand-spanking-new 2016 model fully outfitted for racing seems like a steal.
Mazda doesn't assemble the cars itself, instead sending new-from-the-factory rides to Long Road Racing in North Carolina, a shop that performs the final conversion. Even though Mazda's director of motorsports, John Doonan, expects "to sell out of the first batch of cars rapidly," the Mazdaspeed website (through which you can order one of the cars, provided you've expressed intent to race in the Cup series—more amateur prospective buyers will need to wait until a later date to place their orders) declares that Long Road Racing will "build as many MX-5 Cup cars as we have orders." As if the near-term awesomeness of a well-organized and affordable single-make sports-car racing series isn't tempting enough, the cars also could have some future collectability due to their serialized components, which should help trace their history decades down the road.
Shawnee Hills Police Chief Sean LeFever has been indicted on four counts of theft in office stemming from a July complaint that he had received improper compensation. Delaware County Prosecuting Attorney Carol O'Brien announced the indictment outlining the four counts - all fifth-degree felonies - on Tuesday.
Shawnee Hills Police Chief Sean LeFever has been indicted on four counts of theft in office, Delaware County Prosecutor Carol O�Brien announced on Tuesday.
The charges end months of waiting for residents of the village just north of Dublin, where LeFever has been on leave since August.
The indictment stems from a July complaint that LeFever had received improper compensation.
Village officials have said the investigation involves LeFever�s work-time reporting. According to a sheriff�s incident report, the suspected crimes took place from Aug. 7, 2014, to June 15.
The indictment sheds some light on the situation for Shawnee Hills residents, who haven�t seen their police chief for months, even though LeFever is well and is being paid regularly.
The 43-year-old chief of five years for 770 residents in the village has been on paid leave since Aug. 14. That�s when Delaware County Sheriff Russell Martin advised Mayor Pat Monahan that LeFever was being investigated for alleged theft in office. Since then, LeFever has been paid about $16,000.
The investigation �went on for longer than I ever wanted it to, but it did,� said Monahan. He said he hoped that the allegations were a misunderstanding, in part because of a flexible-scheduling policy.
�When you manage people, you let your manager also manage time,� Monahan has said.
Because officers aren�t paid well, Monahan allowed them flexible hours and comp time.
�I expect they can shift around their time,� the mayor said.
LeFever, who lives in Dublin, declined to discuss details of the case without his lawyer present.
�It has been extremely difficult,� he said of staying at home for months, knowing that many in the tight-knit community may be questioning his authority.
�Trust me, I know,� he said in an interview before the indictment was announced. �I�ve been waiting for answers, too. I�ve been waiting to give my side of the story.�
LeFever�s attorney, Sam Shamansky, has described the case as �unusual and complex.�
�I think generally there�s a lot more to these cases than meets the eye. We don�t anticipate a speedy resolution, but one that is decided in court,� he said.
Shamansky said that an indictment against LeFever was �imminent.�
�He�s eager to have his day in court, at which time he will fully and completely set forth his defense and explain his actions,� said Shamansky. �His preference would be to continue to serve the citizens of Shawnee Hills, rather than sitting at home.�
Shamansky said on Tuesday that LeFever will plead not guilty to the charges.
Carol Kender, a village resident who ran for mayor against Monahan in November, said, �I�m wondering why we still have the chief on the payroll.�
As a full-time chief, LeFever oversees two full-time officers and several part-time officers. The chief�s salary is about $48,000, Monahan said. LeFever previously trained security officers at Nationwide Insurance.
�Everyone�s aware of it,� Acting Chief Russell Baron said of LeFever�s absence. �We�re just moving forward.�
Some of the department�s unwritten policies have now been documented, such as prohibiting officers from calling off work in order to work a special-duty assignment.
�Our policy was kind of loose and open, and we just wanted to solidify them,� Baron said.
Investigators had asked for time sheets and work records for other officers. But Baron said he�s been told no one else is under investigation. �The actions were his (LeFever�s) alone,� he said.
Baron said he�s eager to keep the chief�s job, pending the investigation�s outcome.
�I�m hoping that council chooses to keep me in the position, but that�s up to them.�
Meanwhile, residents such as Kender continue to ask questions.
�We�re way too small a village to be dealing with something like this.�

Imagine that you're an author, academic, journalist, commentator or blogger. You've been writing and opining on Israel, America and the Jews for most of your adult life. You may even have achieved a certain elevated status: you get paid to give speeches, you are quoted by your peers, you are a welcome guest at symposiums and workshops and every once in a while even the television networks are interested in what you might have to say.
Then one day, everything changes. Suddenly, the only thing that people want to hear about is Peter Beinart. The only thing they ask you is whether you've read his book “The Crisis of Zionism”, and what you thought of it. You may want to change the subject and write about something else, but your editor suggests you take another swipe at Beinart. It doesn't matter whether you're for or against, he tells you, as long as it's for or against Beinart. “It's the only game in town,” he says.
Peter Beinart. Natasha Mozgovaya
If one needed any further proof of the rock star status of the Jewish world's enfant terrible, it was on full display at Columbia University on Wednesday night, as throngs of frustrated fans and foes were turned away from the hall in which Beinart was to square off against the Shalem Center's Daniel Gordis, in a debate billed as “a heavyweight fight on Zionism” sponsored by Columbia's undergraduate journal The Current and by Tablet magazine. The authorities simply refused to allow any more people into the already jam-packed hall, which might have been twice or thrice bigger and would still be filled to capacity.
Most of the people in the audience weren't necessarily fans of Beinart or of his controversial book or of his leftist, liberal anti-establishment message. Most, in fact, appeared to be right of center, at the very least, and very much in agreement with Gordis' assertion that Beinart's unequivocal condemnation of the Israeli government and its settlement policy was somehow disloyal to the Zionist cause because “it encourages the world to turn the screws on Israel. “
But even though Gordis is an accomplished author of no less than eight books about Israel, Judaism and American Jews, there was only one book that the audience was interested in, and it wasn't his. Gordis was there on behalf of the prosecution, Beinart was acting in self-defense, but there was only one book on trial, and it was “Crisis of Zionism."
The debate itself was polite and civilized, excruciatingly sterile by Israeli standards – except for the guy who waited for an hour and a half before shouting “Beinart you're an idiot” – and the two protagonists were patently proud of the civilized manner in which they agreed to disagree. Gordis, who wrote a scathing review of Beinart's book, took some sting out of the debate by declaring his own support for a Palestinian state and the removal of some settlements, but he placed the onus for the lack of peace squarely on the shoulders of the Palestinians and said that Beinart was a “clear eyed realist about Israel - but a romantic about the Palestinians”. Tellingly, in what may have been a Freudian slip, he promoted the 41 year old author and journalist to the status of “one of the leaders of American Judaism” and a worthy adversary for any debate on the future of Zionism.
Indeed, even though they have launched what seems at times to be a concerted campaign to discredit him and his book, Beinart's detractors are having a hard time putting him down. Some have been rightfully criticizing his apparent inability to fully appreciate the traumas of terror-stricken Israelis, others have been legitimately knocking his misguided and tactically ill-advised call for a boycott on settlements, but most have been authoring article after outraged article in which they nitpick Beinart's book to death, raising hell about an errant verb here or an unfortunate adjective there, maliciously cutting down trees in order to obscure the forest, reviving the canard of the “liberal media” – which have generously hosted their diatribes - in order to explain the enduring resonance of his message. One thing they have failed to do is come to grips with Beinart's stipulation: that Israel's settlement drive in the West Bank and its 40 year rule over stateless Palestinians are eroding Israeli democracy and hijacking the Zionist enterprise, that the American Jewish establishment has been mindlessly aiding and abetting this process and that young, liberal Jews – even if they are only a minority - are finding it increasingly difficult to identify with either.

One can well understand why Beinart's popularity, or notoriety if you will, is viewed as a threat by people who hold contrary views; much of the vicious tone directed at him is par for the right wing course when it comes to eradicating the last remnants of leftist dissent. But one suspects that there is another powerful emotional element at play here - jealousy – that is the source for the copious amounts of venom that have been hurled at Beinart.
Think about it: even though he is a self-declared Zionist who attends an Orthodox synagogue and sends his children to a Jewish school, Beinart is a relative newcomer to the Israel-America-Jews nexus. He wrote two books about American foreign policy and rose through the ranks of the New Republic without devoting any special attention to the future of Zionism or its adherents. Then he suddenly comes out of nowhere and bursts on the scene with his explosive May 2010 article in the New York Review of Books on “The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment” and now compounds his impact with his equally hell-raising book “The Crisis of Zionism.” For people who have been doing this all their lives, Beinart's meteoric blast-off to the center of the Jewniverse must be infuriating, to say the least.
He looks like a good Jewish boy from the Upper West Side, his academic credentials are almost boringly top notch and his speaking style is detached and calculated, but somehow Beinart has been cast as the Mick Jagger of the organized Jewish world, the bad boy your parents don't want you to listen to, the rebel who unflinchingly looks the establishment in the eye. He brings a buzz when he arrives and spreads stardust when he leaves, causing the two young women who were swooning near me throughout the Columbia debate to ferociously claw their way to the podium the minute it was over “just to shake his hand, oh my God, oh my God.” And they, I suspect, were from the Gordis side of the argument.
Besides the cogent and compelling presentation of the main thrust of his case, which makes “The Crisis of Zionism” into such a powerful book despite its deficiencies, Beinart has the consummate actor's knack for impeccable timing and that divine and indefinable gift called charisma. It may be a New York-intellectual-Jewishy kind of charisma that wouldn't play all that well in Zion itself, but among young American liberal Zionists – pro, post and anti – it sparks the kind of electricity that money can't buy. And there is room to suspect that it's driving some of Beinart's peers, both those on the left who are upholding their right to stay silent, and those on the right who are blasting Beinart with everything they've got, right up the wall.
P.S. And by the way, even though I've been doing this for close to thirty years, when you search for my name in Google you come up with only a tenth of the results that you get when you look for the name of that upstart Peter Beinart. I just checked.

Fuchida in training for the attack on Pearl Harbor
Mitsuo Fuchida (淵田 美津雄, Fuchida Mitsuo, 3 December 1902 – 30 May 1976) was a Japanese captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and a bomber aviator in the Japanese navy before and during World War II. He is perhaps best known for leading the first wave of air attacks on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Working under the overall fleet commander, Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, Fuchida was responsible for the coordination of the entire aerial attack.
After the war ended, Fuchida became a Christian evangelist and traveled through the United States and Europe to tell his story. He settled permanently in the United States (although he never became a U.S. citizen).
Early life and education [ edit ]
Mitsuo Fuchida was born in what is now part of Katsuragi, Nara Prefecture, Japan to Yazo and Shika Fuchida on 3 December 1902. He entered the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, Hiroshima, in 1921, where he befriended classmate Minoru Genda and discovered an interest in flying. He graduated as a midshipman on 24 July 1924, and was promoted to ensign on 1 December 1925 and to sub-lieutenant on 1 December 1927. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December 1930.[citation needed] Specializing in horizontal bombing, Fuchida was made an instructor in that technique in 1936. He gained combat experience during the Second Sino-Japanese War, when he was assigned to the aircraft carrier Kaga in 1929 and then to the Sasebo Air Group, He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 December 1936 and was accepted into the Naval Staff College. Fuchida joined the aircraft carrier Akagi in 1939 as the commander of the air group. Fuchida was made commander in October 1941.[citation needed]
World War II [ edit ]
Pearl Harbor [ edit ]
On Sunday, 7 December 1941, a Japanese force under the command of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo—consisting of six carriers with 423 aircraft—was ready to attack the United States base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. At 06:00, the first wave of 183 dive bombers, torpedo bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters took off from carriers 250 mi (400 km) north of Oahu and headed for the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.
At 07:40 Hawaiian Standard Time, Mitsuo Fuchida, who by this time had achieved the rank of commander, arrived with the first attack wave on Oahu's north shore near Kahuku Point. The first attack wave then banked west and flew along the northwest coast. Fuchida ordered "Tenkai" (Take attack position), and upon seeing no U.S. activity at Pearl Harbor, Fuchida slid back the canopy of his Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bomber, tailcode AI-301, and fired a single dark blue flare known as a "black dragon", the signal to attack.
Passing Waimea Bay at 07:49, Fuchida instructed his radio operator, Petty Officer 1st Class Norinobu Mizuki, to send the coded signal "To, To, To" (totsugekiseyo—"to charge") to the other aircraft. Fuchida, thinking Lt Cmdr Shigeru Itaya's Zeroes had missed the signal, fired a second flare. Lt Cmdr Kakuichi Takahashi, overall leader of the first wave dive bombers, saw both flares and misunderstood the signal. Thinking the dive bombers were to attack, he led his dive bombers into immediate attack position. Lt Cmdr Shigeharu Murata, overall leader of the torpedo bombers, observed both flares and saw Takahashi's planes gliding into attack formation. He knew there was a misunderstanding which could not be rectified, so he led his torpedo bombers into attack positions. At this point, Cmdr Fuchida's pilot, Lieutenant Mitsuo Matsuzaki, guided their bomber along with the remaining horizontal bombers in a formation sweep around Keana Point and headed down the western coast of Oahu.
At 07:53, Fuchida ordered Mizuki to send the code words "Tora! Tora! Tora!"[a] back to the carrier Akagi, the flagship of 1st Air Fleet. The message meant that complete surprise had been achieved. Due to favorable atmospheric conditions, the transmission of the "Tora! Tora! Tora!" code words from the moderately powered transmitter were heard over a ship's radio in Japan by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the wartime naval commander, and his staff, who were sitting up through the night awaiting word on the attack.
As the first wave returned to the carriers, Fuchida remained over the target to assess damage and observe the second-wave attack. He returned to his carrier only after the second wave had completed its mission. With great pride, he announced that the U.S. battleship fleet had been destroyed. Fuchida inspected his craft and found 21 large flak holes: the main control wires were barely holding together. The successful attack made Fuchida a national hero who was granted a personal audience with Emperor Hirohito.
Other actions [ edit ]
On 19 February 1942, Fuchida led the first of two waves of 188 aircraft in a devastating air raid on Darwin, Australia.[10] On 5 April, he led another series of air attacks by carrier-based Japanese aircraft against Royal Navy bases in Ceylon, which was the headquarters of the British Eastern Fleet, in what Winston Churchill described as "the most dangerous moment" of World War II.[citation needed]
On 4 June 1942, while onboard Akagi, Fuchida was wounded at the Battle of Midway. Unable to fly while recovering from an emergency shipboard appendectomy a few days before the battle, he was on the ship's bridge during the morning attacks by U.S. aircraft. After Akagi was hit, a chain reaction from burning fuel and live bombs began the destruction of the ship. When flames blocked the exit from the bridge, the officers evacuated down a rope, and as Fuchida slid down, an explosion threw him to the deck and broke both his ankles.
Staff officer [ edit ]
After spending several months recuperating, Fuchida spent the rest of the war in Japan as a staff officer. In October 1944, he was promoted to captain. The day before the first atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, he was in that city to attend a week-long military conference with Japanese army officers. Fuchida received a long-distance phone call from Navy Headquarters asking him to return to Tokyo. The day after the bombing, he returned to Hiroshima with a party sent to assess the damage. All members of Fuchida's party later died of radiation poisoning, but Fuchida exhibited no symptoms. Fuchida's military career ended with his demobilization in November 1945.[citation needed]
Postwar activities [ edit ]
After the war, Fuchida was called on to testify at the trials of some of the Japanese military for Japanese war crimes. This infuriated him as he believed this was little more than "victors' justice". In the spring of 1947, convinced that the U.S. had treated the Japanese the same way and determined to bring that evidence to the next trial, Fuchida went to Uraga Harbor near Yokosuka to meet a group of returning Japanese prisoners of war. He was surprised to find his former flight engineer, Kazuo Kanegasaki, who all had believed had died in the Battle of Midway. When questioned, Kanegasaki told Fuchida that they were not tortured or abused, much to Fuchida's surprise, and then went on to tell him of a young lady, Peggy Covell, who served them with the deepest love and respect, but whose parents, missionaries, had been killed by Japanese soldiers on the island of Panay in the Philippines.
For Fuchida, this was inexplicable, as in the Bushido code revenge was not only permitted, it was "a responsibility" for an offended party to carry out revenge to restore honor. The murderer of one's parents would be a sworn enemy for life. He became almost obsessed trying to understand why anyone would treat their enemies with love and forgiveness.[citation needed]
In the fall of 1948, Fuchida was passing by the bronze statue of Hachikō at the Shibuya Station when he was handed a pamphlet about the life of Jacob DeShazer, a member of the Doolittle Raid who was captured by the Japanese after his B-25 bomber ran out of fuel over occupied China. In the pamphlet, "I Was a Prisoner of Japan" DeShazer, a former U.S. Army Air Forces staff sergeant and bombardier, told his story of imprisonment, torture and his account of an "awakening to God." This experience increased Fuchida's curiosity of the Christian faith. In September 1949, after reading the Bible for himself, he became a Christian. In May 1950, Fuchida and DeShazer met for the first time. Fuchida created the Captain Fuchida Evangelistical Association based in Seattle, Washington and spoke full-time of his conversion to the Christian faith in presentations titled "From Pearl Harbor To Calvary".
In 1951, Fuchida, along with a colleague, published an account of the Battle of Midway from the Japanese side. In 1952, he toured the United States as a member of the Worldwide Christian Missionary Army of Sky Pilots. Fuchida remained dedicated to a similar initiative as the group for the remainder of his life.
In February 1954, Reader's Digest published Fuchida's story of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Fuchida also wrote and co-wrote books, including From Pearl Harbor to Golgotha, a.k.a. From Pearl Harbor to Calvary, and a 1955 expansion of his 1951 book Midway, a.k.a. Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy's Story. His autobiography, titled "Shinjuwan Kogeki no Sotaicho no Kaiso", was published in Japan in 2007. This was translated into English by Douglas Shinsato and Tadanori Urabe and published in 2011 under the title, "For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor". Fuchida's story is also recounted in God's Samurai: Lead Pilot at Pearl Harbor by Donald Goldstein, Katherine V. Dillon and Gordon W. Prange.
According to Fuchida's son, his father had a green card allowing permanent residence in the U.S. but he never obtained U.S. citizenship. This is contrary to the assertions of several authors.[quantify]
Fuchida died of complications caused by diabetes in Kashiwara, near Osaka on 30 May 1976 at the age of 73.
Published works [ edit ]
Fuchida was the author of three books, one on the Battle of Midway, one a memoir, and one on his conversion to Christianity.
Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy's Story was coauthored with Masatake Okumiya. In a section entitled "Five Fateful Minutes", Fuchida (as translated) writes "Five minutes! Who would have believed that the tide of battle would shift in that brief interval of time? ... We had been caught flatfooted in the most vulnerable condition possible—decks loaded with planes armed and fueled for attack." Later scholarship (Parshall et al.) dispute Fuchida's description.

From Pearl Harbor to Calvary, originally published as From Pearl Harbor to Golgotha, is the story of Fuchida's Christian conversion.
Historical controversy [ edit ]
Fuchida was an important figure in the early portion of the Pacific War, and his written accounts, translated into English and published in the U.S., were highly influential.[19] However, the veracity of Fuchida's statements on a variety of topics has been subsequently called into question. This process began in Japan in 1971, with the publication of the Japanese official war history volume on the Battle of Midway, which explicitly contradicted Fuchida's version of events. In 2001, historians H.P. Willmott and Haruo Tohmatsu in their Pearl Harbor, dismissed Fuchida's rendition of having demanded a third-wave against Pearl Harbor's fuel tanks as "blatant and shameless self-advertisement" regarding "an episode which never took place."[21] These criticisms were repeated by historian Jonathan Parshall and Mark Stille's Tora! Tora! Tora! Pearl Harbor 1941.[23] Alan Zimm's 2011 Attack on Pearl Harbor: Strategy, Combat, Myths, Deceptions, reinforced and enlarged these earlier criticisms and added new charges, including Fuchida having fabricated a battle damage assessment that was presented to Emperor Hirohito. Zimm subsequently accused Fuchida of lying about important decisions and signals he made as strike leader immediately prior to the attack, while blaming others for his own errors. With respect to the Battle of Midway, Fuchida's account of the readiness of the Japanese counterstrike aircraft during the American dive-bomber attack has been disputed by historians Parshall and Anthony Tully in their 2005 work Shattered Sword, as well as Dallas Isom's Midway Inquest,[28] and Craig Symonds The Battle of Midway.[29] Parshall also disputed Fuchida's uncorroborated claims of attendance on the battleship USS Missouri during the Japanese surrender ceremony in 1945, these criticisms being later amplified by Zimm. Fuchida's version of some of these events has, however, been defended by writer Martin Bennett.
When asked about his views of the Hiroshima bombing, Fuchida stated that although "it was a disaster", it was his belief that "it saved half a million lives".[32]
Portrayals [ edit ]
In the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora!, Fuchida was portrayed by Japanese actor Takahiro Tamura.

Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up sign (Shutterstock).
In a deep dive into what is known about President-elect Donald Trump's foreign business connection, the New York Times has exposed a multitude of conflicts that could have a major impact on how he conducts foreign affairs — to the extent that diplomats already in place are afraid to make a move that could “frustrate Trump's overseas business partners or political allies.”
“The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump's companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay,” writes the Times based upon what little he revealed before the election. “What's more, the true extent of Mr. Trump's global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.”
Noting the connection of the President-elect to his businesses, the Times posits, “Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president's hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.”
“The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,” explains Michael H. Fuchs, recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. “They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.”
Fuchs also noted, “American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump's companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.”

The rumors have been circulating for a few months now and we reported on it back in July. Today, it was officially announced that Mercedes-AMG will purchase a 25% interest in the Italian marque for an undisclosed price. In addition to the financial exchange, the two brands will also cooperate on marketing and sales initiatives, plus Mercedes-AMG will be able to appoint one board member. If approval is granted by the relevant Italian authorities, the purchase will occur sometime in November.
This will mean that the three main German car manufactures will now have a presence in the motorcycle industry (BMW with BMW Motorrad and Volkswagen with Ducati).
The full press release is below (and note the confirmation of the soon-to-be released Stradale 800 and the all new Turismo Veloce 800 models):
The sports-car and performance brand Mercedes-AMG of the Daimler AG and the motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta have signed a cooperation agreement on a long-term
partnership. Cooperation between the two high-end brands with long traditions and histories will include the area of marketing and sales. At the same time, Mercedes-AMG GmbH will acquire a 25% interest in MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. No details have been disclosed of the price to be paid for the stake in MV Agusta Motor. Mercedes-AMG will appoint one member of MV Agusta's board of directors. The partnership is still subject to the approval of the relevant authorities, which is expected to be granted in late
November.
Tobias Moers, Chief Executive of Mercedes-AMG GmbH: “In MV Agusta, we have found the perfect two-wheel partner for Mercedes-AMG. This manufacturer with a long tradition and Mercedes-AMG are connected not only by a long and successful racing history, but also by shared values and goals for the future – allowing the experience of utmost perfection, optimal performance and motorsport technology for the road. The cooperation with MV Agusta also underscores the importance of AMG as the sports-car and high-performance brand of Mercedes-Benz Cars. The partnership provides us with an entry into a world of additional high-performance enthusiasts.”
Giovanni Castiglioni, President and CEO of MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., commented: “MV Agusta and Mercedes-AMG are a perfect brand fit: Two complementary companies that stand for design, high performance and excellence. Mercedes-AMG will help MV Agusta to further expand globally and to accelerate our growth. The uniqueness of MV Agusta will further enhance Mercedes-AMG's leadership in the high-performance segment.”
Wilko Stark, Vice President Daimler Strategy & Mercedes-Benz Cars Product Strategy and Planning: “The positioning of Mercedes-AMG as the performance brand in the Mercedes-Benz product portfolio will be further strengthened through the strategic partnership with MV Agusta. The strategic cooperation with MV Agusta will allow us to address high-performance enthusiasts with automobiles and with motorcycles.
Through the cooperation in the area of marketing and sales, we will be able to attract new target groups for both companies all over the world.”
As a 100% subsidiary of Daimler AG, Mercedes-AMG GmbH is the sports-car and performance brand of Mercedes-Benz Cars. The company was founded in 1967 by Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher, and built its reputation on the basis of great success in motorsport and a unique product portfolio. At present, the Affalterbach-based company employs approximately 1,200 people, of whom 700 are active in the area of development engineering. This reflects the company's high technological standards and self-image: Mercedes-AMG automobiles are today renowned worldwide for high performance, perfection and precision, and are the benchmark in many areas. The company's motorsport DNA is tangible in every model, and especially in the two sports cars completely developed in Affalterbach, the SLS and the recently unveiled Mercedes-AMG GT, which will further enhance the profile of the performance brand. In 2013, Mercedes-AMG achieved unit sales of 32,000 cars; by the middle of this year, a total of 23,000 AMG automobiles had been sold.
In the AMG engine factory in Affalterbach, highly qualified engine mechanics build the engines by hand according to the highest quality standards and the principle of “one man, one engine” – as witnessed by the AMG engine plate bearing the signature of the responsible mechanic. This exclusive craftsmanship fits exactly with the MV Agusta philosophy of raising the development and manufacturing of motorcycles to another level:
“motorcycle art.”
MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., headquartered in Varese/Italy, was originally founded in 1945 by Domenico Agusta. The North Italian manufacturer attained international renown for its advanced technology and high performance, which helped to make it one of the most successful brands in the world of motorcycle racing. MV Agusta motorcycles represent dedication to the perfect balance of high performance and breathtaking Italian design. The company currently employs a workforce of approximately 260 employees at its headquarters located on the shore of Lago di Varese in Northern Italy, of whom 90 work in the area of research and development. MV Agusta's product portfolio is based on two main platforms, comprising three- and four-cylinder models ranging from 675 to 1100 cubic centimeters engine displacement and occupying the supersport, superbike, sports-naked and crossover segments. MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. is also the owner of Cagiva, a further renowned Italian historical motorcycle brand.
Through the sales-and-marketing partnership with Mercedes-AMG, the producer of high-performance motorcycles should further accelerate its growth, which has been at a double-digit rate for the past five years. The continuing extension of its motorcycle range will be announced at the forthcoming EICMA international motorcycle fair in Milan. MV Agusta will present new models in the sports-naked segment embodying the maximum expression of design and power – the Brutale 800 RR and the Dragster 800 RR. With the all new Stradale 800 and the all new Turismo Veloce 800 models, MV Agusta will continue its expansion by entering the touring market segment for the first time.
NORTHAMPTON — A Holyoke man who told police he was a football player with the St. Louis Rams during a routine traffic stop in July, now faces a charge of using a false name.
Michael C. Roper, 25, of 95 Beech St., Holyoke, was also arraigned in District Court on Wednesday for drug charges stemming from the July 8 incident.
Roper was a passenger in a car stopped by police for having a rejected inspection sticker. Police questioning led to the discovery of a crack cocaine pipe and a pill bottle containing the prescription drug Clonazepan, according to court documents. Police said Roper told them the drugs belonged to the driver.
Roper also allegedly told police his name was Robert Steeples and that he lived in St. Louis. He was booked under that name. Police later learned, however, that Steeples is an undrafted rookie trying out for the Rams.
In a letter to police, Stephen Miller, the director of security for the Rams, said head coach Jeff Fisher came into his office on July 26 with an envelope containing a police blotter story that Steeples had been arrested. Miller called Northampton police but was unable to obtain a mug shot. He did learn that the man arraigned had a tattoo on his right arm.
Miller then met with Steeples and determined that he had no such tattoo. Steeples suggested to the Rams the defendant in question was his adopted cousin, Roper.
A warrant was issued for Roper, who was arraigned on three counts of possession of cocaine, possession of a Class E substance, giving a false name to police and intimidating a witness, a charge that is sometimes used for misleading police. Roper denied all charges. Judge W. Michael Goggins set bail at $2,000 and continued Roper's case to Sept. 5.
This year's NCAA Championships was amazing. I know what you're thinking: aren't they all? The Fastest Short Course Meet in the World (TM) doesn't often disappoint, and this year was far from that. It seemed that nearly every session had jaw dropping swims, from Morozov's 17.8 to Kevin Cordes' complete revision of what a good 200 breaststroke was (1:48? There were many teams at NCAAs that didn't have an IMer that fast).Still, as I watched, all I could think about was what was coming. It should come as no surprise to readers of this website that there is something of a phenomenon going on in age group swimming at the moment. Swimming is a sport that has seen rapid change in times since it's inception: the sectional qualifiers of today would have been Olympians in another era based on raw time. However, as time has passed it seemed the pace of improvement had slowed. As good as Morozov's 17.8 was, many people on deck noted that it was more surprising that we hadn't seen a 17. split yet with the number of swimmers that gotten to the 18 mid range over the years.
I think we are approaching a point where improvement at the top of events will continue at least at it's current pace but that depth is actually going to improve faster. Not to harp on the 50 freestyle, but I think that needing only a 19.4 to make the A Final in that event will look like the Stone Age very, very soon. When so many 15-17 year old swimmers are going 19 in that event, with one 14 year old almost there, it's not hard to envision that in four years you will need an 18 to make the A final.
I use sprinting as an example but it's not the only one. The NAG record assault we've seen this year is totally unprecedented, and it will leave few events untouched once those swimmers reach college age. When Mike Barrowman won the NCAA Championships in the 200 Breaststroke with a 1:53.7 in 1990, it took over a decade for anyone to beat that time. In this case, I don't see that happening, and not only because Cordes is just a sophomore. Swimmers are going fast enough at 15-17 that they could go sub 1:50 200 breaststrokes in college in the next few years and at least push Cordes.At this point, I feel it's appropriate to address an important question: why is this happening? Why is improvement moving away from a slowing curve? Some attribute recent fast swims to the the suit era and the way it expanded swimmers' notions of what was possible. I think there's something to that explanation, but I don't think it nearly covers it.
At the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, i think we owe this “talent” explosion to the increased proliferation of results and coverage via the internet. As recently as when I was an age grouper (1993-2000), if you were a good young swimmer you dominated local meets and that was it. For the most part, you had to wait until the Top 16 lists were released (far after your season was over) to see how you stacked up.
Now, age groupers are finding out about others in real time, at this website and through their own hounding searches through the ample live results resources. I believe this has compacted the amount of time between a jaw dropping swim and young swimmers adapting to the new reality of what is “fast”. Likewise, coaches are exchanging information in a way they never have before across some of these same platforms. This doesn't even begin to address how much these developments have changed international swimming.
As I left this meet (and NCAA Swimming for a while), I couldn't help but think of two things: how amazing it was and how amazing it will be. Couple that optimistic thought with the fact that University of Cincinnati is bringing back it's scholarships, that's a lot of optimism for college swimming. For the Fastest Short Course Meet in the World, it means we aren't going to be changing that title anytime soon.
Theresa May has been warned by a senior Tory MP that the British public will “go bananas” if she agrees to a Brexit divorce bill of £40billion or more.
Robert Halfon, the former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, said voters would not accept such a payment at a time when public services are clamouring for more funding.
The warning came as it was claimed David Davis fell out with the top official at the Department for Exiting the European Union after the Brexit Secretary's demand to use private RAF planes for trips to the continent was repeatedly blocked.
Oliver Robbins, the UK's most senior Brexit negotiator, was moved from DExEU to report directly to Mrs May in Downing Street earlier this year amid reports of a strained relationship with Mr Davis.
Mr Robbins reportedly refused to sign off on Mr Davis's request to avoid using commercial flights with the Brexit Secretary apparently only getting his way after appealing directly to Number 10.
After the Xiaomi Redmi Pro, the Chinese OEM threw another device our way - the Mi Notebook Air. To be completely honest, the laptop announcement was somewhat expected as well.
It comes in two sizes - 13.3-inch and 12.5-inch. Both feature metal shells, 1080p displays and slim glass-covered bezels. The former actually looks closer to the MacBook Pro series. It is just 14.8mm thick and weighs 1.28kg, while still managing to fit an Intel Core i5-6200U inside, along with 8GB of DDR4 RAM and 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. Xiaomi has even left a free SATA slot for some extra storage, provided that you allow the OEM to install it for you, as the laptop is not user-servicable.
The 13.3-inch model also has a dedicated 1GB NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU. It is not exactly a gamer's dream, but sure is better than relying on integrated graphics alone. The device is powered by a 40W battery pack, which should last up to 9.5 hours and can be quick charged with the bundled USB Type-C charger from zero to 50% in 30 minutes.
And if you tend to put an emphasis on lightness and portability instead of performance, then the 12.5-inch model is probably a better suited option for you. It brings the total weight down to only 1.07kg, which does sadly come at a cost. The processor is bumped down to an Intel Core m3, RAM is set at 4GB and there is a 128GB SATA SSD by default, although Xiomi says even the smaller one has a free PCIe slot, that it can fill with extra storage on request.
The dedicated GPU is gone as well and there is a slight reduction in ports. Instead of 2 USB 3.0 ones, like on the bigger model, you only get one, but the HDMI port is still present. With all that hardware shed, the manufacturer also claims battery life should be around two hours longer.
Probably the best part about the the new Mi Notebook Air models is their price, especially when compared to their obvious Apple counterparts. The 13.3-inch one will set you back CNY 4999 or about $750, while its smaller sibling starts at CNY 3,499 or $520. This is about has as much as the Apple MacBook, but as with all Xiaomi products, it is worth noting that availability is still a big issue and prices tend to go up outside of China. Even sp, the Mi Notebook Air looks like a solid entry in the growing ultralight Windows laptop market, provided you can get your hands on one.

Lance Stephenson's very brief Pelicans career is likely over. Over the weekend, Stephenson—who signed with the Pelicans in the offseason and was averaging 9.7 points, 4.8 assists, and 3.3 rebounds for the team so far this season—found out that he's going to need to undergo surgery to repair a groin injury. As a result, he will be forced to sit out for at least a few weeks to let his groin heal. And because of the injury, the Pelicans have reportedly decided to cut ties with Stephenson so that they can sign former Suns guard Archie Goodwin to take his place.
Thanks everyone that wished me a speedy recovery I'll be back stronger and better. #BORNREADYFOREVER A photo posted by Lance Stephenson (@stephensonlance) on Nov 6, 2016 at 9:46am PST
According to reports, the Pelicans didn't really want to release Stephenson. But because of injuries to two of their other guards Tyreke Evans and Quincy Pondexter—as well as the absence of Jrue Holiday, who has decided to sit out to be with his wife Lauren who was diagnosed with a brain tumor while pregnant with the couple's child earlier this year—New Orleans didn't have much of a choice. They need help in their backcourt, and they're hoping Goodwin can provide it for them.
A huge thanks to the @PelicansNBA organization. Forever grateful. Chapter 4 officially begins. — Archie Goodwin (@A1Laflare10) November 7, 2016
Stephenson hasn't responded to the news about the Pelicans releasing him just yet, but his good friend Matt Barnes chimed in early Monday morning to let everyone know that he's not happy about it. He said that this is just one more example of an NBA team showing a lack of loyalty to a player, and he reminded NBA fans that they should keep these kinds of situations in mind when they see players leave teams in free agency. Here is what Barnes posted on Instagram:
POST CONTINUES BELOW
Barnes raises some interesting points, but it's hard to be too critical of the Pelicans here. They're 0-6 through the first two weeks of the season, and the injury bug has clearly bitten them hard. So they had to make a move, and unfortunately, that left Stephenson without a place on the team at the moment. It could ultimately help Stephenson out in the end, though, assuming he's able to recover from his injury and get back on the court with a different/better team.

First, let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of American mediums as a whole. We'll look at the individual tanks later on.
Manoeuvrability. The Americans have some of the most agile tanks in the game. You have the ability to turn on the spot without moving backwards and forwards, and your traverse rate is extremely high. Also, you lose very little speed when making a turn. These attributes make it very easy to obtain superior positioning with your tanks.

Also, you lose very little speed when making a turn. These attributes make it very easy to obtain superior positioning with your tanks. Gun depression. American tanks have the best gun depression in the game, bar none. This means you can shoot over slopes no other tank would be able to shoot over without exposing their entire hull. Firing with just your turret showing is called "hull down", and if done effectively in combination with peekaboo, makes you extremely difficult to hit, especially by heavy tanks.

Firing with just your turret showing is called "hull down", and if done effectively in combination with peekaboo, makes you extremely difficult to hit, especially by heavy tanks. Rate of fire. The Easy 8 has some wicked rate of fire, but the T20, Pershing and Patton still maintain excellent rates of fire, especially for the amount of the damage their guns do. The Patton does a full 390 damage (same as BL-9 on the IS-3) per shot and still shoots once every seven seconds. Despite what people say, rate of fire and DPS are very important attributes for a medium tank, much more so than for a heavy.

Despite what people say, rate of fire and DPS are very important attributes for a medium tank, much more so than for a heavy. Accuracy on the move. A very good natural accuracy on the move, combined with the ability to fit a vertical stabiliser from tier 6 where other tanks can only fit them from tier 8, means that American mediums can fire while moving at full speed with good accuracy. This is especially important when trying to circle a heavy, playing peekaboo, or trying to deal some damage while moving from cover to cover.

American mediums, especially the Patton, have some of the longest view ranges in the game. This makes you an excellent scout for artillery.
American mediums, especially the Patton, have some of the longest view ranges in the game. This makes you an excellent scout for artillery. Speed and acceleration. I've mentioned this last because I feel as though American mediums don't really have any speed advantage over the other medium tanks. Their top speeds are often capped at around 45-50 km/h whereas German and Russian tanks can do almost 60. However, acceleration is very good, and the speed cap is often an advantage because it keeps the reticle smaller when you're moving. Overall, speed and acceleration are an advantage for you.
Hull armour! American mediums have terrible hull armour for the most part. Pretty much anything above perhaps two tiers below you can penetrate you easily. This means you have to adapt your gameplay to make sure they don't get a chance to shoot at your hull. Obviously there are some exceptions to this (Jumbo), but this guide will focus on the main medium line for the most part.
Turret armour You can actually bounce shots here! The Patton can sometimes bounce tier 9 or 10 shots, depending on where it gets hit. The Pershing has some sort of magical mantlet that allows it to absorb ridiculous hits.
You can actually bounce shots here! The Patton can sometimes bounce tier 9 or 10 shots, depending on where it gets hit. The Pershing has some sort of magical mantlet that allows it to absorb ridiculous hits. Module damage and fire. It's not too bad. I haven't experienced any more module damage or fires on American mediums than I would on any other tank. By that, I mean you won't get set on fire from the front like in German tanks, and you won't get your driver knocked out all the time like on Russian tanks.
Okay, so now I know the strengths and weaknesses of my tank - how do I play it?
Give me an example?
Conclusion
Do not engage a heavier target head on.
Use your speed and agility to flank.
Use your viewing range to scout.
Use your gun depression to not get hit.

The Singaporean national computer response team, SingCERT, made it known yesterday that some of the home routers that had been provisioned by ISPs in the country could be easily compromised in many cases.
This information came from research that was published by the security firm Vantage Point. They published their findings that these devices could be easily compromised and in some cases could be made to provide a remote shell. Nothing good about that. To their credit the company refused to release the details of the vulnerabilities but, it seems based on the apparent trivial nature of the compromise that these devices will fall prey to less upstanding denizens of the Internet.
The affected systems are listed in the SingCERT advisory:
Products with vulnerabilities Zhone zNID GPON 24xx, 24xxA, 42xx, 42xxA, 26xx and 28xx series (CVE-2014-8356, CVE-2014-8357, CVE-2014-9118)
Asus WL-330NUL Insecure Configuration Aztech FG7008GR(AC)
The listed mitigation steps give me pause. They suggest disabling remote access such as web, ssh and telnet. As well changing the default router passwords. Wait, what? Default passwords? Why does this sticky wicket continually bedevil us? It strikes me that there was no attempt to apply even basic security configuration to these devices before they were sent to their customers.
Here is some information gleaned from the Vantage Point write up.
During this research we have developed several proof-of-concept exploits. Given the vulnerabilities found so far, we found thousands of ViewQwest users to be particularly vulnerable – they use the ZHONE GPON router with a statically assigned IP address with all default services exposed on the Internet. Using the vulnerabilities above, it is possible to compromise routers of ViewQwest subscribers at will. An attacker can not only read out the subscriber's name and residential address via the web interface, but also run arbitrary code on the subscriber's router, e.g. to install malware on the user's client systems or read and manipulate the user's network traffic.
Troubling that these devices were not secured. In addition to the problems that can arise for the customers from negative actors compromising these devices are larger issues. These devices, if compromised, could potentially be put to a more devious purpose as conscripts in a botnet.
There are many botnets for hire that are more commonly referred to as “stressers”. These services can be hired in by individuals for a sum of money, usually paid via bitcoin, and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks other parties. Whether these are competitors or simply some pimply faced kid who beat another at Destiny or Call of Duty remains to be seen.
The problem here is that if a customer that has one of these affected devices is unwittingly made to be a part of one of these botnets that they could suffer consequences of ill formed attribution.
The long and the short of it is that customers of ISPs in Singapore should take steps to secure their routers and contact their ISPs for more information on how best to protect themselves from possible attack.

The Federal Trade Commission plans to begin a study of the U.S. sales and marketing of electronic cigarettes, more commonly known as e-cigarettes. To conduct the study, the agency would issue information requests to e-cigarette marketers and would use the information as a basis for a report on the sales, marketing activities, and expenditures in this new and complex industry.
Since the mid-2000s, the sale of battery-powered e-cigarettes has grown rapidly in the United States. Rather than burning tobacco, e-cigarettes heat liquid containing flavorings and chemicals (usually including nicotine) to produce an aerosol that the user inhales. E-cigarettes are sold both online and in conventional brick-and-mortar stores, are available in both disposable and refillable models, and come in a range of different flavors and nicotine levels.
The FTC is seeking clearance from the Office of Management and Budget to collect information from the e-cigarette marketers, which is the first step toward conducting the study. It will publish a Federal Register notice seeking public comment on the proposed collection of information from approximately five large and ten smaller e-cigarette marketers. The topics the FTC seeks comment on include:
The need for the study and the practical utility of the information collected; the accuracy of the Commission's burden estimates; and ways to enhance the quality and utility of the information collected and to minimize the burden of that collection;
Whether the FTC should seek to collect data according to: 1) the various types of products sold and given away by industry members; 2) the various flavors and nicotine strengths of those sales and giveaways; 3) the various sizes and liquid capacities of disposable e-cigarettes, cartridges, and e-liquids sold and given away; and 4) whether the company sells directly to consumers or to wholesalers and distributors;
Whether industry members can provide data that distinguishes between, among other things: 1) direct sales to consumers (e.g., online sales) and sales to retailers and distributors; 2) sales and giveaways of disposable e-cigarettes and sales and giveaways of refillable e-cigarettes; and 3) the various combinations of sizes, flavors, and nicotine contents of their e-cigarettes and refill cartridges and e-liquids; and
Whether the FTC should seek data on state-by-state sales of e-cigarettes and related products.
Public comments will be accepted until 60 days after the notice is published in the Federal Register. Information about how to submit a paper comment can be found in the “Supplemental Information” section of the notice. Comments can also be filed electronically.
The Commission vote approving publication of the Federal Register notice was 4-0. It will be published in the Federal Register soon, and is available now on the FTC's website as a link to this press release.
The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit the FTC's online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357).

When Hyundai unveiled the 2011 Hyundai Veloster hatchback at the 2011 Detroit Auto Show earlier this year, it was confirmed that the Korean automakers will indeed offer a turbocharged version to take on the hot-hatch segment. However, Hyundai did not provide any details as to which engine will power the hot Veloster.
While many of you really wanted to see the 274-hp 2.0L turbocharged from the Sonata 2.0T make it into the Veloster, reports suggest that Hyundai will be fitting its new 1.6L T-GDI turbo engine in the turbo version of the hatchback.
The 1.6L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine produces 208-hp at 6,000 rpm and maximum torque of 195 lb-ft of torque available from 1,600 rpm to 5,000 rpm.
Click here for more news on the Hyundai Veloster.
Refresher: The 2012 Hyundai Veloster is powered by an all-new 1.6L GDI Gamma direct-injection gasoline engine making 138-hp and 123 lb-ft of torque. It can be mated to either a 6-speed manual, or Hyundai's all new dual-clutch 6-speed automatic. Fuel-economy wise, the 2012 Veloster is expected to get up to 40 mpg. Sales start later this year.

The polls have not been kind to President Trump, whose approval rating has declined since he took office despite his boasts that everything is great. To get behind the numbers and understand why some voters are losing faith in Trump, veteran Democratic pollster Peter Hart, under the auspices of Emory University, assembled a focus group in Pittsburgh Tuesday evening with half Donald Trump voters, half Hillary Clinton voters to explore attitudes about immigration and Trump's cherished border wall with Mexico, along with their thoughts on how Trump conducts himself as a leader.
Asked to compare Trump to a shiny new car that they were all excited about 200 days ago and are now discovering isn't running very well, one woman said it was like being promised a Cadillac Escalade that turned out to be a pickup truck with a gun rack on the back. “Unsafe at any speed,” said one man, hearkening back to Ralph Nader. “Dentally ill,” quipped another man, playing off the theoretical car's dents to take a slap at Trump's mental state. “I don't want to say he's fatally flawed, but it's not running the way it should.”
What was amazing is that these slurs against Trump did not incite a riot in the room. That's because they came in equal measure from the Trump voters, who were college educated and drawn to Trump because he's a businessman and he wasn't Hillary, and Clinton voters. Only David, a high school graduate who works in construction, rated Trump “great.” He said he did so because business is good. When pressed he said, “His learning curve has not been impressive.”
These Trump voters are disappointed. It's less about policy than Trump's personal behavior in leveling personal attacks on people, and his prolific tweeting. One woman, Christina, who is in her forties and works as an administrative assistant for a pharmaceutical company, said, “We knew he was a nut—everyone knew he was a nut.” But she figured that once he was elected, he could at least become “professional” in his conduct, her word for the widespread expectation that once he was president, Trump would ipso facto be presidential.
“What's taken my breath away,” declared Hart, who had anticipated fireworks between the Trump and Clinton factions, “I'm looking at a half dozen of you, and I haven't heard any defense of Donald Trump. Why aren't you with him... What are you trying to tell him?”
Tony, who works in the insurance industry and is between 50 and 64, explained, “I'm not part of his base. It was an anti-Hillary vote... but it wasn't eeny, meny, miny, moe. I leaned a lot to Trump.”
These Trump voters in Pittsburgh are urban and suburban, and not part of the rural base that forms Trump's core support. Their votes helped put Trump over the top in Pennsylvania. Brian, a sales rep in his forties, said, “I didn't want more of what we had. It [Trump vote] was lesser of two evils.”
Hart pressed for answers. Why doesn't he have you after the first 200 days? A president is someone who is “calm, focused,” replied a Trump voter. “He's let me down.”
Hart asked everyone to state how long their family has been in the country, and most were long-termers, with one's family going back to the last signer of the Declaration of Independence. There were no hardliners on immigration, and Christina, the only female Trump voter, said she imagines a “proverbial wall,” with tightened rules and regulation, “not a literal wall.”
With Trump deciding soon whether to deport the Dreamers, children brought here illegally whom President Obama exempted from deportation, Christina said, “I wouldn't want to see any national guard taking thousands of people away from their loved ones, that's absurd. The military is not going to come in and pull people from their homes, not going to happen.”
When it was pointed out that Pittsburgh is a “sanctuary city,” and Trump has vowed to pull back federal resources, one man pointed out, “Half the Eastern European waitresses you get at Market Square are illegal.” Another respondent doubted Trump had the power to cut funds to Pittsburgh, calling it “another one of Trump's oopsies.”
Asked how they would fix America's immigration problem, one man said, “Find a way to make undocumented workers become documented workers and pay taxes.”
Trump's pardon of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio did not raise major hackles. A male Trump voter said he doesn't like the guy, but he operates in a very dangerous area, and we need to “parse” between immigration and illegal immigration, “which isn't immigration, it's lawbreaking.” A Clinton voter immediately countered with, “When they're here already raising their children and working, to deport them is a crime all its own.” Both statements had support in the room.
The issue of Russia and Putin never came up, and Hart did not raise it. In a series of round robins on what they knew about certain officials, the responses were revealing. Vice President Pence: “non-existent, puppet, waiting in the wings”; chief of staff John Kelly, “strong, reliable, finger in dyke”; Speaker Paul Ryan: “floats in the wind, opportunist.”
At the mention of special counsel Robert Mueller's name, except for one audible, “Hurry up,” others passed, saying they didn't know who he was, or didn't know enough to comment.
Over the two hours of the focus group, no one really defended Trump, but his voters haven't totally given up on him. Christina had watched Trump on television in Texas earlier that day, and she expressed hope “that should give him some sort of humanization,” seeing people come together and that he would “take advice from that perspective.”
No one said they regretted their vote. “He is our president until and if he gets impeached,” said Tony. “I wouldn't change my vote.”
After the session, Hart made several points, among them that Trump had the perfect foil in Hillary Clinton, someone voters had problems with “looking down on people, instead of looking out for people.” Hart said he was struck by how personally upset and disappointed the Trump voters were with what Trump said he would have the easiest time doing—acting presidential. “What they couldn't get past is his personal behavior.”
With these voters, it's not policy, it's personal. “How they see this president is more than his positions,” says Hart. “It's how he is representing us as a leader, as the father of the country.”
Unlike presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, who conveyed the importance of the office with their behavior, Trump has made his presidency all about him, says Hart.
What Democrats should take away from this group of people is that the next election is less about party and more about Trump. He's his own worst enemy, but that is not a construct that Democrats or Republicans for that matter can count on. He's tied his fortunes for the moment to Harvey and the politics that follow around recovery and redemption. He's a businessman, he's drawn to rebuilding. That focus could yet save him, although “focus” hasn't been a strength so far.
Kyoto cops: Man traps woman in car, licks her foot for 30 minutes
KYOTO (TR) – Kyoto Prefectural Police arrested a man on Monday for allegedly trapping a woman in his car and licking her foot, a case that could be tied to five similar incidents where the suspect was known among officers as the “foot licker man.”
The 56-year-old suspect is charged with indecent assault for allegedly asking a woman in her 20s passing by a parking lot to “help me fix my car's brakes” in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto, at around midnight on July 23 before making her sit in the driver's seat as he forced off her right sandal to lick her foot for some 30 minutes, the Asahi Shimbun reports (Nov. 7).
Police said the suspect, who is denying the charges claiming he “doesn't remember this at all,” also put his teeth on her heel.
The suspect thanked and freed the woman, who told police she “couldn't run away because he was holding down my ankle, plus I was barefoot because he forced off my sandal.”
Police said the latest case could be linked to five other similar incidents reported mainly in Fushimi Ward since, where women around their 20s recounted similar assaults when they were out late at night or early morning. Officers investigating these cases nicknamed the suspect the “foot licker man.”
Microsoft laid off "hundreds" of employees late last week, in what is expected to be the last wave of the 18,000 planned job cuts officials announced last year.
The Seattle Times reported on the latest round of layoffs on April 4. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed those cut were notified on Thursday, April 2, with most of those cut being part of Microsoft's IT group.
The Times quoted an e-mail from Microsoft chief information officer Jim DuBois, who said the IT cuts were designed to "remove role overlap, optimize activities and functions, align disciplines with the rest of Microsoft, and, perhaps most importantly, reshape IT for the skills we need to transform."
Microsoft officials announced last July that the company planned to cut 18,000 jobs, the largest layoff in Microsoft's history.The layoffs occurred over several rounds -- July, September and October.
"We expect this to be the last of the anticipated broad cuts as part of the restructuring plan announced last July," a Microsoft spokesperson told me on April 5, via e-mail.
Earlier rounds focused on those who joined Microsoft as part of the Nokia handset and services acquisition. Other teams hit by various layoff rounds included Microsoft's Operating Systems Group, Microsoft Research, Xbox, MSN and other engineering and marketing positions.
Microsoft officials said 12,500 of the 18,000 employees who were cut came from those who joined the company as part of the Nokia acquisition.
The new Gears gang looks good in the armor and knows how to cut an enemy with a chainsaw gun.
It's been awhile since Gears of War has felt absolutely vital. Five years, if you want to be a little more exact about it. The release of Gears of War 3 was the high-water mark for the series up to that point, both narratively as it closed off most of the loose ends you wanted to see wrapped up by the end of the trilogy and technically. Gears 3 was a great-looking Xbox 360 game that built up some terrific gameplay additions when compared to the earlier games in the franchise.
Since then, the series lost its way a bit. Epic seemed to drift away from game development, with its then-owned studio, People Can Fly, handling a Gears side story that filled in story gaps that didn't need filling and offering up gameplay twists that were occasionally interesting but usually superfluous. Not long after that, Microsoft realized the value of the Gears franchise and brought it in-house, converting one of its studios into a Gears-dedicated studio along the way. That team got its feet wet with a technically competent remake of the first Gears of War that really just made it obvious how much the series had improved over the course of that initial trilogy. Going back to Gears 1 just made me want to see a full, new Gears of War game.
Gears of War 4 is The Coalition's first full, new Gears of War game. And it feels like a good mix of old and new, capturing the characters and gameplay moments that made the series feel so impactful in the first place while advancing a new set of characters, a new, well-justified story, and the sort of multiplayer options you'd expect to see. It might not reinvent the gear, but it goes a long way to making the franchise feel alive in a way it hasn't since 2011. If nothing else, it's left me wanting to see more from the franchise and the team behind it.
Weather effects and stabbing both play a meaningful role in Gears 4.
Gears of War 4 is set years after the events of 3, where Marcus Fenix sat down, took his do-rag off, and made you think that the Locust threat was more or less over. Gears 4 puts you in the boots of Marcus' son, JD Fenix. It seems that the situation has changed since we last checked in on this universe, as the younger Fenix and his colleague Del have abandoned their post, left the Gears, and taken up with some "outsiders." The COG may have successfully fought off the Locust, but in the years that followed they seem to have become quite the oppressors themselves, with robots known as DBs doing most of the heavy lifting as they attempt to rebuild the planet and repopulate the race. It's politically muddy in ways that the previous trilogy would occasional hint at, but now you're seeing the effects of that trilogy spun out, 25 years later. It's a good swap that makes the good guys the bad guys, as the game opens with your crew of outsiders raiding a COG construction site.
The game doesn't spend much time actually exploring this new flip, though, as a new/old threat of creatures that come to be known as "the Swarm" rear their ugly head around halfway through the game. While the airdrops of robot troops made the game's opening chapters feel at least a little different, the Swarm come off as the Locust troops of the previous games but with somewhat better AI. They'll flank you, they'll hop over your cover to knock you back, but they'll also just post up behind something and take mindless shots in your direction. And they'll occasionally emerge from nests that look suspiciously like the Locust emergence holes. So the bulk of the game, then, just feels like more Gears of War with some new unspeakable creatures thrown in along the way, including a "snatcher" who sucks up downed players and traps them inside the creature's stomach until other players put enough rounds into the enemy, forcing it to puke the player back up. There's some neat stuff in there, but I was definitely left wishing that the campaign didn't cruise back into its comfort zone quite so quickly.
It also must be said that the game is really leaning into its status as the first step in a new Gears of War saga, sometimes at the expense of its own story. The world is interesting and I like its cast of characters, both new and old. Cool things happen along the way that enrich the Gears of War universe. But Gears of War 4 is mostly setup with very little in the way of resolution. The ending moments feel like they're missing an encounter or two.
You can play the campaign cooperatively with another person, or you can dive right into the game's multiplayer modes. The competitive multiplayer brings new weapons into the conflict, but that doesn't mean that it isn't still a map full of bulky, shotgun-toting fighters who love to roll up behind you and splatter you into a mess before you know what's happening. This is the fifth Gears of War game, and by this point you probably already know if you're into that sort of thing or not. I used to be, but as the competitive community developed and got better and sneaking up behind you and shotgunning you down, I fell out of love with this mode in the game. On one hand, it's a shame that this facet of the game isn't more inviting to new players. On the other... well... it's the fifth Gears of War game, and by this point you probably already know if you're into that sort of thing or not.
Some of the new enemies just look straight-up disgusting, but most of them blow up when they die. Fair trade.
Even as someone who isn't likely to spend any more time with the competitive side of the game, Gears of War 4 still feels like it has a lot to offer. Horde mode returns as the wave-based survival mode that up to five players can play. It uses a class-based system this time out with equippable bonuses and starting weapons that correspond to each class. Soldiers are your everyman Gears of War character, while Heavy players get bonuses to explosive damage. Engineers start with the repair tool for making sure your defenses are in working condition. Scouts collect more power out in the field, which is used to purchases new fortifications. And each class can equip a set of bounties and bonus cards.
Yes, Gears of War 4 is the latest in an increasingly long line of games to bring a card metaphor into the action. Here you'll open blind boxes (which you can grind out for a far-too-high price or spend actual money on) and get new characters, weapon skins, versus bonuses, Horde skills, and bounties. The skills are things like a card that gives you 20% damage bonus whenever you active reload in Horde mode. Bounties are things like "earn 20,000XP when you build 50 fortifications." And so on. Skill cards can be combined to increase their bonus potential and you'll earn the ability to equip multiple cards as you level up. It's a neat system that doesn't dig too deep into the single-use item side of microtransactions, but ultimately the rate at which you earn in-game currency seems way too low, making the game feel too biased in favor of real-money transactions. It's not enough to ruin the core of the Horde experience--which is one of the best wave-based survival modes in the business--but it's still a bummer.
Gears of War 4 is a great-looking game both on the PC and Xbox One, though with its higher frame rate potential and better resolution options, the PC version is the way to go, if you're able. The only real catch is that PC and Xbox One players can't mingle in the public, competitive side of the game. So if you're going in looking to play with friends against other humans, you'll all need to commit to the same version of the game to stick together. Horde mode and co-op don't enforce that same limitation, though it's easy to see why you'd want to keep the higher-fidelity mouse-and-keyboard crowd away from the controller users in competitive matches.
My time with Gears of War 4 left me with a feeling that the game could have been a little more ambitious in spots. It feels a little too safe and too unwilling to ditch some of the traditions of the initial trilogy. But the ways it plays around with and reintroduces the characters from those Gears of War games is expertly handled, making for some great moments along the way. It might not stick the landing, but Gears of War 4 puts the franchise back on the map in a big way, and large parts of it are a great time.
The question of why m/m slash holds such a predominating and prolific place in fandom relative to f/f slash is one that has been circulating in fandom for decades, and understandably so. The disparity is quite significant, and although the gap has been decreasing a bit in recent years, “dudeslash” definitely still reigns supreme in fandom OTP rankings. So really, what gives?
This article is a tentative effort to lay out, and think through some of the potential reasons why this gap persists with such fervor. My aim is most definitely not to come to a single unilateral explanation because I do not believe there is one. Rather I am going to suggest that the femslash gap is a product of many overlapping, interlocking forces, some of them likely related to questionable fandom biases (internalized misogyny, queer female phobia), but many of them also likely about subverting and excising patriarchal cultural constructions of gender and of sexuality.
Therefore, think of this as rather as a substantive “brainstorm,” a list of possibilities and suggestions which is certainly not exhaustive, and which probably all deserve to be examined in greater individual depth than is viable in this article alone. Two more caveats before the main event. First, understand that I must speak here about trends in very broad strokes terms, with full awareness that there are always exceptions, and that not all points will be applicable to every single slash fan in every single circumstance. Some of my points, for instance, address the issue of bodily sexual arousal and fantasy related specifically to anatomy; while it would certainly be incorrect to assume all women have the same anatomy, or that all fans are cisgender, or identify as women, cis women do make up by far the largest chunk of slash fans, and this is a significant factor in understanding slash fandom trends in aggregate.
Second addendum, highly related to the first, is that while I understand slash is not remotely reducible to the pornographic or the explicitly sexual – who doesn't love a good fluff fest every now and then? – this essay operates on the premise that explicit sexual fantasy is often a highly relevant factor in which characters get slashed by whom. For most slash fans, explicit erotics are a primary (if not singular) force guiding a fair amount of their fandom practices and proclivities, and this is treated as axiomatic in much of what follows.
Finally, a warning. This rest of this article will address certain sexual topics explicitly. It is not G-rated going forward.
Working Theories on the Femslash Gap
Not as many interesting, multifaceted female characters, and fewer substantial female/female relationships to draw from in pop-culture. Fanworks are by definition derivative works, and fans are somewhat limited by the offerings of mainstream culture. Granted, fans sometimes create huge, substantial fanworks and communities around very minor characters and pairings with very little canon to work from (*cough*ClintCoulson*cough*) Therefore this cannot be a singularly definitive explanation. Nevertheless, most of the ‘top-tier' dudeslash pairings are about main characters who typically have a lot of canon text underlying them. So women's continuing marginalization in mainstream media probably remains a factor here.
Audience bias against female characters/internalized misogyny. While mainstream media sometimes is to blame for creating less substantial, interesting, well-rounded, sympathetic, multifaceted female characters, fans and audiences are also sometimes to blame for being too hard on female characters. Although most slash fans are women, women in patriarchal societies can still have internalized misogyny, and we are often less forgiving of female characters and much more likely to dismiss them as “boring,” “annoying,” “bitches,” pick your epithet as preferred. There does seem to be a general fandom and audience propensity to be more sympathetic to male characters, give them more leeway, accord more nuance to their motivations and perspectives, and just generally treat them as deeper and more interesting (especially if they are white).
Of course, it is often hard to know in any given circumstance whether a female character really is written as less deep/interesting/complex (option 1) or whether audiences are simply treating her that way (option 2). I would wager it is six to five and pick ‘em on any given day, and there's nothing that says both cannot be true to some degree at the same time, either.
Women being more predisposed to identify with male characters. While second-wave feminism unilaterally derided being “male-identified,” this is probably a more complicated dynamic than simple internalized misogyny. First, texts typically invite everyone to identify most heavily with the protagonist(s) of the story, and male characters still make up the majority of protagonists in our pop culture. Second, in cases where female characters really are less well-written, it arguably is a sign of self-worth for women to identify more with the substantial male character over the one-dimensional, cardboard cut-out female ones. While always disidentifying with female characters might be a sign of internalized misogyny, it might also be a recognition that a lot of female characters (as currently written) do not do justice to the complexity of real women, and well-written male characters actually make for better reflections of our full humanity than badly written female ones.
Women-as-love-interest fatigue. Pop-culture narratives about women are far more likely to make romance a foundational premise – rom-coms, soap operas, chicklit – and women in stories about men are often put there primarily to be wives, girlfriends, one-night stands, unattainable crushes, etc. Woman-as-love-interest is currently one of the most exhausted gender norms in mainstream culture, and femslash debatably doubles down on that trend. Granted, women are not typically playing love interests to other women, so there is some novelty to femslash relative to your standard Bond-girl or manic pixie scenario. But still, I can see why many women might have an all-around love-interest fatigue when it comes to female characters that would make them want to avoid it in their fanworks.
Femslash still has the whiff of the male-gaze hovering over it, unfortunately. Stipulated, femslash is not the equivalent of male-oriented ‘lesbian' porn, not even close. Femslash often accords its female protagonists a great deal of inner depth, and is often about exploring feelings of intense love between women, and not just purely sexual exchange. However, even when that is the case, it still falls much more easily in line with a hetero-male fantasy scenario than does m/m slash. No matter how much depth and nuance and broad-ranging emotional gravitas femslash protagonists are given, they can still be much more easily appropriated by straight men, and that prospect can sour the experience for a lot of female fans (be they queer women or straight). “Conceal don't feel” is more of a cultural norm for men/male characters. Fanfiction and fanworks are often about exploring the inner-lives of characters and particularly their potentially concealed feelings, thoughts and desires. Men and male characters arguably make for better targets of this because, in accordance with certain gender norms, they are more often written with a propensity to hide or deny their emotions. See Eric Kripke's famous comment about loving to write about straight men because they are never honest about their feelings. Repression and denial of feelings is more commonly depicted through male characters, and audiences are more likely to suspect male characters of concealing their emotions, both of which makes exploring their inner thoughts and feelings more compelling from a fan stand-point. (Also note the female character who sang that famous line is part of a very popular femslash pairing herself)
Fanfiction (and writing more generally) is an act of control. Yes, fans often make fanworks about characters because we like them; affection sometimes bordering on all-out worship can be an aspect of why we choose to appropriate certain characters in our fan doings. But writing, and fan-production more broadly, are also undeniably about exercising power over characters as well. Arguably it makes sense why women in a patriarchal society would display more desire to control male characters than female ones, and why they might garner more satisfaction in dictating what male characters do and think and feel. Yes, the preference for dudeslash might be indicative of the fact that women are trained to like men and male characters more than other women. But it could just as easily be about the fact that women get more satisfaction out of controlling men/male characters because it is a complete inversion of the power dynamic under which they live normally. Many women feel less bound by ‘reality' when representing (cis) male bodies. Fanfic often creates sexualized renderings of cis male bodies that are quite dramatic and almost otherworldly in their experiences of things like arousal, sexual intercourse, orgasm, etc. Large amounts of cis women perhaps find it more appealing to write about sexual bodily experiences that are ‘foreign' to their own because unfamiliar bodies can often sustain a great deal more sexual hyperbole and suspension of disbelief. Because I don't know what an erection, or prostate stimulation feels like, my mind can inflate and dramatize the experience with a lot less reservation. Women writing about cis female bodies probably feel a lot more constrained by “realism,” in other words. Exploration of cis male bodies enables a lot more freedom to imagine and hyperbolize sexual experiences for the sake of fantasy. (This dynamic might also be relevant to understanding A/B/O dynamics, and the sexual fetishization of non-human anatomy in many fics and pairings)
Wanting the inaccessible/novel experience. In addition to the above, it is also possible that female fans are simply looking to experience in fanfic what they cannot experience in real life. People approach fiction in a multiplicity of ways, sometimes via things like identification and representation – wanting to see our world and experiences reflected in media. But fiction is also often a site of exploration for experiences we can't have in real life or would not want to have in real life, but which we enjoy fantasizing about from a ‘safe-distance' (e.g. disaster movies). It is possible many cis women enjoy dudeslash as a vicarious kind of sexual experience that is totally inaccessible to them in the real world, unlike femslash. Exploration of sex through fiction can be about exploring experiences that are simply unattainable to us in reality, thus men are a much heavier site of exploration for women, not because men are better or superior, but because they are simply Other. There's a difference between who is a text is ‘about' and who a text is about. Although it is worth examining who we include and exclude from our cultural productions (fan-made and otherwise), it is equally important to remember that just because a text depicts a group of people, that text still is not necessarily about that group of people. No one thinks because Hustler magazine is full to the brim with depictions of naked women that it is about women. Clearly it is about the presumed straight male reader, even when male bodies are totally absent from the textual content. Just because dudeslash is ‘about' men that does not always mean it is about men. Texts can completely exclude a group of people, while also being entirely about them as audience members.
Wanting what is harder to get. Granted there are not enough queer love stories or characters in popular culture full stop. But even with femslash being far less popular relative to dudeslash, femslash pairings are still WAY more likely to go canon than are dudeslash pairings. Xena/Gabrielle. Korra/Asami. Root/Shaw. Brittany/Santana. Mulan/Aurora. And female characters are also far more likely to be written as queer later on in a story, without having been introduced as such at the outset. Willow Rosenberg. Clarke Griffin. Annalise Keating. Callie Torres. Alana Bloom. Marissa Cooper. Tara Thornton. The list goes on. My thesis here is not necessarily that queer women unilaterally have it “better” than queer men, but that female characters are demonstrably far more likely to (narratively) transition to being queer, than are male characters, even with the far greater fandom advocacy that exists for male characters and pairings. As such, there may be an element of simply wanting what remains most withheld.
Again, I concede that this brainstorm is likely incomplete, so please, feel free to use the comments section to add to it as you see fit. This issue is multifaceted and immensely complicated and I doubt it could be fully encapsulated in the likes of a PhD thesis, much less an online editorial.
Nancy Hartsock once suggested that feminism is “a method of approaching politics, a way of asking questions and searching for answers, rather than a set of political conclusions about the oppression of women.” I often return to this quote when I think about the question of dudeslash versus femslash and how we ought to understand gender disparities in various fandom practices. None of this is simple, or easily understood, and although the patriarchy is operational in all domains of public life, the preference for dudeslash cannot simply be reduced to the power of The Patriarchy™ given how intensely rebuked and reviled it is often is by hetero-men and mainstream culture.
We should ask questions about fandom biases of all kinds, and we should try to understand how things like sexism, misogyny, racism, certain brands of homophobia and biphobia, and ableism manifest in our subculture. We have an obligation to ask such question and to seriously consider all possible explanations. The femslash gap needs further discussion and address, unequivocally. But in pursuing this aim, I would argue it is particularly imperative to approach the question with every ounce of nuance and complexity of which we are capable, and to avidly resist the impulse to fall back on reductive, pat answers like it's just internalized misogyny, or most women in fandom are straight and primarily attracted to men. To do that is to fail to engage with the current (and longtime) messiness of both fandom, and gendered reality. Which it to say, it is to not take the question seriously.

We live very close to a working fishing pier and I walk there every day with our two dogs. There is always something going on there: a seal playing in the tiny harbour, the herons making their way from the tall trees to land on the seaweed covered rocks, or a swan gliding into view.
GONE FISHING
I also see the lot of small boats coming and going. A lot of the locals use small boats go out into the bay to catch fish and I have often been lucky enough to be given some fresh mackerel by my generous neighbours.
WILD ATLANTIC WAY
The downside is that we tend to suffer some terrible storms here in this part of Galway – we are on the Wild Atlantic Way and because of that very many small boats end up smashed against the pier.
These boats tend to be left around the pier and when ever I see them I always wonder about the people who sailed in them, the sea beneath them and the creatures that swam alongside or underneath.
A NATURALLY RAISED BED
I admire the sense of history and life attached to these boats and because of this have always wanted a boat in my garden. I felt that not only would it be an attractive feature to have in a garden so near the sea but I also thought that a boat would also make an ideal and very natural raised bed. As well as being a great way to upcycle something that would otherwise be left to rot.
When I saw this sorry looking boat dumped near the pier I hummed and hawed for a while before deciding to just go for it and ask the owner if I could have it.
ASK AND THOU SHALT RECEIVE
As it happened the owner was only too glad to get rid of it and all I had to do then was ask a local farmer to bring it up for me on his tractor and this he kindly did.
I decided to paint it and try and restore at least a little bit of its former glory. I didn't repair the storm damage, as I hope eventually to have flowers pouring out of the holes and that way turning its defects into its features.
After painting it I filled it with some rotting logs, newspapers, hen manure, cardboard, seaweed, and a top layer of soil. Before planting it I left it for a few weeks so that my ingredients could decompose.
FLOWER NURSERY
I decided that I would use the boat as a flower nursery this year and to that end I added tons of flower seeds. Some were the remnants of wild flower seed boxes, some seeds had been saved and given to me by friends and others were seeds I saved myself.
Many of the seeds were old and well past their sell by date but I decided it didn't matter because when it comes to the boat – what will be.
As it turned out the boat turned out to be one of my most productive flower beds. Everything I planted grew, even some poppy seeds that had failed elsewhere and I had thought were duds.
Maybe I got the mix right for the boat, or maybe the wood retained some of the sea's nourishment – I'll never know but whatever it was I am happy to say the boat is one of my favourite flower beds this year.
P.S. I think this old boat deserves a name other than it's current one: ‘old boat.' If you can think of a name you think is worthy please do let me know in the comments box.

Being used to aid educators across a range of subjects
The University of Sydney has launched an ‘Immersive Learning Laboratory' containing what it claims to be the largest number of virtual reality devices in an Australian education institution.
The lab, which is housed within the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, is home to 26 Oculus Rift headsets and a new suite of high-powered PCs to support their use.
“Virtual reality technology has revolutionised education opportunities by allowing students to experience and interact with new and diverse environments. For example, many environments in which professional engineers and scientists work are restricted to students, due to safety and logistical constraints,” explained the lab's project team lead and lecturer in Humanitarian Engineering Dr Jacqueline Thomas.
“We can even transcend the human scale, giving students the opportunity to go to the nanoscale to travel through materials and look at particle arrangements, or to very large scales to hop between galaxies in space. Rather than ‘tell' the students what it is like to work in a particular field, we can use this technology to ‘show' them and let them experience it for themselves.”
This semester, 12 academics from the University's faculties of Engineering and Information Technologies, Science, Arts and Social Sciences, and the Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning are using the lab for teaching.
More than 700 hundred students are expected to experience virtual reality in the lab over this semester. Current immersive experiences on offer include 360-degree video of village life in Niger to help students can to apply engineering skills to humanitarian problems; 3D models of reefs in the Great Barrier Reef for marine biology classes, and a real-time simulation of the night sky being used by astronomy students.
Delivering experiences
A number of Australian universities are taking advantage of virtual reality as tool for education.
In May, the University of Newcastle announced that its School of Nursing & Midwifery would be using Samsung GearVR and HTC Vive headsets to run a simulation of a delivery room, presenting midwifery students with an emergency neonatal resuscitation scene.
“New graduates may find transitioning from performing a neonatal resuscitation in an educational setting to a real-world emergency room an overwhelming shift, which is exactly why we designed the program to bridge that gap,” said Midwifery lecturer and project leader, Jessica Williams at the time.
Virtual reality based training programs have been delivered at UNSW's School of Mining Engineering for almost 10 years, giving students an immersive experience of what it's like to work underground.
CLOSE A USA TODAY Network investigation found a predatory scheme that ensnared thousands of immigrant truck drivers at the port. Scott Hall

A group of high-profile Democratic Senators, led by Sherrod Brown of Ohio, wrote letters to the nation's top retail CEOs Monday, demanding they crack down on trucking companies that turned their workers into modern-day indentured servants.
The call to action comes in response to a yearlong USA TODAY Network investigation that found port trucking companies in California forced their drivers into debt, pressured them to work up to 20 hours a day and paid them pennies per hour.
“As a major U.S. corporation,” the senators wrote, “you also have a role to play in ensuring that you are not complicit in the mistreatment of port truck drivers and that American consumers, your customers, are not unwittingly supporting labor abuses in the United States.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sens Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris of California joined Brown in sending the letter to 16 retail brands, including Target, Wal-Mart and Costco. They asked each CEO to answer a series of questions about their knowledge of labor violations in the port trucking industry and about their plans to cut ties with those companies.
Together, these four senators represent powerful voices around the issues of labor, immigration and corporate malfeasance.
Warren, of Massachusetts, famously took on Wall Street after the real estate collapse in 2008 and transformed her popularity as a consumer crusader into a Senate bid. California Sen. Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the powerful judiciary committee.
“Port trucking companies' brazen disregard for federal transportation safety standards and workers' safety and rights is shameful,” they wrote in Monday's letter.
They pledged to “pursue aggressively all federal avenues to put an end to this rampant mistreatment of port truck drivers.”
“We cannot allow corporate profits to come at the expense of American workers, and that means putting an end to abusive practices we've seen in the port trucking industry," Brown said in a statement.
Since USA TODAY Network published its investigation in June, elected officials across the country have been pressing for action.
Dozens of lawmakers, from the Los Angeles City Council to Capitol Hill, have denounced the business practices, many calling on retail corporations to better police their trucking contractors.
Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino wrote a letter to the CEO of Target, suggesting the retail giant adopt a code of conduct specific to its port trucking contractors.
In a follow-up statement to reporters, Buscaino said he wants a “commitment from the big box retailers to stop doing business with trucking companies that treat their drivers as indentured servants."
Target, which previously called the mistreatment of workers in its supply chain “unacceptable,” declined to comment about the letters. Others, contacted Monday afternoon by USA TODAY, did not have an immediate response.
As they investigated the port trucking industry, reporters contacted two dozen retail companies, including Target, Costco and LG, that have used port trucking companies with labor violations. The few that responded said they were either unaware of widespread labor violations or not responsible for monitoring the maze of contractors and subcontractors in their shipping operation.
Now, some companies say they are taking steps to identify any abusive companies in their supply chain.
“We're investigating this issue directly with carriers,” Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said. Holmes pointed out that Home Depot had previously changed trucking companies and no longer uses any companies named in the USA TODAY investigation.
Over the past month, elected officials have met with experts and labor union leaders to discuss new laws that could curb abuse in the industry. And they've begun publicly pressuring federal Department of Transportation regulators to better coordinate with state officials to ferret out predatory labor practices.
Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Calif., said she's working with Rep. DeFazio, D-Ore., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., to resurrect a federal bill, the Clean Ports Act, which would give states and cities the power to better enforce labor laws and standards in the port trucking industry.
In California, state Rep. Ricardo Lara said he's drafting another bill to tweak California law so companies would have to disclose how they audit their operations at American ports.
California law already requires big companies doing business there to disclose what efforts they make to monitor their supply chain overseas. But retailers are not required to apply those standards to their U.S. shipping operations.
“We can't ignore the reality of what's happening in our backyard,” Lara said. “I think it's one of the biggest injustices happening in our state.”
Federal lawmakers have also called on regulators to begin working with state officials to coordinate efforts to crack down on labor law violators.
Two weeks ago, Rep. Alan Lowenthal, D-Calif, and Rep. DeFazio quizzed Department of Transportation officials on whether they had begun taking action at the ports.
Unhappy with the response, Lowenthal said he may seek to compel federal and state coordination if the agencies don't quickly take steps on their own.
DOT officials said the agency typically investigates cases only after they receive complaints.
Hundreds of California drivers have testified in state labor cases that they were cheated out of wages. Many described potential crimes, including managers who coerced them to work past the legal limit of hours and doctor logs, at times physically preventing workers from going home.
But that information has not yet led to criminal investigations at the federal or state level.
Julie Su, the California Labor Commissioner, told reporters in December that her office has not passed along port truckers' testimony to the DOT or the California Highway Patrol.
“I don't have a good answer to that,” Su said when asked why the agency did not sharethe evidence. “It hasn't been something we pursue.”
The USA TODAY Network's investigation focused on trucking companies around Los Angeles, where two ports are responsible for about half of all imports brought into the country.
In 2008, California officials ordered trucking companies at the ports to replace old big rigs with cleaner trucks. The companies pushed that cost onto drivers with a lease-to-own program, forcing many drivers to work around the clock. When they got sick or fell behind on payments, companies fired them, seizing their trucks and thousands they had paid in.
Company owners deny the claims made by their drivers, arguing most drivers are successful, and those who aren't had the freedom to quit.
Weston LaBar, executive director of the Harbor Trucking Association, which represents port trucking companies, said most of the complaints so far have been “noise drummed up by the Teamsters union.”
“If policymakers feel inclined to investigate this issue further,” LaBar said in a later email, “hopefully they will reach out to industry as well to get all perspectives.”

I loved Dredd so much when it came out two years ago that I was fairly disheartened when it failed to connect with a massive audience. I rarely approach celebrities in random situations, but the one recent exception was to tell Karl Urban how much I loved that movie. So it's good to hear that we'll be getting a version of Dredd fairly soon, although it's not the cinematic sequel that some of us have been clamoring for.
Instead, we're getting a seven part miniseries from producer Adi Shankar that will be released next month for free. There's no word on if Karl Urban or Olivia Thirlby will be participating (though Thomas Jane came back for Dirty Laundry so I suppose it's a possibility) but I guess we'll all find out soon enough. Hit the jump for more on the Dredd miniseries.
Shankar has been working on this project in secret for almost two years. Per The Wrap:
Since Shankar's unofficial “Dredd” project was done off-the-grid, it's technically a part of his popular Bootleg Universe, which includes the short “Punisher: Dirty Laundry” starring Thomas Jane and Ron Perlman, as well as “Venom: Truth in Journalism,” which starred Ryan Kwanten as Spider-Man villain Eddie Brock.
I'm definitely excited to see how this pans out. In the meantime, check out Dirty Laundry and Shankar's statement thanking the Dredd fans for their support.
Members of Venezuela's National Guard use their shields to form a barrier from a fire during clashes with anti-government demonstrators in Caracas (AFP Photo/RONALDO SCHEMIDT)
Caracas (AFP) - Venezuela's political crisis looks headed for a dangerous showdown Friday, after the opposition called three more days of nationwide protests against President Nicolas Maduro, defying a ban on demonstrations ahead of a controversial weekend vote.
The war of words escalated on Thursday, the second day of a 48-hour general strike by Venezuelans angry over Maduro's plans for a Sunday poll to elect a new body to rewrite the constitution.
"The regime declared we can't demonstrate... We will respond with the TAKING OF VENEZUELA" through a protest on Friday, the opposition coalition, the Democratic Unity Roundtable, said on its Twitter account.
It later upped the ante, calling for protests on Saturday and Sunday, as well.
"The whole country must tell the world this constituent assembly has no legitimacy," opposition lawmaker Freddy Guevara said at a press conference, urging Venezuelans to "deepen the conflict" to force Maduro to abandon his plan.
Maduro countered by urging the opposition to "abandon the road to insurrection."
He called for immediate dialogue but signaled he was not backing down. Any talks, he said, should happen "before the election and installation of the Constituent Assembly" tasked with rewriting the constitution.
Earlier, he issued a decree warning anybody taking part in protests that "could disturb or affect" Sunday's vote risked five to 10 years in prison.
Four months of violent protests have already left 108 people dead, according to prosecutors. Five of them -- including two minors -- died in protests during the two-day strike.
Fears of open civil conflict have prompted an exodus of thousands of Venezuelans into neighboring Colombia.
- Maduro unbowed -
International concern has mounted, with the United States, European Union, United Nations and most heavyweight Latin American nations urging Maduro to back down from his plan.
Some 70 percent of Venezuelans oppose plans for the constituent assembly, according to polling firm Datanalisis.
Washington has responded to Maduro's intransigence by imposing economic sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuelan officials, freezing their US assets and forbidding American entities from doing business with them.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that the 545 members to be elected to Maduro's constituent assembly could also face punishment.
Maduro branded the sanctions "illegal, insolent and unprecedented."
The US on Thursday ordered relatives of embassy staff in Caracas to leave the country, and authorized employees to leave on a voluntary basis, citing "social unrest, violent crime, and pervasive food and medicine shortages."
Venezuela's opposition, which controls the National Assembly, has urged civil disobedience against what it terms Maduro's dictatorship.
It is pushing on with its own strategy of trying to force Maduro from power through early elections.
Skirmishes in the street between supporters of the opposition and the Maduro government have become commonplace.
Volleys of tear gas, rubber bullets and homemade bombs arced through the air in the capital during the strike.
Barricades made from debris littered the eastern part of the city, with signs reading "No more dictatorships!"
"What happens if they impose the constituent assembly? The crisis will worsen. Where does Maduro want to take the country? To a social explosion?" asked Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader.
- Dire economy -
Protest organizers claimed 92 percent of businesses and workers supported the strike.
Maduro accuses Washington of fomenting unrest against him, aided by the opposition. He has increasingly relied on the Venezuelan military, which has repeatedly declared loyalty to him, to hold onto power.
The opposition, bolstered by an unofficial vote on July 16 that saw a third of the electorate reject Maduro's plan, has called for an election boycott.
At the same time, Maduro's administration is being squeezed by the long-running economic crisis.
The oil export-dependent economy will shrink 12 percent this year, after a contraction of 18 percent last year, the International Monetary Fund said.
Inflation is projected to top 720 percent.
Venezuela's currency reserves have dwindled to under $10 billion as the government keeps up debt repayments at the expense of imports to stave off a devastating default.
The country's isolation increased as more airlines cut service to and from Venezuela.
Avianca, a major Colombian carrier, said Thursday it was ending flights immediately, moving forward a suspension originally announced for mid-August.
US airline Delta is also expected to suspend services from September. The company declined to comment on the move.
If you care to remember, there was a time when fans were screaming for Alain Vigneault's head ... in October. You read that sentence correctly. There was a time when fans regretted John Tortorella being fired for Vigneault before 10 games of the season had even been played. Not everyone, mind you, but New York has a big enough fanbase that sometimes even the smallest minorities can raise their voices to something of a fever pitch.
New York has always been one of the toughest rooms to play. People expect (and in most cases demand) success the way they want it; which is usually right now. Often times it doesn't play out the way they envision, and when things happen people didn't expect or didn't want they voice their displeasure. Loudly.
Through the first season of Vigneault's marriage to the New York Rangers people questioned him at every turn. I blatantly questioned Vigneault when the Rangers brought in Dan Carcillo:
[The Carcillo trade] is not a true solution, or at least not a solution to help the Rangers' real issues. Obviously the Rangers' brass (and Vigneault is a part of this too) thought the Rangers needed more toughness. So they made a move for Carcillo to play on the fourth line. This wasn't a move to replace Derek Dorsett, who was injured against the Pittsburgh Penguins, this wasn't a move to bring in a player who could provide an offensive spark and this wasn't a move to alleviate the Rangers' issues with consistency.
Obviously I was quite wrong about the above. Vigneault not only used Carcillo in a way that utilized his strengths, but he helped turn Carcillo into a true factor that helped the Rangers reach the Stanley Cup Final. How many of you would have thrown money on that number at the roulette table the day the trade way made? Not many, if any at all.
We started learning our lesson around the beginning of the playoffs. We watched Vigneault mix and match, hit different buttons, examine what worked and what didn't and started shutting our mouths even if we didn't agree. When he moved Carcillo up to the top line for a game we mumbled and grumbled but watched it turn out OK. When he inserted Raphael Diaz to try and ignite the slumping power play we did the same thing.
Simply put, he earned the benefit of the doubt, which speaks volumes about the type of coach he is. It takes a lot to appease the fine folks of New York, and he did it in less than a year.
A lot of those feelings changed when the Rangers signed Tanner Glass to a three-year, $4.35-million contract. And when people found out all the signs pointed towards Vigneault personally requesting Sather go after Glass this summer, people turned on him yet again.
This year's free agency was different for the New York Rangers. For the first time in a long time fans watched more players walk out the door than came in it. Not to say that was the wrong decision -- it wasn't -- but it does represent sweeping change from the Rangers' brass.
The Rangers refused to overpay for the marquee name. They didn't try to fit a square peg into a round hole because of a veteran player's past accomplishments. What they did do was bring in a power play quarterback they desperately needed, AHL depth to help keep the Hartford Wolf Pack a place where prospects can continue to develop and re-signed one of last year's more important players in Dominic Moore. Outside of those moves it was quiet. And quiet isn't something we're used to when it comes to the Rangers and free agency.
So people turned on Sather and company. They were mad that he wasn't able to keep last year's team together -- despite the overwhelming evidence that Sather might have had his hands tied with some of the moves -- and they turned their frustrations into a loud argument against Glass.
I get the fancy stats argument. I really do. Glass has horrific possession numbers that didn't improve all that much (or at all) when he was paired with guys like Evgeni Malkin or Sidney Crosby. That's a red flag and at least one alarm ringing for sure. His possession numbers were the worst in the NHL last year. Not kind of the worst, THE worst. And if Crosby and Malkin can't help you there's nothing the Rangers can offer you short of tying Zuccarello and Martin St. Louis to each leg (they're small it would work) and having them sort of play for you.
But keep in mind Vigneault is not a coach who throws these stats out the window. Remember, Vigneault and his staff not only accept advanced statistics but they also keep their own stats internally which they analyse as they move through the season. Vigneault is very, very aware of the numbers Glass possesses, which means he has a plan for him.
Just because we can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there. I am not in the camp that believes Glass was brought in to be strictly a face puncher. I made that mistake when the Rangers traded for a Mr. Dan Carcillo (see above). For what it's worth, Glass did kill penalties in Pittsburgh (1:38 per game last year) and averaged close to 12 minutes a game. Some of that might have to do with the Penguins' remarkably weak bottom six, but through his career he has been a player to average around 11 minutes a game -- playing close to 14 in Winnipeg a couple of years ago.
Understand something, I agree with most of you. I don't think this move makes much sense for the Rangers. They had a player who filled Glass' role in Derek Dorsett and he proved he could do it, too. The Rangers traded him away in a move that was labeled as "clearing cap space" and then brought Glass in for just $200K less. On the surface it doesn't make sense.
But I've questioned Vigneault before and been proven wrong just about every time. And to be honest with you, if anyone has deserved the benefit of the doubt after an inaugural season it's Vigneault. He took this team and this fanbase kicking and screaming all the way to the Stanley Cup Final. And if not for three overtime goals that all went to the Los Angeles Kings, we might be signing a different tune.
So hate the signing all you want. Hate the player all you want. But give it a chance, if for nothing else because Vigneault wanted it.
And he's earned that right, like it or not.
A zero-day code-execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office is one of three critical flaws under active attack in the wild, Microsoft warned Tuesday as it rolled out a batch of updates that plug the security holes.
As Ars reported Monday night , attackers are exploiting the flaw to infect unsuspecting Word users with bank-fraud malware known as Dridex. Blog posts published Tuesday morning by security firms Netskope and FireEye reported that attackers are exploiting the same bug to install malware with the names Godzilla and Latenbot
Ryan Hanson, a researcher at security firm Optiv and the person Microsoft credited with reporting the critical bug, said exploits can execute malicious code even when a mitigation known as Protected View isn't disabled. The attacks are able to bypass other exploit mitigations as well. Microsoft's fix for CVE-2017-0199, as the flaw is indexed, is here.
According to Microsoft, flaws in two other products are also being exploited in the wild. One is an Internet Explorer vulnerability that allows attackers to access sensitive information from one domain and inject it into another address. Such elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities are typically exploited along with an additional attack exploiting a separate bug so the attack chain can bypass a security sandbox or similar security protections. Microsoft's guidance for CVE-2017-0210 said the IE bug is being exploited, but it didn't elaborate.
The third zero-day also resides in Office 2016, 2013, and 2010 and isn't actually being patched in Tuesday's update batch. According to guidance for the flaw: "Microsoft is aware of limited targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in the [Encapsulated PostScript] filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is released." The flaw is exploited when a target opens a malicious EPS image in Word.
In all, Microsoft released 15 updates on Tuesday patching dozens of individual flaws in software, including the Windows operating system, Exchange Server, and Adobe Flash. It's always a good idea to install updates as soon as possible. The active attacks on three separate Microsoft products makes that advice particularly important this month.
Now that we know Peter Capaldi is going to be the new Doctor, we're wondering what his signature wardrobe will be. These photos take us back to the days when Matt Smith's Doctor was still in development—as was his outfit.
Smith's Doctor went through a couple of rumpled looks before settling into the tweed jacket and bow tie—and at least one dark businessman outfit. Steven Moffat has said that the bow tie was Smith's idea, that he was a great admirer of Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor and liked the idea of a Doctor in a bow tie. Moffat says he was skeptical at first, but later admitted that the bow tie was the perfect fit for Smith. In a couple of these shots, Smith looks confused as to how he ended up in those particular clothes.

Chaos in Cape Town as protesters run amok
Cape Town - There was chaos in the Cape Town CBD on Wednesday as protesters against the provincial government ran amok and looted stores and stalls.
News24 reporter Nielen de Klerk said she was hiding in a food store as protesters looted stores and stalls in St George's Mall. A shop owner had also been hurt by the protesters, De Klerk said.
A loud bang was also heard which De Klerk said was a police water cannon. Cape Times reporter Caryn Dolley said the bangs might have been stun grenades. Police sirens could be heard in the city.
People in the CBD have been advised to not venture onto the streets.
The protesters appear to be protesting the provincial government.

After Gatebox, creators of the virtual home robot projection box, teased a Hatsune Miku themed demo at last year's Magical Mirai, they now seem determined to proceed with the idea of creating a proper version of the box with Hatsune Miku, this time for the consumer market! The announcement comes from an update to Gatebox's website. Titled the “Living with Hatsune Miku” project, it announces a March 9th, 2018 release. Further details are expected to arrive at a later date.
Gatebox plans yet another preview for this year's Magical Mirai, hopefully with changes to show off improved interaction compared to last year's demo. If you wish to try the demo, you must fill out the application located about 3/4 the way down the official page: http://gatebox.ai/livingwithproject/
Above is Gatebox's official announcement video of the event. It's not much, but we should learn more later. The LAT Miku model may be a placeholder, and not the finalized model choice. Pricing info is also still TBA, but might end up the same as the original Gatebox's price of 298,000 Yen.
Burger chains Carl Jr.'s and Hardee's have launched reverse versions of their websites featuring backwards text. According to Burger Business, the websites were created to promote the healthier or "other side" of the menus at the fast food chains. The Carl's Jr. and Hardee's sites even have URLs that feature their names' in reverse (rjslrac.com and seedrah.com, respectively). While text is backwards on the site, it does flip when scrolled over to "minimize head-inducing confusion."
The related burger restaurants are notorious for gut-busting concoctions: Many of Hardee's burgers contain over 1000 calories, and Carl's Jr. has offered everything from biscuits covered in frosting and sprinkles to Pop-Tart ice cream sandwiches. The new reverse websites provide tips on how to eat as healthily as possible at the two fast food restaurants. They highlight calorie counts, offers suggestions like ordering burgers wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, and focus on offerings like turkey burgers and salads. Then again, the websites list deep-fried zucchini as healthy.

Fresno State's secondary depth took an unexpected twin hit Tuesday.
According to head coach Tim DeRuyter in a press release sent out late Tuesday night, both cornerback Bryan Harper and free safety Justin Holmes have decided to quit the Bulldogs football team. The moves apparently came from out of the blue, at least publicly.
The pair left due to unspecified personal reasons.
“We appreciate their contributions and we wish them well in the future,” DeRuyter said in a statement.
Harper transferred to Fresno State from Arizona in 2013 and sat out that season to satisfy NCAA transfer rules. The decision to leave came after Harper had started the first two games of the season. The Fresno Bee wrote that Harper “was excused from practice on Monday while at home in Los Angeles to tend to a family issue.”
Coming out of high school in Ontario, California, Harper was a three-star member of the Wildcats' 2012 recruiting class.
Holmes, meanwhile, didn't record a tackle this year after redshirting as a true freshman last season. He was a no-show at practice Monday.
Neither Harper nor Holmes was listed on the most recent two-deep depth chart.

Finally a 75-Watt Incandescent Replacement (100W Model is Coming Soon)
I liked all the LEDs that I've had the chance to review so far. In fact, I use them every day and don't have much to complain about; in my office, I have a Qnuru 6.4W LED (the cool white model), in my bedroom the bedside lamp uses the FIRST 7W LED , and the living room used the Philips 12.5W LED . Until now that is... While light quality is fine with all these bulbs, brightness for most of these has been hovering around the 40-60W incandescent-equivalent level, and that's not enough for all purposes. That's why I was so happy to learn that the new wave of LED lightbulbs from manufacturers like GE and Philips are cranking up the brightness. Today, let's look at Philips' brand new 17W AmbientLED model.
Photo: Michael Graham Richard
This review is kind of an update on my review of the 12.5-watt model of this LED bulb because they are very similar (as you can see in some of the photos below).
Photo: Michael Graham Richard
They both look like they belong on a futuristic spaceship, or at least on a science-fiction show, but what matters most is how well shape follows function. The strange curvature of the yellow part helps the LED bulb project light in all directions much better than the 'ice cream cone' design of so many other LED lights (for example, see the Qnuru and FIRST models)
The 12.5-watt model is rated at 800 lumens, while this new 17-watt model is rated at 1100 lumens.
You might be wondering if it's dimmable. Short answer: Yes, it is dimmable. I've tested it and it works pretty well.
Photo: Michael Graham Richard
As you can clearly see here, the main differences between the 12.5-watt and 17-watt models is that the cylindrical heatsink is longer on the more powerful LED bulb. While LEDs don't produce nearly as much heat as incandescent bulbs, their components are less tolerant of heat than incandescent filaments. That's why they need to shed that heat with large heatsinks.
Photo: Michael Graham Richard
Here's another example of form following function. The way the top part of the bulb is split in three sections helps it have a large surface area to radiate heat and provide airflow. In practice, once the LED bulb is lit this isn't visible and doesn't affect light diffusion. Same with the yellow exterior, which acts as a filter for the blueish LEDs inside. Once the bulb is lit, the light is of a normal warm-white tint and isn't particularly yellow.

Light Quality of the Philips 17W LED
Unfortunately, I'm still not set up for very elaborate light quality testing, and since my last reviews I moved to a new apartment so I can't take a photo in exactly the same room as before (I always keep the camera settings the same between these photos, and I don't tweak them in Photoshop). In fact, this new room is bigger and has darker walls than the room I used before, so the photos don't quite do justice to how bright this LED is. You'll have to rely on my word, I suppose...
I found light quality to be quite good, as with the 12.5W model. As I wrote at the time:
"If I don't tell people, they don't know it's a LED, and I could easily see myself using Philips AmbientLEDs as my main source of light without problem.
To me this really shows that LEDs are ready for prime-time, all that needs to be done is to reduce the price, and that will happen with economies of scale and as R&D; into new ways to make them pays off."
Photo: Michael Graham Richard
We'll have to wait for the 100w replacement model (which is supposed to come out in a few months) before we have a truly bright LED, but this one is sufficient for most mid-sized rooms, and a couple of them would be enough for most big rooms (I guess it depends on personal preference - some people like things to be really bright, in which case you can either wait for the 100W model or just add a third or fourth 75W replacement LED).

Also noteworthy is that a Philips LED bulb using very similar technology to the one used in the AmbientLED 17-watt model won the U.S. Department of Energy's L-Prize after going through some pretty thorough tests. This is a good sign regarding the quality of these bulbs.
Price: The bulb will be available online exclusively at Home Depot at an initial retail price is $39.97.

The Context
On Saturday, June 10th , the cesspool of the right will bubble up in City Hall Plaza on 4th and James St in Seattle. Well, as of right now that is their plan C, according to the ACT head in Virginia Beach, VA Kerry French who is coordinating it since street preacher Anthony Harris couldn't figure out permits and Joey Gibson was even seen as a little too much for them. As has been known for some time, the organization ACT! For America [ACT], a notorious Islamophobic group that weakly tries to hide its White Christian Nationalism behind being “anti-Sharia Law”, is doing a national day of action “against Sharia Law”. The group's leaders such as the founder Bridgette Gabriel AKA Bridgette Tudor openly states, “all Muslims are radical Muslims” and that “Europe will no longer be Europe in 2050. Europe has already become Eurabia,” from quotes gathered by SPLC. They made it to hate group status; and in this time frame where white supremacist walk free beating somali hijabis in the streets into comas and killing men for standing up to men harassing young Black and Black Muslim girls while liberals still question whether or not they deserve to speak, they are bold enough to come out in public and connect with the who's who of fashy, white nationalist, nazi and alt-right types of the PNW.
The Guest List
This event, much like last weekend's rally in Portland, will have the likes of the Alt-Right's summit hoppers including:
Joey Gibson and Patriot Prayer, same organizers who gave us the anticom rally May Day in Seattle, and last weekend in Portland. Straight up white nationalist fascists.
Proud Boys, an ignorant group of chauvinist men whose 4th degree of membership involves “a major fight for the cause,” generally involving physical confrontation with Antifa.
Cascade Legion, a recent group based in Seattle, WA. An overtly fascist/nationalist group. Some ex-military, Odinists, and meme warriors. Willing to fight.
Traditional Worker's Party members
Warriors for Freedom/American Freedom a biker gang of Trump-loving, mouth breathers. Joey Gamble's group – known to assault protesters as well as conceal carry handguns.
3%er and Oathkeepers, continuing their role in assisting cops in being even more obvious fascists than they already are, makes sense since they are ex-cop/military militia groups, and known to open carry,
Anticom, largely a group of nerds that don't get out a whole lot. In their spare time they make memes and LARP as nazis and fascists.
And More!
Many of these individuals and groups take advantage of Seattle and Washington State's laws of mutual combat (RCW 9.08.070) which states that if you are challenged to a fight and you accept it is legal, the cops won't step in, and there is no recourse – which is why we have fucking “superheroes” here; Washington is a Stand Your Ground state (RCW 9A.16.020) as well as an Open Carry state. If you want to, look into these RCWs, since the other side already has to know what all of us are up against.
It's also important to note that some “liberal” groups such as the local Pink Pistols, a LGBT group made up of liberal white gays who are “anti-sharia” due to the homophobia presumed to be worse in Islamic-majority regions than other locations in the world, and Trumpers. Just because they aren't openly fash doesn't mean they won't mess with you or casually assist the alt-right folks.
Sometimes People Do Things
There has been some effort put in by comrades in the IWW and GDC locals in Seattle to work with other groups and coordinate. Things got really complicated and could have it's own article about the issues with mass organizing, but there's no time for that or groups invited wanting to have control on a narrative. However, even with the Interfaith Alliance going off to do an event on Friday, there will still be two offerings if you're wanting to do outreach or more green-zone actions earlier in the day:
The first event is the aforementioned positive-message only event fronted by the One People's Project and Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). It will be a rally starting at 9am in Occidental Park in Pioneer Square, about 6-7 blocks southwest from Ciy Hall Plaza, which will then lead to a march. Link is here
The other event is coordinated autonomously from that action is being led by Seattle Solidarity Network (SeaSol). It is a noise brigade, leaving from Westlake Park in the Financial District of Downtown Seattle, 9 blocks north of City Hall Plaza. They will be meeting at 9am, and you can find out more here
Where Do We Go From Here?
As antifascists and anarchists in Seattle, the conversations have been coming up on what we and our comrades in other cities can do to push back the increasing creep of the Far Right wherever they are and give no platform for their ideas. What seems to be a common pattern in the conversations between friends, organizers, people who will listen to any of us talk about this subject for more than five minutes who we trust is that we don't just want to show them that we disagree – we want it known that they should never come back here to our city. We are tired of having them win, whether that be because the cops rolled on us or they got to do their networking and making new fash friends from around the US. Never give nazis, white supremacist, Kek-praising edgelords, or Proud Boys what they want.
The objective requested for the 10th is simple yet open to interpretation: respect the events happening so as not to harm others, but do what you are comfortable with at any point.
Connect with people you trust. If you have people you trust on the ground here in Seattle, make contact. If you can't be here, support in other ways you can whether that be during or after the dust settles. Medics and bike scouts are being asked to meet with the SeaSol action in Westlake at 9am to coordinate where people can find out day-of where we end up in case they switch the location again.
Mumbai: An FIR has been registered against a man in the neighbouring Navi Mumbai for allegedly posting "offensive and humiliating" messages about NCP chief Sharad Pawar on a social networking site, police said today.
No arrests have been made, with police saying appropriate action would be initiated after a proper probe. They also did not reveal the content of the messages posted on Facebook.
According to Nerul police station, an NCP worker saw the posts on Facebook about Pawar and found them "offensive and humiliating". He complained to the police on Wednesday, following which an FIR was registered against one Pravin Pisal.
"The FIR was registered under section 66 A (punishment for sending offensive message through a communication service) of the IT Act. We have not arrested Pisal as we want to first make a thorough investigation into the case," Rajkumar Chaphekar, senior inspector at the police station, told PTI.
The officer, however, did not divulge the name of the complainant.
Investigators are taking help of legal experts before initiating any action against the accused, said another officer adding that Pisal would be questioned in this connection.

A rower plucked from his overturned boat about 250 kilometres off the coast of Ireland says he and his partner are "incredibly lucky" to have been rescued.
Brian Conville of Dublin and Joseph Gagnon of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Que., left St. John's on June 13 in a bright green boat packed with supplies, with the goal of being the first two-person crew to row across the Atlantic Ocean, west to east, from St. John's to France.
An unfriendly ocean and nagging injuries forced them to shorten their trip, and they aimed for the Irish coast instead — but the Atlantic wouldn't allow for that either.
Around 5 a.m. Irish time Friday, when they were about 250 kilometres from Ireland, rough seas flipped their boat and flooded the cabin, leaving the pair clinging to the hull for hours until they were found by the Irish coast guard — a rescue they didn't know was coming.
[The beacon] activated itself when it went into the water, and that's what saved our lives, to be honest. - Brian Conville
"We realized that we were incredibly lucky, because when the boat turned over, our EPIRB [emergency position-indicating radio beacon], which is the beacon that you would generally press if you're in distress, I must have knocked it when the boat turned over. It got a knock somehow," Conville told CBC News on Saturday.
"It was quite violent when the boat turned over. I was thrown from side to side. I was tied on enough; that's the only reason I stayed with the boat. But the EPIRB disappeared, so it activated itself when it went into the water, and that's what saved our lives, to be honest. Without the EPIRB, we wouldn't be here today. We'd still be on the boat."

Conville was rowing at the time. Gagnon was sleeping in the cabin, and didn't have enough time to grab his protective thermal suit before the boat flipped.
Didn't know coast guard was looking for them
The men spent several hours on the hull of the overturned boat, waiting for the seas to calm so they could retrieve their life raft from the flooded, overturned cabin, and figure out what to do next.
"We were formulating plans when we were sitting on the boat, to work out how to make communications to land," said Conville.
"The big thing for us at the time was to get the life raft, so we'd have a safe base."
By 2 p.m., the seas had calmed enough for the men to try to get any gear they could from the boat. "But at that point, we heard a noise in the background, like an engine, and it turned out to be a helicopter."
'Bittersweet' to come so close to goal
That helicopter was about a mile and a half away, sweeping the ocean, looking for the stranded men, who were then hauled up to the helicopter using a winch and taken to County Kerry in Ireland, where they spent Friday night recovering in a hospital in Tralee.
Conville said he's not sure whether they will try again. The priority right now is recovering and spending time with their families. He said he's not thinking too much about having come so close to their goal of reaching Ireland
"It's kind of a bittersweet thing, to be honest," he said. "In our opinion, we still rowed across the Atlantic. If it's between two to two-and-a-half thousand miles, it's a fairly impressive feat. We've got onto the continental shelf of Europe."
"But we don't do it for the records," he said. "We do it for the challenge, the personal challenge."

Scores and highlights from Friday's Class 2A semifinals at the 2017 Iowa high school girls' soccer state tournament in Des Moines.
Lewis Central 4, ADM 1
The top-seeded Lewis Central girls' soccer team ran past fourth-seeded ADM, 4-1, on Field 9 at James Cownie Soccer Park in the first Class 2A semifinal on Friday afternoon.
The star of the game was Kelsey McSorely, a senior for a Titans (18-3) team now one win away from repeating as the 2A state champions. McSorely, an Iowa State signee, scored twice for Lewis Central, and assisted on the other two goals.
The Titans opened the scoring in the second minute, when McSorely found Grace Guidry in the penalty box. Guidry then slotted home the lone goal of the first half.
Lewis Central broke the game wide open in the second. McSorely scored her first goal thanks to a pass from Guidry in the 50th minute. ADM (18-3) responded in the 64th minute, when Delaney Barton scored from 25 yards out
But the Titans pushed their lead back to two when McSorely found Suzie McDonald in the 69th minute. McDonald then weaved through the ADM defense and scored easily. McSorely scored her second goal on a free kick from 21 yards out in the 73rd minute.

Union 4, North Scott 3
A frantic final 11 minutes saw the Union girls' soccer team turn a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 victory over North Scott on Cownie's Field 6 on Friday afternoon.
North Scott held a commanding lead over the Knights after 60 minutes of soccer. A pair of goals from Rylie Rucker and another from Savannah Bogner put the Lancers (12-7) up 3-1 heading into the second-half water break.
But when time became an issue, Union flipped a switch. Courtney Powell scored on a long shot that bounced over the North Scott keeper in the 69th minute to bring the Knights closer at 3-2.

The old adage goes that everything is bigger in Texas. I know a whole bunch of Texans that would argue that everything is also better in the Lone Star state. Yes, we Texans are a very proud bunch, and rightfully so.
In order to fully appreciate visiting Texas, you must understand a few things first. So, here are ten tidbits that will help you make the most out of your trip:
Speaking, making eye contact, smiling, and waving doesn't mean we're trying to seduce you or sell you anything.
As a whole, Texans are a friendly bunch. We're quick to say hello and ask how you're doing. That's more of a rhetorical question, and just our way of being polite. We hold store doors open for strangers and wave to passing cars on two-lane highways. Need directions or recommendations to the best Tex-Mex in town? Ask a Texan, but don't be surprised if you suddenly have company for dinner. It's just our way.
Don't turn your nose up at gas station food.
Convenience store cuisine in Texas is more than a bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos, ranch-flavored sunflower seeds, and a 64-ounce fountain Coke. When you're seeking fried food paradise, look no further than the nearest gas station. When in the Panhandle, get an Allsup's burrito; it's golden fried cylinder of goodness. Don't forget a handful of taco sauce with that order. The corny dog was invented in Texas, and you can't go wrong with one of those from Stripes {formerly Town & Country} when in West Texas. And if you're lucky enough to encounter a Buc-ee's, you'd better stop. There are six flagship stores around Austin, San Antonio, and Houston. I tend to think they're called ‘flagship stores' because of their size. Each one is at least as big as Rhode Island and deserves its own Buc-ee Beaver flag and governing body. I dare you not to spend at least an hour in one and not ingest 1,752 calories.
Don't utter the words pop or soda unless you want a strange look.
Nothing will give you away as a foreigner more than saying pop or soda when ordering carbonated beverages. Those things are called Cokes. It's a generic term we use. I don't care if you really want a Pepsi, 7-Up, Mountain Dew, or Sprite. They are all known as Cokes. The only time they're not called Cokes is when you want a Dr Pepper. The Dr Pepper {don't ever put a period after Dr} was invented in Waco and thus deserves a certain amount of respect.
Learning our pronunciation is essential for communication.
Texans are not fast talkers. We have a drawl that seems to turn two syllable words into three. To accommodate for our slow speech pattern, we tend to combine words or just drop the endings. We apparently don't care for the letter g on the end of words. Take for instance these bastardized Texan words: fixin' {fixing}, gonna' {going}, nuttin' {nothing} and sumpin' {something}. Often times we simply make up our own words—libel'ta {likely to}, piddlee'o {an adjective meaning something small}, and ja'eatyet {did you eat yet}.
We don't measure distance in miles, but rather time.
Texas includes 7.4% of the nation's total area. El Paso in West Texas is closer to California than it is to Beaumont in East Texas. King Ranch in South Texas is bigger than Rhode Island. Brewster County in West Texas is larger than the entire state of Connecticut. Texas is larger than France. Driving in Texas is not only necessary, but a big part of our culture. So, you want to know how far it is from Houston to Austin? It's about three hours, unless you stop at the flagship Buc-ee's in Bastrop.
Whataburger is the alpha and omega of hamburgers. Amen.
The orange and white striped A-frame building is like a beacon in the night to millions of hungry Texans. I laugh in the face of folks who swoon over White Castle or In-N-Out Burger. Obviously they haven't yet tried a Whataburger or heard that there are 36,864 ways to customize one. The food is so good that HEB {my favorite Texas-founded grocery store—sorry Whole Foods} sells Whataburger fries, mustard, ketchup, and the best condiment invention since Tabasco—spicy ketchup. I might also add that Whataburgers are open 24-hours a day, and thus ideal for an after-bar burger rendezvous. Don't leave Texas without trying one.
We like our expressions.
It takes a Texan ten minutes to tell a five-minute story. It's not just because we talk slowly, but also because we're very much into our expressions. Here are a few common phrases:
This ain't my first rodeo.
Like lipstick on a pig
Come hell or high water
That dog won't hunt.
Rode hard and put up wet
Dumb as a box of rocks
Busier than a $2 whore on nickel night
Useless as tits on a boar
Like a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest
Sweatin' like a whore in church
Madder than a wet hen
Doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of
Bless your heart {Can't believe I forgot this one! Thanks, Donna.}
I suggest dusting off those eighth grade English skills and use context clues to figure out what we're talking about. If that doesn't work then just ask. We'll certainly take amusement in explaining.
Chicken fried steak is not poultry.
The state dish of Texas may be chili, but the chicken fried steak, simply known as CFS, is probably the most beloved meal. It can be found from cafés to high-end restaurants in big cities and small towns. What is a CFS? It's wiener schnitzel's first cousin.
Take a piece of steak and pound it senseless or until it's about ¼ inch thin. Dredge it in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Then dip it in an egg and milk wash. Repeat this process twice and then throw it in a skillet with hot oil. Fry it on both sides and then cover the CFS with cream gravy. Serve it with a side of mashed potatoes and fried okra and you've got yourself the Texas version of comfort food.
Kolaches and tacos—it's what's for breakfast
Forget IHOP, Denny's, Dunkin' Doughnuts, and the Waffle House. When you're in Texas, that dog won't hunt {See what I did there?}. Thanks to our Czech and Mexican influences, we have kolaches and tacos for breakfast.
You can find a breakfast taco anywhere in the state, from mom and pop taquerias to fast food joints like Taco Cabana {a Texas chain that obliterates Taco Bell}, Sonic, and Whataburger. The concept is simple: flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, and anything else you'd like thrown in. In West Texas and the Panhandle, they often are breakfast burritos, which are the same thing, only larger.
We have Czechs who immigrated to Central Texas in the late 19th century to thank for our love of the kolache. What is a kolache? Well, they are yeast bread filled with sweetened cheese or fruit. Kolaches have since evolved into yeast bread filled with sausage, ham and cheese, bacon, and eggs, though traditionalists eschew the savory version.
The devotion to kolaches has spawned chains like the Kolache Factory, which is great when you're in an urban area. However, along the highways and in small towns is where you'll find the most delicious kolaches. Central Texas gas stations double as bakeries {another reason why our gas stations are the best}, with my favorite being Hruska's in tiny Ellinger. Though, the most well known place for kolaches in the state is probably the Czech Stop in the town of West. It's so beloved that after a recent massive explosion occurred in West, the second question everyone asked was “Is the Czech Stop still there?” Seriously.
For more information on the great Texas kolache, Czech out this article.
When it comes to bar-b-que, beef is boss.
In Texas, we love our beef, but that's not to say that we discriminate against other delicious proteins. Bar-b-que is actually a cooking method that involves meat being smoked over wood at low temperatures. Any and all meat can be deemed bar-b-que in Texas, as long as its been smoked over mesquite, oak, or the like. Turkey, chicken, sausage, pork, and cabrito {that's goat in Spanish}, are also available on menus.
With that being said, if you've eaten bar-b-que in Kansas City, Memphis, or the Carolinas, then you haven't really had bar-b-que. In Texas, beef is boss and pork is a minion. We don't have pulled pork and our ribs are rarely baby back. Pork is used in sausage, but that's just about it. Beef brisket is far-and-away the most popular and beloved item on any menu. Sliced brisket is standard, as is a chopped brisket sandwich. Here's a tip: Just get a three-meat plate and try a little bit of everything. It's hard to go wrong with bar-b-que in Texas, especially in Central Texas.
This easily could be a ten-part series, as we Texans are a unique bunch with a culture all our own. We're not Southerners and we're not Western. We're simply Texan. I believe the great writer, John Steinbeck, described us best:
“I have said that Texas is a state of mind, but I think it is more than that. It is a mystique closely approximating a religion. And this is true to the extent that people either passionately love Texas or passionately hate it and, as in other religions, few people dare to inspect it for fear of losing their bearings in mystery or paradox. But I think there will be little quarrel with my feeling that Texas is one thing. For all its enormous range of space, climate, and physical appearance, and for all the internal squabbles, contentions, and strivings, Texas has a tight cohesiveness perhaps stronger than any other section of America. Rich, poor, Panhandle, Gulf, city, country, Texas is the obsession, the proper study, and the passionate possession of all Texans.”
Yes, Mr. Steinbeck, Texas is a state of mind, a blissful, happy state of mind.
BERLIN (Reuters) - A senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies rejected French President Emmanuel Macron's plans to reform the euro zone by installing a joint finance minister and creating a common budget, in an interview published on Saturday.

The suggestions from Macron, who was elected in May, have been met with caution by Merkel, amid suspicion in Berlin that German taxpayers might be left to shoulder common debts.
Markus Soeder, Bavaria's finance minister and a senior member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the region's sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) - told Der Spiegel magazine that Germany needed to consider how it could, together with France, strengthen financial stability in Europe.
But he raised doubts about the idea of a euro zone finance minister, saying he was “very sceptical about whether an extra political office alone would improve the objectivity of decisions”.
Soeder said a joint finance minister who might get the right to intervene in the budgets of euro zone states if they did not stick to stability criteria would amount to a “huge intrusion”.
He was also concerned that changing EU treaties “would create new European financial equalisation or a transfer model through the back door”.
Soeder suggested taking the responsibility for ensuring states stick to the stability criteria out of the European Commission's remit and passing it to a beefed-up European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in the form of a European Monetary Fund with wide-ranging powers.
The European Monetary Fund would have the power to punish states that do not stick to the European stability pact - which stipulates, for example, that member states should not run budget deficits greater than 3 percent of GDP - and would be more objective in checking whether states are keeping to the criteria, Soeder said.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has proposed turning the euro zone's ESM rescue fund into a European monetary fund.
Asked about Macron's idea for a common euro zone budget, Soeder said it was good to promote investment in Europe but “we don't want any eurobonds or an EU financial transfer system. And no one should believe that a European finance minister will give them the money that their own budget lacks”.
Team New Zealand believe they may have found the "ultimate recipe" for this America's Cup and it stretches beyond their radical move to pedal-powered grinding stations.
The Kiwis continue to train and develop their boat on Bermuda's Great Sound ahead of official racing which opens with the first round-robin of the Louis Vuitton qualifying series on May 27.
Team NZ mechanical designer Tim Meldrum revealed on Friday there was more to the magic of the Kiwi boat than just the pedal stations, even though that was the most obvious innovation.
EMIRATES TEAM NZ Team New Zealand and Ben Ainslie Racing tangle in Bermuda.
"It was a bold decision, it challenged the norm if you like," Tim Meldrum said of getting the grinders to wear lycra and sit in a saddle for the job.

"But I think we had done our homework and we had all the numbers on the table. We are constantly searching for perfection, for the ultimate performance, for the ultimate recipe and we believe we might have found it," Meldrum said.
EMIRATES TEAM NZ Team New Zealand in full flight on Bermuda's Great Sound.
His cause for optimism went beyond the bikes.
"Cycling as an innovation is really just one of many innovations on the boat. It gets the lion's share of the media because it's so visible. But it's not like we are driving a propeller that actually makes the boat go faster. If we make more energy, we've got to be the smarter team that actually benefits from what we can do with that energy.
"There are probably 20 if not more equally impressive innovations on this boat that we have got to make work as well."
Meldrum marvelled at the way the grinders had taken up the challenge to start using their legs rather than their arms and said there was a competitive feeling within the group of eight grinders that would show in the boat's performance.
"There are still positions to be fought for so you are seeing a massive amount of hunger from the guys to want to do a really slick transition and put out some big power. There's everything to play for and the good news for us on the design side is the guys have really taken to it and are trying to make it work."
Team New Zealand managed to keep their cycling concept secret long enough to probably prevent rivals copying it.
"It was a sort of soft decision really," Meldrum said of the initial look at the dynamics of the bikes on boats approach.
"We had a covert internal programme going where we tried to keep a very limited number of people in on the early days concept.
"But the decision was early on that bikes were a serious contender.
"The bikes ran in parallel with grinding for a while, we had to really prove that it was here to stay.
"Gradually it just grew and grew and then one day it became pretty serious, we built a one-for-one full trampoline mock up and started to do some live training.
"I think everyone took it a lot more seriously when we put some bikes in the actual hull."

We're go­ing to the moon. Well, we're go­ing to or­bit the moon.
Fri­day night at 11:27, NASA plans to launch the LADEE (pro­nounced lad-ee) lun­ar or­bit­er, which will col­lect dust — lit­er­ally — as it circles the moon and stud­ies the lun­ar at­mo­sphere. The launch will be NASA's first from its flight fa­cil­ity on Wal­lops Is­land off the Vir­gin­ia coast, which means that most of the East Coast will be able to see it as­cend in­to the cos­mos.
Know­ing that space launches are awe­some, Or­bit­al (the com­pany that man­u­fac­tured the rock­et) has cre­ated these guides show­ing where you can watch the LADEE fly.
A huge swath of the East Coast will be able to see it.
But there might not be a bet­ter place to watch the launch than here in Wash­ing­ton on the Na­tion­al Mall.
For a more sym­bol­ic loc­a­tion of the ad­vance­ments in hu­man in­genu­ity, you could also travel to the site of the first flight in North Car­o­lina.
Va­ca­tion­ing on the Jer­sey Shore or Cape Cod? Yup, you can watch it there, too.
The relationship between Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid is heavily loaded. For Cristiano Ronaldo, it was a special moment on Monday. His documentary Ronaldo premiered in London. Jorge Mendes, Carlo Ancelotti, Alex Ferguson and José Mourinho were present. A charge of Real Madrid was sought in vain among the guests. Actually President Florentino Perez should attend the gala, but did not come after all.
The situation is worrying
This fits into the picture for the strained relationship between the FIFA World Player and his club. The Portuguese with 13 competitive overarching goals this season is largely on target. He takes much less at on the game at the Royal, looks listless and not involved in the game much like associated with the injury-related absence of his colleagues Benzema and James. Ronaldo is not happy on and off the pitch.
Lack of support from the club
Last season after the Derby defeat against Atlético Madrid, Ronaldo greatly celebrated his 30th birthday, which was heavily criticized by media and fans. There was a lack of support from the club back then. He has not forgotten that apparently. His unclear statements in recent weeks and the mysterious conversation with PSG coach Blanc after the Champions League game let doubts arise whether the Portuguese will play next season at Real Madrid.
Ibrahimovic marked his territory
The current Paris Saint-Germain top star Zlatan Ibrahimović has explained in an interview: “No matter what's been said or written, there's only one chief at PSG,” the Swede told the media, referring to himself. “I've felt part of this project from the moment I joined. Now everything is easier and we've built a great team together.”
MLB's new Collective Bargaining Agreement contains a previously unknown detail that could potentially affect teams that spend heavily, Baseball America's J.J. Cooper writes. In addition to the luxury tax, the CBA includes two surcharge thresholds that could cost big spenders extra money and that could even lower their top draft picks.
The financial details of the surcharge thresholds were previously known. If a team spends above $217MM in 2018, it will receive an extra 12% tax in addition to the usual 20%, 30% or 50% luxury tax. If a team spends over $237MM, it will receive an extra 42.5% or 45% surcharge tax.
Beginning in 2018, there will be an extra penalty for teams in that second category, Cooper notes. A team that spends above $237MM will also have its top draft pick lowered ten spots, unless that pick is in the top six, in which case the team's second pick will be lowered ten spots.
As Cooper points out, the new rule could be a significant deterrent to teams hoping to be among baseball's biggest spenders, since teams are generally quite protective of early-round draft picks. The Dodgers, for example, have had payrolls above $237MM for the past several seasons. Under the new system, they would pay a very significant penalty for spending so heavily. Cooper notes that a $260MM payroll in 2018 would cost the Dodgers over $50MM in luxury tax, plus the lowered draft pick.

The National Party president is as confident as he can be that his party has not received any donations from money earned from corrupt activities.
Labour leader Andrew Little told Radio New Zealand's Morning Report programme his party was offered "handsome" donations by Chinese donors when he was party president.

Mr Little said he had two approaches from potential Chinese donors.
"I wasn't satisfied about the origins of their funds, I had a hunch it wasn't appropriate to accept them and we didn't accept them."
The revelation comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping, on a visit to the country last month, asked New Zealand to do more to apprehend corrupt officials who he says have fled here from China.
Mr Little said it could not be ruled out out that other political parties had benefited from donations from people from China who have been corrupt.
Photo: SUPPLIED
National's President, Peter Goodfellow, said the party has turned down some donations because of concerns about where the money came from, but none linked to corruption in China.
He said he was as confident as he can be that all National's donations have come from legitimate sources.
"Certainly we disclose all of our major donations, you're able to see who those people are, the others are all within the disclosure limits and I'm certainly not aware of any that would cause concerns."
Mr Goodfellow said National did not have the resources to do in-depth investigations into individual donations.
Mr Little told Morning Report he did not refer the approaches from Chinese donors to police because that was not his job.
"Certainly in the Labour Party when I was party president we were approached being offered handsome donations - we turned them down, but they will have gone to other places," said Mr Little.
"We did not accept (the donations) and it simply beggars belief that they wouldn't have approached other political parties then and since."
Mr Little said Labour had rejected other donations as well, for example from the gambling industry.
Property market
Meanwhile, Mr Little said it was possible that money brought into New Zealand by former Chinese officials had been invested, or laundered, through the residential property market.
Prime Minister John Key said he had no information about that.
"Yeah look I wouldn't want to speculate on what they do with those funds, they could do a variety of different things and be held in a variety of different places.
"The issue that was raised with me wasn't where the money's going, just that there's concern there could be people in New Zealand who had essentially bought funds with them that were illegally obtained."
Mr Key says if New Zealand did send officials suspected of corruption back to China, it wouldn't want a cut of of any money they are accused of taking, as has been suggested in the Chinese media.
The issue of LAN play has become a hot-button issue for PC gamers ever since we found out that StarCraft 2 will have no support for it. Be prepared for an even larger backlash against a well-known RTS franchise however, as EA has confirmed that Command and Conquer 4 currently requires an online connection at all times... even when playing the single-player game.
"As of right now, you need to be online all the time to play C&C 4. This is primarily due to our 'player progression' feature so everything can be tracked. C&C 4 is not an MMO in the sense of World of Warcraft, but conceptually it has similar principles for being online all the time," Community Leader APOC wrote. No matter what mode you're playing, no matter what you're doing, if you want to play Command and Conquer 4, you're going to need to have a working Internet connection.
If you're already enraged, don't be. We're assured that this is no big deal. "While some may be taken aback by this, we've been testing this feature internally with all of our world-wide markets," APOC continued. "We wanted to make sure it wouldn't take away any significant market or territory from playing the game. We have not found or seen any results that have made us think otherwise." You won't need a broadband connection, in fact you'll be able to use a dial-up connection to get the game to play.
EA is arguing that you'll like what it's doing with the game enough to put up with this inconvenience. This is reminiscent of Blizzard's insistence that the new Battle.net will make up for the lack of LAN play. "What we are doing for multiplayer for the game and with our infrastructure for this game is unlike any we've produced before and I think you will finally see the culmination of a lot of key learnings from past projects in C&C 4, in this respect," APOC finished, before saying we can expect more details as upcoming gaming magazines hit the newstands.
While online connections are becoming more plentiful every day, can EA honestly not imagine any scenarios where a gamer might be away from an Internet connection and want to play the game? Without more information about the game's mechanics, it's hard to know if this move is a shady excuse for extreme DRM... but we're going to go ahead and float the possibility.
In fact, in a prior interview, Designer Samuel Bass claimed "as a nice side effect, since C&C4 requires players to be online all the time in order to prevent cheating, we'll be shipping without any form of DRM."
RTS games are great for laptops, and a natural way to pass the time while traveling. For Command and Conquer fans, though, it soon might be crucial to make sure your flight features Internet access.
Nothing seems more unlikely and surprising than this headline. Yet, it is a matter of fact that Jews served in the Nazi army in World War II. Bryan Mark Rigg, Ph.D. has written a book called Hitler's Jewish Soldiers, which deals with the 1,200 German officers of “Jewish descent” who commanded German armies during that war. Included were two Field Marshals, the highest rank available at that time, fifteen generals, and the officers commanding 150,000 German soldiers.
The most prominent of these officers was General Erhard Milch. An aviator during peacetime, he was given a commission in the German air force and made deputy to Herman Gőring, the chief of the Luftwaffe (air force). Although Milch had one Jewish parent and would not be viewed as Jewish by us, the Nazi laws persecuted so-called half Jews, murdering many of them. Yet, Milch was so important to the Nazi bosses that Hitler decreed that Milch was not a Jew and told his cohorts that “I decide who is a Jew.”
At least 20 Jewish soldiers in the Nazi army were awarded the Knight's Cross, Germany's highest decoration.
Rigg even found an observant Jew who served as a captain and practiced his religion throughout the war.
My cousin was one of those Jewish soldiers. Here is his story. When he was eighteen years old, in 1938, he was suddenly called by a Christian friend who told him the Secret Police, the Gestapo, were then and there coming to arrest him at home and send him to a death camp. Desperate for help, my cousin asked his friend what he might do, since running into the street was certain death as well. The friend told him to come along and join his company, as he was then on leave from the army.
My cousin could hardly accept that suggestion, as the army demanded that each recruit prove his pure “aryan” blood by showing papers certified by a “race researcher” who had looked through all of the recruit's ancestral certificates to insure that he had no “non-aryan” ancestry. My cousin was, of course, Jewish on both sides of his family and had no such papers. However, his friend assured him that his company commander didn't “give a damn” about the race laws then in effect.
And so it was. The German captain enrolled my cousin and said nothing at all about any evidence of “racial purity”. So, my cousin participated in the invasion of Poland in September of 1939. Then, one day, an officer confronted him and said that he knew that my cousin was a Jew. Hearing this, his captain discharged him from the army lest someone kill him.
It was required at that time that all discharged German soldiers had to work in the German defense industry. Therefore, my cousin was assigned a job in a factory in the Ruhr area where most of Germany's steel production takes place. There he was again confronted by a boss who told him he knew that my cousin was a Jew but would say nothing. So it was. My cousin survived the war, married an Israeli woman and came to this country, where he died a natural death ten years ago.
Rigg tells the story of how a Jewish soldier in the Nazi army saved the life of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Joseph Schneersohn. The Jewish soldier was Ernst Bloch. Bloch had a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother. A decorated World War One hero, Bloch barely escaped detection in rescuing the Rebbe. It is a fascinating story involving also American senators, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and a host of bureaucrats who made the rescue as difficult as possible.
Bryan Mark Rigg is professor of history at Southern Methodist University. He is not Jewish but served as a volunteer in the Israeli army. He is an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.
The Empire Podcast has released a new episode focusing on Alien: Covenant. As well as discussing the film, the Spoiler Special episode also includes an interview with Sir Ridley Scott recorded during Alien: Covenant's press rounds.
Scott talks a lot about Alien, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, re-iterating a lot of points that he has previously spoken about (including some brief mention of the sequel). Of interest, though, was Scott talked a little about some of the questions left hanging from Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Discussing how the Engineers would go around seeding various worlds with life, Ridley went on to say:
“If the planet went wrong, they would want to wipe it clean. But that could take 500 years. When they revisit – because different visitors would come back and see we're not doing so well – they would look at these human beings that are jerks, that are killing the planet, killing themselves, can't settle down, they're like a bunch of children. We should wipe it clean.”
Scott goes on to talk a little about the Engineer's tool of choice, the black goo, and re-iterate the nature of it as discussed in Alien: Covenant. The black goo would wipe out all non-plant life.
Later on in the interview, Scott also clarified David's motivation for wiping out the Engineers as seen in The Crossing prologue and the brief flashback scene from Alien: Covenant. In discussing David's creation of the Alien using the black goo, Scott had this to say about why David killed the Engineers:
“He hates them. He has no respect for Engineers and no respect for human beings.”

According to internal NSA documents seen by SPIEGEL, the NSA has the ability to access a lot of data on smartphones.
The agency reportedly has special task forces focusing on smartphone operating systems — specifically Apple's iOS, Android, and BlackBerry — as well as departments responsible for customized surveillance operations against high-interest targets.
A purported secret presentation leaked by Edward Snowden presents screengrabs from Apple's iconic 1984 commercial followed by pictures of Steve Jobs, saying "Who knew in 1984 ... that [Steve Jobs] would be Big Brother ... and the zombies would be paying customers?"
The implication of the presentation is that iPhone users are somehow complicit in their own surveillance by buying iPhones in the first place.
The documents mention that "location services" used by many iPhone apps are useful since most customers allow location tracking out of "convenience." The NSA has claimed that it chooses not to collect location data.
The report cites several instances in which the NSA was able to retrieve personal photos from iPhones, but states that there is no evidence of large-scale spying.
From Der Spiegel:
The material contains no indications of large-scale spying on smartphone users, and yet the documents leave no doubt that if the intelligence service defines a smartphone as a target, it will find a way to gain access to its information.
Here are the slides:

The slides also show a man in Afghanistan whose phone has purportedly been accessed. NSA/Der Spiegel
The below images — from a presentation called "Your target is using a BlackBerry? Now what?" — shows an email from a Mexican government agency sent using BlackBerry encryption technology which was intercepted by the NSA.
For some reason, Pastor Michael Mohr and University of Kentucky adjunct professor Kenneth D. Royal surveyed 170 self-professed exorcists (PDF) to get an idea of what they believe.
(Had they asked me, I could've just said “in bullshit” and saved them all this trouble…)
Anyway, here's what they found:
… today's self-professed exorcists don't see [“casting out demons”] as special or complicated. That is, most believe any mature Christian can cast out demons, and that no special items — water, oil, or crucifixes — are needed beyond the authority of Jesus' name.
In other words, they're just making it all up as they go along.
Here's the infographic with the results, because you know you want to see people argue over the colors of unicorns' horns:
Who knows how representative these exorcists are of the general exorcist population, but the fact that anyone thinks they have some special power is horrifying.

Atlanta-based rapper Tauheed Epps — better known as 2 Chainz, and formerly as Tity Boi — was robbed outside a medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood Sunday afternoon, police said.
Epps, 35, was walking with five members of his entourage on the 800 block of Howard Street outside the Green Door dispensary around 4:30 p.m. when three men in their 20s approached, said police spokesman Sgt. Dennis Toomer.
One of the men had a handgun and fired a shot, but no one was injured, Toomer said. The suspects, he said, took Epps' wallet and cell phone and drove away in a gold or grey sedan. No arrests have been made.
Epps was in San Francisco before heading to Oakland Sunday evening to perform at Oracle Arena for Summer Jam, a hip-hop festival hosted by radio station KMEL. Other Summer Jam headliners included rappers Kendrick Lamar and J Cole.
Las Palmas Barcelona Barcelona 1 2 FT Game Details GameCast
Lineups and Stats
Barcelona survived a late onslaught to beat Las Palmas and remain in the driving seat at the top of the Primera Division.
Luis Suarez opened the scoring within just five minutes of kick-off, finishing off a wonderful one-touch move involving Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba, but just moments later Willian Jose levelled for the struggling hosts.
Neymar restored Barça's lead shortly before half-time, but Las Palmas kept their heads up and missed four chances to prevent the visitors running out 2-1 winners.
The Catalans stretch their unbeaten run in all competitions to 32 matches and pick up a seventh straight league win, keeping them clear of title contenders Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid.
Luis Enrique made surprisingly few changes given his team have a Champions League match at Arsenal on Tuesday, only choosing to rest Gerard Pique.
The relegation-threatened hosts ceded possession to Barça early on and sought to hit them on the break, while sticking close to Neymar.
But Barcelona exploited these tactics, with the Brazilian drawing two defenders and quickly giving it to Iniesta.
He glided through midfield unopposed and played a simple ball down to Alba, who rolled the ball across for Suarez to tap in at the far post.
While Alba was one of the creators, he was at fault for Las Palmas' swift equaliser by not pushing up enough.
Willian Jose was played onside as a result and the Brazilian latched onto Jonathan Viera's back heel and fired low into the far corner.
The hosts nearly took the lead just a few minutes later as Momo raced onto another fine pass by Viera, but Javier Mascherano slid across to put off the midfielder and his shot flew over.
Barcelona kept trying to regain their lead, though, with Iniesta shooting straight at Javi Varas and Suarez sending a free header wide of the near post.
They enjoyed a slice of luck when they did eventually score, with replays showing Suarez was marginally offside when he received a pass down the right-hand side.
But the Uruguayan combined guile and composure to fight off a defender and then round another by the byline, with his cutback reaching Messi. His shot was well saved by Varas, but Neymar was there to knock the rebound in.
Suarez missed another clear chance early in the second half, shooting straight at Varas from the near post after a cushioned header from Dani Alves.
At the other end, Viera forced Claudio Bravo to dive low and Willian Jose was offside when he got to the rebound, hitting the side netting anyway.
The final half an hour was anything but comfortable for Barcelona and former academy player Sergio Araujo spurned three chances after coming off the bench, failing to hit the target each time.

After missing most spring practice because of a concussion, Notre Dame wide receiver Corey Robinson announced Wednesday he is ending his playing career because of them.
A 21-year-old senior who was elected student body president in February, Robinson has suffered three diagnosed concussions in the last year. He said he will remain with the team as a student assistant coach this season.
"After much contemplation and prayer, I have decided not to continue playing football due to multiple concussions," Robinson said in a statement. "I couldn't have come to this difficult personal decision without the incredible support from so many within the Notre Dame football program."
Robinson, who could have graduated in the spring, decided to return to school so he could run for student body president. He is believed to be the first football player elected to the office in school history.
Robinson had 16 catches for 200 yards and one touchdown in 11 games last season and finished his Irish career with 896 yards and seven touchdowns on 65 catches. He would have been the leading returning receiver this season.
The 6-foot-5, 215-pound son of Basketball Hall of Famer David Robinson had his best year as a sophomore, when he had 40 catches for 539 yards and five scores.
Father had some advice for his son as he pondered the decision.
"If you think football is going to take you somewhere, do it," David Robinson said. "If you think you can go a different direction, then do that. It's his decision to make."
Any aspirations Robinson had of playing professionally were overtaken by his desire to be an active student combined with the health risks involved with football.

"Playing in the NFL is an amazing opportunity," David Robinson said. "Some people would give their left arm to do it.
"But at the same time, if you have the opportunity to do other things — be a Rhodes Scholar, be student body president — those are things you need to weigh. To me, it's about understanding what your calling is."
Robinson, a liberal studies major who minors in business economics, applied to be a Rhodes Scholar but was denied. Had he earned that scholarship, he would have missed the football season while studying in Oxford. Robinson said he will continue to apply until he's 25, the age limit. He has studied abroad in South Africa and, most recently, Jerusalem.
His interests beyond football weren't lost on Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly.
"He's such a committed kid to everything he does — whether it be academics, football, community service or campus leadership initiatives — that he wanted to finish his four-year career on the field," Kelly said in a statement.
Now that he won't, Kelly will welcome him to the sideline.
"He sets a remarkable example for all of our players — not only how to represent yourself on and off the field, but also how working hard through adversity can lead to tremendous success," Kelly said.
Robinson, who plays 10 musical instruments, was an Academic All-American in 2014.
Quarterback DeShone Kizer saw firsthand how talented Robinson is. He also saw something else.
"He's one of the best athletes I've ever been around," Kizer said. "He's as brilliant as any man I've ever been around."
Robinson co-founded a nonprofit, One Shirt One Body, that distributes athletic apparel to underprivileged children. He said during his presidential campaign he planned to bring to campus a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program, which would allow students 24/7 access to rape kits and sexual assault prevention advice and resources.
Robinson first began to contemplate giving up football after the Irish's loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day but decided to return for his senior season.
"There's this notion or stigma that you have to only do one thing year-round, and you can't be excellent at something if you're passionate about two things," Robinson said after he was elected. "I think we're actually crippling a lot of our student-athletes."
But a concussion in March pushed him to reconsider. On Wednesday, he officially removed the "athlete" portion of his "student-athlete" title.

Under Armour Demands Tiny Clothier 'Armor And Glory' Change Name Or Face Legal Siege
from the armor-all dept
Under Armour, the clothing brand built on the idea that my belly fat should be clung to by a shirt while I shoot hoops in my backyard, has built up quite a reputation for itself as a trademark bully. To go along with the fun story of its battle against Ass Armor, Under Armour is notorious for trademarking roughly all the things when it comes to sportswear and equipment, and has always had a liberal idea of just how much control the law allows it to have over the use of the word "armor." Most times, very little public attention is whipped up. But now they're picking a fight with God.
In 2013, a Bible-quoting high school football champ named Terrance Jackson, upset that most of the clothing options for his 3-year-old son were covered in skulls and crossbones, decided to start his own “inspirational apparel” company with a scripture-inspired name, Armor & Glory. It recently received some major attention from America's second-biggest sportswear empire, Under Armour, which demanded the small Maryland company change its name or face all-out legal war.
“It's trademark bullying at its finest. I'm the little kid in the group and they're trying to kick dirt on my new shoes,” said Jackson, 37, who said the name came to him one morning, from “the full armor of God” cited in Ephesians 6:11. “When God gave this [name] to me, I never thought once about those guys. We don't even spell it like them.”
Ed Tomlin, Jackson's partner and a former director of football development for Under Armour (who says he left on good terms), says “it's a matter of principle and a matter of faith.” The name, he added, “was inspired by God. … To turn our backs now would be like we were being disobedient.”
Indeed, much as Ass Armor did, Armor & Glory's name doesn't include the "u," unlike Under Armour. Which is only a minor point, actually, because the chief test here is customer confusion and brand identity, and it takes a more imaginative mind than mine to think up exactly how a company selling a few hundred shirts is going to be mistaken for the clothing company currently chasing Nike for the sportswear crown. More troubling still is the nature of Under Armour's request. The company's legal representation requested not only that all Armor & Glory's inventory be destroyed, but that it would also have to hand over its domain, profits, and $100k in damages and attorneys' fees.That would equate to about every last dollar the company has ever made, since its 2013 inception. More interesting, for me at least, is that the company's core audience is Christian athletes wearing the gear in part due to the Christianity-inspired names and slogans. Lawyers for Under Armour have gone so far as to state that if Armor & Glory refuses to cease using the bible-inspired name, the result will be "an expensive and time-consuming legal battle." A more bullying statement is difficult to compose. But Jackson, thus far at least, isn't backing down. Why, you ask?How aboutfor a fun First Amendment test? If anything can whip up public support in a David v. Goliath legal battle, it's the injection of some honest to goodness bible-thumping. In fact, Armor & Glory has reportedly increased sales and brand-awareness due to the threat from Under Armour, making it all the more silly for the larger company to have engaged in this silly bit of bullying to begin with.

The domestic drug manufacturing industry has raised concern at the revelations by the anti-secrecy group, highlighting provisions proposed by the US government in the (TPP) that could impact generic penetration into various countries.
The industry, along with global health activists and patients' groups, have made representations to the government to initiate talks with the negotiating countries of
Patent experts, who have reviewed the document leaked by WikiLeaks, said provisions sought by the US attempt to block generic entry through intellectual property interventions. For instance, the proposal seeks to protect patents for brand name medicines in some participating countries and curtail access to low-cost generic drugs, experts said. The suggested provisions also attack section 3 (d) of the Indian patent law, which prevents patenting of incremental innovation.
The Indian pharmaceutical industry, a major supplier of generics to the world, is worried that the US proposal poses a huge threat to its export revenue. According to the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil) data, around 60 per cent of the total pharmaceutical generics produced in India are exported, clocking annual revenue of $14.7 billion. This is growing at 30 per cent yearly.
While the US is the largest importer of such products from India, domestic majors supply to various other markets, including Europe, Japan and Russia. Pharma is the fifth largest commodity exported out of India.
With so much revenue dependence on export, the domestic drug manufacturing industry is concerned that the proposed provisions in they are a concerted effort of multinational corporations to obliterate the generic producing industry, which poses a serious threat to innovator "It is of serious concern for the industry. We have been raising this issue for a long time and have exposed it. These are concerted efforts by the European Union and the US to contain Indian exports by creating obstruction," said D G Shah, secretary-general, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. The IPA represents 19 domestically-based companies, such as Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Lupin and Sun Pharma.
Industry officials are also sceptical of the government's ability to intervene and stop such provisions. India is not a party to the TPP, being negotiated between 12 countries, including the US and Japan. Other nations drafting the proposed partnership are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.
China, the world's largest trading nation and also on the Pacific rim, is not one of the negotiating parties.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international humanitarian organisation working in 70 countries worldwide to make generic medicines accessable, said the proposals currently include some of the harshest provisions against access to medicines ever included in a trade agreement with developing countries, gutting public health safeguards and leaving these countries unable to take the steps needed to protect the lives and health of their people.
Leena Menghaney, India Manager of MSF's Access Campaign, said various representations had been made to the Indian government. "We are also briefing and initiating talks with negotiating countries like Vietnam, New Zealand and others, convincing them to ask the US to take these provisions off the table," she said.
The industry is particularly concerned that in the absence of government support, the international lobby is trying to malign the domestic generic industry and delay approvals and launches.
THERE is “huge concern” among British doctors that “super-gonorrhoea” is spreading across the country.
The highly drug-resistant strain of the sexually transmitted superbug is at risk of becoming untreatable if the only fully effective antibiotic remaining fails, experts say.
There have been efforts to track down the sexual partners of those infected with the disease, which can cause infertility.
However Public Health England is understood to have acknowledged that efforts to contain the spread have been of “limited success”.
The alert comes after Chancellor George Osborne warned resistance to antibiotics will become “an even greater threat to mankind than cancer” without global action.
PHE said an increase in cases of super-gonorrhoea was a “further sign of the very real threat of antibiotic resistance to our ability to treat infections”.
What is gonorrhoea?
The disease is caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.
Of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms.
But symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.
Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.

We chatted yesterday and I was promised a formal response today. Radogno just sent me a text message… I'm out of here 7-1. End of business. Let's hope she helps finalize a budget deal by then. Personally, I'd like to see her go out on a high note. *** UPDATE 1 *** Full statement… Statement from Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno: “It truly is an honor to represent the 41st Senate District and my Republican colleagues in the Illinois Senate. I have done the job to the very best of my ability and always with the needs of the state and my constituents in mind. I am proud of my legislative accomplishments – none of which were achieved alone. I have always appreciated the support, advice and counsel of my colleagues in both parties, staff and family. I have particularly enjoyed my friendship and working relationship with Senate President John Cullerton that began the day we were chosen as Leaders of our respective caucuses. However, I believe it's time for a new Senate Republican leader. I have done everything I can do to resolve the state's budget crisis. I will continue to do so for the coming days. But if the solution will not come on my watch, I hope and pray that the Governor, other legislative leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House can find a path to solve the state's problems. Though I leave political office with a sense of sadness and some disappointment, I leave with no regrets. I did my best – that's all I could do. It has been a privilege to serve. But now I am looking forward to returning to private life and spending time with my family, especially my five grandchildren. Effective close of business on July 1, 2017 – the start of the new fiscal year – I intend to resign my position as Senate Leader and Senator from the 41st District. The Caucus has already begun executing the plan for a smooth, orderly and expeditious transition.” She's a class act through and through. *** UPDATE 2 *** I think it may wind up being a little narrower than this, but this is true at the moment…

She is a consummate professional and public servant, who has championed fiscal responsibility and human services that help our most vulnerable residents. While she will be sorely missed, Diana and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.” *** UPDATE 4 *** From House GOP Leader Jim Durkin… “Chris Radogno has been my Senator and Co-Republican Leader for many years. I am fortunate to call her a confidant and friend. Her contributions to her district and the State of Illinois are immeasurable. Chris always stayed above the fray in this very partisan environment. Her constituents and I will miss her valued leadership.” *** UPDATE 5 *** From Mayor Rahm Emanuel… “Leader Radogno has been a committed and courageous public servant who has put the needs of her constituents, and all Illinois residents, ahead of special interests, politics and partisanship. Throughout her five terms in office she has always proven willing to reach across the aisle to find solutions for Illinois' most pressing challenges, and her reasonable, pragmatic, collaborative approach to policy stands as a model for other legislators to follow. As the first female leader of a party in the Illinois legislature, she has served as a role model and paved a path for future generations to follow. I join residents across the state of Illinois in thanking Leader Radogno for her service and wishing her well in her next chapter.” *** UPDATE 6 *** Press release… Illinois Senate President John J. Cullerton issued the following statement regarding the pending retirement of his colleague and friend Republican Leader Christine Radogno. She and I began as Senate leaders on the same day. We started our relationship in those roles by voting for each other. We then turned our attention to the impeachment trial. We followed that up with a long-overdue, bipartisan agreement on investing in roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure. It has been nine years of cooperation and professionalism It's been my honor to have Leader Radogno as my legislative partner, and I have cherished the opportunity to work with her as a colleague and friend. She was the one who first reached out to me to start the Senate effort to show that we could balance the budget. Frankly, this week's leaders meetings wouldn't be occurring if it wasn't for her. I will miss her camaraderie and common sense. But I also hope that she has a few tricks left up her sleeve before July 1 to help us finally get out of this mess. *** UPDATE 7 *** Sen. Bill Brady… “Over the years, it has been a privilege and an honor to work alongside Leader Christine Radogno. Chris has a track record of being an incredibly hardworking, principled and bipartisan leader who truly believes in working across the aisle to do what is best for the people of this state. I want to thank her for her years of service to the state of Illinois, and wish her and her family nothing but the best as she moves on into this next phase.” - Posted by Rich Miller

After years of political debate, partisan pleas and protests, Georgia as of Saturday will allow guns on any campus in the state's public college and university system.
The “campus carry” legislation is the most high-profile of a slew of laws that become effective July 1. including an expansion of Georgia's medical marijuana law and permission for the state to take over failing schools.
Campus administrators and law enforcement officials have spent weeks holding town hall-style meetings. Facts sheets have gone out to digital in-boxes. Officials with the University System of Georgia, which has 45,000 employees, have posted online information and guidance about the new law.
Yet a number of faculty and students say they are still confused about what to expect, in part because guns are allowed on some parts of the campuses and prohibited in other areas. Some worry their campus communities aren't prepared, an unease heightened by a schedule that brings an influx of hundreds of thousands of people mid-August when the fall semester begins.
“I think the university is being responsive but I just don't think there will be a clear answer for a while,” said Victoria Smith-Butler, a communications professor at Albany State University and chairwoman of the University System's faculty advisory council.
Smith-Butler said she is trying to be realistic.
“I'm sure there have been students with guns in my classroom before without me knowing it,” she said. But now that it will be legal, “we are not sure how to deal with it. We're breaking new ground.”
According to system officials, the law leaves it up to the person carrying the gun to know what the rules are and to follow them. That includes whether they are entering a place on campus where guns are still banned or if they are taking a class with a high school student — a situation that would also bar them from carrying their weapon.
Under the law, anyone with a concealed-weapon permit will be allowed carry firearms on all public college and university campuses, with exceptions that include dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, and buildings used for athletic events. On-campus child care centers are also excluded, as are areas on campus where high school students attend class.
No signs will be posted on campus identifying which areas are off-limits. Everyone has been told they are not allowed to ask whether someone is legally carrying a gun.
This was the fifth year in a row the Legislature had considered such a measure. Last year's legislation got as far as Gov. Nathan Deal's desk before he vetoed it, citing concerns that it was both too broad and that campuses have historically been gun-free to promote learning.
He signed House Bill 280 this year, however, after supporters agreed to other concessions that additionally excluded guns from places such as campus discipline hearings and administrative and faculty offices. With it, Georgia became one of at least 34 states to allow guns on public college campuses.
Supporters have said the law gives faculty and students a chance to protect themselves without interfering with their peers, since weapons must be concealed. It is an added measure, they say, to counter criminals who may also bring a gun onto campus.
Critics, however, fear allowing guns on campus creates an unsafe environment. They've cited national studies, including one released last fall by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health that concluded the presence of guns would likely lead to more shootings, killings and suicides on campus, especially among students.
Georgia law requires anyone seeking a state permit to carry a concealed gun to be at least 21 years old. They must be fingerprinted and pass a background check.
Younger out-of-state students, however, could be allowed to carry their weapon here depending on “reciprocity” agreements that Georgia has with other states. In those agreements states recognize one another's gun laws, so students from places such as Missouri, where the minimum age for a concealed-carry permit is 19, could also legally carry on campus in Georgia.
Other potential issues include the conundrum of game day: People will be allowed to carry their weapons in tailgating areas where alcohol can be consumed, but not inside athletic facilities.
Then there is the question of what to do with their firearms when owners are not carrying them if, for example, they live on campus. No campus in Georgia will provide gun storage facilities. Existing state law allows weapons to be locked in cars if the permit holder comes onto campus.
Students who supported the legislation said they will ask the Legislature next year to add provisions that allow weapon holders to keep their firearms in their dorm rooms.
“It's a real pain for anyone I know who carries,” said Ja'Quan Taylor, 21, a Georgia Tech senior who lives off-campus.
Guns are supposed to be concealed, carried in a fashion that does not attract attention. Campus police will be responsible for administering the law.
For students like Taylor, who said the law gives him and others an assurance of protecting themselves, Saturday will be a momentous occasion. Taylor has carried his primary weapon — a .45 ACP handgun — near Georgia Tech but not on the campus. Now everything will change.
“It's definitely going to feel safer,” he said.
Some faculty members, too, have praised the plan. When the faculty Senate at Darton State College — which has since merged with Albany State — voted on the issue before final passage, half thought it was a good idea.
Smith-Butler, who has a law degree from Emory University, said her biggest concern is what she considers inconsistencies in what the law addresses and ignores. Smith-Butler said while she personally opposes guns on campus, her peers “just want more direction and consistency.”
It's too soon to know whether the law will have any effect on enrollment, despite threats by some parents to remove their children over the issue. Officials also have no way to say how many people will be carrying guns on campus.
Some are attempting last-ditch efforts to make the rules clearer. Georgia State assistant professor Julia Gaffield started an online petition Wednesday asking the state Board of Regents to require its campuses to post signs where guns aren't allowed.
In the meantime, some students are taking it on themselves to also spread the word. Tech's Taylor and others recently conducted an online session to talk about the law. They plan more.
Others are still trying to wrap their minds around what to expect.
“It's still really muddy,” said Audrey Smith, 21, a rising senior at the University of Georgia who said there are plans at that campus to conduct gun safety training this fall with campus police and student government leaders. “It still raises a lot of questions for me.”
Writer Amanda Hess, in the cover story for this month's Pacific Standard, writes at length about the problem of online rape culture, and the challenges women face in both experiencing and reporting it. As one who's suffered the abuse of online stalkers, including everything from rape to death threats, she writes from a position of particularly personal relevance. She's far from alone in that position: according to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent of people who report harassment online are female. However, her piece comments on how impotent local law enforcement and Silicon Valley platforms like Twitter are in responding to harassers — often because it's much harder to discern if an online threat is real when compared to real-world ones. As she writes, "...when anonymous harassers come along — saying they would like to rape us, or cut off our heads, or scrutinize our bodies in public, or shame us for our sexual habits — they serve to remind us in ways both big and small that we can't be at ease online."

Commentary by Justin Igger
A man climbed through the open window of an 83-year-old woman's room at an assisted-living facility here, then beat and sexually assaulted her in the middle of the day, the King County Sheriff's Office say
Well, that's just wrong, but why she leaves her window open in the middle of the day? I tell my momma niggas be crazy nowadays. Not one of momma nine baby daddies ever been there for her. They were always locked-up or runnin the damn streets. So I told her she always needs to lock her windows, cause you never know who might crawl through that mufucka.
The crime was so brutal and brazen that it left law enforcement stunned.
Sho. Da poleece is stunned when a nigga choke and rape an 83-year-old woman at a nursing home, but they ain's stunned when they kill armed black criminals just because they skin is black. Fuck da poleece. Black lives matter too!
“The nature of it, horrible, horrible circumstances,” said Sgt. Jason Houck of the King County Sheriff's Office . “But an 83-year-old woman? That's just seeming like it's taking it to a new low.”
Yea, it is horrible. But at least she wasn't 100 and sumpin. That damn nursing home director need to make them old folks keep they damn windows closed. Knowmsayin.
Firefighters told deputies the 83-year-old woman had serious head injuries and showed signs of sexual assault. She was taken to a hospital. She told deputies later that she was in her room watching TV when she heard a noise by an open window. She saw a man taking off the screen and climbing through. The man hit her several times on the side of the head, wrapped his hands around her throat and choked her. Then he sexually assaulted her.
What the fuck is wrong with that man? He coulda raped her without having to hit her upside the head and choke her old ass. If he did that to my momma I'd rob a liquor store or sumpin just so I could beat that nigga ass in jail. Sheeit. Think I'm bullshittin.
Deputies arrived with a dog to try to track the attacker, but the man couldn't be found. He is described as a black man who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and has a slender but strong build. He was wearing a black and white shirt, black pants and a black skull cap.
Man, I ain't ever seen no brotha wearing a hat wit a skull on it. I bet it was a white dude with his face painted black. Or prolly one of them dark ass Meskins or sumpin. You know that old woman didn't have her glasses on. Besides, why they gotta say he black any damn way? It ain't 1960 no more. We smarter than they are. Now everybody just bleeds red. Cause there ain't but one race and that's the human race. Who care what color that man is? Damn poleece always tryin to make the black man look bad.
The most intriguing and polarizing player on this current Raiders team is by far Terrelle Pryor. The skills he possesses have a lot of fans seeing stars envisioning the kinds of playmaking abilities they have seen players like Cam Newton and Colin Kaepernick make for the Panthers and 49ers respectively.
The Raiders have been trying different ways to get him on the field this season and utilize his athletic abilities from the quarterback position. Greg Olson is the offensive mastermind behind the plays that have been inserted into the book designed for Pryor.
"We're still kinda tinkering with that toy," said Olson. We did some things in the first game that we were pleased with. We went into the second game and tried some other schemes... you looked at them and say maybe they weren't as successful as they were in that first week, but again, we changed up and we'll continue to change up and do some different things this week with him so that we have an entire package. Each week we're just trying to expose a little bit with Terrelle, add a little bit to the initial package that we had in for him."
He said how he uses Pryor will change with the loss of Veldheer but that it will change for everyone. Whether that means we see any more of Pryor will probably play itself out more as we get into the season depending on how well Flynn performs under the extra pressure not having his standout left tackle presents.
It also will depend on just how well this "toy" functions in the packages put aside for him.

Runaways #1 8.5 / 10 Reviewer {{ reviewsOverall }} / 10 Users (0 votes) BC Rating Summary RUNAWAYS #1 (W) Rainbow Rowell (A/CA) Kris Anka Rated T+ | In Shops: Sep 13, 2017 SRP: $3.99
“When did you get so stingy with spells?” “Since I started running out.”
Not enough people liked Runaways. A comic published in 2003 by Brian K Vaughan and Adrian Alphona as part of Marvel publisher Bill Jemas‘s doomed “Tsunami” initiative, it was pretty much shunned by most Marvel readers and, with corporate support, limped along to issue 18, despite rapturous reviews, awards, cosplay, and people devoting their hearts to it. It was the Kieron Gillen/Jamie McKelvie Young Avengers of its day, but sold even fewer copies.
This comic about teenagers in the Marvel universe who discover their parents are super villains that no one has heard of — and they'd like to keep it that way — had elements that would be seen in Brian's later hit, Saga, the combination of people of science and people of magic, working, living, loving, side by side. The expectations and failures of parenting. And the likelihood of people to do the wring thing at the right time. No wonder the people who liked it loved it.
And then something strange happened. The trade paperback collections started to sell. And not just the Jemas-mandated digest-sized versions, but the later full-size versions as Marvel realised that, actually, there was a market for Runaways — just not where they had been looking. And it was enough for them to bring Runaways back to comics, in dribs and drabs, even with folk like Joss Whedon writing, with other creators on subsequent issues included Terry Moore, Humberto Ramos, Kathryn Immonen and Sarah Pichelli.
Marvel published a 30 issue series to follow, then relaunched another 14. There was even a Secret Wars mini-series. But it's fair to say that they never quite caught the critical fire that the Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona series did, which remains a true Marvel Comics classic.
An old friend of mine, Drew Pearce, wrote a film treatment after working on Iron Man 3 — he also wrote and created superhero sitcom No Heroics which is really overdue a critical reappraisal. As with many movie projects, it went away.
This meant Marvel TV were allowed to have a go. And a new TV series based on the original series will be dropping on Hulu on N0vember 21st, my birthday. We ran a few snippets here until people started making legal threats…
And, with a new TV series on the go, Marvel Comics has decided to have a new runaway comic, as well. It looks like a six-issue limited series, but Marvel isn't confirming that, as they are allergic to those words. But it's from YA author Rainbow Rowell with artist Kris Anka and colourist Matthew Wilson. Here's to solicit, ahead of next week's release.
RUNAWAYS #1
(W) Rainbow Rowell (A/CA) Kris Anka
GET READY TO RUN!
The “IT” book of the early 2000s with the original cast is back – Nico! Karolina! Molly! Chase! Old Lace! And, could it be? GERT?! The heart of the Runaways died years ago, but you won't believe how she returns! Superstar author Rainbow Rowell (Eleanor & Park, Carry On) makes her Marvel debut with fan-favorite artist Kris Anka (ALL-NEW X-MEN, CAPTAIN MARVEL) in the series that will shock you and break your heart!
Rated T+In Shops: Sep 13, 2017
SRP: $3.99
Break my heart? I'll take that challenge. Bleeding Cool has seen an advance copy of the comic. There will probably be small spoilers here, but major twists not stated in to solicit or previews won't be stated.
The comic focuses on Nico, the magician who can use any spell (but only once), and who has bunted though all she can think of, having difficulty lighting matches for the stove. The mighty brought low. She could use many a spell to sort out her situation, but who knows when she'd need it later?
It's the combination of absolute power and inability to use it, for fear of needing to use it later, that goes to the heart of the character. She knows she cannot have her cake and eat it, and that fills this first issue. It's this incapability that has caused Nico to run away from being a Runaway. The “with great power must come great responsibility” line is far more suited to Nico, and this comic is all about that responsibility — both to use her powers and not use them.
I'm not sure about breaking my heart, but it certainly stressed me to all hell.
A fellow Runaway has suffered a terrible blow. And Nico must save Gert somehow — every one of her previous healing spells now seems a waste. Some of this is said, some is left in between the panels, unsaid but acknowledged.
Yes, Gert died. But things can be fixed if you don't cheat. OK, OK, don't cheat a lot. But Runaways has always been about whatever you can get away with. And Chase does have a time machine, after all.
“You have a time machine… and you got there too late?”
So this becomes a superhero magical procedural, the details are delicious and thought through, the ingenuity of solution, with any possibilities not taken excused by the stress of the situation.
Taking this comic apart, it is impressive to see this build, to watch the flow of audience expectation pieced together and ramped up panel by panel. It's a comic about emotion, but as much that unexpressed as expressed. So, yes, Kris Anka, is perfect for this, clean lines, inter personal stress and conflict, in the moment agony, then able to conjure the fantastic but make it sit happily alongside the mundane, without contradiction, both his strengths but also keeping it in tone with previous Runaways.
It may be the biggest insult or the greatest compliment that I could have totally seen this as Runaways #19. Or whatever it would have been. It's a shame that, as part of Marvel Legacy, it couldn't have been Runaways #67. Because that's how it feels. There is a mention of moments in between, but it's telling how soon it feels like the regular Runaways again.
It's also as funny. There is a killer gag, delivered after the main trauma has ended that totally lightens the mood, does something only comics can do and even reflects the newspaper gag strip just a little thanks to Anka's deft pen lines.
So no, no heartbreak. But stress, smiles, and a longing for more. What the hell else do you want, blood? Because, okay, there's plenty of that too.
Some will dismiss this as fanfic. A way to get away from what a writer originally wrote, with the audience given what they want rather than what they need. I don't know. I think these days giving the audience a bit of what they want, as long as it comes with a price, is no bad thing.
Oh yes, and no dinosaur yet. Though on the cover — and the TV show — so, just wait…
Runaways #1 is published on September 13th by Marvel Comics.

Pastor Bill Lytell (Screenshot/YouTube)
Stay-at-home mothers should meet their husbands at the door looking “all spiffed up,” Florida pastor Bill Lytell told his congregation in an August 9 sermon about being a good “manager.”
In a sermon posted by the website “Stuff Fundies Like,” the pastor lays out quite a tall order for women.
Women who stay at home with children and don't have a “secular job” are responsible for a laundry list of items, Lytell said, including buying groceries and making sure the house is kept “impeccable,”having the baby fed and squared away and having a hot meal waiting when their husbands get home.
And on top of all that, women must meet men at the door looking like “a million bucks.”
In April, Lytell also said that he was proud of a “male leadership” sign outside the church and that this is a man's world.
“Don't you be ashamed you go to a church with male leadership,” Lytell said at the time. “Every church that's right with God oughta have a sign: ‘Male Leadership.' Because that's the only kind of leadership, both from Adam all the way to the last part of the Bible. It's all been male. This is a man's world!”
Watch Lytell discuss his views on how women should look, via Stuff Fundies Like YouTube account, here:
New Delhi: Government think-tank NITI Ayog's chief executive Amitabh Kant on Wednesday pitched for market pricing of electricity and transferring power subsidy to the bank accounts of poor consumers as part of radical reforms needed to cut power theft and make affordable energy available for a globally competitive manufacturing industry.
At a conference in New Delhi organized by the India Energy Forum, an industry organization, Kant said introduction of direct benefits transfer (DBT) along with other steps like privatization of all the state-owned power distribution firms and having independent state electricity regulators were the bold reform measures needed to turn around the struggling electricity distribution sector. Direct bank transfer of entitlements is already in place for cooking fuel.
At present, individual power consumers are cross-subsidized by industrial and commercial establishments, the higher power tariff for which adds to their cost of doing business and reduces competitiveness in the world market.
“About 79% of our manufacturing output comes from small and medium enterprises. Availability of affordable and reliable energy on a sustained basis is essential for them to plan for the size and scale required to penetrate world markets. No country has benefited from strong manufacturing growth for long periods on the back of domestic market alone," said Kant. He added that it was the manufacturing sector, more than services, that has helped other nations to record long periods of economic growth. Service accounts for about 65% of India's gross domestic product.
“Health of the energy sector is critical in attracting investments. Radical restructuring (of the sector) is necessary," said Kant, adding that the government which pulled off a mammoth and unprecedented move like demonetisation of large denomination currency notes, was capable of bold reform measures.
Power distribution utilities have been the weakest link in the energy value chain, plagued by power theft, billing inefficiency and regulatory delays in approving tariff increases, which together made them one of the worst loan defaulters in the economy.
“In the name of load management, power distribution companies shy away from procuring power, which makes the generation companies run their plants at low capacity, impacting their loan repayments. If distribution companies are to turn around, there is a need for continuous improvement in operational efficiency and continuous revision in power tariff," said Ashok Haldia, managing director and chief executive officer of PTC India Financial Services Ltd, a power sector lender.
According to Anil Razdan, former Union power secretary, health of the power sector directly impacts that of the financial sector as 70-80% of the funds invested in any new power project are from financial institutions. “Outstanding bank credit to power sector as on September 30, 2016 was Rs5.3 trillion. Power sector's share in gross non-performing assets (NPAs) is almost 6% compared to 14% for the entire infrastructure sector," said Razdan, quoting Reserve Bank of India figures. He argued that it was crucial to enable power generation companies to run plants at full capacity so that they can produce affordable power and service their debt.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Italy closed its embassy in Libya in February, warning nationals to leave
Four Italian construction workers have been kidnapped in Libya, the Italian foreign ministry has said.
They were abducted near a compound owned by Italian oil and gas group Eni in the western Mellitah area, the ministry said.
Italy closed its embassy in Libya in February, calling on Italians to leave because of the dangers to foreigners.
The country is beset with warring factions four years after the civil war that ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi.
The foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni told Italian media on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that it was difficult to speculate about who was responsible for the abduction at this stage.
The workers are employed by Bonatti, a company that provides services to the oil, gas and energy sector, a spokesman confirmed.
They were kidnapped while returning from Tunisia on Sunday evening, La Repubblica newspaper reports.
Two rival governments are vying for legitimacy and territory in Libya and so-called Islamic State (IS) is among the armed groups operating in the country.

Canada's New Marijuana Medical Access Program
On June 10, 2013 the Minister of Health released the new regulations that will govern access to cannabis for medical purposes in Canada. The regulations are the result of consultations over the past two years and introduce significant changes to the program. The regulations eliminate previous requirements that patients submit an application to Health Canada requesting authorization to possess cannabis. Instead they must seek a document from their physicians that they would then present to a licensed producer. Though this move could potentially streamline access to cannabis for medical purposes, the Canadian Medical Association has released a report that suggests that many physicians believe they do not know enough about the benefits and risks of cannabis to “prescribe” it to their patients for medical purposes. The irony of this situation is that the prohibition of cannabis has limited the amount of research into its medical benefits (though research is increasing).
In addition, the new rules eliminate personal and designated production by individuals in their homes by March 31, 2014. This means that current options to access cannabis for medical purposes will be replaced by regulated and commercial Licensed Producers and medical cannabis dispensaries remain excluded from the supply chain by these new regulations. Many patients produce their own cannabis in order to access strains that they have found to be helpful. Maintaining one's own garden is also cost-effective. Even the government's own regulatory impact statement notes that the cost of medical cannabis will go up with the new rules. These cost increases could potentially act as further barriers to accessing cannabis for medical purposes.
The exclusion of medical cannabis dispensaries from the supply chain is counterintuitive. The personnel working in these dispensaries are experts on using cannabis to treat a variety of medical conditions. Dispensaries also offer a range of patient-centred services and supports that help challenge the isolation many patients experience. And Canadian medical cannabis dispensaries have developed a rigorous accreditation program to ensure consistency in both the quality of their services and the products dispensed at these sites. Without dispensaries, patients will have to submit their doctor's authorization to a licensed commercial producer and then receive their medication by courier, without the supports accorded by face-to-face consultations.
The odd thing about the new rules is that they introduce a fully commercialized route of access to cannabis for medical purposes while keeping the overall prohibition of this drug fully in place. Indeed some of the provisions for producers of cannabis for medical purposes may serve as a model for production of cannabis for a legal, regulated market. At the same time, the requirements for licensed producers are quite strict and could make it very difficult for small growers to transition to this new regime. It is also unclear how many licensed producers will be approved by Health Canada. This later point is key for patients who want to be able to access a range of strains of cannabis.
All in all, these new rules will likely result in new barriers to accessing cannabis for medical purposes and will end up costing patients more money over the long-term.

The agency once viewed as a major stumbling block to the bill's passage is now seen as an inevitability by Republicans and key industry lobbyists alike. Banks will accept consumer agency
Republican Sen. Richard Shelby recently made Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd a tantalizing offer: He'd drop his opposition to an independent consumer financial protection agency as part of a renewed round of negotiations over sweeping financial reform.
It's not clear what the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee asked his Democratic counterpart for in return for the offer, which Shelby made almost immediately after a regulatory reform bill cleared the committee last month. But Shelby's willingness to negotiate signals that an agency that would regulate mortgages, credit cards and most loans to consumers — once viewed as a major stumbling block to the bill's final passage — is now viewed as an inevitability by Republicans and key industry lobbyists alike.

Big banks that have been vocal opponents of the agency have decided they have the legal resources to deal with a consumer agency, whether it's independent the way it was originally proposed by President Barack Obama, or as a part of the Federal Reserve, as envisioned in Dodd's bill.
Whatever its ultimate form, they expect they will still be able to influence the critical details of how it's set up. And smaller banks are expected to be exempt from many of the new agency's regulations, according to insiders.
An even larger factor is that big financial institutions now have more important concerns as they scramble to fend off tighter restrictions on lucrative derivatives trades and other provisions of financial regulatory reform legislation that threaten the industry's bottom lines. Obama on Friday threatened to veto any bill that fails to place tight controls on derivatives, the complex financial instruments that played a key role in the 2008 global meltdown.
"While media reports and attention has been focused on the consumer protection piece, most industry believes there is a greater threat in other areas of the bill," a Democratic industry lobbyist said.
Indeed, mammoth financial institutions like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are worried about one provision that would force more open dealings in the $450-trillion over-the-counter derivatives market, an unregulated playground largely dominated by the quintet.
Another provision, the so-called Volcker Rule preventing federally insured banks from trading on their assets, essentially threatens to break up financial titans like JPMorgan. And megabanks are worried about new rules governing how companies once deemed too big to fail would close down under the new system should they implode again.
Those five banks spent more than $21 million lobbying Congress last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And they have employed plenty of Washington's brand name lobbyists to work their influence, including: former House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt; Steve Elmendorf, a former top Gephardt staffer; Chuck Brain, former President Bill Clinton's top lobbyist; Ken Duberstein, a chief of staff in the Reagan White House; and Tony Podesta, a prodigious fundraiser close to the Obama administration and much of the Senate Democratic caucus.
Over the weekend, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick created a stir when he did not stand for the National Anthem before an exhibition game and later told reporters that his refusal to do so was a protest of institutional racism in America. Given how issues which touch on patriotism and protest play in a sports setting, it's not at all surprising that this quickly turned into a huge controversy, with many decrying Kaepernick's act, even as many have rushed to his defense.
Because this is the NFL and because we live in the social media era, the volume of this controversy is understandably cranked to 11. But it's not the first time an athlete has mounted such a protest. Back in 1995 NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf similarly refused to stand for the Anthem and the same sorts of pro and con arguments emerged, albeit at the far more measured pace of 1990s discourse.
In 2004 a baseball player made a somewhat similar protest. That player was Carlos Delgado, who made a point to not be on the field during the by then de rigueur playing of “God Bless America” during the seventh inning stretch which most teams adopted in the wake of 9/11. Part of Delgado's protest stemmed from his opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It likewise reflected his protest of the United States Navy's use of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a weapons testing ground for decades and Puerto Ricans' call for the government to clean up the island which had become contaminated with ordinance over 60 years of bombing.
Delgado was backed by his team, the Blue Jays, who made no effort to intervene in his protest. He likewise had the support of his teammates. Even profoundly conservative ones like Gregg Zaun, who disagreed with the substance of Delgado's protest yet respected his right to protest how he chose. At the time Zaun said “He has his opinion and he's decided to use that as his platform. Whether or not I agree with him, I salute him.”
Which is not to say that Delgado did not take considerable criticism for his protest. Many, including commissioner Bud Selig, said that, while they respected his right to protest how he wished, they hoped he wouldn't protest in such a fashion. Or, at the very least, they hoped to better understand why he chose to make a political statement at a sporting event, suggesting that they really didn't think his act to be appropriate. Lost on them all, it seemed, was that the act of playing “God Bless America” during the seventh inning stretch was itself a political statement, but I suppose that's an argument for another time.
Carlos Delgado weathered the controversy well, playing for five more seasons after 2004 and maintaining the respect he had always had in baseball as a team leader, a respected veteran and a consummate professional. Kaepernick doesn't have the track record in his sport that Delgado had by 2004 and there are some who have suggested that, this controversy aside, he may not have long in the league due to his skills and health and things. It'll be interesting to see how those differences, as well as the different media environment in 2016 compared to 2004 affect this whole saga.
What we know for certain, however, is that Kaepernick's reasons for protest are his own and he is, obviously, free to protest however he'd like. He is, of course, likewise subject to criticism from those who don't care for his protest. That's how free speech works. Even in sports, where a great many people choose to believe that protest and political speech, at least of a certain variety and of a certain leaning, does not have a place.

The press in Britain has recently been having fun mocking a group for which pejorative descriptions have been created such as “non-educated delinquents” and “the burgeoning peasant underclass”. The subjects of these derogatory descriptions are said to be set apart by ignorance, fecklessness, mindless violence and bad taste.
To illustrate the last of these, critics point to their style of dress: a love of flashy gold jewellery (hooped earrings, thick neck chains, sovereign rings and heavy bangles, which all may be lumped together under the term bling-bling); the wearing of white trainers (in what is called “prison white”, so clean that they look new); clothes in fashionable brands with very prominent logos; and baseball caps, frequently in Burberry check, a favourite style. The women, the Daily Mail wrote recently in a characteristic burst of maidenly distaste, “pull their shoddily dyed hair back in that ultra-tight bun known as a ‘council-house facelift', wear skirts too short for their mottled blue thighs, and expose too much of their distressingly flabby midriffs”.
This upsurge of popular distaste towards one group may be evidence for a cultural shift back towards a class-ridden British society — at least the fear that it might be so is causing some alarm in liberal circles. Critics point to the copying of the style by many younger television celebrities as a further dumbing-down of that medium. Much of the attention is due to the experience of a Web site, which was intended to be humorous but which was infiltrated by extremists who threatened to turn it into a hate site.
From a linguistic perspective the most interesting aspect is the wide variety of local names given to the type. Scots call them neds (often said to be an acronym of “non-educated delinquents”, but that's a folk etymology, given credence by being mentioned as fact during a debate in the Scottish parliament in 2003; it's actually from an abridged form of the given name Edward, which was attached to this group in the period of the teddy-boys, who dressed in a version of Edwardian costume), while Liverpudlians prefer scallies (a term of long-standing for a boisterous, disruptive or irresponsible young man); Kev is common around London (presumably from the given name Kevin, common among this group and popularised through the portrayal on his television show by the comedian Harry Enfield of an idiotic teenager with that name). Other terms recorded from various parts of the country are smicks, spides, moakes and steeks (all from Belfast), plus bazzas, scuffheads, stigs, skangers, yarcos, and kappa slappers (girls who wear Kappa brand tracksuits, slapper being British slang for a promiscuous or vulgar woman).
The term that has become especially widely known in recent weeks, at least in southern England, is the one borrowed for the name of the Web site, chav. A writer in the Independent thought it derived from the name of the town of Chatham in Kent, where the term is best known and probably originated. It is also commonly said that it's an acronym, either from “Council House And Violent” or “Cheltenham Average” (the word being widely known in that area). As usual, we must treat supposed acronymic origins with the greatest suspicion; these examples are definitely recent after-the-event inventions as attempts to explain the word, though very widely known and believed.
But it seems that the word is from a much older underclass, the gypsies, many of whom have lived in that area for generations. Chav is almost certainly from the Romany word for a child, chavi, recorded from the middle of the nineteenth century. We know it was being used as a term of address to an adult man a little later in the century, but it hasn't often been recorded in print since and its derivative chav is new to most people.
Other terms for the class also have Romany connections; another is charver, Romany for prostitute. Yet another is the deeply insulting pikey, presumably from the Kentish dialect term for gypsy that was borrowed from turnpike, so a person who travels the roads.
Did chavi die out, only to be reinvented recently? That seems hardly likely from the written and anecdotal evidence, and many correspondents report that it is well known to them as a spoken term in various parts of the country; what we're seeing is a term that has been in active but inconspicuous use for the last 150 years suddenly bursting out into wider popular use in a new sense through circumstances we don't fully understand.
A section of the Burnside Bridge has fallen into Antietam Creek
January 17, 2014
For Immediate Release: January 17, 2014

A section of stone wall on the upstream side of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam National Battlefield has fallen into Antietam Creek, and the National Park Service has temporarily closed this pedestrian bridge. National Park Service engineers will conduct a preliminary evaluation of the bridge next week.
Burnside Bridge is one of the best known historic structures at Antietam National Battlefield. One of a number of stone bridges constructed across Antietam Creek during the first half of the 19th century, it became an iconic symbol of the horrific battle that occurred on farm fields surrounding Sharpsburg, Md., on September 17, 1862. The bridge served a key role in the Battle of Antietam when a small force of Confederates defending the critical crossing over Antietam Creek held off Ambrose E. Burnside's 9th Corps for several hours.
It may be the biggest insult since salsa made in New York City. Texas, long the nation's oil capital, could get upstaged by California.
That's right, California. Enron's prey-ground. Cap-and-trade fantasyland. Home of fossil-fuel-hating, electric-car-driving, green-dreamers.
Last week, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management sold 15 leases for about 18,000 acres in California's Monterey Shale, which stretches 200 miles south from San Francisco. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates the shale formation could hold 15.4 billion barrels of oil, which would be double the combined reserves of the Bakken formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas, Bloomberg News reports.
Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum snapped up most of the leases sold at the auction, and California lawmakers have drafted new rules to deal with a boom in hydraulic fracturing.
So far, Texas still has the edge in terms of jobs. A recent report by IHS Global found almost half of the country's nearly 1.3 million energy industry jobs were in Texas, and predicts the number will continue to rise. Oil and natural gas activity in Texas is expected to generate $22 billion in federal, state and local revenue this year.
Those numbers aren't lost on California, a state battered by budget shortfalls, underfunded public pensions and an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent, the nation's highest.
Increased production from California will add to U.S. oil output that is already growing a record, hitting its highest level in 15 years, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy . Domestic production will top 6.4 million barrels a day this year, a 14 percent increase from last year and the biggest annual gain since the first commercial well was drilled in western Pennsylvania in 1859.
All of which is good for the country and good for the oil industry, as long as they don't start calling it California Tea.
Lagos, Nigeria - The sun beats down on the baked grass as spectators shelter beneath a blue and white marquee. The field of the Lagos Polo Club is emblazoned with the name of the oil and gas firm Caverton.
The tent does little to alleviate the oppressive humidity as team Zippy begin their preparations for the afternoon's Low Cup. This is the second week of the Lagos International Polo Tournament and the tension is mounting. Bode Makanjuola, 39, takes deep drags on a cigarette while his younger brother, Rotimi, stares into the distance.
RELATED: Playing through the pain
The keen polo players are at the heart of Caverton, a family-owned company run by the Makanjuolas. A childhood friend, Sherrif Shagaya, and a South African professional player, Leroux Hendriks, form the other half of team Zippy.
"I'm trying not to shout," says Rotimi softly. Apparently the ponies and jerseys from the sponsor are yet to arrive. "So many things have gone wrong," he says.
The 34-year-old - whose friends and family call him 'Tim' - says he always gets butterflies before a match.
Leroux discusses strategy and, 15 minutes later, after the jerseys and ponies have arrived, the team rides out into the heat.
The South African's voice can be heard throughout the match - coaching and coaxing his team-mates to victory.
'The sport of kings'
It isn't unusual for foreign professionals to be brought in to improve a team's handicap ratings for particular cups.
Each player is awarded a handicap rating, which is combined with those of their team-mates. The Low Cup requires a maximum rating of seven.
Leroux isn't the only overseas pro competing at the tournament. Fred Allison, an entertainment entrepreneur who is watching the game, explains that overseas pros are often flown in and paid around $10,000 to $15,000 to participate in the tournament. He nods towards a few Argentine players on the field and jokes: "They're kind of like mercenaries."
Argentine horses are also popular. Considered the best, they are imported for upwards of $30,000 each.
As each player needs at least six to eight horses to compete, it is, perhaps, unsurprising that most of them are wealthy businessmen.
Female players are not participating in this tournament, but Uneku Atawodi, the female player who is perhaps Nigeria's most famous polo export, is watching from the sidelines.
When asked whether there are plans to make events like this more inclusive, the tournament's organiser, Duntan West, says there are few female riders. Then she adds, pointedly: "It's the sport of kings."
There is little in the way of social diversity out on the field. Most members of the club can point to only one example of somebody breaking through the elitist ranks - Ahmed Umar, a groom who became a professional player.
Thirty-six-year-old Ahmed is a pro who travels around the world competing in tournaments. He also manages the logistics department of Honeywell Oil & Gas, a family-owned company run by Ahmed's polo patron, Obafemi Otudeko.
"He wants me to work with him and play polo with him ... He's my friend and also my boss," says Ahmed, laughing.
He recalls his childhood assisting his father, who was a groom in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. It was during this time that his passion for horses and polo developed. As people noticed his talent, he says, they would hire him to participate in tournaments.
RELATED- Short story: The smell of home
Ahmed earns about $3,000 per tournament, which might involve about four matches played over the course of a week.
He still doesn't own any horses, he says, but he hopes one day to open a farm where he can breed polo ponies.
He's unsure whether somebody from his background would be able to enter the sport today. "It's not impossible, but it would be very difficult," he says. "It is much more elitist."
Ahmed thinks it's especially difficult to break into the sport in Lagos.
"I started in Ibadan so it made it easier. I had a little bit of [an] education ... Also the skills in the game ... By God's grace and favour, I was able to focus and gain people's respect."
"It is definitely a game of means," says Bode. "There's no hiding that."
And, for some, the sport's exclusivity adds to its appeal.
Ayo Olashoju, who was elected Lagos Polo Club captain last year, acknowledges that the sport attracts affluent patrons and sponsors who want to rub shoulders with the Lagos elite. Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, was spotted at the grand finale of this tournament's prestigious Majekodunmi Cup and royal guests, such as the Oba of Lagos, are regular attendees.
Attracting the 'right' crowd
Thirty-two-year-old technology entrepreneur Olumide Soyombo was introduced to the sport by a school friend. He is sponsoring two teams at this year's tournament, but is reluctant to disclose the cost of this arrangement.
Whatever it is, he believes it pays to associate his company, Blue Chip Technologies, with the sport. "It's a game that every brand would want to be affiliated with because it can capture the right markets and the right target audience," he explains.
At the tournament, that "right audience" is enjoying suya, a spiced grilled shish kebab popular in Nigeria, as a burly security guard stands by a roped-off entrance to a space where guests lounge on white sofas as waitresses in tight black shorts serve them champagne.
Bode has finished playing and is now sipping on champagne himself. "Everyone loves playing in front of a big crowd," he says. "We've seen the membership of the club grow. We have a lot of social members who just love coming to watch polo."
He describes himself as a late starter. He only began horse riding in his mid-20s, and his passion for polo followed.
Ellison, a childhood friend of Bode's, chips in, explaining how, back in 2006, the polo scene didn't hold the same allure it does today. "Bode was a pioneer [for] young people," he says. "It wasn't as cool as it is now. He helped to turn the atmosphere around ... [Now] it's like a bunch of friends hanging out and at the end someone brags about winning."
The polo lifestyle
But not all spectators are here for the glitz and glamour. A few hardcore polo enthusiasts are lined up at the bar by the field.
They arrive early in the afternoon to enjoy a full day of matches and show little interest in drinking or socialising. For them, it is all about the game.
Bola Lawal, who asked that his real name not be revealed, grew interested in the sport more than 10 years ago, after spending a year in the northern city of Kaduna, where riding horses is far more commonplace. The 30-year-old dreams of one day being able to own ponies and to afford club membership.
"It's aspirational. Everyone wants to be here," he says.
"Basically, it's a Nigerian trait ... People want to mix with the successful. Who doesn't want to hang out with the rich and famous? This is 80 percent of the reason people [come here]," he adds.
RELATED: A day in the life of... a house girl
Despite being dependent on the hospitality of friends in order to access this world, Bola says he admires the exclusive nature of the club. "When things become too accessible the value deteriorates," he says.
Olatona Olayinka is one of the ushers working at the event. The bus trip from her home in Surulere, a suburb of Lagos, to the club takes 90 minutes each way. She has been hired through an agency and works at a wide range of events to earn extra money while studying cell biology and genetics at the University of Lagos. She will be paid 5,000 naira ($25) a day for the 12-day tournament, arriving at 10am and finishing at 10pm most nights.
"The pay is OK," she says.
Olatona laughs when asked if she enjoys polo. She has no interest in the sport, but this is the second year she's worked at the tournament and she likes the crowd.
"This one is very cool," she says. "It's very well-organised and the whole setting is perfect."
The ushers explain that people begin to arrive from around 4pm. As the weekend approaches, the number of people in attendance grows. By the time Saturday comes, the club is packed.
Luqman Adebayo, 40, a polo player, company CEO and club member, describes the popularity of the sport: "You can see drones flying around. The games are streamed live. Social media makes everything more accessible."
And the club has big plans to expand. It has already spent $300,000 on a new field and is now planning to roll out a three-phase renovation project, explains the club's president, Ade Laoye. That will include building a state-of-the-art stable and grooms' quarters and constructing hospitality boxes for sponsors. The first phase is expected to start next year at a cost of $2m.
These plans come at a time when Nigeria is experiencing an economic downturn as a result of the plummeting price of crude oil.
The state of the economy is a hot topic of conversation during the tournament and collective belt-tightening a recurrent theme.
Tournament organiser Duntan West admits that sponsorship has dwindled substantially. She says she has responded to these financial difficulties by altering the balance between sporting and social activities, which were once given equal status at the club. "Now we do, maybe, 70 [percent] polo, 30 [percent] socials," she explains.
Players have also been hit by the financial downturn, but many seem reluctant to cut back on their passion.
"Regardless of the economic situation, people always try to find a way to do the things they love doing," Bode explains. "You find that most polo players cut back on other luxuries, but ... try and … maintain [the] polo lifestyle. Maybe I planned to buy [a] car this year, but … I'd rather buy a horse and play polo."
Luqman, who runs a construction firm based in the city, admits that he doesn't calculate his polo expenses. "If you keep counting, you're not going to do it ... I can just tell you that it's not cheap."
He grew up in Ikoyi, where the club is based. He remembers how, as a six-year-old, he was cycling around the neighbourhood when he was drawn to the sound of a tournament taking place. After watching through the club gates he decided he was going to play polo. He started riding and, seven years later, competed in his first polo game.
Bode gushes about his love of the sport. "I think all polo players are polo evangelists," he says smiling. "It's just about the passion."
TORONTO — The corporate auditor to the once high-flying Livent theatre company run by disgraced mogul Garth Drabinsky was partly responsible for the hundreds of millions of dollars creditors ended up losing, Ontario's top court ruled Friday.
In upholding an $85.6-million award against Deloitte and Touche — $118 million with interest — the Court of Appeal sided with a judge who found the auditor had been negligent in failing to detect, and act on, the fraudulent behaviour of Drabinsky and his partner, Myron Gottlieb, in the 1990s.
After all, there had been numerous red flags for several years that Deloitte essentially ignored, the court found.
“Deloitte knew that Drabinsky and Gottlieb were aggressive entrepreneurs who pushed the envelope in terms of accounting and financial measures,” the Appeal Court said in a 100-page judgment.
“It is more likely than not that a careful and objective investigation into Livent's financial statements, pursued with ‘an attitude of professional skepticism,' would have revealed the fraud.”
Under the flamboyant Drabinsky, Livent Inc. brought popular shows like “Phantom of the Opera,” “Show Boat,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” and “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” to stages across North America. But the apparent success was based on a massive sleight of hand that included cooking the books, kickbacks and manipulated expenses.
The shenanigans were discovered in mid-1998 when a new management team took over. Within months, Livent went bust — leaving investors and banks about $500 million out of pocket. Drabinsky and Gottlieb went to prison for fraud and forgery.
Livent's bankruptcy receiver sued Deloitte — which had audited the company's books from 1989 through to 1998 — on behalf of those owed money.
In a novel ruling that followed a 68-day trial in April 2014, Superior Court Justice Arthur Gans found Deloitte largely liable for Livent's losses after August 1997, saying company creditors had been hapless victims of a fraud the auditor should have brought to their attention had it done a proper job.
Barring such a claim, Gans said, would deprive innocent parties a remedy for an auditor's negligence in those cases where the services of an auditor are most critical — namely, the detection of wrongdoing by high-level management.
Deloitte appealed, arguing among other things that it should not have been held responsible for the fraud, or for the fact investors lost money.
The Appeal Court disagreed, siding with the judge's finding the auditor was liable for most of the post-August 1997 losses.
Deloitte knew the impresarios were using Livent's financial statements to help them raise money but failed miserably in scrutinizing those statements, the Appeal Court found. In addition, the court rejected Deloitte's argument that Livent's losses all flowed from the “inherent vicissitudes” of its risky business rather than from its failure do to a proper audit.
“The trial judge distinguished between losses generated from Livent's unprofitable but legitimate theatre business, operating within the changed environment, and those losses attributable to Deloitte's negligence,” the Appeal Court ruled.
The court also dismissed a Livent cross-appeal that sought to extend the period of losses for which Deloitte should have been liable.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Deloitte said it needed time to review the decision before deciding on any next steps.
“The audit and legal issues in this case are exceptionally complex and important — not only to the audit profession but to the broader business community,” Emily Richardson said.
Euro-conservatives sound just like you, me, and Donald Trump. They talk about freedom and democracy. They talk about tolerance for democratic parties but not for totalitarian killers. They talk about taking control of their borders again. Their college campuses have been subverted and turned upside-down, just as ours have. Their police forces often turn against normal people on behalf of murderous barbarians, just as ours are being pushed to do.
I keep reading in the European fakestream media that the new upsurge in conservative democratic parties in Europe all comes down to fascists and paleo-Nazis. They are not – any more than Republicans are fascists and Nazis.
But normal people in Europe have finally gathered the courage to call the enemy by name.
Europe's media constantly smear democratic conservatives as "extreme right" or "fascist." That is a vicious lie, as you can hear for yourself by listening to video speeches on the web by European conservatives.
If you don't happen to understand their languages, you can listen to Nigel Farage, who sounds just like Trump.
But notice that the Fakestream in Europe can never allow conservatives to speak, not without smearing them in the same sentence. Trump is a madman according to the media elites in Europe. But then their own democratic populists are also ready to go for a new Hitler, if you listen to the establishment media.
I've just listened to one of the heroic figures of the resistance, Geert Wilders, who has twice been arrested and convicted of "hate speech" by the neo-fascist establishment in the Netherlands. Over there, the "mainstream media" have lost all credibility, just like the Washington Post and the New York Times. Over there, normal people are sick and tired – and scared – of the pile of lies they have to listen to every day. They no longer believe a word of it.
Before Trump was elected, European conservatives were forbidden to speak out, accused of Nazism or racism. Today, they are finding their true voices.
Democratic conservatism has gone international – not as a centralized ideology, but as a commonsense revolt by ordinary people for their ordinary freedoms. Patriotism is coming back over there as well, and no, that doesn't mean a return to the Kaiser's militarism in Germany, or Napoleonic grandeur in France. It means a return to normalcy.
When Euro-conservatives give speeches, Donald Trump gets tremendous applause. Trump's victory in the U.S. has given courage to tens of millions of Europeans, who have been afraid to speak out. Some have been jailed, and all have been smeared in the public media. But they are not going to take it anymore.
You'll never, ever read this in the New York Times. Or in the WaPo. Or in the highly concentrated "news" cartel that controls what most Americans hear.
Marxo-jihadist globalism is always the same, here and there. And just like here, ordinary people are outraged and ready to take to the streets. They are not fascists, and they are certainly not Nazis. They are not totalitarians of any kind at all. They are true democrats with a small d.
Ordinary, healthy patriotism is in. Sensible talk is in. Crazy fascism can be heard coming only from the totalitarian left, just as in our country.
The treacherous establishments in Europe are closely allied to the corrupting forces of jihad and the Soros left. Young, empty-headed kids are being indoctrinated there, just as they are here. Trained ruckus-makers in black masks are taking the side of jihad over there, just as here.
Everyday Europeans are very scared, because their governments no longer protect them from thugs and rapists. Women are afraid to show their blond hair (or any other color hair, for that matter).
The same fascist smear tactics we see in Berkeley today are being used in Europe. And no wonder: The sources of political poison are the same left-jihadist Axis of Evil we see in this country. These are people who have been told by Alinsky types like Obama and Hillary that the American middle class is "the enemy." And today, when they run the Organs of Propaganda, they are persuading airheads on colleges around the country that their parents and grandparents, normal Americans, are indeed their enemy.
Obama is an expert Alinsky ruckus-maker. The term "community organizer" used to be called "Communist agitator," when Communists were not afraid to be labeled accurately, and agitation-propaganda is exactly what they do. The anti-Trump riots are organized by neo-Stalinists, who have never given up their quest for total power. They are not subtle about it.
The U.S. media are now completely corrupt, united in their goal of destroying Donald Trump. The Euro-media are exactly the same. But normal people don't speak in a single voice. They speak in many voices. Democracy is unpredictable, and power cults around the world are starting to finally see it.
Amanda Berry was screaming into the fresh air, trying to claw her way out of the confines of 2207 Seymour Avenue. It was May 6 and countless lives were about to be irrevocably altered.
Charles Ramsey heard her screaming for help. Charles Ramsey happened to be in the right place at the right time - a point of fate that strung together 10 years of mystery and pain and hope.
Cleveland police began making their way toward the otherwise quiet thoroughfare that shoots off of West 25th Street, just a stone's throw from I-90. The wreck of a home stood tall in the late afternoon light, almost bracing for the grand reveal of all the secrets waiting within. Soon enough, two other women emerged from the home, and internationally breaking news began spreading a message of joy around the world. Three long-missing women had been found. Alive. Relatively healthy and coherent.
Ariel Castro, 52, and his brothers Pedro and Onil were arrested following the rescue of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. (May 8 Update: Ariel was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape - all first-degree felonies. Pedro and Onil were not charged with anything.) Ariel owned the Seymour Avenue home where the women had been kept. Police sources paint a grim picture of chains, restraints, locked doors, and rape.
“Those guys were walking out of the house with 1,000-yard stares,” said one source.
The details surrounding who knew what in the neighborhood and within the Castro family remain murky at best. But the investigation is plowing on this week, thanks to bravery from unsuspecting corners.
For Amanda's actions and Charles's quick assistance, both are lauded as heroes in the community.
But it's unclear whether their rescue needed to wait so long. Leads came and went during the past decade.
Israel Lugo, a neighbor, told MSNBC that he summoned cops in 2011 after “his sister spotted a woman with a baby in the home, banging on the window ‘like she wants to get out.'”
"The cops came,” he said. “They pounded on that man's door around 15, 20 times, real hard. They looked in the driveway, they got back in the squad car and left."
“Every single lead was followed up no matter how small,” Cleveland police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said during a press conference.
But lingering loose ends remain as law enforcement officials, family members, neighbors and investigators work to meld the disparate pieces of this puzzle.

Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, as sources put it, were close with the Castro family. Emily and Arlene Castro were similar in age to the girls, and they often hung out in the neighborhood.
“These kids all knew each other,” private investigator Chris Giannini says. During and after the girls' disappearances, in 2004, he employed a man named Fernando Colon - Ariel Castro's ex-wife's husband - as a security site supervisor at a local shopping center and got to know the inner workings of the family fairly well.
Colon had fallen under the suspicions of the FBI during their investigation into DeJesus's whereabouts. By way of marriage, he was somewhat close to the Castro family, and his step-daughters certainly ran in the same circles at the missing teenager. Colon was soon brought in for questioning regarding the disappearances.
But he was cleared following a polygraph test. The man in turn insisted that FBI agents look into Ariel Castro, a man who seemed to attract tumult and disorder throughout his adult life.
“They did not follow up on that,” Giannini says. The Cleveland Division of the FBI offered no comment on the matter when contacted by Scene.
It was 2004, still within the first year of DeJesus's disappearance. She, along with Berry and Knight, were still regular fixtures in local conversation. Within the Castro family, however, turmoil was bubbling. As Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight grew up painfully inside Ariel Castro's home, he was fighting to keep the eye of the law far away.
Emily and Arlene Castro, teenagers themselves, did not live with their father. Their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, had married Colon and brought her daughters to live with them over on West 110th Street. Allegations of sexual molestation against Colon soon threatened the stability of the household. Law enforcement once again zeroed in on Fernando Colon, all while Ariel Castro egged them onward. As his daughters continued to accuse Colon of touching them inappropriately - of penetrating them - Ariel Castro began visiting them more frequently and showering them uncharacteristically with gifts. They didn't spend much time at Castro's Seymour Avenue house, though. He ensured that much.
The Castro girls' mother did not believe their mostly frantic allegations. Nor did their older brother, Ariel “Anthony” Castro. Nonetheless, Colon was indicted in late 2004 on 27 criminal charges, including kidnapping and gross sexual imposition, and later offered a light sentence that he couldn't realistically appeal. Ariel Castro had testified against him in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. His wife and Castro's son had testified on his behalf, hoping to clear Colon's name in this increasing confusing tangle of allegations. Colon's wife repeatedly told investigators that there was no credence to any of the charges.
This personal history is resurfacing following the arrest of Ariel and his brothers, mostly because it paints one of the few concrete images of life within the family. Ariel Castro had free range of the Seymour Avenue house — his son told the Daily Mail that his father kept the basement, garage, and attic locked and off-limits — and keeping his three kidnapped victims quietly within became a simple task.

"Words can't even explain," Tasheena Mitchell, Berry's cousin, told Scene as she gathered with hundreds of neighbors and family members outside MetroHealth Medical Center Monday night. She was nearly shaking at times.
"I feel blessed. I'm ecstatic,” she said, adding that there was never a day where she gave up hope on finding her cousin. "I think about her everyday."
A neighbor chimed in: "Prayers do come true. It's surreal."
The three women were released from the hospital in good condition Tuesday morning. Unconfirmed reports from family members at the scene, which police and doctors had not publicly commented on as of press time, noted that at least one and possibly as many as five babies were born during the women's captivity. A six-year-old child left the house with Berry as police arrived.
Speculation on the condition of the Seymour Avenue home abounded in the hours and days following the rescue. By any standards, the relative health and coherence of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight was a miraculous turn of events.
"This isn't the ending we usually get to these stories," Dr. Gerald Maloney, who works in the Emergency Room at MetroHealth, said.
Family members and friends spent the day and the night - every waking hour - rejoicing. It was the best of all possible family reunions, save for the void left by Berry's mother's death in 2006.
Louwana Miller, bereft of her daughter and any semblance of meaningful information about her disappearance, died of a broken heart, friends and family have said. She spoke with Scene in 2003, seven months after Berry disappeared. Already at that point, Miller openly feared, the city had given up on her.
"Me and her was very close," Miller said. "She always called when she was going someplace." She was last seen a day before her 17th birthday as she left for a shift at Burger King on West 110th and Lorain. Miller acknowledged that much of Cleveland bent over backward in the weeks following the disappearance, working to maintain awareness and follow up on any possible light. But news cycles demand change, and Miller was soon lamenting the loss of her daughter to few outside of her immediate social circle.
She offered stirring words in 2003, complete with the silver lining that truly never escaped her:
“One good thing is that they haven't found her body.”
Family members, of course, wished openly that Miller could be here now.

Ariel Castro spent much of the past decade working as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. According to police, his most notable interaction with the law occurred when he left a child on a bus in 2004, resulting in a call from Cuyahoga County Children and Family Services. “He was interviewed extensively,” Tomba said.
Castro would eventually be fired in November 2012 after leaving a child on his bus.
Public Safety Director Martin Flask said at the same press conference Tuesday morning that Children and Family Services were not able to make contact with Ariel after visiting his home. It's unclear what developments really followed the report of a child being left on the bus, but no charges were ever brought about in that case.
Once again, Tomba's words at the Tuesday morning press conference hang in the air: “Every single lead was followed up no matter how small,” he said. Unavoidable thoughts hearkening back to Anthony Sowell's 2011 serial murder convictions hang in the air, as well. The rescue at the Seymour Avenue house will bear out a legacy on the backs of all involved, much like Cleveland's other high-profile crimes.
Stories revolving around Castro's work as a bus driver and his interactions with family members fill out characteristics about the man - elements of his personality that may have led to both the kidnapping and to his evasion from law enforcement.
In 1993 and 2005, Castro was accused of domestic violence from his one-time wife. The former charges were reduced to mere disorderly conduct, while the latter incident offered grisly imagery of a fractured marriage still capable of wreaking havoc. Castro broke his ex-wife's nose and ribs, dislocated her shoulders, knocked out one of her teeth and battered her so hard that a blood clot formed on her brain, according to filings in court. In an interview with investigators after the fact, Castro denied ever being abusive toward her.
That filing effectively killed Castro's chances at even partial custody of his children. Nevertheless, as sources familiar with the man report, his penchant for manipulation pulled Emily and Arlene back into his gravitational pull at times.
Several years after the gross sexual imposition conviction of Colon blew over, Emily Castro gave birth to a girl. It's unclear who the father was - though speculation points to either a former boyfriend who now lives in Cleveland or, according to the private investigator, something much more untoward, evil, and incestuous.
Emily was living in Fort Wayne, Ind., where she attempted to murder her 11-month-old daughter by slashing her throat four times in 2007. She was later convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison.
“It is certainly a mystery as to how this happened or why this happened,” Allen Superior Court Judge John Surbeck told The Journal Gazette at the time.
It is indeed a mystery that may yet hold more clues as to who Ariel Castro has been all these years. Any answers that lay within may illuminate a gap in local law enforcement's own investigations.
***
The Regional Fusion Center and the Cleveland Police Department currently maintain a list of 96 missing persons in the area. Some of them have been missing since the mid-2000s. One was last seen in 1995.
Each person carries with them a story, a life.
Women like Ashley Summers and Christina Adkins have garnered attention in the region, thanks to widespread reporting and an insistent base of family and friends that maintains the vigil.
Summers was last seen at her West 96th Street home, near Madison Avenue, in July 2007. The FBI has not come close to solving the mystery of Summers' whereabouts, though various reports indicate the possibility that she has been held against her will and that foul play has not been an immediate suspicion in her case. The FBI had tied the investigation into Summers' disappearance into those of Berry and DeJesus as recently as 2009, though the department never explained why.
It took about 10 years for three of the most prominent names on the city's list of missing persons to come off that roster and back into some semblance of normalcy. Ten years for three names.

WEWS posted an interview Monday night with Charles Ramsey, the neighbor who found Berry as she was running out of the house. In the hours following the rescue, that interview went about as viral as it could go, hitting all corners of the Internet and bestowing upon Ramsey a heroic bit of worldwide fandom. “I heard screaming…And I see this girl going nuts trying to get outside,” he said. “I go on the porch and she said, ‘Help me get out. I've been here a long time.'"
He had been working over a meal from a nearby McDonald's just moments before - a fact that figured prominently in the Internet's collective gushing. The fast food corporation reached out on Tuesday, writing: “Way to go Charles Ramsey- we'll be in touch.”
Ramsey stepped into local history Monday night, precisely as the names Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight re-entered local conversation with fervor and optimism.
All of their actions, which won out over the evil brewing on Seymour Avenue this past decade, are a testament to the power of will in this community and to the need for hope in the face of darkness. This matter of profound significance was not ushered in by way of police investigations or federal law enforcement insight. Three long-missing women are safe and out of harm's way today solely due to the faith they fostered and the bravery they summoned.
Going forward, the weight of unanswered questions is countered only by the overwhelming joy resounding through Cleveland and the rest of the world.
India Lok Sabha Elections 2014 is now at its climax, as the counting of votes has begun and the fate of the next government would be sealed has been sealed before the day ends.
But looking back at the phase when our politicians were trying out every trick in the book to lure voters, we find that this election has been quite controversial, with high-decibel statements being lashed out without even thinking for a second what their implications can be.
Here, we have compiled some of the most controversial statements and words uttered by politicians, which were condemned and criticized all over:
Sharad Pawar:
During a rally in Mumbai on March 23, 2014, Sharad Pawar actually encouraged people to vote twice, which is not only illegal but punishable by law as well. His exact statement: “Last time [in 2009], polling in Satara and Mumbai was on the same day and people went to their hometowns. But this time polling in Satara is on April 17 and here [Mumbai / Navi Mumbai] on April 24. Vote for the clock [NCP's symbol] there and come back to vote for the clock here as well”
Election commission issued notice to Sharad Pawar for making such ridiculous suggestion.
Beni Prasad Verma
On April 2, Beni Prasad Verma from Congress passed a statement: “People from RSS and BJP killed Gandhiji. Modi is BJP's biggest goon..”
Election commission took note of this strong statement and issued notice to him.
Azam Khan
On April 9, Azam Khan from Samajwadi Party said in Ghaziabad: “Kargil ki pahadiyon ko fateh karne wale Hindu sainik nahin balki Musalmaan they. (Muslim soldiers conquered the hills of Kargil)”
This statement inciting communal hatred was not taken down lightly by the media and leaders of every political party except SP lashed out against Azam Khan. Eventually Election Commission had to intervene and he was barred from holding public meetings or road shows. An FIR was also lodged against him.
Mulayam Singh Yadav
Mulayam Singh Yadav is a three time CM of UP, having a rich political experience. But on the issue of rape, he too issued a very ridiculous statement: “Ladkon se aisi galtiyan ho jati hain, to iska matlab yeh to nahi ki unhe phaansi de di jaaye (Boys make mistakes, but this doesn't mean you hang them).”
Sadly, our law cant do anything for those who makes such statements.
Mamata Bannerjee
On April 7, Mamta said, “I challenge EC. I wont remove a single SP… Who is EC? They are working under Congress and BJP.”
The issue propped up after Election Commission transferred few West Bengal officials on complains that they helped rigging the polls by encouraging booth capturing. EC took strong position and threatened to cancel West Bengal polls. After this threat, Mamata backed off.
Imran Masood
Imran Masood from Congress issued a statement on March 28, 2014: “I am a man of the street, ready to give my life for my people. I am neither afraid of death nor of killing….He thinks this is Gujarat. There are only 4% Muslims in Gujarat. There are 42% Muslims here. If he tries to convert this into Gujarat, then we will chop him”
Election Commission filed a FIR, resulting which he was arrested and sent to jail for 14 days.
Abu Azmi
On April 11, 2014, Abu Azmi from Samajwadi Party issued a ridiculous statement on rape: “Any woman if, whether married or unmarried, goes along with a man, with or without her consent, should be hanged. Both should be hanged. It shouldn't be allowed even if a woman goes by consent.”
It actually shows the mentality and thought process of such ‘leader'. His daughter-in-law Ayesha Takia had to come to Twitter and apologize for this statement.
Amit Shah
Amit Shah from BJP was the main campaigning person for Narendra Modi, as he spearheaded his campaign planning across whole India, especially Uttar Pradesh. He issued a controversial statement on April 4: “This election is about voting out the government that protects and gives compensation to those who killed Jats.. It is about badla (revenge) and protecting izzat (honour).”
Election Commission took strong note of this statement, and FIR was filed against him. He was promptly banned from holding public rallies in UP.

Robin Givhan, The Washington Post's Pulitzer-winning fashion critic, is covering New York Fashion Week. Follow along as she makes her way from runway to runway. Read her stories on Style Blog and follow her on Twitter: @robingivhan.
NEW YORK — At half past the appointed hour for the unveiling of Kanye West's collaboration with Adidas Original, the crowd of non-celebrity guests was still standing in a cramped hallway in a downtown warehouse along West Street waiting for the doors to open. It was the kind of dawdling that puts a fashion audience in a bad mood as they envision their tightly choreographed schedules of back-to-back appointments collapse.
The organizers of the Perry Ellis show — in the unfortunate position of having to follow a superstar musician and sensing that he might keep to his own Yeezy clock — had dispatched mini-buses to whisk guests uptown to the brand's more sedate venue. They sat on the street idling.
People expected hubris from West. And he did not disappoint. Indeed, when guests were finally seated and various Kardashians, including wife Kim, were settled in alongside Rihanna and Russell Simmons, Jay-Z, Beyonce, Diddy and more, West rattled off a manifesto of sorts in introducing the collection.

[Robin Givhan at New York Fashion Week: day one]
“People just write negative things,” West began. They ask: “Why's he still trying?”
And then he answered that rhetorical question: “I want to create something better for you,” he declared. “We have been limited. There's a lack of creativity in every field because people are afraid.” West promised to jar the eyes with a fashion revelation and delight the ear with a sonic explosion.
[NYFW: The meaning of dirty hair on the fashion runway]
Fear no more, dear bored and deprived shoppers. Yeezy Season 1 has dawned. It is a collection of men's and women's athletic-leisure wear and footwear that was created in a mostly sobering, muddy palette that called to mind a dystopian world. The men's clothes were far more interesting than the women's because they did not rely on beige body stockings that at times made the female models look like nearly naked Barbie dolls. The men mostly wore oversized, deconstructed sweaters, sweatshirts and sweatpants and the occasional pullover jacket. Everything was juiced up with styling tricks such as stocking caps, moody lighting and choreography that had the models lined up and advancing towards the bank of photographers like an army of cyborgs. Each row stepped forward to the imploring wail of a single musical note. And then, they moved en masse for a final pass to dire-sounding, bone-rattling bass.
[NYFW: Why are designers afraid of women's sex appeal?]
Yeezy Season 1
The collection had a decidedly urban, gritty edge to it and the colors were sophisticated. The ankle-high boot/sneaker hybrids were not nearly as interesting as the quilted t-shirts and multi-layered sweats. The collection had a point of view and a definitive attitude. But as a whole, it did not fill fashion's creativity void — something that does, in fact, exist — which West so ham-handedly described and so brazenly implied he would correct.
[Robin Givhan, NYFW Day 3: School girls and business ladies in space]
The fashion industry is struggling to move forward and find new ways of dressing, more diverse definitions of femininity and masculinity, a renewed energy for experimentation. Menswear is answering these questions and solving these riddles more successfully than the women's side of the business. West should know that. Design houses such as Public School have made a career out of pushing those boundaries.
[ When Street Meets Suit: Public School]
But there are also those big commercial entities, such as Perry Ellis and Hickey Freeman, that are having a challenging time fighting paralysis — fearful that experimentation could disrupt a lucrative set of licensing deals or antagonize a reliable customer.

But West was wrong in his generalization that fashion struggles to find a creative spirit out of fear. It's simply a hard puzzle for for fashion to work out. It is incredibly difficult to bring a new point of view to the runway and ultimately to store racks and the closets of consumers. Designing is a matter of aesthetics, engineering, personality and magic. A designer's creativity has to be worn. It has to carry a man through the day, helping him to navigate his work life. It has to bring him comfort during his downtime.
West offered a satisfactory version of a current movement in menswear — the elevation of athletic wear into something that can move confidently beyond the gym or the basketball court. But he didn't offer a new way of thinking about sportswear. He didn't challenge the gender divide. He didn't dazzle the eye.
[How Designer Shayne Oliver Won Over Kanye West – And the Fashion World]
But just because he did not succeed at the lofty goals he set for himself, just because some elements of his collection failed, that doesn't mean he should stop trying. Every attempt is an education.
Newer labels may possess a certain loud bravado and swagger, but older ones — those that often take a more considered and cautious approach to a collection and its customers — can quietly up-end the status quo.

There's arguably no more of an established menswear brand in New York than Ralph Lauren. For fall 2015, his luxury Purple Label engages in quiet experimentation that speaks powerfully to the ways in which menswear is changing. Notably, the brand has incorporated more functional athletic wear into this rarified arm of the Ralph Lauren empire. A matte leather puffer jacket — the epitome of a workhorse garment made over into a refined piece of outerwear fit for a dinner out at a formal restaurant. Ralph Lauren even tries to broaden the category of men's black tie offerings by adding formal “coveralls” to the mix, inspired by historical photographs of Winston Churchill. They are beautifully made, pleated and belted. They look foreign and fey and curious. But they are undeniably elegant.

Steven Cox and Daniel Silver of Duckie Brown decided that stripping away excess ideas, barriers and crutches was the best way to push their creativity forward. They removed the wall separating the backstage area from the audience. The designers surrendered their mystery — that sense that they are a couple of wizards of Oz hiding behind a curtain manipulating us all.
It wasn't just an opportunity for the guests to watch what typically unfolds in the shadows; it was also a chance for the designers to watch their audience. To see the faint smiles, the whispering and Instagramming. To connect.
The clothes were spare: draped trousers in black, silk shirts and chiffon ones in white and taupe and even a dusty rose. Coats and jackets lost their lapels. Everything was crafted with an eye towards intimacy and honesty. And in a world where everyone wears a game face — fully made-up and camera ready, 24 hours a day — anything that even nudges towards unscripted and real is a kind of bravery.
There have been menswear labels such as J. Lindeberg and Chapter that have found inspiration in science fiction, space exploration and a fascination with the unknown. J. Lindeberg's Jessy Heuvelink describes his patterns as referencing the surface of Mars and fabrics' whose textures called to mind a similar aesthetic. His collection of men's sportswear is all shadowy shades, tight British tailoring and bursts of metallic silver. He sees fashion as a kind of second skin, a personal environment that protects, inspires and defines us.
And Devin Carlson, creative director of Chapter, showed his California-based brand in New York for the first time Wednesday evening. He was captivated by the fading away of NASA funding, the mystery of science fiction and the world of punk rockers. Many of the asymmetrical elements in his clothes, he says, come from astronaut uniforms, which were designed for function and with little regard to aesthetics. Pockets and closures were simply placed where they needed to be.
Chapter Fall 2015: “Unknown” inspired by astronauts and punks
Chapter fall 2015 “Unknown”
The common thread with these designers is an attention to logic and practicality and the way both are essential to the definition of luxury. That hybrid is what menswear should be. (And womenswear too, for that matter.) At Ralph Lauren, younger men — both in the U.S. and in Europe — are drawn to the brand's Purple Label in part because it has streamlined its silhouettes to better connect with contemporary tastes, but without forgoing the kind of old world practicality around which the brand has built an entire world. Being willing to focus, staying true to a niche that invigorates some and rebuffs others is a kind of creative risk.
Alan Eckstein, one of the partners in Timo Weiland, noted that it makes no sense for his brand to “to make an oxford shirt. Uniqlo makes a great oxford for $29.99.” Timo Weiland is more interested in the eccentric crewneck . Todd Snyder offers up his take on sweatpants, which are cut narrow so that their silhouette is tidy and even a bit tailored. He makes cargo pants out of jersey — merging two of menswears most stalwart standbys into something that is not purely military inspired and not just for a gym rat.
There is no fear here. These designers are willing to be creative. But they're doing it the hard way. They're attempting to be innovative within a limited framework: the daily construct of the average (well-to-do) man's life.
Rihanna, left, with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West
Yes, West was right. Creativity is hard to come by in the fashion industry — perhaps harder than in almost any other creative field. Because when something daring and mesmerizing bubbles up in fashion, it can't just be framed and hung on a wall, it isn't just the soundtrack to your life; it is the coccoon in which you live, it's your calling card. Fear isn't the hurdle facing fashion. The human body is.

While it is easy to focus on many other strong points of KDE software, one aspect that deserves a closer look is the ability for it to support science. Back in July, you may have caught the Dot story on "KDE-Science" discussing the background and initial call for engaging the scientific community. Today we would like to highlight some of the advances that have occurred since then and present a real world example of how KDE software is already helping to support research.
KDE and Science
Since the publication of that first article, several practical steps have been taken. Our first follow-up article, an interview with RKWard developer Thomas Friedrichsmeier was published just last week. There has been a new forum established for discussing specific KDE applications for science, the use of KDE Workspaces for science, and promotion of KDE software and our community among scientists. There has also been a revival of the KDE-science mailing list. If you have interests in these subjects, please consider joining the conversations.
KDE Software in the Lab
While it may seem our efforts are just getting (re)started, there are already users in the scientific community who are leveraging KDE Workspaces in their daily research. Below is an interview that highlights one example of how KDE software has already found its way into the lab. Anthony Kolasny is an IT Architect at the Center for Imaging Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Maryland, USA.
Justin: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us Anthony. So what is it exactly that you do as an IT architect at JHU?
Anthony: Essentially, my job is to help provide a stable hardware and software environment so that users can be most productive. I also help manage the various research projects to ensure that milestones and goals stay on target.
Justin: Would you tell us a little more about your lab and what kind of work your team does?
Staff at JHU's Center for Imaging Science Staff at JHU's Center for Imaging Science
Anthony: The Center for Imaging Science is part of the Department of Biomedical Engineering under the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Centers at the University are solely research driven. They do not have teaching responsibilities.
Our major focus is exploring various aspects of medical imaging. We use the term "Computational Anatomy" for this field of study. It includes developing algorithms in order to register, segment and quantify shape within anatomical structures. This provides the basis for statistical analysis within populations. (Reference: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309089)
Justin: How is your team currently using KDE software?
Anthony: Much of our code development involves the algorithmic development of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) and GUI plugin development using Paraview. Programmers mainly use C++ with common utilities and libraries like CMake, the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) and Insight Toolkit (ITK). KDevelop is a natural environment to do this development.
Justin: How was the decision made to adopt KDE software in your workplace? Were there any significant challenges in doing so?
Anthony: It was a gradual evolution in our environment. Around 2000, our lab was dominated by RedHat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows on the desktop. Desktops and servers migrated to CentOS. Later, users requested Ubuntu due to the need for more current applications in order to support their research. We had some minor annoyances with users switching between GNOME on CentOS and Ubuntu machines. Kubuntu and KDE resolved the issues. Users became accustomed to this environment and started exploring its features. KDevelop has been a useful tool. The KDE workspace best met the needs of the users.
Justin: What are the major advantages to using KDE software in your office?
Anthony: Users enjoy the KDE software environment. They like the rich collection of applications. I ensure a common core of non-standard applications on all desktops, which provides consistency and familiarity within our environment.
Justin: What does your team like about KDevelop that gave it an edge over other options that were available?
Plasma Desktop, KDevelop and Konsole at JHU Plasma Desktop, KDevelop and Konsole at JHU
Anthony: The majority of software that we utilize is open source. It's natural to use open source development tools as well. KDevelop provides good functionality for our needs and has dedicated developers who are constantly improving the product. The integration with CMake is very useful for our Paraview development.
The advantage of free development tools is that as our development team expands or we interact with other groups, the development environment does not incur large costs in order to collaborate. We try to avoid expensive development tools.
However, not all of our development is done with free and open source software. For computationally intense algorithms, we utilize Intel compilers and Math Kernel Library (MKL), which allows for more highly optimized code on multicore systems. Our lab tries to be practical in the development of quality code that takes advantage of high-end hardware.
Justin: Has your group committed any code upstream? If not, do you expect that you might in the future?
Anthony: We have committed code to Paraview and ITK. As our applications mature, we foresee greater use of Qt development. If KDE tools assist in that development, they will be utilized. I see our group pursuing Qt Webkit development in order to glue together the web service of our medical imaging database and the visualization tool based on Paraview.
Justin: Ok, and one last question. What would you advise aspiring developers interested in science, or more specifically imaging, about meaningful projects to pursue? Is there some major gap in existing software that you wish someone would fill?
Anthony: Pursue your interests. There is plenty of research to explore. A simple email to a research group may be all that is needed. We have sponsored several students from around the country to participate in summer projects. Some were paid while others came to learn and to see if this would be a desired career path. These summer projects may develop into research grant proposals which may lead to useful applications that one day may turn into companies. Good ideas usually start with an interesting problem and a desire to solve it. If anyone is interested in extending Paraview for medical imaging applications next summer, send me an email.

ONI KOJI vjeroučiteljima u hrvatskim školama osporavaju pravo na povlašteni status su "netolerantni, neosjetljivi, drski i nekulturni", piše u Glasu Koncila od 18. svibnja Valentina Blaženka Mandarić, časna sestra i voditeljica Ureda za vjeronauk u školi Zagrebačke nadbiskupije.
Sva četiri citirana epiteta upućena su zapravo ovdje potpisanom novinaru, s obzirom da je Mandarić tekst u Glasu Koncila objavila kao "osvrt na uvrede iznesene na račun hrvatskih vjeroučitelja", odnosno na dva teksta koja su krajem travnja i početkom svibnja na Indexu objavljena pod naslovima "Paraziti hrvatskog školstva: Vjeroučitelje skupo plaćamo, a nitko im ništa ne može" i "Sustav po mjeri parazita: Vjeroučitelji napreduju tri puta brže od ostalih učitelja u školama".
Parazit je, u medicinskoj terminologiji, organizam koji živi na račun drugog organizma (a često je i prijenosnik bolesti). Paraziti svoje domaćine koriste kao hranu, uglavnom su mnogo manji od svojih nositelja, ali se znatno brže množe. Ne rade paraziti na štetu svog domaćina zbog urođene im zloće, već zbog toga što imaju biološki imperativ - drugačije ne mogu preživjeti.
U ovakvom opisu vjeroučitelja, a posredno i crkvene institucije kojoj i sama pripada, Mandarić je prepoznala "omalovažavanje, ponižavanje, govor mržnje i netolerancije". Štoviše, Mandarić smatra da su vjeroučitelji poslužili kao "ispušni ventil za vrijeđanje" ljudima (u ovom slučaju potpisanom autoru) koji se u javnosti lažno predstavljaju "kao veliki zagovornici demokracije i promicatelji ljudskih prava".
Odgovarajući na floskule koje je Mandarić objavila u notornom glasilu Kaptola vrlo bi se se jednostavno bilo poslužiti retorikom za koju se i ona sama odlučila: zgražanjem, moraliziranjem i vrijeđanjem. No, umjesto toga bolje je još jednom podsjetiti na činjenice.
"Građani drugog reda" su svi nastavnici osim vjeroučitelja
U hrvatskim školama ima 3001 vjeroučitelja. Godišnje se iz proračuna za njihove plaće izdvaja oko 300 milijuna kuna. No, vjeroučitelji su zaposlenici države samo na papiru. U praksi, vjeroučitelje na dužnost postavlja i dužnosti razrješava katolička crkva. Takvi vjeroučitelji, koji zarađuju državnu plaću, ali državi ne moraju polagati račune, u hrvatskim školama mogu biti i ravnatelji. U kojem slučaju dolazi do nakaradne situacije u kojem rukovodeći školski kadar odlučuje o upravljanju državnim novcem, ali istovremeno vrhovni autoritet kojem takav vjeroučitelj-ravnatelj odgovara ne sjedi u Ministarstvu obrazovanja već u palači od oniksa Hrvatske biskupske konferencije. O povlaštenom statusu vjeroučitelja naspram ostalih prosvjetara svjedoči i pravilnik kojeg je Tuđmanov HDZ donio u zadnjim danima svoje diktature, u prosincu 1999. godine. Tim pravilnikom je određeno da vjeroučitelji zvanje mentora stječu nakon dvije godine radnog iskustva, a zvanje savjetnika nakon tri godine radnog iskustva. Ostali nastavnici mentori mogu postati nakon šest godina rada, a savjetnici tek s 11 godina radnog iskustva.
Ovo su činjenice o vrlo stvarnom problemu sustava hrvatskog školstva. U njihovom svijetlu posebno apsurdnim čini se naslov pod kojim Mandarić u Glasu Koncila elaborira svoje nezadovoljstvo. Svoj uradak Mandarić je nazvala "Zar ponovo građani drugog reda?!".
Pritom Mandarić pogrešno smatra da su građani drugog reda u ovom slučaju vjeroučitelji i vjernici koji su, eto, opet izloženi komunističkom progonu. Ne, ovo nažalost nije slikovito pretjerivanje. To je doslovno ono što je Mandarić napisala:
"Kao djetetu moji roditelji, ali i drugi znanci, pričali su mi o 'prošlim vremenima', u kojima su zbog vjere i nacionalnosti bili šikanirani, deklasirani i svrstavani u građane drugog reda... Naši razgovori o 'takvim temama' i 'starim vremenima' redovito su završavali riječima: Hvala Bogu, to je sada iza nas. No čini mi se da su to ipak bila moja naivna nadanja", razotkriva Mandarić cr(k)venu opasnost koju je prepoznala u Indexu.
Ovakva logička falinga bila bi redikulozna da se ne radi o perfidnoj manipulaciji. Mandarić nas, dakle, uvjerava da se vjeroučitelji nalaze u podređenom položaju, iako su im omogućena prava o kojima ostali nastavnici i stručni suradnici u školama mogu samo sanjati. Koji su, da se poslužimo izrazom časne sestre Mandarić, u usporedbi s vjeroučiteljima "građani drugog reda".
I djeca u drugom redu
U istom tom drugom redu nalaze se, ni kriva ni dužna, djeca koja ne dolaze iz katoličkih obitelji. Koja u osnovnim školama, ukoliko ne pohađaju vjeronauk, vrlo često bez nadzora moraju lutati hodnicima jer alternativne aktivnosti za njih nisu osigurane. Nisu li i ta djeca, da se još jednom poslužimo izrazom časne sestre Mandarić, "zbog vjere i nacionalnosti šikanirani, deklasirani i svrstavani u građane drugog reda"?
Nisu li građani drugog reda i oni roditelji koji djecu na vjeronauk moraju slati ne zbog svojih katoličkih uvjerenja, već zbog toga što ne žele da im djeca ostaju sama na školskom hodniku dok njihovi razredni kolege pohađaju nastavu vjeronauka? Ili još gore, zbog toga što strahuju da će im djeca biti na meti bullyinga zato što nisu dio stada?
Nisu li građani drugog reda i srednjoškolci koji su u pojedinim školama de facto ucijenjeni da pohađaju nastavu vjeronauka tako da, ako žele slušati nastavu etike, moraju u školu dolaziti na predsat ili ostajati nakon nastave na dodatnom satu? Dok im istovremeno vjeronauk, kojeg ne pohađaju, ostavlja rupu u trajanju od 45 minuta točno u sredini nastavne satnice.
Poluinformacije? Ne, otvorene laži
Nedosljednost Mandarić pokazuje i kada u jednom dahu hrvatske katolike svrstava u poziciju žrtve, dok već u idućem na papir stavlja tvrdnju da 80 do 90 posto roditelja, dakle ogromna većina, žele da njihova djeca pohađaju vjeronauk. Nije to doduše "kvaka 22" s kojom na kraj ne može izaći jedino Mandarić; čitava katolička crkva u Hrvata zadnjih 14 godina (od 3. siječnja 2000. naovamo) neuspješno pokušava pomiriti pozicije dominantne većine i zlostavljane manjine koju se zbog svoje vjere pribija na metaforički križ.
Upravo to nastoji učiniti i Mandarić tekstom kojeg je složila za Glas Koncila. Slijedi citat: "Navedeni tekstovi (objavljeni na Indexu op.a.) nisu govor demokracije, već nasilje, vrijeđanje i diskriminacija u pravom smislu riječi. Iščitavajući spomenute napise, lako je zaključiti da se namjerno lansiraju poluistine i poluinformacije kako bi se našlo opravdanje za omalovažavanje i vrijeđanje vjeroučitelja".
Tekst se nastavlja ispod oglasa
Najlakše bi sada bilo uloviti se za prvu citiranu rečenicu pa na optužbe za "vrijeđanje, nasilje i diskriminaciju" odgovoriti podsjetnikom na ono što katolički svećenici izgovaraju na redovitim misama za Antu Pavelića ili obljetnicama osnivanja HOS-ove bojne koja nosi ime koljača Rafaela Bobana. No, devalviranje ozbiljnih tema na rasprave o "crvenima" i "crnima" ipak ćemo ostaviti crkvi.
Radije ćemo se pozabaviti činjenicom da nas za plasiranje "poluistina i poluinformacija" optužuje žena koja otvoreno laže. Sve informacije koje su prezentirane u dva sporna Indexova teksta dolaze uz pozivanje na relevantne izvore - na Ministarstvo obrazovanja i na važeće zakone i propise koji se tiču hrvatskog školstva.
Mandarić optužuje Index za širenje dezinformacija, ali istovremeno ne objašnjava o kakvim se točno dezinformacijama radi, niti nudi argumente u prilog svojoj tezi. U svom tekstu Mandarić ističe tek da "vjeroučitelji prolaze istu proceduru koju prolaze ostali predmetni nastavnici", uz tu razliku što "vjeroučitelji uz pravilnikom propisane uvjete prilažu i preporuku nadležne crkvene institucije za vjeronauk".
Što je točno, ali - samo kada se radi o polaganju stručnog ispita, odnosno uopće stjecanja uvjeta za držanje nastave u školama. Činjenicu da vjeroučitelji mogu napredovati brže i lakše nego ostali nastavnici Mandarić niti ne pokušava demantirati, jer bi u tom slučaju morala demantirati važeći Pravilnik o napredovanju učitelja i nastavnika u osnovnom i srednjem školstvu. Ovaj pravilnik Mandarić niti ne spominje, a razlozi su i više nego jasni; nije luda da polemizira s legislaturom koja očigledno favorizira vjeroučitelje naspram ostalog nastavnog osoblja. Pa se stoga radije koristi jeftinim spinom, nudeći neke druge činjenice o nekoj drugoj temi, koja uopće nije bila predmetom Indexovih napisa.
U sukobu sama sa sobom
U zaključku svog teksta Mandarić nudi još jednu poluinformaciju i dvije floskule. Najprije, pozivajući se na čitav niz dokumenata europskih institucija, tvrdi da je vjeronauk u školama univerzalna vrednota zemalja Europske unije. Pritom naravno ne navodi da neke razvijene zemlje poput Francuske i Slovenije u svojim školama niti imaju, niti žele vjeronauk. U nekim drugim zemljama poput recimo Engleske, Švedske, Norveške, Nizozemske ili Grčke u školama se uče povijest religija (obratite pozornost na množinu - religija) ili religijska kultura.
Pritom, naravno, ne treba bježati od činjenice da mnoge zemlje EU, među kojima je i Njemačka, u školama imaju konfesionalni vjeronauk po vrlo sličnom modelu kakav postoji u Hrvatskoj. Druge su zemlje, doduše, uglavnom dobile priliku da same o tome donesu odluku, dok su Hrvatskoj i vjeronauk u školama i službena državna religija nametnuti Vatikanskim ugovorima. Koji, ne treba se zavaravati, nisu potpisani iz vjerskih već iz diplomatskih razloga. Vatikan je, na kraju krajeva, devedesetih odigrao nezanemarivu ulogu u međunarodnom priznanju Hrvatske.
No, s obzirom da je to još jedna priča u koju bi bilo nezahvalno (i preopširno) ulaziti u ovom tekstu, spomenut ćemo radije znanstveni rad pod nazivom "Konfesionalni vjeronauk pred izazovima dekristijanizirajuće Europe", kojeg je 2012. godine napisala upravo Valentina Mandarić. U tom tekstu i sama Mandarić priznaje da se crkva mora snažnije angažirati kako bi očuvala vjeronauk u europskim školama, pozivajući se na "obilježja i procese u europskom društvu koji ubrzanim ritmom mijenjaju religijsku sliku Europe". Ovim putem stoga časnu sestru Mandarić javno pozivamo da se konačno odluči - je li vjeronauk u školama univerzalna vrednota koju EU predano pokušava očuvati ili je zbog "mijenjanja religijske slike Europe" vjeronauk ugrožen i treba mu dodatna zaštita crkvenih institucija?
Moralno dno i pogrešna tumačenja
U zaključku Mandarićina teksta dolazimo i do ranije spomenutih floskula. Svom razmišljanju Mandarić prilaže dva citata koji bi, prema njenom mišljenju trebali govoriti u prilog teze da je vjeronauk u javnim školama nužna pojava.
Prvi citat izvlači iz usta Benedikta XVI. odnosno Josefa Ratzingera, bivšeg poglavara katoličke crkve. Sa sadržajem ovog citata nije potrebno polemizirati iz prostog razloga što Ratzinger nema moralni autoritet da bilo kome dijeli lekcije o odgoju i obrazovanju djece s obzirom da se radi o osobi koju je međunarodni tisak odavno razotkrio kao glavnog pokrovitelja i prikrivatelja pedofilije u vatikanskim redovima.
Drugi citat nešto je zanimljiviji s obzirom da je njegov autor ugledni književnik i Nobelovac Mario Vargas Llosa. U svojim kolumnama za španjolski "El Pais", ukoričenim u zbirku eseja "La civilizacion del espectaculom", Vargas Llosa se doista založio za očuvanje religijskog obrazovanja u školama. Ali ne onako kako to shvaća Mandarić.
"Zapadna kultura natopljena je religioznim idejama, vjerovanjima, slikama, slavljima i običajima. Osakatiti ovu prebogatu kulturnu baštinu u obrazovanju novih generacija značilo bi izručiti ih kulturi zabave zavezanih nogu i ruku, odnosno neozbiljnosti, površnosti, neznanju, brbljanju i lošem ukusu", piše Vargas Llosa dodajući da bi djecu trebalo podučiti o utjecaju, "I DOBROM I LOŠEM", koje je kršćanstvo imalo na stvaranje zapadne kulture, na njenu povijest, filozofiju, arhitekturu, umjetnost i književnost.
Iz citata kojeg je sama Mandarić uvrstila u svoj tekst, više je nego jasno za što se Vargas Llosa zalaže: za kulturnu edukaciju koja će djeci približiti ulogu kršćanstva u povijesti i umjetnosti, koja će im objasniti Michelangelovu Pietu i Danteovu "Božanstvenu komediju", koja će ih naučiti zašto je Giordao Bruno spaljen na lomači, a Galileo Galilei za dlaku izbjegao istu sudbinu. A ne za vjeronauk koji će biblijske mitove i alegorije djeci prezentirati kao univerzalnu istinu.
Only a nation of geeks could trigger the crash of a census website. That, at least, is what a lot of people seemed to assume after the StatsCan site flatlined on Monday.
Sure, we may be geeks … but apparently we're trusting geeks, too. On Monday — which just happened to be the deadline for filing our annual tax returns — many Canadians were still keen to give the government even more information about themselves, overwhelming the StatsCan website with their replies to the 2016 census. “Here are all my receipts. Want my diary, too?”
Call it endearing, call it naive — Canadians' enthusiastic embrace of the census's return at least tells us that we're not a paranoid nation. And that's a good thing. Paranoia in politics can lead us down roads better left untravelled: distrust of newcomers, cultural snitch lines, or, say, a character like Donald Trump being regarded as a serious contender for high political office.
Trump's candidacy for president, as many commentators have observed, is fuelled in large part by a strong streak of paranoia running through the American electorate. The longer he's stayed in the race, the more references we've seen to a 1964 article by Richard Hofstadter, titled, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.”
“The paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent,” Hofstadter wrote, more than a half-century ago.
Canada's political culture isn't totally free of paranoia, but it's safe to say (I think) that we collectively have more faith in the state to manage our money, our health care or, as we saw with the census, our personal information.
Come to think of it, maybe website crashes have become our way of reminding ourselves in 2016 how un-Trump-like we are. Just a few months back, one of Canada's immigration websites went down right after Trump's victories in the Super Tuesday round of presidential primaries. The speculation at the time was that the site was being overwhelmed by Americans looking into how to move to Canada in the event Trump takes up residence in the White House.
It's surprising, to say the least, to see how some senators have failed to see Justice Vaillancourt's ruling for what it was — a slap against the use of high political office to punish a citizen, to deny that citizen the presumption of innocence. It's surprising, to say the least, to see how some senators have failed to see Justice Vaillancourt's ruling for what it was — a slap against the use of high political office to punish a citizen, to deny that citizen the presumption of innocence.
Clearly, all the enthusiasm about the census this week was an echo of last fall's election result and the widespread rejection of Stephen Harper's brand of politics, which often seemed laced with paranoia toward everyone, from the media to public servants to the courts. The decision to end the mandatory long-form census, never fully explained, was assumed to be rooted in some kind of deep-rooted Harper distrust of government in general.
But the old saying still holds true: Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they aren't out to get you. Which brings us around to the subject of Senator Mike Duffy. The census is back, and so is Duffy — back in the Senate after a three-year ordeal as a designated enemy of the state.
Regardless of what one thinks about Duffy, the story of his downfall and trial should be first and foremost a lesson about how the top political leadership of this country messed around with someone's life and livelihood.
Justice Charles Vaillancourt wasn't subtle about this in his verdict. He talked of a prime minister's chief of staff ordering senators around “like pawns on a chess board” and a culture that never stopped to ask itself whether it was doing the right thing — or even the legal thing. He went on at some length about the presumption of innocence and how it's the cornerstone of our system of justice.
All the plotting that Vaillancourt found “shocking” didn't happen in some dark corporate boardroom, or even in a political backroom. It happened in the top political office in the land, with some help from eager order-followers in the Senate and a scattershot of charges from the nation's police force. (Why was Duffy charged with receiving a bribe when no one was charged with offering one? Why wasn't the prime minister ever called as a witness?) What started as political damage-control ended up consuming a large part of the time and energy of the people who were supposed to be running the country. That's a bit chilling.
Any citizen, seeing that the power of the state could be used this way, would be justified in feeling a bit paranoid. What if the state decided, in a similar way, to use the tax system to intimidate political opponents, such as environmental groups or bird-watchers? That couldn't happen in Canada, right?
Hold that thought.
It's surprising, to say the least, to see how some senators have failed to see Justice Vaillancourt's ruling for what it was — a slap against the use of high political office to punish a citizen, to deny that citizen the presumption of innocence. Again, regardless of what one thinks about Duffy, the law has handed down a powerful reminder that neither the PMO nor the Senate can act as laws unto themselves — notwithstanding the fact that some senators still insist that they were right to dock Duffy's pay for two years.
Canadians celebrated the end of paranoia in our politics this week by filing their taxes and personal information to the state. The Senate, in that same spirit, should restore the salary it took from Duffy before the law settled the matter of his guilt or innocence.
It's great that Canadians still trust the government enough to be geeks about the census, but the Duffy verdict has shown us that we should at least be vigilant about that trust. Or that maybe we should be a bit geeky about the fine points of law and the power of the state, too.

Eight dogs had their day Wednesday afternoon as the NYPD ushered in its newest graduating class of highly-trained canines — which are now tasked with keeping New Yorkers safe in the wake of the Brussels attacks.
“Ironic, in the sense of the horrific events in Belgium yesterday, that we are having this graduation today because one of our front line defenses in the line against terrorism are these wonderful canines,” boasted Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, as he honored the bomb-sniffing K9 unit during a ceremony at the College Point Police Academy in Queens.
The police pups, all of which are Labradors, are known as “Vapor Wake Detection Dogs” — which means they are able to detect airborne particles from explosives moments after a person carrying or wearing them has left an area.
They can even track a suspect through crowded city streets and train stations.
“These eight dogs were almost a half million dollar investment of federal funds,” Bratton said. “The threat we are facing by bombs carried by people in suicide vests or in luggage, they are highly trained to help detect those in a a very unobtrusive manor. The public loves to see them and they are great tools to work with and wonderful animals to work with.”
Each pooch bears the name of one of New York's fallen police officers, one of which is Randolph Holder, the patrol cop who was fatally shot in the head while chasing a gunman during a shootout in East Harlem last October.
The other cops who were honored on Wednesday included three detectives and two officers who were shot and killed in the line of duty, one officer who died while attempting to rescue victims trapped in the World Trade Center on 9/11, and a sergeant and an officer who died of cancer, which they contracted while working at Ground Zero.
Before the season started I predicted that Gundy's mullet would be to his shoulders by late-November. Here's the full quote from our preseason predictions:
“What started out a bad haircut at Big 12 media days has turned into a media circus all its own. Gundy has had fun with it, and embraced it with the team. Although, I'm not sure he's thought this through. We're entering the season and he's still partying like it's 1999 in back. As the team starts winning, and the schedule sets up nicely to win early, I'm not sure the guys in the locker room are going to let him cut it. Plus, we all need two things in our lives: Gundy with a mullet standing on the sideline with his jacket tucked into his pants, and Gundy with a mullet dancing in the locker room.”
I have to be honest, though. I didn't fully expect it to happen, and I really didn't expect to see it a full month early. But here we are in late October, and Gundy's mullet is out of control.
As @F5Video pointed out — Mike Gundy's mullet is in fact in mid season form. Has some serious flow now. #OKState pic.twitter.com/fsy6R9Djl1 — Nate Feken (@TheGreat_Nate) October 23, 2016
Now, as far as the other part of the prediction, we just need the weather to get cooler as we've already gotten a mulleted Gundy dancing in the locker room following the Pokes' win over the Longhorns.
? Kansas lawmakers are considering a bill that would let the governor halt refugee resettlement in communities that don't have the law enforcement or health care services to handle the newcomers.
Supporters say the state needs to be cautious about potential threats of terrorism, but critics call the measure anti-Muslim.
Under the bill, which got a hearing last week, a community could request a moratorium on resettlement from the Department for Children and Families and the governor if it were unable to provide services to those arriving.
The bill also would require the department to track where families move after initial settlement and any crimes committed by refugees.
The bill is one among several efforts in Kansas and nationwide to limit settlement of refugees from Syria and elsewhere without violating the Refugee Act of 1980, which prohibits states from rejecting refugees.
President Barack Obama's administration pledged in September to accept at least 10,000 refugees from war-torn Syria over a one-year period. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback was among at least 20 governors who opposed the resettlement after it was reported that a passport of a Syrian refugee was found near the body of a suicide bomber involved in the November attacks in Paris. Brownback signed an executive order prohibiting any state entity or other organization that receives state funding from assisting refugee resettlement.
Rep. Peggy Mast, a Republican from Emporia, introduced the bill after consulting with Christopher Holton of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative think tank. Holton testified in the House Federal and State Affairs Committee last week.
Mast told the committee that she became aware of the lack of oversight in the refugee community after speaking with resettlement organizations about Somalian refugees in her area. She was alarmed that domestic abuse such as genital mutilation was undocumented, she said.
“As a woman, I find it offensive that any female should be treated as less than equal in our country,” Mast said.
Holton acknowledged that resettlement is ruled by the federal government, but he said that the program was due for reform in light of recent terrorist attacks.
“This is not an act to stop all refugees from coming into the country,” Holton told the Associated Press on Friday. Instead, he said, it's an attempt for states to have some control over their safety.
Mast said she is also worried about terrorist activity in Kansas after a foiled plot near Fort Riley last year.
“We're not bringing the Christians and Jews that are culturally similar to our culture,” she said about the Syrian refugees.
Micah Kubric, a lobbyist from the American Civil Liberties Union, told the committee that he fears the bill would encourage discrimination.
“Denial of services based exclusively on the innate, demographic characteristics of alienage or national origin is a textbook example of rank discrimination,” Kubic said, adding that the state would be vulnerable to lawsuits.
Kubic mentioned a similar bill in South Dakota that was tabled after the sponsor of the bill admitted that it wouldn't endure a constitutional challenge.
Tennessee was the first state to authorize the governor to issue a moratorium on refugee resettlement. No requests for moratoriums have been made since the law was enacted in 2011.
In Kansas, committee Chairman Jan Pauls, a Hutchinson Republican, said the House committee will continue discussing Mast's bill in early March. The Legislature is set to take a break beginning Wednesday and return to work March 2.
Correction appended, 11/29.
In an odd turn of events, Democrats will decide on Wednesday which Republican will be next to join the Oregon House of Representatives.
County commissioners from Multnomah, Clackamas and Hood River counties are set to appoint a new state representative Wednesday to replace Mark Johnson, who quit to run Oregon's largest business lobbying group.
Johnson is a Republican. So, by law, his replacement must be a Republican. But an overwhelming majority of county commissioners who will select his successor are Democrats, voter registration records show. Their votes will determine which of three nominees chosen by Republican Party leaders from Johnson's old district will take his seat.
When an Oregon House or Senate member has to be replaced mid-term, county commissioners from all counties overlapping the lawmaker's district choose from among the three party-endorsed nominees. Commissioners' votes are weighted based on how many of the legislative district's registered voters reside in each county. Under that formula, Democrats have 73 percent of the vote to replace Johnson.
The appointment is also something of an opportunity for Democrats. Johnson's former House District 52 is a swing seat. If Democrats can flip it in 2018 and hold on to all the seats they already hold, they would gain a supermajority in the Oregon House, giving them power to increase taxes without Republican support.
Republican officials from within District 52 picked as potential appointees insurance consultant Stan Pulliam, corporate attorney Erick Haynie and retired Portland Police Bureau officer Jeff Helfrich.
From left, Stan Pulliam, Erick Haynie and Jeff Helfrich.
With so much on the line -- a supermajority for Democrats, and a superminority for Republicans -- politics is inevitably in play.
Johnson and Preston Mann, executive director of the House Republican Caucus campaign arm, complained Tuesday about second-hand reports they'd received that House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, and public employee union officials attempted to influence commissioners' vote.
However, there is no evidence of that. Melissa Unger, a lobbyist for the powerful Service Employees International Union, said she is unaware of lobbying by union officials on who to appoint. Kotek did not return a request for comment.
Karen Joplin, a Hood River County commissioner allegedly targeted for lobbying by Kotek, denied being contacted by the speaker or union officials.
Joplin, a registered Democrat, said that even if there has been backroom jockeying, it's just part of the game.
"It's politics," Joplin said. "Democrats certainly want an appointment for a weak Republican. And Republicans certainly want their strongest candidate."
Joplin, however, said she thinks Johnson's three potential replacements are "all strong candidates."
Joplin's colleague, Hood River County Commissioner Bob Benton, said he's also heard rumors of Democrats angling for a preferable Republican appointment to the Legislature.
"If it is in fact going on it just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth," said Benton, a Republican.

You might need three satellites plus some not-yet-invented equipment to detect gravitational waves directly, but it turns out you can see the effects of these ripples in spacetime with an optical telescope and a stopwatch.
A pair of white dwarf stars, known as J0651, which are only a third as far from each other as the Earth and moon, are creeping closer together because they're shedding energy in the form of elusive gravitational waves.
Though gravitational wave emitters are fairly common, the unique thing about J0651 is the high power of the waves it produces combined with the fact that it emits visible light.
“An amateur astronomer with a 2-metre telescope could measure this effect,” says Warren Brown, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a member of the team that indirectly measured J0651's gravitational waves.

Testing Einstein
According to Einstein's general relativity – the leading theory of gravity – accelerating objects, like stars orbiting one another, should create gravitational waves. The heavier they are, and the faster they're moving, the more powerful those waves. Crucially, this loss of energy causes the two objects to orbit closer together, an effect that can be detected.
Previously detected sources of gravitational waves include pairs of pulsing stars called pulsars – but these only emit radio waves and orbit each other slowly, on the order of once per hour, meaning the change in orbit due to gravitational waves is small.
“With pulsars, it's only because you can measure them with insane accuracy that you can see these small shifts,” says Gijs Nelemans, an astrophysicist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who was not involved in the work.
By contrast, J0651's two stars emit visible light and orbit each other once every 12.75 minutes, or 113 times a day. When Brown and colleagues compared the current orbit of J0651 to when it was first discovered a year ago, they found it was a quarter of a millisecond faster. That may not sound like much, but it amounts to a shift of six seconds in the timing of a specific eclipse compared with what you would expect if a system wasn't sending out ripples in spacetime – a large enough gap to be detected by a common stopwatch.
The researchers also calculated that of all the known steady sources of gravitational waves, J0651 is the second most powerful. Only the binary system HM Cancri is more powerful, but it is less useful to study, says Brown, because the interaction between its two stars is made “messy” by the transfer of matter between them. This makes it harder to figure out what factors are contributing to the loss of energy. J0651 is rare because there is no exchange of material, despite the two stars' relative proximity to one another.
Cosmic blink
“We've seen this with pulsars, but it's very nice to see this here,” says Nelemans. “Optical has such a long tradition that as a community we know very well how to use optical instrumentation.”
The final confirmation of gravitational waves' existence will come from detecting them directly. One promising planned experiment is eLISA, a set of three spacecrafts orbiting the sun that will detect slight movements in onboard, shielded objects that are buffeted only by the gravitational waves emitted by systems like J0651.
Indeed, the discovery of this system, due to be published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, will be a great target for eLISA, which should start taking data in about 2025, says Brown's colleague J. J. Hermes from the University of Texas, Austin.
“We need to know where to look to be able to say we see something above the noise,” he says. “It's like looking for a needle in a hay stack, and now we've got GPS on the needle.”

The firm appointed by the court to make sure Volkswagen adheres to the rules outlined in the $14.7 billion Dieselgate settlement just issued a progress report detailing the struggles the automaker has had accommodating customers who just want this disaster over with. And that report confirms that all the frustrations owners have had with the buyback are legitimate.
Last month, I wrote a story about how VW TDI customers—who had been duped by Volkswagen cheating on Federal emissions tests—were outraged with the way Volkswagen has handled the buyback claims process. Many owners complained about long telephone hold times for the claims hotline, VW missing deadlines, and the automaker giving preferential treatment to owners with paid-off cars.
It turns out they were all right. The good news now, is that Ankura Consulting—the firm supervising VW's buyback proceedings—has confirmed these problems and voiced the concerns to the court, and has also described why VW is having these issues.
The report mentions VW's problems to the court right off the bat, saying:
Despite significant progress in launching the Claims Program, Volkswagen has experienced some challenges in meeting timing requirements in processing the influx of initial claims.

It goes on to say the timetable laid out in the FTC order—which gave VW five days from the final rule to prepare, ten business days to approve documents, and another ten days to send out an offer letter— was “aggressive,” and that it strained Volkswagen's capability.
Ankura said the primary reasons why Volkswagen has been struggling to meet deadlines are because VW:
(i) did not initially have the requisite staffing and infrastructure in place to administer a program of this size and scope; (ii) did not have prior experience processing mass claims on this scale and within such accelerated timetables; (iii) did not have the benefit of any off-the-shelf IT solution to support such a high-volume and intricate claims program; (iv) had to address a significant volume of submitted claims at the outset of the Claims Program; ...(v) did not have much time to test certain components of the operations and technology systems and troubleshoot issues before launch.

As a product of these issues, Ankura says, class members should expect to “encounter certain challenges in the initial months of program administration.”
Missing Deadlines
Further down in the document, in the section “Volkswagen's Claims Program Performance Metrics,” Ankura shows quantitative evidence that VW has failed to meet timing, particularly the second 10-day deadline.

Volkswagen's first deadline was to ensure that all the documents sent in by owners were complete. The consulting firm said VW did that just fine.
But the second 10 business day-deadline, the “Offer Letter Phase,” is going poorly, with only 52 percent of owners receiving offers within the required time, and the rest considered “untimely.”

The document says part of the issue is a disagreement between Volkswagen's staff and claims supervisors, as some documents are being deemed complete by Volkswagen, but the claims adviser disagrees, and the owner then has to be notified that they've still got more work to do.
Owners With Loans Are Being Left Behind
The report goes on to say that of the 38,638 owners who received offers by November 20, only 2,390 of those were owners with loans—that's only 6 percent of the total.

The reason for this is that VW has to account for the amount still owed on the loan to come up with the offer. To do this, VW has to contact the lender to get a payoff statement, and that takes time.
The positive news is that Ankura and Volkswagen are aware of the problem, and changes are being made.
That Owners without loans constitute 94% of offers issued to Owners through November 20, 2016, aligns with a recent uptick of consumer complaints by Owners with loans... Volkswagen has recently indicated that it is shifting resources in an effort to accelerate issuance of offers to Owners with loans.

Long Hold Times On Support Lines
Then there's the issue of long hold times, which Ankura acknowledges, saying:
...in the period leading up to and following the Court's approval of the Resolution Agreements, call volume spiked and the Hotline became overwhelmed with consumer calls.
Advertisement
On November 14, the report highlights, the claims hotline got 10,000 calls, and hang-up rates were close to a staggering 70 percent.
Ankura says Volkswagen has upped its agent count from 67 to 109 after the court approval on October 25, and now that number is up to about 300, reducing wait times to an average of eight minutes.
What Volkswagen Has Done So Far
So Volkswagen has been missing deadlines (particularly with those who have loans on their vehicles) and its claims hotline has been struggling, but it's worth noting what the company has done so far.
Advertisement
Ankura says VW's development of the operations and technology needed to handle almost half a million claims was “a significant undertaking,” noting:
The company was required to build out a claims operation, develop detailed processes and workflows, and staff an organization with hundreds of individuals. In addition, Volkswagen had to develop complex and integrated technology systems to provide information to consumers, allow for application intake, and facilitate back-office claims processing.
I don't think any VW owners doubt the magnitude of what Volkswagen has had to do, but many will say exactly what Ankura's progress report mentions:
Among the foremost recent complaints from consumers are that Volkswagen should have been better prepared to handle the sharp influx of claims at the outset of the Claims Program

In 2002, the East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans introduced a line of packaged ground beef that had been irradiated with an electron beam to kill bacteria. Company executives expected the product to do well; a series of food-borne illness outbreaks had rendered Americans' confidence in food safety dismally low. The launch came at the start of grilling season, and executives thought it would be a hit with people who liked their burgers rare but didn't want to get sick from undercooked meat. The slogan: “Cook it the way you like it!”
“Some people even think their food is going to be radioactive, which is just totally not how this works.”
But to their surprise, sales were unimpressive—and they remain so today, says Wegmans' meat merchandising manager, Mark Spagnola. One reason might be the higher price: Irradiated beef can cost as much as 80 cents more per pound. But Wegmans' customers are willing to pay a premium for other special foods, like organics. So more likely, it's irradiation itself that puts shoppers off. Many consumer surveys have found that people consider irradiation—which the federal government approved for some foods as early as the 1960s—creepy and unsafe. “Some people even think their food is going to be radioactive,” Spagnola says, “which is just totally not how this works.”
Here's how it does work: At a special irradiation plant—there are just a handful in the United States—workers zap food with a machine similar to the kind that administers radiation to cancer patients. Most facilities use electron beams, but some irradiate with X-rays or gamma rays. While the dose of radiation is high, it doesn't stay with the food, and workers are protected from it with safety gear and massive concrete walls. The result, says Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on food-borne illness who has studied irradiation extensively, is that it kills as many bacteria as cooking at high temperatures, but without any loss of taste. “Food irradiation shows absolutely no detrimental impact on the food,” he says.
Hundreds of studies have proved that irradiation neither adds compounds to food nor takes nutrients away.
Hundreds of studies have proved that irradiation neither adds compounds to food nor takes nutrients away, and that it can help prevent the food-borne illnesses that sicken 48 million Americans and kill 3,000 every year. The World Health Organization and the US Department of Agriculture have deemed the technology safe for food, as has the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which asserts that in addition to eliminating dangerous bacteria in human food, the technique could also be used to prevent the spread of disease in livestock through its feed.
Yet some food advocacy groups have campaigned vociferously against the technique. Food and Water Watch, for example, argues it might induce manufacturers to zap food instead of maintaining a clean plant. “This could be a gateway to faster line speeds at meat facilities and sloppier handling practices,” says Patty Lovera, the organization's assistant director. But Rick Holley, a food microbiologist and irradiation expert at the University of Manitoba, sees the technique as an extra tool, rather than a crutch; irradiation, he points out, doesn't get rid of all bacteria, just most. “You can't make bad food good using irradiation,” he says. “If your plant is dirty and not inspected and overtaxed, the food is going to be bad in a way that irradiation can't fix.”
About a third of dried herbs and spices are irradiated to prevent salmonella, and imported fruits like mangoes and papayas are sometimes zapped to kill invasive insects.
In fact, you're probably already eating irradiated products. About a third of dried herbs and spices are irradiated to prevent salmonella, and imported fruits like mangoes and papayas are sometimes zapped to kill invasive insects. The technique is also used to sterilize medical equipment like gloves, bandages, and syringes, as well as personal-care products like contact lens solution and baby bottle nipples. Several European countries regularly irradiate all kinds of food; the French even do it to Camembert cheese to cut down on pathogens from raw milk. In South Africa, safari operators eat irradiated meat because it has a long shelf life, even in hot climates.
To be sure, the technology isn't cheap—but that, says Harlan Clemmons, who runs an irradiation facility in Sioux City, Iowa, is mostly because it costs a lot of money to ship all that meat to the special plants. Although the equipment is expensive (about $18 million up front), Clemmons calculates that if meat processors did irradiation in-house, over time they could bring the cost down “to next to nothing.”
But that's unlikely to happen anytime soon unless consumers start embracing the technique, which might require more public attention. In a 2005 study, 484 shoppers at grocery stores in four Texas towns were asked about their opinion of irradiated foods. Then they read material about how an electron beam works and watched a short video on the topic. Initially, about 18 percent of the shoppers described themselves as “doubters” or “rejecters” of irradiation. But after the statements and video, that number dwindled to just 3.8 percent. Osterholm likens the public mistrust of irradiation to the anti-vaccine movement. “We know we could eliminate much food safety problems with this technique,” he says. “And yet people are still fighting it.”

Part I - The Welsh
Their hospitality and eating habits
In Wales no one begs. Everyone's home is open to all, for the Welsh generosity and hospitality are the greatest of all virtues. They very much enjoy welcoming others to their homes. When you travel there is no question of asking for accommodation or of their offering it: you just march into a house and hand over your weapons to the person in charge. They give you water so that you may wash your feet and that means you are a guest. With these people the offering of water in which to wash your feet is an invitation to stay. If you refuse the offer, it means that you have only dropped in for refreshment in the early part of the day and do not propose to stay the night.
In Wales young people go about in groups and families, under their chosen leader. They spend their time in exercise and in practising with their weapons, with the result they are ready at a moment's notice to protect their homeland. They enter anyone's house without asking permission, as if it were there own.
Guests who arrive early in the day are entertained until nightfall by girls who play to them on the harp. In every house there are young women just waiting to play for you, and there is certainly no lack of harps. Here are two things worth remembering: the Irish are the most jealous people on earth, but the Welsh do not seem to know what jealousy is; and in every Welsh court or family the menfolk consider playing on the harp to be the greatest of all accomplishments. When night falls and no more guests are expected, the evening meal is prepared, varying according to what the house has to offer, and to the number and the importance of the men who have come. You must not expect a variety of dishes from a Welsh kitchen, and there are no highly seasoned tit-bits to whet your appetite. In a Welsh house there are no tables, no tablecloths and no napkins. Everyone behaves quite naturally, with no attempt whatsoever at etiquette. You sit down in threes, not in pairs as elsewhere, and they put the food in front of you, on a single large trencher containing enough for three, resting on rushes or green grass. Sometimes they serve the main dish on bread, rolled out large and thin, and baked fresh each day. In ancient books you will find these called 'lagana'. That noble youth from whom the Welsh claim their descent (Ascanius, son of Aeneas) and whose mode of living they still in part maintain, ate his food off thin bread in the same way: the whole family waits on the guests, and the host and hostess stand there making sure that everything is being attended to. They themselves do not eat until everyone else has finished. If there is shortage of anything, it will be they who go without. Finally the time comes to retire to rest. Alongside one of the walls is placed a communal bed, stuffed with rushes, and not all that many of them. For sole covering there is a stiff hard sheet, made locally and called in Welsh 'brychan'. They all go to bed together. They keep on the same clothes they have worn all day, a thin cloak and a tunic, which is all they have to keep the cold out. A fire is kept burning all night at their feet, just as it has done all day, and they get some warmth from the people sleeping next to them. When their underneath side begins to ache with the hardness of the bed and their uppermost side is frozen stiff with cold, they get up and sit by the fire, which soon warms them up and soothes away their aches and pains. Then they go back to bed again, turning over on their other side if they feel like it, so that a different part is frozen and another side is bruised by the hard bed. back to the top How the Welsh cut their hair, take care of their teeth and
shave off their beards
Both the man and women cut their hair short and shape it round their ears. Like the Parthians the women cover their heads with a flowing white veil, which sticks up in folds like a crown. Both sexes take great care of their teeth, more than I have seen in any other country. They are constantly cleaning them with green hazel twigs, and then rubbing them with woollen cloths until they shine like ivory. To protect their teeth they never eat hot food, but only what is cold, tepid, or slightly warm.
The men shave their beards, leaving only their moustaches.
This is not a new habit, but one which goes back to time immemorial. In the book which Julius Caesar wrote about his exploits, we read: the Britons 'shave their whole body except their upper lip', Sometimes they shave their heads, too, so that they can move more freely when running through forest groves. Of all the people I have seen the Welsh are the most particular about shaving the lower parts of the body.
Julius Caesar, too, tells about the way, when about to fight a battle, the Britons daub their faces with shiny paint. Making themselves so ghastly that the enemy can hardly bear to look at them. back to the top The Welsh love music and singing
The Welsh are very sharp and intelligent. When they apply their minds to anything, they are quick to make progress, for they have great natural ability.
When they play their instruments they charm and delight the ear with the sweetness of their music. They play quickly and with subtle harmony. Their fingering is so rapid that they produce this harmony out of discord.
Giraldus goes on to quote from a passage in his 'Topography of Ireland'; 'It is remarkable how they (the Irish) maintain a musical balance while moving their fingers so rapidly. They play their various instruments with consummate artistry, keeping them in close harmony. The resulting melody is complete and satisfying, played softly but at great speed, with what one may call smooth unevenness or a discordant discord. Whether they are playing in fourths or fifths, they always begin with B flat and then come back to it at the end, so that the whole melody is rounded off sweetly and merrily. They play the grace notes with great abandon, above the heavy bourdon of the bass strings. It follows that music which gives profound and indescribable pleasure to those who listen carefully and can enjoy its subtleties, can only offend the ears of the inattentive instead of gratifying them.
The Welsh, says Giraldus, play three instruments, the harp, the pipe and the crwth (fiddle).
When they come together to make music, the Welsh sing their traditional songs, not in unison as is done elsewhere, but in parts, in many modes and modulations. When a choir gathers to sing, which happens often in this country, you will hear many different parts and voices as there are performers, all joining together in the end to produce a single organic harmony and melody in the soft sweetness of B flat.
In the northern parts of Great Britain, across the Humber and in Yorkshire, the English who live there produce the same symphonic harmony when they sing. They do this in two parts only, with two modulations of the voice, one group humming the bass and the others singing the treble most sweetly.
The two peoples must have developed this habit not by any special training but by age old custom, by long usage which has made it second nature. As the English in general do not adopt this way of singing, but only those who live in the north, I think the latter must have taken their part singing from the Danes and Norwegians, who so often invaded these parts of the island and held them longer under dominion. back to the top
On Tuesday afternoon a flurry of several "mini-me" player cutouts sent out by the Texas Longhorns were making their way into the homes of 2015 prospects and commitments. The cutouts are a very unique piece and could be given to friends and family similar to a trading card.
Taken from Twitter, Deshon Elliott is thumbing through several hand-sized personalized cutouts.
Along with the cutouts, pictures and photo edits hit social media of current Texas Longhorn 2015 commitments and prospects in their future Texas Longhorns uniforms and posed in front of the Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. The pictures went viral and were an instant hit for everyone who saw them.
Commits Tristian Houston (North Shore), Kirk Johnson (San Jose, Calif./Valley Christian), Charles Omenihu (Rowlett) and Deshon Elliott (Rockwall-Heath) along with top prospects Ryan Newsome (Aledo) and Chris Clark (Avon, Conn./Avon Old Farms) were only a few of the 2015 recruits who received these cutouts and photos.
Following are a few examples of the work that was on display throughout twitter.

The sprawling metropolis of Black Rock City doesn't emerge overnight, but it doesn't take much longer than that. Built from the ground up every year for Burning Man, a festival celebrating “radical self expression and self reliance,” the city is a hodgepodge of geodesic domes, yurts, and stories-tall steel sculptures. Assembled in a circle, the city is clustered around a 100-foot tall effigy of modern man.
Building a city from scratch is a monumental task, beyond the reach of mere human strength. But that's what we build machines for—big, honking machines. Burning Man has an entire camp dedicated to housing the metal beasts. But maintaining and operating those machines in the middle of the abrasive Black Rock Desert is something else entirely.
Rick Rea is the mechanic that keeps these big beasts barreling along the desert. He's been working on heavy machinery as long as he can remember, and he knows his stuff. Exploring the maze of equipment, I found him ambling between two large cranes, tending his herd. Weatherbeaten and grisled with a cigarette dangling between his lips, Rick wears workboots and grease-stained jeans like a badge. He's not a hippy and he's not a stoner. He's not pierced or costumed. Rick's a local and he stands out in this desert.
The Department of Public Works has a massive equipment contract with United Rentals. Their camp has more heavy equipment than every construction yard in my hometown. Huge cranes, every forklift imaginable, half a dozen skid steer loaders, cherry pickers, and countless generator-powered mobile light towers. This is Rick's domain.
Rick's a machine whisperer—a kind of mechanical Confucius of the desert. He understands machines so well that his fixes come across as magic. One of the theme camps asked for his help with a cantankerous diesel generator. Getting this particular diesel engine restarted had stumped Kohler's on-site repair technician for a full day, but that didn't faze Rick. He fixed it in less than five minutes with a quick shot of ether. The computerized starter timer refused to crank the engine as long as necessary to build up enough compression pressure to ignite the diesel, he explained to me. The ether boosted the pressure just high enough to start.
Rick's knowledge comes from experience: he runs a repair business (R&B Mobile Equipment Repair of Fallon, Nevada ) fixing heavy equipment full time, but takes two months off every year to work Burning Man, tending to machines in the hostile desert environment. He knows why and how equipment usually fails, but he told me the patterns of failure at Burning Man are dramatically different.
The fine dust crams itself into every crevice, sticking to adhesive and clogging small mechanical parts. Despite bulletproof hydraulics, the conditions machines experience in this alkaline desert clearly exceed the roughest environments imagined by their designers.
Counterintuitively, newer machinery tends to have more maintenance issues. Diesel engines used to be nearly indestructible and maintenance-free, but clean emissions standards are requiring more computer controls. Rick's perspective jives with common sense: "The simpler the better; the less to go wrong." Of course, if the machines stopped breaking, Rick would be out of a job.
That isn't likely anytime soon, as computer controls become more common across heavy equipment brands. Over 90% of the hardware issues Rick deals with are electrical. He fixes Genie's machines more often than other equipment for a simple reason: the controller computer is mounted in an unsealed metal box. The conductive alkali dust shorts computer boards just as easily as it kills alternators.
The most temperamental machines are the lifters—scissor lifts, boom lifts, and cherry pickers. They have internal sensors to check whether their wheels are level—and refuse to operate if they off-level even slightly. This is a sound policy: if the wheels are just a couple percent off-level on the ground, that multiplies out to a precarious angle once you're thirty feet in the air. The problem is that the sensors are complex, computer-controlled systems. Rick told me he regularly has to "shut em off and reboot 'em just like any computer" to get the machines to realize they actually are on firm, level ground. He knows how to override the level sensors but never does, preferring to solve the underlying issue rather than risk the safety of his operators.
Before he heads out on a job, Rick downloads service manuals for the equipment he'll be working on. Even with dozens of years of experience, he'll readily admit that "no one can know everything." You're pretty hosed if you don't have a wiring diagram and have never worked on that particular machinery before.
Fortunately, the heavy equipment industry is more enlightened than consumer electronics manufacturers. Most companies post service documentation on their site for free. One company that eschews this open policy is John Deere. Farmers have to pay hundreds of dollars for John Deere service manuals—some manuals listed on their site cost $600! "That's a lot of money for a farmer," Rick says. Most farmers just work without manuals, but computer controls are making it harder—farmers generally don't have an electrical engineering background.
Rick doesn't either, but decades of experience have given him a spookily accurate intuition. As he shows me around the yard, he glows with pride at the condition of his machines. Like Rick, they're well-worn and coated with a fine layer alkali dust. But after six long weeks in the desert every last machine in the camp still works. The hardware may not have been designed for extreme windstorms and conductive dust, but you'd never know it with Rick's attentiveness.
And he needs it, because the work out here is never done. I point out a hydraulic leak on a cherry picker, and he gives me a knowing smile. "I'll get right on that."
Want to learn Rick's Houdini-like secrets for getting out of repair pinches? As I write this, his page on Facebook has just 41 likes. Give him some love and he'll probably reciprocate. And invite the repair guru in your life to join iFixit's repair community.

Free movement of people from the EU to the UK could be extended after Brexit, Theresa May has suggested.
The prime minister said there would be an "implementation" phase once an exit deal had been struck, with business and governments needing a "period of time" to adjust to any new restrictions.
The government insists Brexit will give the UK greater control of its borders.
But Labour said Mrs May's comments showed she was trying to "downplay expectations".
BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar says the comments clearly left open the possibility of free movement continuing, at least temporarily.
Speaking to journalists during her visit to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, the PM was pressed on what would happen if there was a transitional phase after a Brexit deal is reached.
She said: "You've used the phrase transitional phase; I have used the phrase implementation period.
"Once we've got the deal, once we've agreed what the new relationship will be for the future, it will be necessary for there to be a period of time when businesses and governments are adjusting systems and so forth, depending on the nature of the deal - but a period of time when that deal will be implemented."
However, Mrs May said the government would still be in charge of its immigration policy.
"What is crucial for the British public, what was part of the vote that they took last year, was that they want to ensure that we have control of our borders and control of our immigration," she said.
"That's exactly what we will do when we come out of the European Union."
A change of tone

By John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor
Nagging questions about the future after Brexit continue to follow the prime minister at home and abroad.
The shape of future immigration policy is high on the list. One key change, Mrs May said, would be that borders and immigration policy would be under British control.
That clearly left open the possibility of free movement continuing, at least temporarily.
She did not endorse talk in Brussels of a transitional period of maybe three years. But the tone of ministers discussing immigration policy has changed.
Suggestions of a sharp cut in EU migration after Brexit has given way to caveats and qualification.
The rhetoric and slogans of the EU referendum and its aftermath have passed - now Mrs May and her ministers are preparing the ground for the give-and-take and compromises involved in their mission to deliver success and stability outside the EU.
Mrs May was also asked about when she expected a new trade deal to be finalised with the EU, after European Council president Donald Tusk made clear one could only be agreed with non-members - meaning the UK would have to wait until after it had left.
She told Sky News: "There's obviously a legal situation in terms of how the EU can conduct trade negotiations.
"I'm clear that by the point at which we leave the EU, it's right that everybody should know what the future arrangements, the future relationship, that future partnership between us and the European Union will be.
"That's the sensible thing, it's the pragmatic way to look at this, and I believe that's what we will do."
Labour's Brexit spokesman, Paul Blomfield, said: "It is less than a week since the prime minister triggered Article 50, and it seems every day brings another broken promise.
"They need to spell out the transitional deal that will be in place, to stop the economy falling off a cliff edge without new agreements in two years' time."

South Carolina's “Operation Rolling Thunder”
SPARTANBURG, SC — A surprise annual enforcement blitz in Spartanburg County is largely about stealing cash from harmless motorists, an analysis shows.
“Operation Rolling Thunder” is staged on one weekend per year, and draws in swarms of cops from around the state to participate. The date is held a secret.
Police issued a total of 1,300 traffic citations in just 4 days in October 2013, raking in big money for the county in fines and court costs.
However, fining drivers for burnt-out light bulbs and speeding is is only part of the excitement during the crackdown. The big prize is in summarily seizing cash from drug suspects.
Last October, the department raked in over $100,000.00 in confiscated cash, using a tactic known as civil asset forfeiture. This allows police to seize property on the spot — sometimes without even charging the owner with a crime — and forcing the owner to prove his innocence in court to retrieve the items or money. Often, the legal battle is more expense than the property itself, and can take many months.
The seizures of cash and property are then liquidated by the police and split up among the participating agencies, and then used to beef up their equipment and redouble their dubious efforts.
Spartanburg's WSPA investigated the 2013 operation and found that in just one weekend, police stopped over 1,000 cars and proceeded to search 171 of them. Reporters asked Spartanburg Sheriff Chuck Wright if the operation was all about revenue generation, provoking an interesting response.
After a long pause, Sheriff Wright replied, “You know it's a part of it, but it ain't the main reason we do it.”
“It's a bonus actually when you get the cash or you get the cars we seize and sell,” he said.
Of the 1,000 stops, only 34 people were charged with a crime, and most of those (62%) were for petty misdemeanor charges of “simple possession of marijuana” — being caught with less than an ounce.
Another enforcement blitz is on the calendar for this year, but is not forecast to the public for fear of diminished returns.
Operation Rolling Thunder is a prime example of how programs like civil asset forfeiture create an incentive to take police away from real crime in order to focus on traffic stops, searching vehicles, stealing cash, and arresting people over possession of plants. Indeed, America's second experiment with prohibition has turned many agencies into antagonistic revenue generators rather than peacekeepers and public servants.

After years of playing a lieutenant, Law & Order alumna S. Epatha Merkerson is moving to the world of medicine.
The actress will star in the potential Chicago Fire spinoff Chicago Med, which will be introduced this season as an hour of the mothership series.
Per our sister site Deadline, Merkerson will appear in Episode 19 of Fire as Sharon Goodwin, the head of the hospital which serves as the setting for Med. Though she doesn't love the politics that go into running the establishment and has little patience for foolishness, Sharon excels at keeping the doors open.
The casting reunites the actress with Law & Order and Chicago Fire executive producer Dick Wolf.
Merkerson was a member of the L&O cast for 16 years. Since leaving the series in 2010, she has appeared on The Good Wife, Deception and Drop Dead Diva.
Chicago Bears tickets View Full Caption Flickr Creative Commons/Jim Larrison
CHICAGO — A group of 16 Chicago gang members has been accused of operating a counterfeit ticket selling ring that produced fake tickets to Bulls, Bears and other local teams as well as touring acts and other productions, the state's attorney general's office said Tuesday.
The group has been charged with forgery after a joint investigation between local authorities and federal agents uncovered the ring, Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a news release. Fake tickets to Bulls, Bears and Blackhawks games were uncovered, as were fakes for "Disney on Ice" tours and World Wrestling Entertainment productions.
The tickets were sold on sites like Craigslist, where the sellers met people in restaurants and other business to exchange the fakes for money, Madigan said.
Profits from the scheme then went to fund other illegal operations orchestrated by the gangs, Interim Police Supt. John Escalante said in a statement.
"This ticket scheme provided the finances to fuel the engine of violence that has plagued Chicago communities for far too long," Escalante said.
Of the 16 charged with forgery, eight have been arrested and are in Chicago Police custody. Arrest warrants have been issued for the remaining eight, Madigan said.
"The charges against the defendants allege they operated a widespread counterfeit operation to defraud people seeking to attend some of Chicago's most popular events," Madigan said in a statement.
Chicago Police have identified the targets as being members of local street gangs, Madigan said in the statement.
Those charged with the offense include: Lamont Flowers, 20; Labron Gray, 39; Nathaniel Gray, 24; Mitchell Hazzard, 36; Dionte Johnson, 20; Rashawn Mays, 20; Darrick McClinton, 33; Kenneth McCullough, 19; Joseph McKnight, 26; Russell Merritt, 36; David Metcalf, 25; Marcus Moore, 19; Mark Morrison, 24, Jason Peters, 24; Rodney Pole, 25; Lionel Robinson, 34.

In a segment Tuesday on CNN's ‘Starting Point' with Christine Romans, former wrestler and governor Jesse Ventura urged voters to consider Libertarian Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson — but CNN edited that piece of the interview out of the internet coverage of the story.
The full interview can be seen here:
At the conclusion of the interview, Ventura encourages people who “really want to rebel” against the tyranny of the two party system to vote for Johnson, a former governor and Republican candidate who won the Libertarian nomination in May.
In the CNN write-up and accompanying video posted on CNN's website, which can be seen below, there is no mention of Johnson.
Ventura was promoting his new book ‘DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government,' which is Ventura's manifesto about the two-party system and its obstruction of political progress.
The book by the former “Predator” star calls for more political freedom, arguing that candidates should be forced to run on their own platforms instead of a party',s and that voters should educate themselves on individual candidates rather than parties.

The NFL Insiders crew weigh in on if the Chargers and Saints have each underachieved since San Diego let Brees sign a free-agent deal with New Orleans 10 years ago. (1:35)
SAN DIEGO -- Good morning.
ESPN NFL Insider Chris Mortensen had an interesting conversation with former San Diego Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson.
Days before Drew Brees makes his return to San Diego this weekend with the New Orleans Saints, Tomlinson said that the Chargers would have won the Super Bowl in the 2006 season had San Diego brought back Brees instead of going with Philip Rivers.
The Chargers finished 14-2 that year, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC divisional playoffs at home. Led by Peyton Manning, the Indianapolis Colts went on to win the Super Bowl that season.
"Drew was never going to relinquish that job -- it became his team,” Tomlinson said. “I mean, they both may end up in the Hall of Fame but at that time, I'll say it again: If Drew had been our quarterback, we would have won the Super Bowl [in 2006]. A lot of guys on the team felt that way about Drew. It was so unfortunate.”
My take: The Chargers appeared concerned about paying Brees market value because of his shoulder issue, and that's understandable. The team also had a quarterback in waiting in Rivers. It's an interesting debate, but I'm not sure you can question the organization's decision with how Rivers' career has turned out. The more questionable decision was letting go of Marty Schottenheimer as the head coach.
NFL Nation Saints reporter Mike Triplett writes that New Orleans is getting healthier, with receiver Willie Snead and Kenny Vaccaro returning to practice. Both are confident they will play Sunday.
My take: Don't sleep on the 0-3 Saints, folks. This could be a tough game for the Chargers this weekend.
Michael Gehlken of The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that Melvin Ingram raised $120,000 for his Mission Impossible foundation, which serves low-income, inner-city youth. Ingram was named defensive co-captain in place of Manti Te'o, who was placed on injured reserve this week.
My take: Ingram will lead with his play on the field and also can provide another voice to create energy on game day.
Marty Caswell of The Mighty 1090 AM Radio talks with rookie tight end Hunter Henry about correcting the mistakes the Chargers made against the Colts in this video.
My take: Henry owns up to the fumble he made at the end of the game and said the Chargers have to do a better job of front of blocking in the running game.
Image caption The cars were damaged while parked on Northumberland Gardens in Jesmond
A university professor has admitted scrawling graffiti on cars causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.
Stephen Graham, who had been drinking, admitted four counts of criminal damage in Jesmond, Newcastle.
He used a screwdriver to scratch the words "very silly", "really wrong" and "arbitrary" on to 24 cars, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
The 47-year-old, of Jesmond, who works at the city's university, was bailed and will be sentenced on 25 February.
The cars included a Mercedes, an Audi, a Volvo and a Mitsubishi and the total damage totalled £18,000, the hearing heard.
'No recollection'
Graham, who is based at Newcastle University's school of architecture, planning and landscape, also asked for 23 similar offences to be taken into consideration.
Julian Smith, defending, said: "He has no recollection of the course of events that night."
The hearing heard that the spree took place in August 2011 in Northumberland Gardens, a few streets away from where Graham lived in Lansdowne Gardens.
He has previously blamed a bad reaction to alcohol, antibiotics and prescription drugs for his behaviour.
The word "idealism," when understood as the metaphysical position "everything is ideas" rather than some kind of optimism or high goal-setting, carries a lot of baggage with it that I hope we dispelled in the episode.
To repeat: it's not solipsism, i.e. the notion that I (or my mind) is the only thing that's real, and so everything must be an idea in my mind. No, for Berkeley, other minds (and God's!) are just as real as mine.
It's also not subjectivism, in that while there are some ideas that we can change according to our whim (those of imagination, for instance), for the most part, the ideas we find ourselves with change in lawlike ways: if I move my head this way, the scenery (a set of ideas) moves the opposite way, and then I can move my head back and have more or less the original view restored. Objects don't just disappear when I close my eyes or leave the room for a second unless there was a mundane physical cause for this.
It's also not mysticism: Despite my song choice (listen to "I Am the Cosmos" here!), I am not the cosmos, nor are my ideas part of me. I gave Berkeley a lot of criticism in our discussion for not explaining how me having an idea and God having that idea before me and somehow giving it to me works, but I think Berkeley would say we shouldn't be surprised by that: most of God's creation is not amenable to observation, and all we need to understand is that a) I experience what it is to have an idea, and so for a mind in general to have an idea, all the time; that's about as clear as clear can be, and b) God must exist as objective grounding for all these ideas. I am not (according to my experience) the objective grounding of ideas, meaning that my whims or desires or evident actions are obviously not the basis of the stability and lawlike character of experience referred to above. So there is a God (or some other objective ground), and it is not me, nor are the ideas themselves God, because God is unchanging whereas ideas seem to change all the time.
It's also not relativism: God is the objective ground of these various ideas, which He relates in lawlike ways, and so, on questions of fact where two people disagree, they're likely just referring to different aspects of a thing, or rather different ideas which are normally grouped together as a thing ("The oar is bent!" "No, the oar is straight!") and so are in a sense talking about different things. In the same way that everyday utility could still allow us to say that one person is right and the other is wrong about the oar (the oar, in most circumstances, as when we measure it, comes out straight), we can say that, e.g. the blind man is wrong if he says that there's no silent cheetah hurtling at his face if the impending scratchy impact shows us that that was the case.
Randians, in particular, should really like idealism for the way that it avoids all of the above. Berkeley, like Rand, says that we have a knowing faculty that allows us to get at reality itself, and not just appearances, and that knowledge is a matter of discovering objective facts. Someone like Popper might say that a real respect for objectivity requires acknowledging skepticism and trying to become "less wrong" through attempted falsifications of hypotheses, but that would be tantamount to Kantianism: to saying that the world in-itself is ultimately unknowable. Berkeley and Rand say well, of course there are aspects of reality that will inevitably remain unknown for practical reasons, but that does nothing to impugn the validity of the objects of my immediate experience. There are of course other reasons Rand would reject Berkeley (like the God part), but he's A-OK by this standard so far.
So why does idealism remain icky? Foreign to our modern, scientific viewpoint? Something to be avoided by the philosophically sophisticated? For the one thing, it seems to violate Occam's Razor: isn't it more likely that the causes of our many sensations of a thing is just the existence, as a real, objective thing, of that thing? ... And not that the thing is just a cluster (even an objectively existing cluster) of ideas? What holds the ideas together? Well, God does, according to Berkeley. Theists often claim that God is the simplest explanation, because God is unitary, ultimately simple, but clearly this doesn't satisfy the scientific demand for simplicity, because we can't say how God gives us ideas or holds them together in clusters or makes them otherwise lawlike. We can't use this God hypothesis to predict what will happen next, though we can use the observation of orderliness to make such predictions (induction!).
So I'm interested in hearing from you folks. Do we have any idealists in the listenership? Theistic or non-theistic ones? Convince me that this loathing of the term "idealism" and everything associated with it is just a prejudice of the sort that Berkeley argues against! (i.e. the prejudice in favor of material objects, a concept he ultimately finds incoherent) I personally have much less difficulty with various forms of pragmatism that throw away the thing-in-itself merely because there's nothing useful we can say about it than I do with a view like Berkeley's that rules out skepticism seemingly by fiat.

US Army donates Estonia two military transport aircraft C-23B+ Sherpa, which will replace the existing Antonov An-2 aircraft, LETA/Postimees Online reports.
Sherpa C-23B+ is produced by the British company's Shorts Brothers, which today is owned by Bombardier Aerospace. Sherpa planes are strong durable aircraft, which can also be used on soft surface small airfields, and can fly in all weather conditions, said the Estonian Defence Forces Headquarters.
In addition to the three-member crew, the plane can have up to 36 passengers on board. The aircraft's maximum speed is 468 kilometres per hour and a maximum flight distance of 1,900 kilometres.
The planes to be gifted to the Estonian Air Force were used by the US Army. US forces have used the Sherpa C-23B+ type of aircraft since 1985.
Estonian Air Force uses light transport aircraft for tactical gunners and aimers practice, observation flights, medical evacuation operations and different other transport flights in Estonia and outside.
Estonian Air Force expects to receive the airplanes in 2015, after the United States has carried out the corresponding training to Estonian Air Force pilots and plane maintenance crews.
According to the US Army information, eight C-23 Sherpas are given to Estonia, the Philippines and Djibouti.

An estimated 400,000 fewer people in Wisconsin get health insurance through an employer than a decade ago, as fewer employers offer coverage and fewer workers opt to accept it, according to a report released Thursday.
The percentage of the state's population under 65 with health benefits fell to an average of 69.1% for 2010 and 2011 compared with an average of 79% for 1999 and 2000, according to the report financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funds research and projects to improve health and health care.
That compares with a national average of 59.5%, down from 69.7% in 1999 and 2000.
"Wisconsin still enjoys a level of employer-sponsored coverage that is well above the national level," said Julie Sonier, deputy director of the State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota, which did the report.
The rates of coverage in states such as New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, in contrast, ranged from 48% to 52.1%.
In all, an estimated average of 3.3 million employees and their family members in Wisconsin got health insurance through work in 2011, compared with 3.7 million in 2000.
In that time period, the state's population increased by roughly 339,000.
The long-standing decline in people with coverage through an employer continued over the most recent two-year period tracked in the report, falling 0.8 percentage point from the average for 2008 and 2009.
The report found that fewer than half of all employers in Wisconsin - 49.3% - now offer health benefits, compared with 59.9% in 2000.
The sharpest decline was in employers with fewer than 50 employees.
Wisconsin saw the largest drop in the country over the past decade in the percentage of employees in small businesses who are offered health benefits, according to the report.
In 1999 and 2000, an average of 71.8% of the workers at small employers were offered health insurance. By 2010 and 2011, the percentage had fallen to an average of 51.2%.
The report is based on two government surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The estimates are for two-year averages because of the small sample size in some states.
Health reform benchmark
The report provides a benchmark for whether the Affordable Care Act leads to fewer employers offering health benefits.
Any drop will need to be put in perspective of the established trend, said Sonier of the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.
"We document the trend over an entire decade," she said.
Opponents of the Affordable Care Act contend it will result in employers dropping coverage.
But Sonier said that hasn't happened in Massachusetts, which put in place a series of reforms that became a model for the federal law passed in 2010.
An average of 65.2% of employers in Massachusetts offer coverage - down only slightly from 67% a decade ago - and 72.9% of people under 65 in the state get coverage through an employer.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Affordable Care Act could result in anywhere from 3 million people gaining coverage through an employer to 20 million people losing coverage.
About 170 million people now get insurance through an employer.
Other studies also expect relatively small changes in employer coverage, in part because health benefits are not taxed.
Terrence Frett of Frett/Barrington Limited, an insurance broker, said most of his clients with more than 50 employees - those potentially subject to a $2,000 per employee penalty if they don't offer affordable coverage - are waiting to see how the changes from the law play out.
"I don't see a big shift in 2014," Frett said.
At the same time, he expects more small employers to drop coverage.
Employers drop benefits
Matt Weimer, director of employee benefits operations for Diversified Insurance Services, said the reaction varies from client to client, with some employers, particularly small employers, giving thought to no longer offering benefits.
"They've been at the breaking point for some time" Weimer said, "and a number say 'This is it.' "
Larger employers are required to provide affordable health insurance or pay a penalty only for employees who work 30 hours or more a week. That is expected to increase the incentive that employers now have to hire part-time workers who are not eligible for benefits.
"That's definitely going to happen," Frett said.
Large companies that employ a large percentage of low-wage workers, such as big-box retailers and restaurant chains, for example, could limit hours of workers.
Few low-wage workers now get health insurance through an employer.
Nationally, fewer than one in three people in households with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty threshold - $44,700 a year for a family of four - has health insurance through an employer.
In Wisconsin, the percentage is slightly higher: 36.5%.
The cost of providing health insurance, though, also has more than doubled since 2000, according to the report.
In 2011, the average annual premium in Wisconsin was:
• $5,414 for individual coverage, up from $2,664 in 2000.
• $15,024 for family coverage, up from $6,794 in 2000.
If the cost had risen at the same pace as the consumer price index, the premium would be:
• $3,478 as opposed to $5,414 for individual coverage
• $8,875 as opposed to $15,024 for family coverage.
Roughly three out of four employees - 75.4% - in Wisconsin opt to get health insurance through their employer when offered. But that is down from 80% in 2000.

SAN ANTONIO -- At last, San Antonio, you can haz a cat cafe.
San Antonio Cat Cafe will open its doors this summer at 8818 Broadway, a relaxing coffee-house-cum-scratching-post where you can pet and cuddle oodles of adoptable cats and bask in their furry Zen, and even give one a forever home in your own domicile.
Cafe owner Casey Steuart just got the keys and signed the lease for the nonprofit venture, which to date has raised a little more than $18,000 of its $20,000 Go Fund Me goal.
Steuart envisions an easygoing atmosphere as laid back as its four-legged denizens, where you can kick back with or without a feline and have an actual conversation, also with or without a feline.
"You're not going to leave feeling like you're more stressed than when you came in," Steuart said.
You're also not going to leave with a new cat on your first visit. San Antonio Cat Cafe encourages responsible cat adoption, with a vetting process that encourages potential cat parents to visit multiple times to ensure a good fit.
"This is something you can come back to repeatedly (and) feel if this is a right move to get a cat," Steuart said.

In addition to adoptable cats, the S.A. cafe will host live music and a changing art gallery, with light eats as well as beverages of the alcoholic and nonalcoholic persuasion.
Like most cat cafes, San Antonio Cat Cafe will charge a cover fee to help with cat care. And like other cat cafes, the S.A. site will focus on adoptions as well as TNR (trap, neuter and return) for feral cat communities. The cafe also will offer cat care classes as well as cat foods and supplies.
As for the joy of just chilling with the cats, expect a special closed-off Cat Lounge with couches and chairs to curl up with a book, take in a movie or enjoy some other relaxing activity, as so many cats curl their tails around your ankles and curl up in your lap, or just lick their paws in a corner and grace your presence with that delightful indifference cat lovers relish ever so.
And don't worry about hairballs in your latte. The cats are separated from any food and drink prep or common areas, the cafe's website said, though you can take your cafe items into the cat area.

As the San Antonio Cat Cafe website noted, cat cafes are relatively new to the United States but are quite the hit in Asia, Europe and other areas abroad, dating back to the world's first cat cafe that opened in Taipei, Taiwan in 1998.
The U.S. now has more than two-dozen cat cafes, according to a directory at The Catnip Times. Texas cat cafe locations include ones in Dallas, Houston and Austin.

I was having a horrible week. I won't go into lengths, but I was stressed. I plop down into my chair after dealing with yet another stress inducing episode, and in peripheral vision, I see a few packages stuck in the corner of my desk. Wondering what inventory I accidentally overpurchased, I open the first package with dread expectations..
Neatly sliding of the cardboard carrier, I come face to face with a Raspberry Pi. Tucked behind it, a classic NES USB Controller. The next package opened is an enclosure for the Raspberry Pi, followed by a 16 GB microsd memory card.
As I'm exploring the packaging, I become aware of the huge smile that's now taken residence on my face. For that moment, and the rest of the day, I was ecstatic. A whole crap week was completely blown away, and forgotten. Thank you, so much.
Enclosed was a note, from my "Secret Santa". And yes, you were right, Redditor, I will truly enjoy your gift. It's been a pet project in mind to build a console/emulator using the Raspberry Pi.
MAJOR LATE UPDATE: Finally actually sat down, 2 years later, and gathered together all the requirement materials. I had lost the epic transparent case due to moving between 3 different homes, but managed to snag a black case from wish.com
Once booted and all my roms were installed, I spent the better part of last night til the early morning playing battle hunter for the PSX and Castlevania - Harmony for the GBA.
Thank you again, redditor

A massive trove of raw data leaked from the internal database of Panamanian-based law firm Mossack Fonseca suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin funnelled hundreds of millions of euros to individuals in his close circle through offshore entities, using various banks to help hide the money trail, among them Cypriot RCB bank, The Guardian reported on Sunday.
The leak, deemed “the largest in history”, comprises 2.6 terrabytes of data and 11.5 million documents, which reveal extensive use of shell offshore companies globally by heads of state, politicians, celebrities, sports stars, businessmen, and individuals whose names are included in international sanctions lists, presumably in order to keep the transactions private.
According to The Guardian's report, although Putin's name does not appear in any of the records, “the data reveals a pattern – his friends have earned millions from deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage”.
Mossack Fonseca, “the world's fourth biggest offshore law firm”, is a global operation based in Panama with presence in 42 countries, offering, among others, wealth-management services and incorporating offshore companies.
Mossack Fonseca (Cyprus) Ltd, a representative office of the Panamanian company, was registered in Cyprus in 2003.The company asked to be deleted from the registry of companies registered in Cyprus last month. Three individuals were listed on Mossack Fonseca's website as contacts for the Cyprus office.
The report, which followed a year's worth of sifting through the raw data using specialised software and additional investigation by some 400 journalists in over 80 countries, claimed that a series of suspicious-looking transactions have gone through Panama, Russia, Switzerland, and Cyprus, with hundreds of millions in unsecured loans end up with companies controlled by individuals in Putin's close circle.
Although incorporating offshore companies and moving assets through them is not illegal in itself, it is a method often used to hide the true origin of funds and the real beneficiaries.
Investigation focused particularly on Sergei Roldugin, a professional musician and “Putin's best friend”, who has apparently amassed a fortune worth “at least $100 million”.
Among other assets, Roldugin owns 15 per cent of a Cyprus-registered company called Raytar.
The Cyprus connection is further examined with regard to the role of RCB bank, which has apparently extended “enormous unsecured loans” worth over $1 billion, which were subsequently moved by Bank Rossiya, described by The Guardian as Putin's “crony bank”, in which Roldugin also has a 3.2 per cent stake.
The paper said Rodulgin's response to his alleged links to the offshore companies was “no comment”.
Although RCB Cyprus declined to disclose information about its clients, it unofficially denied any allegation of wrongdoing.
In a statement on Monday, the lender refuted the unfounded references made by media as untrue.
“We would like to clarify the following: RCB Bank, as a principal [sic], did not and does not provide unsecured loans,” the bank said.
“The bank always acts in a transparent manner and all information about its activities is available to the relevant Cypriot and European authorities. RCB Bank, in accordance with applicable legislation of the Republic of Cyprus never discloses to third parties, including but not limited to media, any information regarding its clients, their operations and transactions.“
RCB bank, as a significant EU bank, strictly fulfils the requirements of applicable legislation and in its day-to-day activities employs Anti-Money Laundering procedures to the full extent which conform to the highest standards, the bank added.
“The bank's operations and procedures are under continuous scrutiny by the Central Bank of Cyprus and the European Central Bank,” it argued.
“Additionally, an audit was also conducted by Deloitte Italy, within the framework agreed between the Government of Cyprus and the Troika.”
In a brief statement, the Central Bank of Cyprus said it has taken note of the allegations and will take appropriate action as necessary.
“With regard to press reports citing leaked documents, known as the Panama Papers, the Central Bank of Cyprus announces that it is assessing the information to the extent that it may concern the Cypriot banking system and taking, where necessary, appropriate action,” the CBC said.
Founded in 1985, and known as Russian Commercial Bank until 2013, the Limassol-based lender boasts such eminent members of Cyprus' economic and political elite on its board of directors as Economics Nobel laureate Christoforos Pissarides, former foreign minister Erato Kozakou-Markoulli, former attorney general Petros Clerides, former permanent secretary at the ministries of finance and justice Andreas Tryfonides, and former ambassador and permanent secretary at the foreign ministry Sotos Zakheos.
In the hectic days of March 2013, when Cyprus was in the throes of working out a deal with its Eurozone partners over seizing uninsured bank deposits in Cyprus in exchange for a bailout loan, Cypriot deputies were warned by people “close to the Russian government” that, should a horizontal deposit seizure that would include cash in RCB be imposed, Russia's reaction would be harsh, DIKO MP Marios Garoyian said in October 2014.
According to the deputy – who was DIKO's leader in 2013 – this was one of the key drivers for parliament's ‘no' vote to the first bailout proposal, which included a ‘levy' on deposits across the Cypriot banking system. A subsequent proposal, which included the seizure of uninsured deposits from Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank, went unopposed by the Russian government.
“The message was delivered to me clearly, and I imagine to the other deputies, too – even if many now deny it,” he said.
According to Garoyian, the warning referred to RCB explicitly and made no mention to Russian nationals' deposits at other banks.

How YOUR State Should Respond to Obama's Health Care Reform
Obama's health care reform will likely pass in some form even with the efforts of those who have bravely railed against such lunacy. The dorks on Capitol Hill aren't concerned with a majority of Americans who oppose such poppycock. Neither are these elitists troubled that the States are being sucked of every ounce of power which the constitution squarely reserves to them. In my estimation, these political punks are starting to look as the European tyrants must have looked to our Beloved Founding Fathers some 233 years ago.
Unfortunately, the health care bill is certain to soil everyone's britches when they see just how much their taxes will go up! I believe the protests should continue, but I also believe that now is the time for the States to step in and declare their right to reject the Federal usurpation of its authority. It's time for a Declaration of Nullification by each State. And believe it or not, nullification is an American political tradition which goes all the way back to Founders Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.
In 1798 Thomas J. and Mr. Madison put together resolutions for two states which felt that the Federal government had stepped beyond their sphere of jurisdiction. The resolution said in part, “the … States …are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general [federal] government.”
And after speaking of the power of the States (10th amendment), look closely at these words from the Wise One: “and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force.” I like that last part, “unauthoritative, void, and of no force.” Wow. When our federal friends step beyond their realm of power, the States have it within their own power to individually nullify those Federal laws. That's deep, my friends.
How is it done, you ask? Just like it was done back then. Right now our leaders on the State level need to begin drafting Resolutions of Nullification much like several States have recently achieved with a Declaration of Sovereignty. Go Oklahoma! The resolutions should say that the constitution reserves the right of health care to the States and that any legislation imposed on our State regarding this Obama health care reform shall be declared unauthoritative, void, and of no force, and will immediately be nullified by this State if such is passed.
I'm convinced that the protests are helping. Now it's time for our State officials to join the struggle. It's my fervent belief that a Declaration of Nullification by a good percentage of the States just might help. Will it solve our problem? Nobody knows, but the surest and only way to get back any power we still might have is to declare it now before it's everlastingly too late.

A little over six years ago,metal lost one of it's greatest legends, Ronnie James Dio. To celebrate his legacy, we will be getting a box set called A Decade of Dio: 1983-1993. The CD version of the box set is scheduled for July 22nd, while the vinyl version is set for an October 4th date. This collection contains the first five Dio albums. I was able to speak with former Dio guitarist Craig Goldy to promote the release. He also discussed his friendship with the artist and how he was similar to Bruce Lee.
Can you tell us a bit about this new box set?
I am happy this is going to happen. We started the Dio's Disciples band several years after Ronnie passed away. We did it because every family that loses a family member, they will often do things to keep the loved ones memory alive. So that is how that band got birthed. What we started noticing, is that a lot of teen age fans were coming to the shows. They told us about how they discovered Dio because their parents were fans of his or how they first heard “Holy Diver” when it was in Guitar Hero: Rock The 80's. It was really interesting that a newer generation had emerged. We felt it was a great idea to have the first ten years of Dio's solo band remastered and re-introduced for both the people who have always been there as well people who will be hearing these albums for the first time.
Are their any plans for the next set of albums to be released in a box set like this?
Yes. We definitely will. I think they just wanted to do it in sets instead of doing the whole entire thing at once. I can't really speak for Wendy Dio myself, but there are certain albums that certain record companies control the rights to certain albums. It's not really a mater of control, but more of a matter of everyone wants to do it and of who to contact to put the deal together. I can only speak for myself but, I think they decided to do it in halves. Almost like The Very Best of Dio Vol 1 and 2. So their are other albums like Magica and a few others that will be remastered for re-release. What they could be waiting for is this track me and Ronnie were writing for Magica II. There is an unfinished song that the band plans on finishing and releasing. That will either be part of Magica as a bonus track or released as a single on its on. It's all just speculation right now.
When you first joined Dio for the Dream Evil album, were you nervous and or excited about playing with one of metal's biggest vocalists?
Yes, extremely nervous and extremely excited. He was and still is my favorite singer. Me joining his band stems back to when we first met. We first met during auditions for Rough Cutt. When Jake E. Lee left the band to join Ozzy after Randy Rhoads died, there was an opening in Rough Cutt. At the time I was working with a singer named Terry Mcarty. Him and I were in a local San Diego band together. He would then leave to join a band called Warrior. Warrior was friends with Rough Cutt who were managed by Wendy Dio and produced by Ronnie James Dio, so they were having auditions to replace Jake, and everyone in L.A was ready to go. They were all established from playing in local bands. But I had made a demo, living in my car because I grew up in a abusive family. I left home at the age of 14 and I was living in my car.
With the last 20 dollars I made giving guitar lessons, I made a demo. Since the singer was now in Warrior, the copies of the demo got to Rough Cutt and then to Ronnie James Dio, who said “we have to get this kid up here”. The only problem was how do you find a kid who lives in his car? Somehow they found me. They set me up there with Wendy and Ronnie. They rented amps and cables for me. Dio and I became friend immediately. One night when we were working on demos for Rough Cutt, Ronnie turned me and told me if Vivian Campbell ever left his band, I would be his first choice. When Vivian left, since Ronnie was a man of his word and we had a great relationship, I was added to his band.
It must be awesome that your musical idol became one of your closest friends.
It really is. It's really surreal. I never got over it. It never became secondary or common place. Somewhere deep inside I was this nervous little kid. “Man I'm on stage with Ronnie James Dio”. “I'm recording an album with Ronnie James Dio.” It never went away. I think that is why Ronnie was always loved by fans. He treated his fans like family because he started out as one and didn't forget where he came from. He knows how It's like to meet his own heroes and work beside them, like with Richie Blackmore and Tony Iommi. He saw the excited and ready to go me and it reminded him about how he felt joining Rainbow and Black Sabbath.
Speaking of Rainbow, what are your thoughts on Dio's older projects? As in the ones before Rainbow.
Well I was never a big fan of Elf, but they do have some good tracks and you can hear a lot of the Elf influences on the first Rainbow record. Elf was opening up for Deep Purple. This was when Richie Blackmore was not pleased with the direction Deep Purple was heading. Every night of that tour Richie would hear Dio's voice during their set and was very impressed. One night he told Ronnie that he didn't want to be in Deep Purple anymore and Rainbow was born. On their second record, Rainbow Rising, the band changed heavy metal and hard rock forever. I never really got a chance to hear much of what he did before Elf. I remember one time I was on tour with Dio and I watched the video for “Love Is All” by Roger Glover and I could have sworn the singer sounded like Ronnie. I asked him and he said yes. The Ronnie James Dio I am mostly a fan of is Rainbow and later.
Same here. Dio found who he really was when he joined Rainbow.
Exactly. There is an evolution to everything. It's kind of like how Bruce Lee was Kato on the Green Hornet and Batman shows and then later became the martial arts hero he will forever be remembered for. This hero was who he was all along, he just needed to grow into that. The same can be said for Ronnie. He always had that universe inside of him, he just had to find a way to harness it. Even in Rainbow and Black Sabbath he was still evolving. When he formed his solo band is when he was able to reach his full potential. The man was a master of lyric writing and he peaked at this with his solo band.
S.F. takes new direction on homeless camps with 1-stop aid center

Justin Gember has a prison record and a hopeless sense that he'll never trade his soggy orange tent for a place with a roof. He's a gaunt string-bean of a man sleeping under Highway 101 near Potrero Hill with a colony of about 25 other homeless people, and every attempt by street counselors to move him inside has failed.
He's exactly the kind of guy Bevan Dufty wants for his new effort to help the poorest of the poor get new lives.
The plan being spearheaded by the San Francisco mayor's point man on homelessness is to create a one-stop homeless aid center in the heart of the Mission District that's unlike any seen in America. It will be an airy complex where entire existing encampments of hard-core homeless can be moved in — tents, carts, dogs, girlfriends, boyfriends, you name it — and housed for up to 10 days while an army of aid workers finds them permanent housing.
The complex is being called a Navigation Center. And though some of its techniques have been successfully used before, particularly in Philadelphia and San Diego, no other city has tried this exact approach. It will begin in the spring with a big push in and around the rapidly gentrifying Mission District, where panhandlers and heaped shopping carts are increasingly contrasting unhappily with cash-flush techies and gourmet restaurants.
Usually, when an encampment is broken up, aid workers offer shelter beds and other assistance as the angry campers start heading for the hills. Some take the offers, but much wind up doing what happened in December when San Jose officials busted up the huge Jungle encampment — about half spread out like melted Jell-O into new camps.
Cycle of frustration
Cleanup efforts are also thwarted when campers who do land in housing feel alienated or guilty because they abandoned their street community — and they go back to it.
The new center hopes to shatter that cycle of frustration.
Overwhelmed service providers, policy leaders in other cities and street people are eager to see what happens. So are neighborhoods aching to get rid of homeless camps that have been burgeoning as tech-driven housing costs and gentrification shove them into new urban nooks and crannies.
“I don't know how it would ever be possible to help me, and I don't really trust the system much, but hey — if they can get me and my friends into some kind of center like they're talking about, we might give it a try,” Gember, 33, said as he tied off the entrance to his tent on San Bruno Avenue to go forage for food.
Promising fast results
Steve Woods, 49, gestured down San Bruno with impatience. “Look, I've got a brother and sister-in-law in that tent right down there,” he said. “My girlfriend and I aren't going anywhere separately. A lot of us have prison records. We support each other out here.
“We're not easy to get inside, but let me tell you this,” Woods said. “You know what I want more than anything else? A place to live. A new start. Give me a chance for that, and we'll talk.”
Bring it on, says Dufty along with the other city homeless-aid leaders who are assembling the center.
“We've listened to what people on the street say doesn't work for them, and the whole idea of this center is to take away the reasons accepting help and moving inside doesn't work for you,” he said as he inspected the complex's busy construction site on Mission Street near 16th Street. “There is going to be a very low threshhold for coming in here — we're talking no curfew, you can bring all your possessions, you can stay as a couple, bring your dog.”
Once in the center, the goal is to move people within three to 10 days to permanent rooms, rehabilitation centers, bus rides home or anything else that can lead to stable lives — and will stick.
From creating thousands of counseling-enriched supportive housing units to the periodic Project Homeless Connect daylong, one-stop help fairs, the city has long gone the extra yard to help its street people. But nothing has been that one magic bullet. The always nettling challenge has been to deal with acutely troubled people who resent the constraints of shelters, distrust government and are afraid to leave their survival routines in the street — and legally can't be forced to take help.
If this latest attempt doesn't work, “we'll move on to another,” Dufty said cheerily. It's currently penciled in as an eight- to 10-month pilot project.
Unified approach
Bending over backward to convince an indigent to take offered assistance seems counterintuitive, but studies show that moving a chronically homeless person out of the gutter actually saves cities money. According to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and the United Way, someone living hard-core on the street costs more than $60,000 a year in police busts, emergency ambulance rides and the like, compared with about $20,000 in a government-funded supportive housing unit with counselors on-site to provide help.
Those hard-core, long-term homeless — often suffering substance abuse or mental illness — are the ones the Navigation Center will target, not people who just lost a job and bounced temporarily onto the sidewalk.
The center will be housed in rehabilitated buildings at a closed-down school, and it's expected to be significantly funded by private contributions. Several city agencies, including the Police Department and the Human Services Agency, will participate, along with nonprofits such as the Mission Neighborhood Resource Center and the Homeless Youth Alliance.
Key to the project's success will be the creation this year of 500 new supportive housing units announced by Mayor Ed Lee this month. The units will not just be lumped into huge complexes, but spread throughout other developments and smaller residence hotels away from traditionally troubled areas such as the Tenderloin — and they will come with added counseling, a crucial element for helping people stay inside.
The new units are also to be partly funded by private donations, and the nonprofit HomeBase is conducting an exhaustive study to locate available spots for the city to lease.
“We're lucky to have this site available for the center, because we want an area where there's enough space and a level of care where we can really help people move forward,” Lee said. “If we can get a workable model from this, we'll see if we can pitch for more funding and a new location to take it further.”
Street counselors have long said that if you can deal with whole communities instead of individuals, the whole process of getting to a stable life moves more quickly — and Dufty found this out firsthand in 2013 when the then-biggest encampment in the city, a sprawling mound of tents and trash at the Interstate 280 on-ramp alongside the Caltrain station, was broken up. All 30 campers were put up in a church auditorium for almost a week instead of just being offered housing vouchers or shelter beds, and within days all but five had been moved into permanent spots.
“It actually worked, and we want to build on that,” Dufty said.
A similar effort involving Pathways to Housing in Philadelphia has moved 450 severely mentally ill homeless people inside over six years, and the one-stop Connections Housing center in San Diego reduced homelessness downtown by more than half after it opened in 2013. But they didn't deal with entire camps at once — that's a San Francisco innovation.
“It's actually a brilliant idea to bring in a displaced community of people,” Chris Simiriglia, Pathways' executive director, said of San Francisco's plan. “It hasn't been tried before exactly like this.”
1 encampment at a time
Dufty estimates as many as 400 people sleep in tents and bags in and around the Mission District, which is the most critical camping region of the city. The goal is to bring them in one encampment at a time, with groups no bigger than 25 or 30 at once so aid workers can give good attention to each person. Boozing and doping will not be allowed on-site, but counselors will work on a “harm reduction” model that lets addicts draw down slowly on their habits in ways that are still being worked out.
Trent Rhorer, executive director of the city's Human Services Agency, said speed will be of the essence.
“We don't want this to just become a shelter for people for weeks or months,” he said. “This is not going to be an environment for 150 or 100 people at a time. It's for smaller groups where we can really handle it.”
After helping oversee San Francisco's primary homeless initiatives for more than a decade, Rhorer called the planned center “an entirely new thing.”
“One thing we're trying to do is respond to the frustration we've been hearing from merchants, residents and employees from certain parts of the city about encampments just moving block to block and never going away,” Rhorer said.
Coordination hurdles
Homeless policy leaders across the region are eager to see how this will work, particularly in Santa Clara County, where chaos attended the breakup of the 300-strong Jungle homeless camp. Though officials say more than half of the Jungle denizens have now moved inside, the problem is getting worse — there are now 100 more encampments in Santa Clara than before the Jungle's dismantlement.
Ray Bramson, homeless services manager for San Jose, likes the concept of one-stop help complexes such as the Navigation Center, although he warns it can be hard maintaining funding and that getting all the agencies to coordinate can be “like herding cats.” But he has high hopes.
“San Francisco's project sounds great, and we'll be paying attention to see how it goes,” he said. “Having that kind of targeted approach is a recipe for success.”

Eastland Center has gone into receivership after the mall owners stopped making loan payments.
U.S. District Court Judge Gershwin Drain last month appointed New York-based Spinoso Management Group as receiver of the property in Harper Woods.
New Eastland Mall Developer LLC, a part of Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp., owes more than $42.4 million of the $46 million it borrowed in 2006, according to a complaint filed in May in U.S. District Court.
Eastland Center is listed as being in foreclosure because the company is more than 90 days late on loan payments, said Sean Barrie, a research analyst for Trepp LLC, a New York-based company that tracks commercial mortgage-backed securities.
“That does not mean that they are ready to foreclose on the property or loan,” Barrie said. “They could pursue it as a possibility while the special servicer finds some way to find some stable tenants.”
In March, the loan was transferred to Needham, Mass.-based CWCapital Asset Management LLC for special servicing.
Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. also owned the now-closed Northland Center in Southfield. Representatives did not immediately return calls seeking comment Monday evening.
At the end of 2014, the 1.4 million-square-foot Eastland Center had an occupancy rate of 76 percent. In the first quarter of 2015, that number jumped to 89 percent, Barrie said. “That's a nice increase, but many (tenants) are month to month,” Barrie said. “I would take that with a grain of salt.”
In 2011, Sears announced it would close store there.
Barrie also noted that the appraisal value of one of two loans that make up the original $46 million debt — a $37.2 million balance on an original $39.5 million — is now worth only $9.7 million.
“They've determined the current balance of the loan isn't reflecting what the loan is worth,” he said.
Eastland has long been plagued by incidents of crime. One of the most recent was Mother's Day, when the mall closed for the day after a suspect fired three shots inside the center.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is prepared to impose sanctions of up to C$1 billion ($980 million) a year against the United States unless it complies with a WTO order to redesign its meat labels, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said on Tuesday.
The United States introduced country of origin labels for meat in 2009. Mexico and Canada successfully argued before the World Trade Organization that the labels were discriminatory and Washington has until May 23 this year to change them.
The Canadians and Mexicans want Washington to comply with the WTO ruling that it must amend its meat labeling rules. The labels right now identify where beef, pork, chicken and lamb sold in the United States come from.
The rules cut U.S. imports of Canadian pigs and cattle sharply because it raised costs for U.S. packers who must now segregate imported animals from U.S. livestock.
Ritz said Canada would consider imposing “extensive retaliatory measures” if the United States failed to act and noted Canadian beef and pork producers complained the rules were costing them C$1 billion a year in lost sales.
“We're looking for those kinds of dollars in retaliatory action. Should the Americans put in place the proper response to the WTO ... then this won't be required,” he told reporters from Washington after talks with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
“As a country we are more than prepared to apply retaliatory measures to recoup that billion dollars,” he said.
Last month the United States sought to address the dispute by proposing stricter rules for labeling meat but Ritz said the new measures fell far short of what was needed.

Document shows a narrower definition of term ‘family member' and confirms European case law will no longer be binding on the UK
The leaked Home Office document on Britain's post-Brexit immigration policy spells out for the first time how ending the jurisdiction of the European court of justice will weaken family reunion rights for EU nationals in Britain.
The right – under which EU nationals can bring family members, including spouses, to live with them in the UK – is already a flashpoint in the Brexit talks on citizens' rights. But the leaked document shows the Home Office wants to go further and extend restrictions that could turn thousands more into “Skype families”.
The document also confirms that the forthcoming immigration bill will only “switch off” regulations implementing EU free movement rules. The bulk of the new transitional and final immigration system will be introduced through secondary legislation that has minimal parliamentary scrutiny.
On family rights, the draft document says withdrawing from the European court of justice will mean that, for those who come to Britain after Brexit, European case law will no longer be binding on the UK.
Home Office document exposes heart of Theresa May's Brexit Read more
For the first time it cites specific examples, quoting three cases in particular – Zambrano, Surinder Singh and Metock – which it claims have given “EU nationals rights to enter and remain in the UK which they would not otherwise have”.
The Home Office says that Metock has allowed a non-EU national illegally in the UK to remain if they form a genuine relationship with an EU citizen. Surinder Singh has allowed non-EU nationals who are partners of UK nationals who been legally living in another EU member state to become resident in Britain under EU, not UK, rules.
The Home Office also says it wants to tighten the definition of a family member. Officials say they “will no longer apply the EU definition of ‘extended' family members where there is virtually no limit on the distance of the relationship between the EU citizen and the extended family member, as long as they provide valid proof of the relationship between them”.
Post-Brexit Britain intends to define family members as “direct family members”, which will include only partners, children under 18 and adult-dependent relatives. Others to stay under EU “derivative rights”, such as the non-EU carer of a British child, will also lose the right to stay in Britain.
The leak of the Home Office document prompted strong reactions across the political divide. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, said her committee would demand answers from ministers because it suggested the government was not prepared to wait and listen to independent advice on the issue.
“This document seems to contradict the home secretary's decision just over a month ago to ask the Migration Advisory Committee to provide all the evidence to underpin a new immigration policy,” Cooper said.
Post-Brexit immigration: 10 key points from the Home Office document Read more
“Why have they asked the MAC to do a major programme of work if they have already decided what they want to do?” she added, saying there were rumours that No 10 disagreed with the decision to commission the independent review.
Cooper argued that the government's process for developing policy was “completely confused” and asked if any assessment had been made about the relationship between immigration proposals and any trade or single market deal.
There was also an immediate response from Europe, with Elmar Brok, the German MEP who is one of the European parliament's Brexit officials, warning it would deepen mistrust at a key point of the negotiations.
He told the Guardian that the “harsh language”, the March 2019 start date, and the time limits on skilled and unskilled workers showed “there is not any sensitivity about this issue when we talk about the rights of citizens”.
The draft Home Office post-Brexit immigration policy document in full Read more
“This will increase the lack of credibility and deepen mistrust,” added Brok, who suggested the proposals would make it harder to reach agreement on the Brexit divorce by October.
If the government followed the logic of the Home Office paper, the UK would find it very hard to avoid a Brexit cliff edge. Such tough restrictions would rule out staying in the single market or the European Economic Area.
Michiel van Hulten, a former MEP who is a visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics, said: “These proposals take hard Brexit to their logical conclusion – a clean break with the legacy of EU membership. In that sense there's no surprise. But if the UK wants to secure a transition period … as has been suggested recently, this is completely the wrong way to go about it.”
Labour's frontbench response came from shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who said the leak was “not yet government policy” and her party would judge it against criteria laid down if it became that.
“Labour wants fair rules and reasonable management of migration in accordance with the needs of our economy and our values as a party,” she added. However, Abbott has argued strongly that her party should hold its nerve over the issue of immigration.
The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: “It's no wonder these back-of-an-envelope plans are causing rows between ministers. They would do nothing to tackle falling living standards and insecure jobs.”
London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the plan “read like a blueprint on how to strangle [the capital's] economy” that also “risks thousands of families being split up”. He added: “I respect the outcome of the EU referendum, but the British people did not vote to make our country and future generations poorer.”
Steve Peers, professor of EU law at Essex University, said the Home Office interpretation of the role of the European court of justice was “highly misleading”.
“The repeal bill will end ECJ jurisdiction for post-Brexit judgments but maintain pre-Brexit rulings as precedent,” he said. “What the government means to say is that it wishes to overturn these pre-Brexit ECJ rulings immediately – a derogation from the normal rule.”
Peers added in a series of tweets that the Home Office statement that there was “virtually no limit” on the extended family that an EU migrant could bring to Britain was a “highly misleading and inflammatory” claim that no competent civil servant should sign.
He quoted the clause on EU free movement law clause on extended family and said that its reference to “shall … facilitate” did not amount to a right to enter.

THE GUERRILLA ANGEL REPORT — Zeroing in on what is becoming commonplace throughout Europe and elsewhere, a Cambridge University (UK) law professor lecturing in Hong Kong at a transgender conference argued the surgery requirement for trans legal status needs to be eliminated.
Dr. Jens M. Scherpe spoke at the conference he helped organize at the University of Hong Kong. He urged that the British model be followed when writing the legislation as it is compatible with existing HK law.
Scherpe believes Hong Kong is not quite on board the recognition of trans people and urges the government to begin to do so. Case in point from the source article — 77% respondents to a business survey did not know what “transgender” meant.

Asia isn't exactly a hotbed of transgender equality even though they're home to some of the strongest economies in the world. Gaining a foothold in Asia is necessary and more important, doable.

Apparently, as long as violent leftists label their victims "fascists," they are free to set fires, smash windows and beat civilians bloody. No police officer will stop them. They have carte blanche to physically assault anyone they disapprove of, including Charles Murray, Heather Mac Donald, Ben Shapiro, me and Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as anyone who wanted to hear us speak.Even far-left liberals like Evergreen State professor Bret Weinstein will be stripped of police protection solely because the mob called him a "racist."If the liberal shock troops deem local Republicans "Nazis" -- because some of them support the duly elected Republican president -- Portland will cancel the annual Rose Festival parade rather than allow any Trump supporters to march.They're all "fascists"! Ipso facto, the people cracking their skulls and smashing store windows are "anti-fascists," or as they call themselves, "antifa."We have no way of knowing if the speakers at the Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally last weekend were "Nazis," "white supremacists" or passionate Civil War buffs, inasmuch as they weren't allowed to speak. The Democratic governor shut the event down, despite a court order to let it proceed.We have only visuals presented to us by the activist media, showing some participants with Nazi paraphernalia. But for all we know, the Nazi photos are as unrepresentative of the rally as that photo of the drowned Syrian child is of Europe's migrant crisis. Was it 1 percent Nazi or 99 percent Nazi?As the "Unite the Right" crowd was dispersing, they were forced by the police into the path of the peace-loving, rock-throwing, fire-spraying antifa. A far-left reporter for The New York Times, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, tweeted live from the event: "The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right. I saw club-wielding 'antifa' beating white nationalists being led out of the park."
That's when protestor James Fields sped his car into a crowd of the counter-protesters, then immediately hit reverse, injuring dozens of people, and killing one woman, Heather Heyer.This has been universally labeled "terrorism," but we still don't know whether Fields hit the gas accidentally, was in fear for his life or if he rammed the group intentionally and maliciously.With any luck, we'll unravel Fields' motives faster than it took the Obama administration to discern the motives of a Muslim shouting "Allahu Akbar!" while gunning down soldiers at Fort Hood. (Six years.)But so far, all we know is that Fields said he was "upset about black people" and wanted to kill as many as possible. On his Facebook page, he displayed a "White Power" poster and "liked" three organizations deemed "white separatist hate groups" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. A subsequent search of his home turned up bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics.Actually, none of that is true. The paragraph above describes, down to the letter, what was known about Micah Xavier Johnson, the black man who murdered five Dallas cops a year ago during a Black Lives Matter demonstration. My sole alteration to the facts is reversing the words "black" and "white."President Obama held a news conference the next day to say it's "very hard to untangle the motives." The New York Times editorialized agnostically that many "possible motives will be ticked off for the killer." (One motive kind of sticks out like a sore thumb to me.)In certain cases, the media are quite willing to jump to conclusions. In others, they seem to need an inordinate amount of time to detect motives.The media think they already know all there is to know about James Fields, but they also thought they knew all about the Duke lacrosse players, "gentle giant" Michael Brown and those alleged gang-rapists at the University of Virginia.Waiting for facts is now the "Nazi" position.Liberals have Republicans over a barrel because they used the word "racist." The word is kryptonite, capable of turning the entire GOP and 99 percent of the "conservative media" into a panicky mass of cowardice.This week, Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- among others -- instructed us that masked liberals hitting people with baseball bats are pure of heart --they first label the likes of Charles Murray or some housewife in a "MAGA" hat "fascists."Luckily, the week before opening fire on Republicans, critically injuring House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Bernie Sanders-supporter James Hodgkinson had used the vital talisman, calling the GOP "fascist." So you see, he wasn't trying to commit mass murder! He was just fighting "Nazis." Rubio and Romney will be expert witnesses.And let's recall the response of Hillary Clinton to the horrifying murder of five Dallas cops last year. The woman who ran against Trump displayed all the moral blindness currently being slanderously imputed to him.In an interview on CNN about the slaughterHillary barely paused to acknowledge the five dead officers -- much less condemn the shooting -- before criticizing police for their "implicit bias" six times in about as many minutes.What she really wanted to talk about were the two recent police shootings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis, refusing to contradict Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton's claim that the Minneapolis shooting was based on racism.Officers in both cases were later found innocent of any wrongdoing. Either the left has had a really bad streak of luck on their police brutality cases, or bad cops are a lot rarer than they think.Some people would not consider the mass murder of five white policemen by an anti-cop nut in the middle of a BLM protest a good jumping-off point for airing BLM's delusional complaints about the police. It would be like responding to John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted murder of President Reagan by denouncing Jodie Foster for not dating him.Or, to bring it back to Charlottesville, it would be as if Trump had responded by expounding on the kookiest positions of "Unite the Right" -- just as Hillary's response echoed the paranoid obsessions of the cop-killer. Trump would have quickly skipped over the dead girl and railed against black people, Jews and so on.That is the precise analogy to what Hillary did as the bodies of five Dallas cops lay in the morgue.Thank God Donald J.

A topic of discussion among many fans lately is whether Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. will renegotiate with Marvel Studios for future appearances in their films. The Hollywood Reporter says that the actor met with Kevin Feige and many other executives last night to begin laying out the groundwork for his return. Insiders say that the negotiations looked to his return as the character in the upcoming Avengers 2 and a third “Avengers” film. A fourth Iron Man film was said to not be included in the talks as it is unclear if Downey Jr. is interested in another stand-alone feature as the character.
Beyond the news that Marvel is developing a third “Avengers” movie, THR also revealed that the studio has scripts in development for Ms. Marvel and a reboot of the character Blade (whose screenrights were recently returned to Marvel). Other films still in the pipeline at Marvel, with no production date in sight, include Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, Black Panther and The Runaways.
Furthermore, Kevin Feige spoke with Collider and said there are currently no plans to make spin-off films for the characters War Machine (played by Don Cheadle) or The Falcon (Anthony Mackie in the upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier).
Which of these movies do you want to see in the future? Would you rather have an Avengers 3 than Iron Man 4? Sound off below!

Eric Pickles, a 62-year-old white Christian male, has told the Muslim Council of Britain it has a “precious opportunity, and an important responsibility: in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity.”
Is Pickles, the Minister for Communities and Local Government, suggesting Muslims haven't yet demonstrated they're a part of British identity? How, exactly, are they meant to? David Cameron quickly defended his minister, suggesting anyone who “has a problem” with these comments “really has a problem”.
One might suggest the radicalisation of a tiny minority of Muslims is more a fault of a government responsible for multiple Middle Eastern conflicts than the MCB. But how many British Muslims are there? How old are they? And is Britain really a “Christian nation”, as Eric Pickles suggested earlier this year?
First, nearly 5 per cent of Britons identified as Muslim in the 2011 Census. That's 2.7 million people.
In his letter to the MCB, Pickles called on the council to “lay out more clearly than ever before what being a British Muslim means today: proud of your faith and proud of your country”. Some commentators – including Jonathan Sacks, the former Chief Rabbi – noted a recent poll showed Muslims are actually prouder of Britain than the typical Briton.
The poll was only based on 48 people, which makes its margin of error too high to be meaningful, but it still hints at a wider point: it's unclear what basis Pickles has for implying Muslims need to reiterate their patriotism. It's also unclear whether associating foreign terrorist attacks with British Muslims helps them to be proud of their faith.
As a 62-year-old Pickles is unlikely to be a British Muslim, or have many friends who are. Only 1.4 per cent of his age group (60 to 64) believe in Islam. 73 per cent are Christians.
This data, from the 2011 Census, suggests at least 45 per cent of every age group is Christian.
But the British Humanist Association don't think we are nearly so pious. They think the Census question – “What is your religion?” – is loaded. It implies you have one. If people are instead asked whether they “are religious”, two in three Britons say they aren't.
Similarly, in 2012, the British Social Attitudes survey found 46 per cent of us wouldn't say we “belong” to a religion, and only one in seven attend weekly religious services.
These findings are likely to chime with younger voters. 18-29 year olds – that age group pursued by broadcasters, advertisers and publishers – are the most irreligious Britons. More than a third of them say they have no religion.
Few pensioners feel the same way. The vast majority of them are religious – and Christian.
This is the image of Britain Eric Pickles presumably pictured when he penned today's letter, or when he criticised “militant atheists” for imposing their “political correct intolerance on others” in April.
Was today's letter tolerant? Read it in full here.
In the weeks and months immediately following 9/11, one of the most touching responses in my neighborhood, not far Ground Zero, was the overwhelming support of police and fire departments from around the country. Across the street from my apartment, at the 6th Precinct headquarters from which two officers had rushed to the scene and died, every day a different police contingent from a different town in America guarded our street. And a couple of blocks away, at the Squad 18 firehouse, which lost seven men on September 11, fellow firefighters from all overcame to stand vigil and pay their respects. Solidarity.
All this came back to me when the memorial was held a couple of weeks ago for the 19 firemen who died battling the Yarnell Hill wildfire in Arizona. The tragedy was the worst to befall firefighters since the World Trade Center came down, and the most deadly in eighty years for the men and women who dedicate themselves to taming blazes in the wilderness.

Thousands jammed into an arena in Prescott Valley, Ariz., with the overflow of the crowd in an adjoining parking lot, standing, listening and mourning under the desert sun. There were firefighters there from Phoenix, Tucson and Yuma, but also from Sacramento, Los Angeles – and New York.
Nine days before, the crew members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots had been fatally overtaken by flames and smoke. When the winds picked up and the fire changed direction, surging four miles in twenty minutes, they were trapped, surrounded in a box canyon, trying to save themselves under emergency fire shelters that melted from the heat.
Anyone who has ever been in the middle of a serious fire knows how terrifying they are and unpredictable, even for those like the hotshots, with their courage, skills and conditioning. Much of what gets them through is their camaraderie and the knowledge that what they do saves lives and property. The least we can do is stand in solidarity behind them, but on both a micro and macro level, our stalwart U.S. Congress, aided and abetted by government bureaucracy, is cutting Western firefighters' lifeline much as it did when members of the House initially balked at aid for sick and dying 9/11 first responders. This, despite their publicly professed pride in the men and women who rush into danger when the rest of us rush out to safety.
“In May, Obama administration officials warned that sequester cuts would inhibit the nation's ability to effectively fight wildfires in the West,” Derek Pugh wrote in the progressive Campaign for America's Future blog on July 1. “… Budget cuts are putting the lives of our firefighters and those who live in and near forests at an unacceptably high risk.
“… The automatic spending cuts have forced the U.S. Forest Service to shed 500 firefighters, between 50 and 70 fire trucks and two aircraft in this year's budget. The sequester will leave agencies $115 million short of normal firefighting capacity, meaning that 200,000 fewer acres will be treated to prevent fires.”
Fighting actual fires has meant shifting money from fire prevention, which in a Catch-22-like situation may actually create more and worse fires in the future. And, according to the Climate Desk at Mother Jones magazine, “…The agency's next proposed budget cuts preventative spending by a further 24 percent.
“It's all part of what fire ecologists, environmentalists, and firefighters interviewed by Climate Desk describe as an increasingly distorted federal budget that has apparently forgotten the old adage about an ounce of prevention: It pours billions ($2 billion in 2012) into fighting fires but skimps on cheap, proven methods for stopping megafires before they start.”
This worry was echoed by four Western senators in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget and other cabinet departments – written, coincidentally, on the very day the fatal Yarnell Hill fire began: “This approach to paying for firefighting is nonsensical and further increases wildland fire costs.” And a May report from Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute “found that the bulk of the costs from megafires are borne not by the federal government but by local governments – and the federal budgeting process ignores those bills when weighing whether prevention saves money.”

As for the macro, the simple fact that we refuse to take legislative action to curb climate change is part of the reason fires will continue to worsen. “Big wildfires… thrive in dry air, low humidity and high winds,” James West reports in Mother Jones. “Climate change is going to make those conditions more frequent over the next century. We know because it's already happening: A University of Arizona report from 2006 found that large forest fires have occurred more often in the western United States since the mid-1980s as spring temperatures increased, snow melted earlier, and summers got hotter, leaving more and drier fuels for fires to devour.”
“Thomas Tidwell, the head of the United States Forest Service, told a Senate committee on energy and natural resources recently that the fire season now lasts two months longer and destroys twice as much land as it did four decades ago. Fires now, he said, burn the same amount of land faster.”
It's part of that “new normal” you keep hearing about – drought, heat, earlier growing seasons, new insect infestations, global air and water currents, like the Gulf jet stream, shifting. And fewer trees mean less carbon dioxide being absorbed by them, more CO2 given off when the remaining ones burn, which adds to the warming and more fires… you get the picture.
“The West is burning,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid recently told reporters. “We have climate change. You can't deny it.” And if you don't believe him, listen to Dr. Michael Medler, a scientist at Western Washington University who used to be a wildland firefighter himself. “On the firelines, it is clear that global warming is changing fire behavior, creating longer fire seasons, and causing more frequent, large-scale, high severity wildfires,” he told a House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. “Many firefighters have commented that they are facing more extreme fire behavior than they have witnessed in their lifetimes.”
The good news is that Dr. Medler says some of his colleagues speculate there's a ten-year “window of opportunity to… have some control over fire behavior with desirable effects…”

The bad news is he said that nearly six years ago. The Granite Mountain Hotshots have just finished burying their dead.

Little Eustace Uzoma plays happily in a Tel Aviv park, near the home in which she has lived ever since she was born.
The shy five-year-old speaks fluent Hebrew and is already in the school system.
But she is almost oblivious to the fact that there are some people in the Israeli government who want to deport her and other children who are fully assimilated into Israeli society, because their parents are here illegally.
Israel has approved plans to deport the families of illegal migrant workers, and government spokesman Roei Lachmanovich told the BBC the plan would affect some 400 children and their parents.
Image caption Vincent Uzoma says Israel should recognise the birthright of children born within its borders
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move was made because the country faced increasing illegal migration, which was a threat to its Jewish character.
Eustace's father, Vincent, is originally from Nigeria but came to Israel 14 years ago on a legal tourist visa.
Having outstayed his official welcome, he settled down here and a job, got married and had children.
"It's unfair and unjust," says Vincent of the deportation plan as he carefully watches his youngest daughter on the swings.
"These children are born here and speak the language. Israel should recognise their birthright."
For years Israel encouraged foreign workers from the developing world to come here and do the poorly paid, menial jobs that Israelis did not want to do.
Now, wanting to reduce its dependence on overseas labour, Israel says many of those workers must leave even if they have children who were born here.
'Bringing disease'
Campaigners like Noa Kaufman from the organisation Israeli Children says the recent sight of immigration inspectors conducting spot checks on people in the street is tantamount to persecution.
They live here, they have friends here but now the government wants to separate them from everything they know Noa Kaufman, Israeli Children
"You can't simply put a child and its mother, against their will, on a plane out of the country to somewhere the child doesn't know," says Ms Kaufman.
"They live here, they have friends here but now the government wants to separate them from everything they know."
Some Ministers in Israel's coalition, including Interior Minister Eli Yishai from the religious Shas Party, say they cannot grant more than 1,000 families permanent residency simply because their children were born in Israel.
Mr Yishai caused an outcry last year when he accused migrant workers of bringing with them "a profusion of diseases... and drug addiction".
In need of reform
According Mr Netanyahu, controlling immigration is largely about preserving Israel's Jewish character and his government intends to deport all illegal immigrants by 2013.
Immigration laws in Israel make it extremely hard for people to stay if they are not Jewish, but the scale of protest against these controversial proposals appears to have brought about a compromise of sorts.
Under pressure the government will now allow many children who have assimilated into Israeli society, those who go to school and speak Hebrew, to stay.
Hundreds of others - who do not fit into that category but who were still born here - will have to leave along with their families.
While there may be good news for five-year old Eustace and her family, others of a similar age will be sent to countries they do not know, with languages they do not understand.
By the government's own admission, Israel's immigration policy is unsatisfactory and is in need of reform.
Rare recordings by famous visiting classical musicians broadcast in the 1950s and '60s, including a performance by cellist Mstislav Rostropovich on his first trip to Japan, have been found in the archives of Tokyo Broadcasting System Holdings Inc.
The broadcaster said Tuesday that the 218 monaural but high-quality pieces also include a performance by cellist Pablo Casals on his first visit to Japan in 1961 and the last concert given by violinist Jascha Heifetz in 1954.
The recordings were found in the course of digitizing analog tapes stored in the TBS archives. Some of them will be broadcast by Ottava, an Internet classical music station run by TBS, starting at 6 p.m. Sept. 15.
The recordings were originally aired by Radio Tokyo, the precursor to TBS, during programs including “Hyakuman nin no Ongaku” (“Music For a Million People”), a classical music show that began with the station's 1951 founding.

Employers have responded to the new National Living Wage (NLW) by raising prices or reducing profits rather than cutting jobs, according to a survey from the Resolution Foundation.
The wage, which requires employers to pay staff aged 25 and over at least £7.20 an hour, was introduced in April.
This report is the first snapshot of how firms have reacted to the NLW.
It comes after the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted it would lead to 60,000 job losses by 2020.
Impact of Brexit
Five hundred companies, covering a range of UK businesses, were questioned just before the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, of which 215 said that the new NLW had impacted their wage bill.
Some 36% of those affected by the NLW said they had put up their prices to compensate for the higher wage cost, while 29% said they had reduced their profits.
Despite reports of some employers cutting back on staff terms and conditions, the survey found that only 8% had cut paid breaks, overtime or bank holiday pay.
Separately, the not-for-profit Resolution Foundation think tank warned the UK's decision to leave the EU could affect the government's new wage policy.
It said the so-called Brexit would be likely to reshape the landscape in which many low pay sectors operate, creating huge uncertainty about the outlook for earnings over the coming years.
Weaker wage growth, it said, could reduce the current projected real terms value of the NLW by up to 40 pence an hour by 2020.
The policy was announced in last summer's Budget by Chancellor George Osborne, in what he said was a move to create a higher-wage, lower-welfare economy.
Workers aged 21 to 24 continue to be paid the National Minimum Wage of £6.70 an hour.
The DIY chain B&Q, supermarket Tesco, coffee chain Caffe Nero and the John Lewis Partnership have all this year reduced some staff payments or perks, but most have said the moves were unrelated to the 50p-an-hour increase in the National Living Wage (NLW).
A spokesman for the Department for Business said: "The government wants to move to a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare society and the National Living Wage is a crucial part of achieving this. It is encouraging to hear that employers are investing in training and technology which will help to improve productivity.
"We recognise that employers are responding to the NLW in a variety of ways depending on their circumstances. The Low Pay Commission will recommend the level of the NLW going forward to make sure that wages rise to reward workers while considering the impact on the economy."
WASHINGTON (CN) – An American oil-drilling company claims Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ordered armed and uniformed soldiers to seize the company's oil and gas drilling business in Venezuela after the country stiffed it to tune of $32 million in unpaid invoices.
Helmerich & Payne International Drilling and its Venezuelan subsidiary filed a federal complaint against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its state-sponsored energy companies, Petroleos de Venezuela and PDVSA Petroleo, alleging violations of international law and breach of contract.
“On or about June 13 and 14, 2010, employees of the PDVSA defendants and armed and uniformed soldiers of the Venezuelan National Guard surrounded and unlawfully blockaded the business premises of H&P-V's drilling operations in Anaco, in the eastern region of Venezuela, at that time H&P-V's headquarters in Venezuela,” says Helmerich, a Tulsa, Okla.-based company. “On information and belief, in effectuating both blockades, the employees of the PDVSA defendants and the Venezuelan National Guard soldiers acted at the direction of defendant Venezuela and its anti-America and authoritarian President Hugo Chavez and/or his Minister of Energy and Petroleum Rafael Ramirez.”
Helmerich says Chavez's solders seized its assets, “preventing H&P-V from relocating any assets from its yards, and intimidating H&P into forgiving long-outstanding debts of the PDVSA defendants.” It was also forced into continuing providing PDVSA with drilling services without pay, according to the complaint.
After the seizure, Helmerich says Chavez handed over operations of its business to the PDVSA and at a political rally at the entrance to the facility, Minister Ramirez told PDVSA employees and soldiers that “at this moment … the Venezuelan Government … is taking control over this drill company which as been nationalized by the revolution.”
Helmerich says the 2010 seizure was the culmination of years of unpaid invoices and oil and gas contract breaches.
“Beginning in late 2008 and 2009, despite the fact that H&P-V had fully performed all of its obligations under the relevant contracts, the PDVSA defendants began systematically to breach those contracts,” Hemerich says. “Although contractually obligated to pay at clearly established rates, the PDVSA defendants – knowing that Venezuelan courts would not protect H&P's commercial rights – simply refused to pay as required under the contract.”
“The PDVSA defendants' unexcused failure to pay for H&P's oil drilling services has resulted in over $32 million in unpaid invoices, and defendants have expressed no intention of fulfilling their contractual obligations,” the complaint also states.
Chavez controls the Venezuelan courts, which have “ruled in favor of the government in 324 of the 325 cases brought by private citizens against the government,” Helmerich says, adding that Chavez removes judges at will and without cause to keep the courts loyal to him.
“Upon information and belief, no U.S. company has ever prevailed in Venezuelan courts in a civil action for damages against the Chavez regime,” it claims.
Helmerich says the unlawful taking of its commercial business gives jurisdiction over the case to U.S. federal courts under an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
It wants Venezuela to pay compensatory damages for violating international law and committing breach of contract. Helmerich is represented by David Ogden of Wilmer Cutler.

Angular Routing Q&A: Moving Through Your Angular Apps
Deborah Kurata talks about the challenges of using Angular routing, types of parameters and more.
Angular continues to be a driving force in the development world. And now there are evolving techniques and tactics arising to help you to get the most out of angular development. We caught up with veteran developer, author and trainer Deborah Kurata to get some inside scoop on Angular routing in advance of her Angular sessions at upcoming Visual Studio Live! and Live! 360 conferences.
Is there more to routing than moving a user through different views of an application?
Absolutely -- we use Angular's basic routing features to navigate the user through the views (or pages) of the application. We use Angular's route guards to protect our routes. For example, we check that a user is authorized to access a specific route before letting them navigate to that route. And we determine if the user has unsaved changes and display a warning before navigating away from a route.
Angular provides many choices for laying out routes. With child routes, we insert content within a container to display a common header and footer across multiple pages, for example. With auxiliary (aka secondary) routes, we display content side by side. Picture a master/detail layout with the master data appearing in the top of the page and the selected detail displayed beneath.
If we need to pass data with a route, the Angular router provides three different types of routing parameters: Required parameters let us define required data on a route, such as a customer ID when navigating to a customer detail route. Optional parameters let us pass optional, complex, or multifaceted data, such as search parameters that may or may not be specified. And Query parameters let us define sets of parameters we can retain across multiple routes.
Parameters are useful, but does the Angular router provide other ways to handle data with a route?
Indeed, it does. The router provides a data property we can use to pass a fixed object to a route. That is great for assigning a specific title or other route-unique information in a more generalized way.
And with a route resolver service, we can pre-fetch dynamic data for a page. So instead of routing to a page and displaying only part of that page as it waits the data, we can get the data first and then route to the page. The page then has all the data it needs to display all of its content. This provides a much cleaner user interface for the user.
What are some of the most challenging aspects of using Angular Routing?
One common issue I see when using routing is mingling syntax for the three different types of parameters. The syntax for configuring and navigating is different for required, optional, and query parameters. So you need to be aware of the differences and when to use each.
The more important challenge, however, is laying out the appropriate route configuration for the best user experience. This is especially important when working with larger applications. Should the application have an "empty" shell, such as recommended for Progressive Web Apps (PWA's)? If so, then the root route should not have a header, menu, footer, or other content. Those belong in a home or other component that provides a container for the other basic routes. Each page of the application needs an appropriate place in the routing hierarchy.
What exactly is lazy loading and how can developers use it to their advantage?
This is an important question because lazy loading can really improve the startup performance of an application. First impressions matter. We want to minimize the time between the user's request for our application and display of its first view. If we break our application into pieces, then when the user accesses the application, they only need to wait for the first small piece to be downloaded and executed before seeing its first page. The other pieces can then download "lazily" on demand, when the user accesses a specific feature, or preload asynchronously in the background.
We use routing to define which parts of our application are lazy loaded and for specifying our preload strategy. For example, we may have an admin feature we want to lazy load on demand. This makes sense because only administrators need this feature. There is no need to download the admin pieces unless the user is an admin and wants to work with that feature. Or we may have a customer feature that we want to preload asynchronously. That way it will be available as needed since it is used by most every user.
So yes, Angular routing can do so much more than move the user between multiple views of an application. For more details on how to use these techniques, check out my "Angular Routing" presentation at Visual Studio Live! Or my "Angular Routing" course on Pluralsight.
A 22-year-old woman was apparently mauled to death by her own dogs, described as pit bulls, according to Virginia law enforcement.
Bethany Lynn Stephens' body was found in a wooded area in Goochland, V.A., with wounds on her hands, arms, throat and face consistent with a mauling, WTVR reports. Stephens' father went looking for her on Thursday, and reportedly discovered her dogs standing watch over her body.

“It was an absolutely grisly mauling ,” Sheriff James Agnew told WTVR. “In my 40 years of law enforcement I've never seen anything quite like it. I hope I never see anything like it again.”
Agnew told WTVR that the dogs appeared to initiate the mauling. Evidence suggests the attack began when Stephens was alive, and became fatal after she fell to the ground unconscious. There is no evidence of a homicide, WTVR reports, and the sheriff's office will look to euthanize the pit bulls.

Story highlights Among the weapons destroyed were artillery shells and bombs filled with mustard gas
The United States, Germany and Canada aided in the effort
The Libyan Foreign Ministry describes the move as "an important milestone"
Libya said Tuesday that its chemical weapons, including artillery shells and bombs filled with mustard gas, have been destroyed.
The destruction, completed just a few days ago, was "an important milestone" for Libya fulfilling its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, according to that country's Foreign Ministry.
"Libya has become totally free of usable chemical weapons that might present a potential threat to the security of the local communities, the environment and the neighboring areas," it said.
According to Andrew C. Weber, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, the weapons destroyed were: 517 artillery shells filled with mustard gas, eight 250 kilogram bombs filled with mustard gas and 45 tubes filled with mustard gas.
"We ensure that they never fall in the hands of violent extremists, so we are preventing the potential for weapons of mass destruction terrorism," Weber told reporters in Tripoli.
The destruction operations over the past few months were a joint effort involving Libyans trained for the tasks, with technical assistance and logistical support from the United States, Germany and Canada.
Overstock recently completed the acquisition of SpeedRoute through its settlement platform subsidiary T0, effectively bringing blockchain technology to Wall Street. According to the SEC filing, SpeedRoute was purchased for approximately $30.3 million, consisting of approximately $11 million in cash and 900,000 shares of Overstock's common stock valued at $19.3 million.
SpeedRoute was founded in 2000 and is a a brokerage firm or broker-dealer that buys and sells stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investment products on behalf of its customers. It has offices at 14 Wall Street and moves approximately 2.5 percent of U.S. equity order flow.
Blockchain and SpeedRoute
“This collaboration allows Overstock to enter this new financial technology arena with a speed and aggression that I believe will revolutionize Wall Street, while adding an already profitable and cash-flow positive business right to Overstock's bottom line,” SpeedRoute CEO Joseph Cammarata said in a statement. “The winners are going to be investors and regulators alike.”
Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has been on a mission to transform the financial industry through the company's introduction of cryptosecurities or cryptobonds, which are securities based on blockchain technology. Using blockchain or the decentralized public ledger to verify and record transactions could reduce costs and speed up the clearing time between buyers and sellers, effectively removing the need for middlemen as well.
Through their acquisition of SpeedRoute, Byrne can implement the cryptosecurity framework through a company that's handled a good amount of Wall Street transactions. “Basically, it's the wormhole. It's the connection between the two universes,” Byrne told the New York Business Journal. “All the stuff we've built can now be accessed directly by people with a Bloomberg terminal, people with an eTrade account.”
SpeedRoute and its related companies will be held within the Overstock subsidiary, in which Overstock's ownership stake increases to 81 percent. T0 already owned a 25 percent stake in SpeedRoute.
MOSCOW — The American diplomatic mission to Russia said Monday that it planned to sharply reduce visa services because of Moscow's order to cut its staff, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat penalties by the two countries.
The embassy said in a statement that, beginning Wednesday, it would suspend the issuance of all nonimmigrant visas — like those for business, work and tourism — and that from Sept. 1 it would issue such visas only in Moscow “for as long as our staffing levels are reduced.”
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said during a news conference in Moscow that the announcement was “another attempt to make the Russian citizen angry about the actions of the Russian government.”
Mr. Lavrov said that he doubted the embassy's justification for the cutbacks in visa services. “The American diplomatic school, diplomatic service, just as the Russian one, has great traditions and experience in preparing professional staff,” he said. He added that the American argument that its diplomatic workers cannot issue the same number of visas with reduced staff disrespected the “capabilities and possibilities of the American diplomatic service.”
Kid Rock is in fact not running for office. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)
We were 99.99 percent certain that Detroit musician Kid Rock's run for a Senate seat — he debuted the website kidrockforsenate.com this summer and spent the past few months teasing his possible candidacy — was nothing more than a marketing stunt, and now the woulda-been “gentleman from Michigan” is admitting as much.
“I'm not running for Senate. Are you kidding me?” Rock told radio host Howard Stern this morning on the shock jock's SiriusXM show, per the Detroit Free Press. Of course, since he's Kid Rock, he peppered his comments with expletives definitely not fit for the Senate floor. “Who couldn't figure that out? I'm releasing a new album. I'm going on tour, too.”
Way to mock your fans for believing something you said before trying to shill your music: Rock wrote an earnest blog post calling a run “very possible” and said he was “exploring my candidacy,” then appeared behind a presidential-looking lectern to the tune “Hail to the Chief ” at a Michigan concert. Not that everyone was convinced, but in the Age of Trump, one never knows which celebrity's political aspirations might get taken seriously.
Fans weren't the only ones duped. Rock, born Robert Ritchie, told Stern that even those who knew the whole thing was mere subterfuge started acting as if it wasn't. “No, we're not doing it,” he said he'd tell them, according to the Detroit Free Press, “but let's roll with it for a while.”
Hello my dears. If you've been following my blog lately, you might have caught on that my new home away from home is the Apple Store. My computer — aka my lifeline — has been teetering on the verge of collapse. We've stripped off the data (my Vlogs, gulp!), the operating system, loaded everything back on, and then had to do the whole thing again.
After a LONG weekend of a marathon soccer tournament and no “me time”, so to speak, Tuesday meant Apple Store day again. I needed something cool, comfortable, yet fun enough to lift my spirits since, frankly, I was in a BAD MOOD!
Out of the back of my closet appeared this super early Old Navy dress. Done. Then I fished out a three year old pair of espadrille wedge sandals that tie around the ankle. Done. I draped around my neck my Helen Ficalora necklace with a initial charm for each of my chitlins, which lifts my spirits. Done.
Ready Set Go — enter below to win a $50 Old Navy gift card for some new summer essentials!
My bag? A new Thule computer case with exterior pockets and can double serve as computer carrier and hand bag. Light, sporty and practical. Why carry two bags when a blogging mom only needs one. Done.
Since, as said, I was feeling exhausted, depleted and just stressed, I tried to get a bit whimsical with my hair. Finding fun and easy hairstyles for long hair isn't easy, and washing my hair and blowing it out — something I did daily in my 20's — is a once or twice a week kind of thing now. I did that after drop off and then picked a thin piece and picked two thin pieces and wound them into a twist with some bobby pins.
As I sat down with Rob at the Apple Store, he exclaimed “love your hair.” A nice lady said the same thing. My day started to take a turn for the better. We found an additional back up drive with my shows, which meant that I could reimport them onto my now reinvigorated computer. My day continued to turn around for the better.
If you're feeling low, down, bored, tired and just picky, try a small simple little twist like this to up your spirits and change your day. It worked for me, and could for you to, my dears.
Whatever works, right? Make yourself happy and the people around you will feel it too! We all need a little whimsy in our lives.

This article is about the food. For the phenomenon of glowing white due to temperature, see Incandescence . For the album by Angel, see White Hot (album)
The white hot is a variation on the hot dog found primarily in the Rochester, New York[1] area, as well as other parts of Western New York and Central New York.[2] It is composed of a combination of uncured and unsmoked pork, beef, and veal; the lack of smoking or curing allows the meat to retain a naturally white color.[3] White hots usually contain mustard and other spices, and often include a dairy component such as nonfat dry milk.
History [ edit ]
The white hot, also commonly referred to as a coney, originated in the 1920s[4] in Rochester's German community as a "white and porky".[1] It was originally a cheaper alternative to high-price red hot dogs, made of the less desirable meat parts and various fillers; in contrast, modern versions are made from quality meats and are generally sold at higher prices than common hot dogs.[4]

One of the best-known producers of the white hot is Zweigle's. Although they were not the first to make white hots, they were the first to secure a contract at the Red Wing Stadium soon after Zweigle's began making the dogs in 1925.[citation needed] The white hot has become the official hot dog of the Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres, Rochester Americans and Rochester Rhinos and was the official hot dog of the Washington Nationals during the major league baseball team's first season.[citation needed]
Another producer, Hofmann, produces white hots in the Syracuse, New York area under the name "Snappy Grillers".[5] A third company, Hartmann, is also known to produce white hots.[6]

Top speed of 45 km/h makes bike currently illegal in the US
Taking some pride in the fact that it's currently too fast to be sold in the United States, Specialized today launched the Turbo, a new electric bike that will begin selling in Europe in May.
Termed a ‘performance urban bike,' the Turbo features an integrated battery, a direct drive rear motor, disk brakes and a maximum speed of 45 km/h.
This speed puts it over the maximum allowed in the USA for such bikes, and also does likewise in some European countries. However it's permitted in others, and Specialized is going after this market with, presumably, hopes that the regulations for other territories will be relaxed over time.
The Turbo's Li-ion 342 Wh battery recharges from electrical outlets in two hours. Specialized claims the motor is silent, and states that it can recoup some energy back from the bike when the brakes are applied.
A run time for the motor is not provided, but presumably that will depend on how much force the personal pedaling applies themselves, terrain and other conditions.
The bike has hidden cables, plus a wireless interface unit (ie bike computer) which gives details such as speed, distance, assist level and battery status. A button on the unit also turns on and off batteries on the front and rear of the bike.
The bike is – of course – not UCI legal, and is not intended for use in competition. Promotional videos show its use in the urban environment, with commuters, recreational riders and those who want to ride a new evolution of electronic bike being the likely market.
Specialized is offering test rides to people who wish to try the machine out.

“Statistics is a science in my opinion, and it is no more a branch of mathematics than are physics, chemistry and economics; for if its methods fail the test of experience – not the test of logic – they are discarded.” - John Wilder Tukey
“Box plot,” “stem and leaf plot,” ANOVA” and, yes, even “bit,” “software” and “vacuum cleaner” are terms coined by this month's featured statistician – John Wilder Tukey – whom we are honoring as part of celebrating the International Year of Statistics. Tukey's impact on science and society is so wide and significant that I will only highlight a few areas here. As a side note, Tukey's influence on JMP is also significant, and I'll save an interesting connection for the end of this blog post.
Many recognize Tukey as the father of exploratory data analysis, in part for creating many effective visual techniques such as the box plot and stem and leaf plot, which are standards in introductory statistics courses today. He made many enduring contributions in time series, multiple comparisons, ANOVA, robust statistics, and interactive and multivariate graphics, too. Tukey considered himself a “scientific generalist” and influenced many other scientific fields, including computer science, mathematics, engineering and economics. He even served as an adviser on environmental, defense and education policy to the highest levels of US government. He collaborated with scientists such as Von Neumann, Feynman, Cooley and Morganstern, and served as doctoral adviser to many great statisticians.
Tukey was born on June 16, 1915, in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and was mostly home-schooled as a child. At the age of 18, he entered Brown University and earned his BS and MS in chemistry, thereafter pursuing a PhD at Princeton. Soon after arriving at Princeton, his graduate studies evolved toward mathematics. Tukey's studies focused mostly on pure mathematics, and his thesis, “On Denumerability in Topology,” was published as a book in 1940; mathematician Paul Halmos includes that book among the influential books of the period 1888-1988. After earning his PhD, Tukey became Math Instructor at Princeton and two years later Assistant Professor of Mathematics. By then, the US was engaged in World War II, and like many other leading academic institutions at that time, Princeton was involved in research to support the war effort.
The Fire Control Research Office under the direction of Merrill Flood was located in Princeton, and Tukey joined the office as Consultant in 1941. The office worked on practical problems of warfare, and these led to the use of statistics and association with statisticians such as Charlie Winsor, whom Tukey credits with converting his interests toward statistics.
“He (Charlie Winsor) was data-oriented. I well remember walking up past by old Fine hall and hearing Charlie say, ‘Well, Sam Wilks trains good mathematical statisticians, and it's surprising how soon they become good statisticians.' But, associating with Charlie and living in the data-rich environment where what we were doing was trying to make sense out of data left me with an ultimate data-orientation.” - Tukey
Tukey returned to teaching after the war, and began a transition to statistics research and service in the years immediately following. Within the math department, Tukey joined the Section of Mathematical Statistics, which was headed by mathematical statistician Samuel Wilks. The Applied Statistics seminar began in 1946, introducing many state-of-the-art concepts to the graduate community at Princeton. He became Professor of Mathematics in 1950, Chair of the newly formed Statistics Department in 1966 and was Professor of Statistics and Donner Chair of Science until his retirement from Princeton in 1985.
“..the first time I was in a Statistics course, I was there to teach it.” - Tukey
In 1945, Tukey also began his 40-year association with Bell Laboratories. The parent company's focus and expertise in communications and technology provided valuable research, in part, to support of national security interests. Beginning in 1960, Tukey served as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee and over the course of his career advised five US presidents. This work involved advising on environmental and education policy, and in the early 1960s, policy on nuclear weapons testing. It was in this capacity that one of his most important discoveries was made.
While serving on President Kennedy's Science Advisory committee with the physicist Richard Garwin, the problem of off-shore monitoring and verification of a possible nuclear test ban treaty with Russia was discussed. Garwin and Tukey devised a potential solution that involved a method of monitoring seismic activity with remote sensors and analyzing their signals to distinguish an earthquake from a nuclear test. From this discussion and further work by James Cooley of IBM, the Cooley -Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was developed. The Cooley-Tukey algorithm was a substantial simplification and vast improvement on calculations of Fourier series and integrals.
“If you speed up any nontrivial algorithm by a factor of a million or so the world will beat a path towards finding useful applications for it.” - from Numerical Recipes
A Few Important Contributions
Exploratory Data Analysis: Tukey developed useful techniques for visualizing and summarizing data, the 5-number summary, box plots, and stem and leaf diagram. His book Exploratory Data Analysis published in 1977 introduced many of these techniques at a time when elementary statistical education was mainly focused on Inference and hypothesis testing. “Since the aim of exploratory data analysis is to learn what seems to be, it should be no surprise that pictures play a vital role in doing it well. There is nothing better for making you think of questions you had forgotten to ask (even mentally),” Tukey said.
Interactive Multivariate Graphics: In 1972, Tukey spent four months at Stanford's Linear Accelerator Center. He worked with Jerome Freidman on the development of PRIM-9, which was the first computer program that offered interactive and dynamic multivariate graphics. Features such as rotation and masking (brushing) were developed, along with the concept of Projection Pursuit in this work.
Multiple Comparisons: Some of Tukey's earliest work in statistics focused on Multiple Comparisons. The Tukey-Kramer test or Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test is a standard used in ANOVA for pairwise comparisons more than 60 years after it was introduced.
Robust statistics: According to Peter J. Huber, Tukey was “the first to recognize the extreme sensitivity of some conventional statistical procedures to seemingly minor deviations from the assumptions…. In Tukey's view, robustness is an attribute of the statistical procedure, typically to be achieved by weighting or trimming the observations. This ought to be contrasted to say, George Box's view, who thought the data should not be tampered with and that the model itself should be robust.”
“Once upon a time statisticians only explored, then they learned to confirm exactly – to confirm a few things exactly, each under very specific circumstances. As they emphasized exact confirmation, their techniques inevitably became less flexible. The connection of the most used techniques with past insights was weakened. Anything to which a confirmatory procedure was not explicitly attached was decried as 'mere descriptive statistics' no matter how much we had learned from it.” - Tukey
Tukey earned many awards, including the National Medal of Science, the Samuel S. Wilks award, the Shewhart Medal, the IEEE Medal of Honor and the Deming Medal. He died on July 26, 2000, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He made many other contributions that are covered in greater detail elsewhere, and I reference a few sources below. In particular, David Brillinger's piece provides many firsthand insights into the life and work of Tukey.
The Anscombe Connection
John Tukey's brother-in-law was Francis J. Anscombe – their wives were sisters. Anscombe was a British statistician who joined Tukey at Princeton for a while and shared many similar views when it came to data analysis and the use of graphics. Anscombe left Princeton for Yale and was a pioneer in the emerging field of statistical computing. In 1973, the American Statistician published his article, "Graphics in Statistical Analysis." The “quartet” was introduced in this paper to motivate the concept that statistical graphics often reveal understanding that is not apparent from statistics alone and should accompany the analysis of data. The “quartet” (at right) clearly illustrates four very different graphs of data. But if you only looked at the statistical results that are identical, you would conclude that each bivariate analysis were the same.
As Anscombe said, “A computer should make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding.”
These recommendations influenced a young developer and motivated the development of a new and innovative data analysis software that was launched in the late 1980s. The software was JMP, and the developer John Sall.
You can access the data table and script for Anscombe's quartet in JMP's sample data directory (Help > Sample Data > See an Alphabetical List of all Sample Data Tables > Anscombe).

Armed men opened fire on the officers at a checkpoint in southern province of Bani Suief
Egyptian security officials say masked gunmen riding on a motorcycle have killed five police officers at a checkpoint in the south of the country.
The officials say the attack took place early on Thursday when the armed men opened fire on the checkpoint in el-Wassta district in the southern province of Bani Suief.
Two police officers were also wounded in the attack.
Egypt has seen a sharp rise in drive-by shootings and attacks targeting police and the military in the aftermath of the popularly backed coup last July in which the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
The most prominent attack was a failed assassination attempt on the interior minister in Cairo in September.
Back in the early 1990s, Jeff Daniels' agents thought his decision to do “Dumb and Dumber” was — what's the word? Dumb.
“The night before I flew out to LA to start the wardrobe fitting, three agents got on the phone and said, ‘We're gonna stop this. You're not gonna do this movie,' ” Daniels tells The Post. “I said, ‘No, I want to do comedy, and I need to change it up.' ”
The movie ended up being a massive hit, and it transformed Daniels' image from serious dramatic actor to someone who could also do comedy.
On Friday, Daniels and co-star Jim Carrey are back in “Dumb and Dumber To.” The sequel picks up 20 years from when the original film left off, with nitwits Harry (Daniels) and Lloyd (Carrey) setting off cross-country to find the now-grown daughter (Rachel Melvin) Harry never knew he had.
Getting back into Harry's idiotic shoes for the second time was much easier than the first.
“He's so dumb, he can't just be quirky or flawed,” Daniels says. “You had to go to a depth of dumbness I hadn't done before. An actor finds a key thought, then does the movie through that key thought. Mine was, ‘He has an IQ of eight.' Not seven, not nine, but eight.”
Here, Daniels shows just how low his IQ can go, answering five dumb questions.
1. You attended Central Michigan University. Dumbest class?
I took a karate class. One day, we were in our white robes with our white belts, and a guy did a flip on me and threw me down. I held onto him and threw him down, too. I got pissed. So now we're not doing karate at all, we're just wrestling, and the teacher is going, ‘All right! Bow to each other.' Yeah, right. So I dropped the class and went and took bowling.
2. Dumber haircut: Lloyd or Harry?
Oh, Lloyd. Absolutely. On the first movie, I saw Jim had done a salad bowl thing. We were in a Holiday Inn in Provo, Utah, and I just got the shampoo, which is probably not the highest quality. I threw away the conditioner and the brush. Every day, I'd shampoo with that cheap shampoo, towel dry and walk out the door. Never touched a comb for eight weeks.
3. Since “Dumb and Dumber” was released, have you discovered a more annoying sound than that one Jim Carrey makes?
Usually it's when I turn on C-Span and watch Congress.
4. You live in Michigan. Does your agent think that's dumb?
No. They were very supportive of the move back in 1986. I wanted to raise my kids in a place I could understand. As long as I was willing to get on a plane at my own expense, they didn't care. There was really only one time I had to get on a plane and go out to LA and audition, and that was in the early 1990s. I auditioned for four movies and one was “Dumb and Dumber.”
5. Dumbest thing your character does in this movie?
Licking Lloyd's fingers [after Lloyd has shoved them down the back of his pants]. I made one request of myself as I drove to Georgia to shoot this movie. I said, ‘You have to be fearless.' When you're with Jim and the Farrellys, there's an outrageousness, and you just have to dive in. Licking the fingers? It didn't matter. Jim could have put them where the sun don't shine, and I still would have gone method and licked them.
Recently, a wave of VAC bans touched upon professional players – they all used forbidden soft. After that, one of the leading players on the team Fnatic – flusha, fell under suspicion. Multiply videos, making doubt his honesty, appeared like mushrooms. For example, http://www.hltv.org/forum/684463-flusha-busted
However, there is a perception that such a collection of suspicious moments can be made about any professional player. The main thing – just to enable WallHack in the right time. For example, we propose to take the leader of our team and a veteran of the CS-scene – Kirill «ANGE1» Karasiow.
He starred in the CIS-teams since 2005, and had appeared to be a winner of international tournaments repeatedly. His reputation as an honest, respectable and principled person can not be doubted.
Therefore, we offer you a small joke-experiment in which you need to «prove» that Kirill is a cheater!
Here's the quest:
1. Find 10 moments where ANGE1 suspiciously aims and kills through walls or smokes (demos available h ere )
2. Record a video that will include these examples
3. Register at our website: www.HellRaisers.pro
4. Post a link to your video in the comments to this article.
That one, who can convince the independent judicial assembly, will get a reward of $100 and HellRaisers' T-shirt!
The hunt has just begun!
Saturday marks Formula E Championship's second and final stop in its American tour. The Long Beach ePrix is the mid-season point of the all-electric racing series and will provide enough challenges for the teams and drivers. According to Renault Sport all ingredients are in place for a memorable race.
The race will take on a shortened version (2.1 km) of the famous Long Beach circuit which, in the past, hosted Formula 1 grand prix and the top American single-seater championships. The drivers will do battle over 39 laps before crossing the finishing line on the long straight of the Marina and the Rainbow Lagoon park. With its seven corners combining right angles, a chicane, a fast curve and a hairpin the track will require skilled management of the Fan Boost and the batteries. The surface changes and bumps will add even more spice to the challenge.
“It's fantastic to be going to an iconic circuit like Long Beach,” says Roberto Dlacic, Renault Sport Technologies engineer assigned to the FIA Formula E Championship. “The drivers and spectators are really going to enjoy themselves on this layout. The track's wide and quick and that's going to lead to interesting, exciting racing. Long Beach is a circuit that doesn't require a lot of energy so the drivers can push hard and use different out-of-sync strategies. The ePrix already looks like it's going to be one of the classics of this championship, which has continued to provide gripping, lively competition since the start!”
On April 12th, NASA Ames Research Center will hold an incredible celebration of space exploration. Last year, the Yuri's Night event was utterly amazing. In a hangar decorated with neon lights, Anousheh Ansari, space tourist and founder of the X Prize that bears her name, gave the keynote address. Thousands of people stayed to watch science demonstrations, scientific lectures, and women dancing with glowing hula hoops. Wired compared the event to burning man.
This year, the organizers tell us that it will be much more like the Maker Faire. Visionary Stewart Brand will make some remarks and SIMS creator Will Wright will lead the plenary session. Other luminaries will lead salons about a host of scholarly topics. Lots of sculptures and technical projects will be on display. Of course, there will also be performances by The Flaming Lotus Girls, Capacitor, and new band that includes Phil Lesh of The Greatful Dead.

Seeing A Mother's Alzheimer's As A Time Of Healing And Magic
Enlarge this image Courtesy of Dana Walrath Courtesy of Dana Walrath
In 2008, Dana Walrath asked her mother Alice to move in with her. Alice's Alzheimer's disease had gotten worse, and even though she still had all her humor and graces, she could no longer take care of herself.
During the next two and-a-half years, Walrath and her mother connected through stories and memories, even though Alice didn't always recognize her daughter. Walrath, a medical anthropologist at the Vermont College of Medicine, in Burlington, Vt., looks back fondly on that time.
"As an anthropologist you're always encouraged to document everything you do, but it just felt right to live the experience," Walrath says.
In 2010, she began sketching Alice as a way to process her feelings about transferring her mother to an Alzheimer's care residence. She cut up a paperback copy of Alice in Wonderland, a book her mother loved, and used the fragmented words to craft collages of Alice.
Through curiously-sketched comic illustrations and vignettes, Walrath documents her experience with her mother's dementia in Aliceheimer's: Alzheimer's Through The Looking Glass, published in March by Penn State University Press.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Dana Walrath Courtesy of Dana Walrath
Sometimes funny, sometimes heart-breaking, each comic weaves in a different facet of their shared experience: hallucinations, repetition, memory, loss, magic, and sometimes even time travel. In one vignette, Alice is transported to 1954, where she believes her grandsons are Johnny Depp-like pirates and Dana's husband is a fellow captive.
Walrath spoke with Shots about making the book and her experiences taking care of her mother. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
You say your experience was a time of "healing and magic," which doesn't follow the typical narrative around Alzheimer's disease. Can you explain that?
We've got a medical system that is so focused on curing things that when a cure hasn't been discovered yet, it's really scary. Most people are pining for the cure and focusing on the loss. If we say, "This is reality, this is what it is," and we stop fighting it, then surprising things can happen. People with dementia keep their sophistication and their intentions — they've just lost their short-term memories. They're working hard to figure out how to communicate and stay connected. And for those of us who have our memories, if we can read those signs, we can have those amazing connections. It just came naturally to me as an anthropologist — being used to this notion that everyone is walking around with a framework in their head that comes from their culture that may be very different from mine.

If she was hallucinating, she'd wake up from a nap and say her mother was right there, and say, "Can't you see her?" I'd say, "That's so cool you can see her, you have special powers." It was a way of making her reality safe and then being able to explore from there.
I like thinking about it the way improv comedians do. They use a "yes and" principal. So whatever she was experiencing I would endorse and then build upon it so that there would be collective magic.
How would she respond?
She felt great that what she was experiencing was a special power. And then she had pride in that, she felt met, and then we could go on and process the next thing. The hallucinations about her parents made me think she needed to go and visit her parents' graves. Once we did that, she stopped having those hallucinations.
You say that it wasn't until you started cutting up the book Alice In Wonderland that this book started to come together. How did that happen?
Once I found the collage element, my subconscious was completely engaged and then all these other things started to come out.
Like those halos around Alice's head. I think, oh my gosh, that's a subconscious reference to her first language, her reversion to childhood, and the altered magical state that dementia is and was for me.
Has the process of making this book changed the way you think about Alzheimer's?

I believe that if we can look at people with dementia and cognitive differences as just another way of being human, it's better. We can learn so much from people in altered states. When my mother was living with us, I got in the habit of buying cut flowers because she would just marvel at them. At dinner she'd say nearly 20, 30 times, "Those flowers are gorgeous!" and it's something a lot of us forget to do. It's probably good for all of us to stop and notice what's there and good and what we can be grateful for. I look at it as a different window into being human.
Granzella officially announces Disaster Report acquisition
Previously canceled Disaster Report 4 also planned to reemerge next year.
Granzella made its acquisition of the Disaster Report copyright official today with a press release announcing the procurement.

The NHL is prepared to wipe out the Winter Classic and All-Star Game, its showcase regular-season events.
The Winter Classic outdoor game, staged annually around New Year's Day and slated for Michigan Stadium in 2013, is likely to be included among games canceled if a labor agreement with the Players' Association is not reached Thursday. The Classic would be canceled in November, along with the All-Star Game.
“We obviously take all stakeholder views and needs into account in making decisions in those events,” NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said of the Classic and All-Star Game in an email Wednesday. “Everyone is interested in an earlier decision if at all possible so they can turn the page and try to redirect the business. We are sensitive to those needs.”
Union executive director Donald Fehr did not address the Winter Classic or All-Star Game but said NHLPA leadership remains ready to meet.
“(The NHL is) winding the clock down to yet another artificial deadline they created,” Fehr said.
The Classic and All-Star Game have been the highest-rated regular-season games since the Classic's debut in 2008. Reasons to cancel the signature events include: protecting local businesses such as hotel and restaurants; refunding tickets; and eliminating the lucrative games as possible bargaining chips during labor negotiations.
The Tribune-Review first reported earlier this month that NBC, the NHL's national broadcast partner, had started planning for programming to replace the Classic. HBO, which had produced the “24/7: Road to the Winter Classic” series each of the past two Decembers, must know by mid-November if that program can go off as planned.
The 2013 Classic in Ann Arbor, Mich., is scheduled to pit the Detroit Red Wings against the Toronto Maple Leafs, the first Canadian club involved in the outdoor event. The Columbus Blue Jackets are to host All-Star weekend Jan. 26-27. The 2005 All-Star Game was canceled before the NHL announced its entire season would be lost in January of that year.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman spoke Wednesday at a news conference to announce the New York Islanders' move from Long Island to Brooklyn, and he offered no assurance that the Classic would survive the next round of canceled games.
The NHL has bagged regular-season games through Nov. 1. Training camps must open Friday for a full 82-game season to begin Nov. 2, Bettman reiterated.
Owners locked out players Sept. 15, and negotiations broke Oct. 17 after the league rejected three union proposals. The league will not meet with the NHLPA unless the union agrees to negotiate off the NHL offer, Daly said.
Penguins players have said they expect at least two more weeks of games to be canceled by the weekend, and more likely a month's worth. The NHL has not indicated how many more games would be cut.
There is no plan for how many games would constitute a season if 82 becomes implausible, Daly said.
Based off respective current proposals, the NHL and union have agreed on a 50/50 split of future revenue — a record $3.3 billion last season — and the guarantee of full payment on current contracts. However, the sides differ on the math for a 50/50 split and the manner in which full payment will be offered to players.
Also, structural issues such as maximum veteran contract length and disciplinary measures are not settled, an NHLPA official confirmed.
The NHL offer is contingent on an 82-game season. Fehr has not said whether union offers will stay on the table if there are more cancellations.
Note: Penguins center Evgeni Malkin had a goal and two assists in Metallurg Magnitogorsk's 4-3 overtime loss to Donbass Donetsk in an KHL contest. Malkin has six goals and 20 points in 14 games.

As Trump mulls over leaving the Paris agreement, US officials fly in to interim talks with no clear mandate
By Karl Mathiesen
As UN climate talks prepare to resume in Bonn on Monday, records show the US state department has had little formal engagement with the process since Donald Trump assumed the presidency.
Governments from across the world, including the US' key allies and adversaries, have been staking out their positions on matters at once arcane and consequential. Since the beginning of this year, 241 submissions have been made to the various work streams of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Just two are from the US – both pre-Trump.
One set of answers to a peer review, required under the process, was delivered this week in staccato responses that highlighted the US preference for jobs, rather than climate action.
A former US government official familiar with the talks said it was “quite unusual” for the US to have made no submissions in the lead up to a meeting.
“The US generally addresses all issues in detail in order to promote US interests. Other countries are also very interested in US views and ideas, so it's disappointing,” the former official said.
Trump continues to mull a decision to leave the Paris accord or not. This has left the US climate team, for much of the past decade an influential force at UN negotiations, arriving in Bonn with little direction, according to several former government employees interviewed by Climate Home.
Andrew Light, until 2016 a state department climate advisor, now working with the World Resources Institute (WRI), said the lack of US submissions was “most likely an indication that they have received very little, if any, policy guidance from the new Trump team at [the] state [department] since the inauguration”.
“That's in some measure because none of the senior political positions with jurisdiction over the UNFCCC have been appointed yet at state,” said Light, noting that the Office of Global Change (OGC), which leads the US climate negotiations, was not an exceptional area of the state department in this regard.
At time of publication, the state department had not responded to Climate Home's request for comment.
Negotiations are turning to the creation of a rulebook that will govern the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. How will nations account for and report the progress they are making? How will the gap between commitments made so far and what the climate actually needs be closed?
The Bonn “intersessionals” – regular UN climate meetings held in the middle of each year – are technical affairs. Big political decisions are held until the end of the year Conference of Parties. Meaning the US' lack of involvement is unlikely to affect wider progress at these talks, according to Light.
But it will undermine US interests as rivals seek to exploit US silence in the plenary hall, said Paula Caballero, global director of WRI's climate programme.
“[US secretary of state] Rex Tillerson has said that he wants to keep at seat at the table and I think that this is the reason why. It will be key for the US to be sitting there when key rules are being developed and discussed on, for example, transparency and accounting,” she said.
Minus a few who have left of their own accord, the climate team at the OGC remains roughly the same as the one that negotiated the Paris accord under Barack Obama's presidency. According to Light, the group that goes to Bonn will be led by Trigg Talley, who headed teams at Bonn half-year meetings throughout Obama's second term.
Now, that group, once the centre of negotiations, is set to be an inert presence. A former government official said the US would probably assume an “observer-plus” role in Bonn; silent on many issues, but perhaps with specific instructions to become involved at certain points.
“At a minimum they would be listening to what other countries were saying,” they said.
After the US decided not to participate in the Kyoto Protocol, state department officials were given instructions to only intervene on certain issues. The US position at these talks – and perhaps in future – may be similar.
A lot depends on whether Trump decides to stay within the agreement or not. Trump has said he will decide the matter within two weeks, meaning he could drop the news during the Bonn talks. Although timeframes in this White House are notoriously flexible.
In the early weeks of the new administration, E&E Climatewire reported that staff at the state department were awaiting Trump's in-out decision in order to begin formulating suitable policy. Since that report, staff have been careful about speaking to reporters directly.
A US withdrawal has swung between likely and unlikely for months, according to rumours emerging from the White House about which advisors have the president's ear. Some observers Climate Home spoke to expressed hope that Trump's turn away from isolationist policy in Syria and toward Nato were signs of an unwillingness to burn his global bridges.
Until a decision is made, US officials are left treading water in a stream that will only flow faster.
“International leadership on climate is more diffuse than before and other countries are stepping up to lead,” said Caballero. These include China and the EU, major trading partners and economic rivals of the US.
“Whatever the Trump administration decides to do, in terms of whether it formally stays in the agreement, they are already doing a lot to undermine their credibility and their influence around the world,” said Light.
At a recent G7 energy ministers' meeting, the lack of White House climate policy direction was exposed by frustrated peers when US energy secretary Rick Perry refused to sign up to a statement that included a passage in support of the Paris Agreement.
The same G7 statement did include a reiterated pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. Several experts have expressed privately to Climate Home that they believe this to have been the result of an oversight or lack of any overriding policy, given Trump's repeated support for the fossil fuel industry.
But even by threatening withdrawal, Trump has already managed to influence the fabric of the Paris accord. This week saw the odd spectacle of the EU's climate action and energy commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete arguing the US was able to “chart its own path”, intimating that its commitments to Paris could be watered down.
This is seen as a political necessity to keep Trump in the accord. But it exposes as voluntary a value at the heart of the negotiations. After the Paris deal was struck in 2015, Cañete said its credibility depended on “regular reviews to increase ambition over time”.

Public libraries are a relatively new phenomenon. Before the 1880s, when Andrew Carnegie started funding the more than 1,600 library buildings that bear his name, most libraries in America were subscription-based, with members funding and shaping the collections. As free public libraries sprouted up across the United States, membership libraries mostly died off, but 19 non-profit membership libraries still exist, and are reinventing themselves as cultural centers and the coolest coworking spaces you could dream of.
I'm an itinerant freelance writer and work most of the year in Cincinnati, where I discovered the Mercantile Library a few years ago, when it was hosting a small concert. The majestic space immediately appealed to my aesthetics, but I had no idea of its history. The Mercantile was founded in 1835 as a young merchants' association library—the collection is generalist, though early on there was a ban on novels that has since been reversed. The original cast iron and walnut newspaper reading desks remain in the building that the association secured with a 10,000-year lease for $1 annually.
Grace Dobush Shhh! Quiet!
In the first 70 years of its existence, the Mercantile Library was the most trafficked in Cincinnati, former director Albert Pyle wrote in the book America's Membership Libraries. That was before the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County opened its original main branch, a gorgeous structure that has since been demolished, and its 40 additional libraries.
While public libraries remain a vital resource for the community, membership libraries serve a self-selected clientele looking for something more. On quiet days, the Mercantile Library is my private aerie, a literary hideout of mahogany and leather. On busier days it's a well-appointed office, miles nicer than any I've ever worked in, with coworkers who have chosen to be with each other. Coworking spaces in mid-sized Midwestern cities such as Cincinnati cost upwards of $300 a month—which, honestly, is more than half my rent. But membership at the Mercantile Library is $55 a year, and its brethren charge anywhere from $15 to $250 annually.
The first subscription library in North America was Benjamin Franklin's Library Company of Philadelphia, founded in 1731 with members paying 40 shillings to join and promising 10 shillings per year towards buying new books. “Public libraries made books universally available, but they did not supply the other need for which membership libraries were created, the need for a social forum, where books and the matter they contained could be discussed,” Nicolas Barker wrote in America's Membership Libraries. These were a distinctly American invention—the first subscription library did not appear in England until 1797. Instead, book collections were owned by religious institutions, schools, universities, and private individuals, and “circulating libraries” charged per book. Franklin's subscription library ”produced a new class of reader, someone firmly placed between those who could read Franklin's almanacs, on the one hand, and the well-educated elite on the other,” Richard Wendorf wrote in the same book.
In Cincinnati, the Mercantile Library's membership peaked around the time of the Civil War at more than 3,000, and dipped to just 500 by the late 20th century. Its board realized it had to reinvent the organization to maintain relevance in a world replete with public libraries. The Mercantile's lecture series have featured Julia Child, Ray Bradbury, and John Updike, and it hosts small concerts, book groups, and social hours. (I'm a frequent guest on its book discussion podcast.) When I joined the library three years ago, the clientele was overwhelmingly older men in suits coming in at lunchtime to eat their Subway sandwiches. The Mercantile Library's new director, John Faherty, a reformed reporter poached from the Cincinnati Enquirer, is actively recruiting creative people around the city as members, doling out annual passes like a skinny Santa.
Grace Dobush
“Over the century, our position in society has changed a little bit,” Faherty says. “We're as much about being a place that celebrate books and where people talk about books more than it is a place where people check books out.” His little cage of an office is right next to the wrought-iron stacks, with some sliding shelves for oversize volumes that he's crazy about. The Mercantile's staff is just five people, but some of its programs draw hundreds of patrons.
In San Francisco, another membership library follows a similar ethos. “We don't try to compete with the public library,” says Deb Hunt, director of the Mechanics' Institute Library. “We want to be the cultural center for the bay area.” And what they specialize in is community, as evidenced by the high librarian-patron ratio and the legendary Tuesday night chess marathons.
The Mechanics' Institute was founded in 1854 and has been in its current building since 1910—owning a prime piece of San Francisco real estate definitely helps their budget. Now the library has about 4,600 members, but before the 1906 earthquake it peaked at more than 10,000.
Hunt is quick to point out the difference between private libraries and membership libraries. “A private library is exclusive—you have to be recommended, and the bar is very high,” with initiation fees in the thousands of dollars, she says. Her library costs just $95 a year to join. “We feel it's very democratic.” In November, the Mechanics' Institute Library will host the fourth international conference of independent and member libraries, the first held in the United States. And although most membership libraries were created before the 20th century, one more has just sprouted in Washington: Folio: The Seattle Athenaeum opened its doors this month.
The low barrier to entry makes me wonder why membership libraries remain such well-kept secrets, but the Mechanics' Institute's demographics are getting younger, as are the Mercantile Library's. “We kind of appeal to younger people in a way I didn't anticipate. We are so authentic. And we're not like purposefully authentic—we're not ironically or contrived authentic. We're just authentic. And I think that appeals to people. It appeals to me,” Faherty says. “The world can feel like a contrivance. This place is anything but.”

A Florida man who produced dozens of videos of child pornography and sent them over the Internet was sentenced to 80 years in federal prison Friday, authorities said.
Benjamin Cuadrado, 40, had pleaded guilty in January to producing and transporting child pornography, following his arrest at his Lakeland home last March, according to a news release from U.S. Immigration and Customs.
According to court documents, Cuadrado coerced an infant and a toddler to engage in sexually explicit conduct and produced at least 70 videos, which were sent over the Internet. Authorities found 250 videos and more than 4,000 images of child pornography on Cuadrado's cell phone, authorities said.
"The sentence handed down in the case against Mr. Cuadrado brings to an end one of the most disturbing child exploitation cases in the history of our office," said Alysa Erichs, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations Miami. "This also sends a message to those who take advantage of the innocence of our children, that we will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."
Cuadrado was arrested after a massive investigation by ICE, HSI offices in Tampa, Miami, Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts, the U.S. Secret Service, the Miami Beach Police Department, Polk County Sheriff's Office, Lakeland Police Department and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
Hillary Clinton's continued obsession with inflicting herself upon a public that told her to go away almost a year ago is now giving agita to those who used to be close to her.
According to Politico, the Democrats are sweating her impending book tour.
President Donald Trump may be the only person in politics truly excited about Hillary Clinton's book tour. Democratic operatives can't stand the thought of her picking the scabs of 2016, again — the Bernie Sanders divide, the Jim Comey complaints, the casting blame on Barack Obama for not speaking out more on Russia. Alums of her Brooklyn headquarters who were miserable even when they thought she was winning tend to greet the topic with, “Oh, God,” “I can't handle it,” and “the final torture.” Political reporters gripe privately (and on Twitter) about yet another return to the campaign that will never end. Campaign operatives don't want the distraction, just as they head into another election season. And members of Congress from both parties want the focus on an agenda that's getting more complicated by the week. But with a new NBC News poll showing her approval rating at 30 percent, the lowest recorded for her, Clinton kicks it off on Tuesday with a signing at the Union Square Barnes & Noble in New York. She'll keep it going all the way through December, all across the country.
It really isn't clear anymore who comprises Hillary's inner circle, if she even has much of one left these days. What is abundantly clear, however, is that whomever is in it only tells her what she wants to hear.
That also is what probably doomed her last year, in addition to her legendary lack of likability.
This is nothing but good news for the Republicans and President Trump. Hillary's tortured turns in the spotlight will invariably be covered by the MSM, because they just can't help themselves. That will provide some media cover for the bumbling GOP Congress and should give the president some good material with which to mock Mrs. Clinton.
It isn't just anonymous former staffers who are dreading the return of America's Least Favorite Grandma:
“Maybe at the worst possible time, as we are fighting some of the most high-stakes policy and institutional battles we may ever see, at a time when we're trying to bring the party together so we can all move the party forward — stronger, stronger together,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents a Northern California district. “She's got every right to tell her story. Who am I to say she shouldn't, or how she should tell it? But it is difficult for some of us, even like myself who've supported her, to play out all these media cycles about the blame game, and the excuses.”
That's gonna leave a mark.
The dirty little secret while the press wails about the Republicans is that the Democrats are in disarray too. Despite a generous hand from the media as it constantly tries to create noise and distractions for President Trump, the Democrats have not been able to really pick up any momentum of their own.
They still have no real coherent message to offer voters beyond, “We don't like the president.”
When they do start talking policy, it's far left progressive policy, and that's not going to win over the heartland voters they've lost.
Hillary Clinton's four month long reminder tour of the party's most bitter recent failure will be a test for them. Will some members of the party who are more prominent start speaking out against her?
She isn't doing much to earn “respected elder stateswoman” status from the Democrats. That is probably because she probably considers herself viable candidate, even if no one outside of her kitchen does.
One thing is certain: you'll want to check President Trump's Twitter feed the morning after Hillary's first promotional appearance.
With violent protesters shutting down Donald Trump's campaign rally in Chicago, people getting physically assaulted, and a Black Lives Matter nutjob almost managing to rush the stage and do God knows what to a presidential candidate, the media is left trying to point the finger at the big boogeyman – “rhetoric.”
You see, “rhetoric” is the cause of these outbursts by the folks at Trump's rally. It's just not his rhetoric that is the problem.
President Obama recently claimed that things happening at Republican events are not “a consequence of actions that I've taken.”
But they're certainly a byproduct of the “rhetoric” you've used over the years, Mr. Obama. And if “rhetoric” can be used to justify violence as you and the media have done in the case of demonizing Trump, then you are just as guilty as hell.
These left-wing goons are inciting violence because they've heard repeatedly from their President over the years that it's okay to do so. They're following Obama's marching orders, that it's okay to be violent against Republicans.
Need examples of Obama saying it's okay to be violent against Republicans?
Here's Obama saying that when it comes to Republicans, you need to “argue and get in their face”:
President Obama tells his supporters that “we need to punish our enemies”:
Obama told Republicans that they need to stop talking and “get out of the way”:
Here's our President saying he wants to know “whose ass to kick”:
Then of course, there's the time Obama told his supporters that “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.”
Via Politico:
The McCain campaign and RNC are pouncing on another line from the Obama pool report: “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,” Obama said in Philadelphia last night. “Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I've seen Eagles fans.”
It's only a matter of time before your followers actually carry out your orders on this last one, Mr. President.

Boos, catcalls and the turning of backs welcomed the commencement speaker at Wednesday's Bethune-Cookman University graduation ceremony.
For 20 minutes, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, President Trump's most opposed cabinet secretary nominee during confirmation hearings, endured jeers from the graduates and interruptions from the university president to calm down the crowd.
At one point, President Edison Jackson even threatened to “send your diplomas in the mail” if the noise didn't stop.
DEVOS DELIVERING COMMENCEMENT SPEED DESPITE UNREST
For most of her speech, and during her receipt of an honorary degree in Human Letters, the students continued the past 10 days of contention that, of all people, she won the invite for the keynote address.
In her speech, DeVos directly addressed the controversy.
"As I said, I'm grateful to be with you today,” said DeVos. "While we will undoubtedly disagree, let us do so respectfully, and let us hear each other out."
When the historically black university announced May 1 that DeVos would be the speaker, the local NAACP, National Federation of Teachers and Florida Education Association immediately voiced outrage, arguing she's an enemy of public education, a champion of school choice, favors using tax dollars to pay for kids to attend religious, private schools and is ignorant about the origins of historically black colleges and universities.
MONEY TO PREP POOR KIDS FOR COLLEGE? SORRY, WRONG SIZE TYPE
That opinion comes from a statement DeVos released in February, referring to historically black colleges and universities:
“HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.”
Many historically black school leaders expressed shock and dismay that DeVos didn't also mention how segregation, racism and Jim Crow forced the creation of black colleges in the first place, i.e., there was no “choice.”
Students, alumni and the NAACP organized an online petition drive calling on DeVos to be disinvited and for Jackson and Board Chairman Joe Petcock to resign.
On Wednesday, President Jackson defended the DeVos invitation, saying “It's important to understand that people will disagree, but that does not mean that you roll over and play dead because you disagree. This is a good day for us. Can you imagine how many institutions would love to have the secretary of education, the highest educational officer in the land, to be their commencement speaker and hopefully open new doors for this institution?”
Jackson added that the Department of Education controls 87 percent of Title IV funding and money is needed at historically black colleges and universities to help students graduate with degrees and impact their communities.
Caylin Mason, one of Bethune-Cookman's 300-plus 2017 graduates, said she was excited about graduation: “Four years..it all paid off.” But when asked about the controversy over DeVos, Mason had two words.
“No comment.”
While some black clergy members lament the loss of parishioners to mega-churches like Rick Warren 's and prosperity-gospel purveyors like Joel Osteen , it is often taken for granted that African-Americans go to religious services. Islam and other religions are represented in the black community, but with the assumption that African-Americans are religious comes the expectation that they are Christian.
“That's the kicker, when they ask which church you go to,” said Linda Chavers, 29, a Harvard graduate student. The question comes up among young black professionals like her classmates as casually as chitchat about classes and dating. “At first,” she said, “they think it's because I haven't found one, and they'll say, ‘Oh I know a few great churches,' and I don't know a nice way to say I'm not interested,” she said.

Even among those African-Americans who report no affiliation, more than two-thirds say religion plays a somewhat important role in their lives, according to Pew. And some nonbelieving African-Americans have been known to attend church out of tradition.
“I have some colleagues and friends who identify as culturally Christian in a way similar to ethnic Jews,” said Josef Sorett, a religion professor at Columbia University . “They may go to church because that's the church their family attends, but they don't necessarily subscribe to the beliefs of Christianity.”
Given the cultural pull toward religion, less than one-half of a percent of African-Americans identify themselves as atheists, compared with 1.6 percent of the total population, according to Pew. Black atheists, then, find they are a minority within a minority.
In 2008, John Branch made his first YouTube video, “Black Atheism.” With the camera tight on his face, Mr. Branch, now 27, asks, “What is an atheist? An atheist is simply someone who lacks a belief in God.” Half kidding, he goes on, “We're not drinking blood. We're not worshiping Satan.” The video has received more than 40,000 hits.
“I think it attracted so much attention because, in the black community, not believing in God is seen as a thing for white people,” said Mr. Branch, a marketing strategist in Raleigh , N.C. “I hate that term, ‘acting white,' but it's used.”

According to Pew, the vast majority of atheists and agnostics are white, including the authors Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens .
Seeking a public intellectual of their own, some black atheists have claimed the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , interpreting his arguments against teaching intelligent design in the classroom to be an endorsement of atheism. But Dr. deGrasse Tyson is loath to be associated with any part of the movement. When contacted last week by e-mail, he noted a Twitter exchange he had in August, in which he told a follower, “Am I an Atheist, you ask? Labels are mentally lazy ways by which people assert they know you without knowing you.”
Jamila Bey, a 35-year-old journalist, said, “To be black and atheist, in a lot of circles, is to not be black.” She said the story the nation tells of African-Americans' struggle for civil rights is a Christian one, so African-Americans who reject religion are seen as turning their backs on their history. This feels unfair to Ms. Bey, whose mother is Roman Catholic and whose father is Muslim, because people of different faiths, and some with none, were in the movement. The black church dominated, she said, because it was the one independent black institution allowed under Jim Crow laws, providing free spaces to African-Americans who otherwise faced arrest for congregating in public.

Recognizing the role of churches in the movement, Ms. Bey still takes issue when their work is retold as God's. “These people were using the church, pulling from its resources, to attack a problem and literally change history. But the story that gets told is, ‘Jesus delivered us,' ” Ms. Bey said. “Frankly, it was humans who did all the work.”
Garrett Daniels wrote on the Facebook group page of Black Atheists, “I CAME out that I'm an atheist to my family.” He added, “I'm not disowned and they apparently don't love me any less.” A member responded: “Good for you. Seeking out religion just to fit in will drive you crazy.”
The Facebook discussion boards for these groups often become therapy sessions, and as administrator of the Black Atheist Alliance, Mark Hatcher finds himself a counselor. “My advice is usually let them know you understand their religion and what they believe, but you have to take a stand,” he said.

This strategy has worked for Mr. Hatcher, 30, a graduate student who started a secular student group at the historically black Howard University. For two of his Facebook friends, though, it has not worked, and they moved to Washington, not to sever ties with their families as much as to keep their sanity.
Now that Facebook groups have connected black atheists, meet-ups have started in cities like Atlanta , Houston and New York.
On a gray Saturday in October, 40 members of African Americans for Humanism, including Mr. Hatcher, Ms. Bey and Mr. Adams, met at a restaurant in Washington to celebrate the first anniversary of holding meet-ups. Speakers discussed plans to broaden services like tutoring and starting a speaking tour at historically black colleges.

“Someone's sitting on the fence, saying, ‘I go to church, and all my friends and my family are there, how am I supposed to leave?' ” Mr. Hatcher said on stage. “That's where we, as African-American humanists, say, ‘Hey look, we have a community over here.' ”
After the speeches, Mr. Hatcher looked at the attendees mingling, laughing, hugging one another. “I feel like I'm sitting at a family reunion,” he said.

Seated beside Mr. Hatcher was his girlfriend, Ellice Whittington, a 26-year-old chemical engineer he met through a black atheist Facebook group. He lived in Washington and she in Denver , so their relationship progressed slowly, she said, over long e-mails. But Mr. Hatcher said he fell immediately. “We bonded over music . She loved Prince.”
As for being nonreligious in the black community, Ms. Whittington said, “It definitely makes your field of candidates a whole lot smaller.”
She added, “It scared some men to hear me say I don't believe in God the way you do. I've heard people say, ‘How can you love somebody if you don't believe in God?' ”
