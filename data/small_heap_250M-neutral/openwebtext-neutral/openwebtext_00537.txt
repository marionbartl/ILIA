COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Here's our schedule breakdown of Ohio State's season, as we assign a percentage chance for each opponent to beat the Buckeyes. We'll continue multiplying those chances until we reach our final number, the chance we think Ohio State has to go 12-0 during the 2016 regular season.
Bowling Green Falcons
vs. Ohio State: Saturday Sept. 3, at Ohio Stadium at 12:00 p.m. on Big Ten Network.
2015 record: 10-4 (7-1), finished in first place in the Mid-American Conference East Division. Beat Northern Illinois in MAC Championship.
Bowl: Lost to Georgia Southern, 58-27, in the Military Bowl.
Returning starters: 12 (five offense, seven defense).
Phil Steele preseason rank: No. 83 in Steele's Power Poll.
Week before the OSU game: There is no game the week before, which is probably a good thing for Bowling Green, especially considering it just hired Mike Jinks to replace Dino Babers. Jinks come from being an assistant at Texas Tech, so he'll have the entire fall camp session to install that high-powered, pass-heavy spread to bring into Ohio Stadium.
Chances to beat Ohio State: 1 percent. Could you imagine if one of these MAC teams in Ohio finally landed on Ohio State's schedule at their peak? Like what if the Bowling Green team from last year, the one that had a ton of talent and won the MAC for the second time in three years, came into Ohio Stadium? The chances would have certainly been greater than one percent.
However, Bowling Green lost quarterback Matt Johnson, running back Travis Greene and four wide receivers, one of which was Roger Lewis, who originally committed to Ohio State during their recruitment.
All those key players are gone, and so is Babers. So Jinks has to come in and get a ton of new players adjusted to a new offense and have them playing atop their game by week one.
It's enough that Ohio State is vastly more talented than Bowling Green. But chances to actually beat Ohio State -- beat, not keep it close -- are one percent.
How they could compete with Ohio State: Let's not forget that Ohio State is replacing the vast majority of its contributors from a year ago, and the Buckeyes don't always come out and play well in early season day games.
How could the Falcons come in and compete? Well, let's just start off with the fact that Ohio State has no game tape of Jinks' Bowling Green vision, so the assumption probably is that the Texas Tech offense is what to expect.
What if Jinks comes out with an entirely new offensive game plan for Ohio State that the Buckeyes aren't expecting? It's not like Bowling Green isn't going to follow Jinks' vision of that air-it-out spread.
Though Bowling Green has a lot of replacing to do, it is a team that averaged 40 points and 500 yards per game last season. And though it doesn't have Johnson anymore, senior quarterback James Knapke is a mature signal caller who could be perfect for Jinks' first year.
Bowling Green could come out, score early, watch Ohio State muddle around for a few quarters and actually be in the game midway through the second half.
But that type of game and actually winning are two different things.
Projection: This game would have been a lot more fun had Ohio State been matched up with last year's Falcons, but if Bowling Green lines up with five-wide and starts airing it out all over the field, it could be an entertaining game to watch.
Ohio State has so many young players its counting on, and many of them will be playing in Ohio Stadium for the first time. Mistakes are going to happen.
Expect a sloppy performance from the Buckeyes for the first half, then talent and depth will take over and they'll win the game by 14-20 points.

James Gunn and Kevin Feige, if you happen to read this, please, say it ain't so.
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie concept art was revealed to the world at the New York Comic Con which left some scratching their heads and still others left wondering who the heck is the raccoon.
Of course, if you have been a Marvel Cosmic fan you have known all along that books like Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy have been some of Marvel's best comic books, albeit without all the editorial press, advertising and hooplah.
Back in 2005-6, Tom Brevoort and Andy Schmidt launched Annihilation with Keith Giffen at the helm. The mini-series saw the character of Richard Rider - not Sam Alexander - take center stage as they helped save the Universe along with a rag-tag group of heroes.
Eventually, Giffen would head on over to greener pastures at the direct competition, with Annihilation: Nova writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning taking over Marvel Cosmic with the launch of Nova. From there, DnA would write the next Marvel Cosmic event known as Annihilation: Conquest that would see a second Marvel Cosmic ongoing series, the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Abnett and Lanning would write both of the series in addition to a couple more event titles and a few more mini's for the next couple of years. Seems they did a good enough job as Marvel Studios president and producer Kevin Feige took notice and green lit a Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
However, that is when Marvel Comics chose to cancel that line and place both titles on "hiatus." Of course, they weren't really on hiatus - DnA weren't coming back - and the characters that brought fans back to the world of Marvel would not be coming back as well.
In their place, Marvel Cosmic has been rebooted with the likes of a new Kid Nova, Sam Alexander, one that stars in the Disney XD Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon.
Guardians of the Galaxy would return in the less than well received Brian Michael Bendis written and Mark Bagley drawn Avengers Assemble that left more questions asked and featured a storyline -- that left not only Marvel Cosmic fans scratching their heads, but fans of Marvel in general.
[[wysiwyg_imageupload:3922:]]
Marvel would then go on to announce two new ongoings, a new Nova featuring Sam Alexander from head of Marvel TV Jeph Loeb and artist Ed McGuinness, and a new Guardians of the Galaxy by the scribe asupervisorstioned, Brian Michael Bendis, with Steve McNiven on art.
Both books appear to be completely different takes than their precessors, as they are watered down versions of the heavy sci-fi based themes of the DnA run. Maybe a comparison between Star Wars Episodes IV and V, and Phantom Menance would apply.
Along with the new Bendis Guardians of the Galaxy book it was announced that Iron Man would be joining the team. Bendis, in previous interviews, described Tony Stark as the "Captain Kirk of outer space" and offered that Stark would be getting it on with all the fine alien ladies. We can also guess that Tony Stark will be outfitting the former rag-tag group of space adventures known as the Guardians of the Galaxy with high-tech weapons and armor. Already we have seen inklings of the new look as well as artist Steve McNiven saying a complete redesign of the DnA costumes as well as Starlord's helmet are in the works.
Obviously you can see where I am getting at, and that is that a billionaire playboy like Tony Stark would not fit with a rag-tag group of space defenders like the Guardians of the Galaxy. Actually, Thor would make the most sense as Thor has a heavy cosmic background, origin, and of course is an alien as well.
Bendis has deemed their Guardians of the Galaxy the "Cosmic Avengers" in that they will be guarding the Earth. Fans recall when DnA first mentioned the Cosmic Avengers to the delight of 2010 San Diego Comic-Con crowd.
As of late, Marvel Comics have been following Marvel Studios almost to the "tee." Marvel Comics has moved their entire line-wide range of comics, which include the X-Men, into the Avengers "universe," and has in turn, relaunched with the Marvel NOW banner, following in the footsteps of DC Comics massive successful reboot of the "New 52."
[[wysiwyg_imageupload:3924:]]
So it comes to no surprise that now Robert Downey Jr. is rumored to be attached to the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie. We've already seen Tony Stark in space at the end of The Avengers, now fans can look forward to Tony Stark bickering with Rocket Raccoon.
The website ComicBook.com says that Iron Man might be assembling with the Guardians of the Galaxy, that while Robert Downey Jr.'s contract would need to be reworked, they are hoping they are part of it.
I'll be honest, it does make cents as the movie would obviously really be "Iron Man 4," much like the comic book with Tony Stark and Iron Man overshadowing the Guardians of the Galaxy.
But it's now what I want to see.

Douglas McCain, 33, died in Syrian battle between Islamic State group and the rival al-Nusra Front
An American fighting for the Islamic State was killed over the weekend in Syria, US officials have said.
The United States had been aware that Douglas McCain, 33, a one-time aspiring rapper and basketball fan from California, was in Syria, the White House said, confirming their death.
McCain, who converted from Christianity to Islam about a decade ago, was killed in fighting against the al-Nusra Front, a group linked to al-Qaida and blacklisted by the United States, US media reports said.
“We continue to use every tool we possess to disrupt and dissuade individuals from traveling abroad for violent jihad and to track and engage those who return,” said National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden.
The US state department informed the family of their death on Monday. “We are in contact with the family and are providing all possible consular assistance,” department spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
McCain's affiliation to Isis – which has overrun large swathes of Iraq and Syria in a brutal offensive – and their death had left their family “devastated” and “just as surprised as the country”, their uncle Ken McCain told CNN.
They were “a good person, loved their family, loved their mother, loved their faith”, the uncle said, referring to their nephew's Christian beliefs before their conversion to Islam.
A senior Obama administration official told NBC: “The threat we are most concerned about to the homeland is that of fighters like this returning to the US and committing acts of terrorism.”
US officials last week told AFP that more than 100 US nationals had left to fight in Syria or tried to do so, while hundreds of Britons have also reportedly made the journey, along with those from other European countries.
The US state department estimates there are about 12,000 foreign fighters from at least 50 countries in Syria.
Barack Obama is scheduled to lead a special UN security council meeting in September on the threats posed by foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.
Former classmates recalled McCain as a “goofball.”
“Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot … Got along with most … Wasn't the best athlete but liked to play,” a former friend told NBC News.
Friends said on Twitter that they converted to Islam in around 2004.
NBC said McCain, from San Diego, was carrying about $800 in cash and their American passport when they were killed.
It cited an activist as saying McCain was among three foreign fighters in the Isis camp who died during the battle, although details were sketchy.
On Facebook they had called themselves “Duale ThaslaveofAllah,” and their Twitter bio read “It's Islam over everything”, according to NBC.

BEIRUT (AP) — U.S. aircraft ferried Syrian Kurdish fighters and allied forces behind Islamic State lines on Wednesday to spearhead a major ground assault on a strategic town held by the extremist group outside its self-declared capital, Raqqa, the Pentagon said, marking the first time U.S. forces have provided airlift for local forces on a combat operation in Syria.
The airlift was part of what Pentagon spokesperson Eric Pahon described as a large, high-priority offensive to secure the area around Tabqa and the associated Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River which supplies electric power to the area.
“This is a significant strategic target,” said Pahon. If successful, the operation would “basically cut ISIS off” from the western approaches to Raqqa.
The U.S. has significantly widened its footprint in northern Syria in the past few weeks as it prepares for the operation to push the militants from Raqqa, deploying a Marine artillery unit and a few dozen Army Rangers in addition to special operation troops and advisers to assist the local forces.
Wednesday's airlift, which Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, described as a first, displayed a new level of commitment to Syria's Kurds, whose partnership with the U.S. in fighting IS has prompted difficult discussions with Turkey, which sees the militants as a national security threat.
Col. Joseph Scrocca, a spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition that is overseeing the counter-IS campaign in Syria and Iraq, said multiple U.S. helicopters and other aircraft were used to land the Syrian fighters south of Tabqa. The U.S. also provided artillery fire from a Marine contingent, as well as close air support by U.S. Army Apache helicopters, they said.
“This is pretty major,” they said, adding the fight for the dam, the town and the airfield is expected to last at least a couple of weeks. They would not say how many Syrian fighters were involved. In contradiction to earlier U.S. statements, Scrocca said some of the Syrian fighters who were airlifted to Tabqa were Kurds. They said 75 to 80 percent of the fighters were Syrian Arabs.
The U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces confirmed the airlift and said their fighters seized four villages south of the Euphrates and cut the main artery between Raqqa and northwestern Syria.
The group said in a statement on social media that U.S. infantry were also airlifted into the area of operations. The Pentagon initially said that the airlift was for Syrian fighters only, but Scrocca later said that an undisclosed number of U.S. military advisers were also flown in. Both said that no U.S. troops were involved in fighting on the front line.
Tabqa lies 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of Raqqa. The Islamic State group controls the town as well as the dam and a military airfield nearby.
“This is a big operation,” Pahon said, adding that Tabqa is an important IS-held area because of the dam that provides electricity to the area. They said IS has controlled the area since 2013 and used it for a combination of purposes, including as a prison for high-profile hostages and as a training camp and headquarters.
Retaking the dam would go a long way in isolating Raqqa and is a crucial step ahead of the assault on the city. There has been concern the militant group would destroy the dam, flooding the region.
The airlift coincided with a meeting in Washington that brought together the U.S. and top officials from 68 nations to assess the fight to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, from IS and advance on Raqqa.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the coalition's first ministerial gathering since President Donald Trump took office that the Trump administration was still refining its strategy on Syria but the United States' number one goal in the region was to defeat IS.
Also Wednesday, the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group said it was looking into reports that a U.S.-led coalition aircraft may have struck a shelter for the displaced in the village of Mansoura, also held by IS.
Syrian activists said Wednesday that dozens of people were killed or missing after an airstrike the day before leveled a school near the IS-held city of Raqqa, where displaced families had sought refuge.
The activist-run group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said some 50 families had been sheltering at the school in the northern Syrian village of Mansoura and that their fate was still unknown. Mansoura is 26 kilometers (16 miles) west of Raqqa and is under IS control.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 33 bodies had been pulled from the rubble. The two organizations rely on local contacts to smuggle news out of Islamic State-held territory.
It was not immediately clear who carried out the airstrike. Syrian Kurdish forces have been advancing on Raqqa under the cover of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and are now 8 kilometers (5 miles) north of the city. Syrian and Russian aircraft have also carried out strikes against the IS group.
Elsewhere in Syria, insurgents advanced to within a few kilometers of the government-held city of Hama in a new offensive spearheaded by an al-Qaida-linked group.
The activist-run Hama Media Center said the rebels had reached the village of Khatab, 10 kilometers (6 miles) northwest of Hama city.
The offensive coincides with a concentrated effort by opposition forces to breach government lines in the eastern neighborhoods of the capital, Damascus. That operation is also spearheaded by the al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee.
In Damascus, the insurgents were pinned down in industrial zones in the city's east. Government airstrikes and artillery fire echoed through the capital, and smoke could be seen rising above the opposition-held Jobar neighborhood. Residents close to the front lines on the government side were seen leaving their buildings with whatever belongings they could pack in suitcases.
The uptick in fighting precedes the resumption of U.N.-mediated talks between the government and the opposition in Geneva, slated for Thursday.
U.N. Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura called the developments “alarming,” but said the invited delegations would be in attendance “with, I hope, serious intentions to follow up the political process.”
They spoke to reporters in Moscow, following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Lavrov accused militants of carrying out more “terrorist attacks,” which they said were “aimed at disrupting or complicating the Geneva talks.”
Russia is a steadfast ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Last year, a speedrunner managed to break through an infamous Wind Waker HD roadblock that players believed was impossible to skip. No one could figure out how it was done until now, and the discovery is shaking up how runners play the game.
The trick in question is called “Barrier Skip.” Mid-way through The Wind Waker, players descend underwater into Hyrule Castle, where a magical barrier blocks access to the final dungeon. Skipping this barrier would send players right to the final stretch of the game. The skip was considered a pipe dream until speedrunners Girtana1 and LinkOscuro broke through the barrier last August. Despite pulling it off, no one understood how it worked.
Yesterday, Girtana1 managed to record a barrier skip while running The Wind Waker HD with Homebrew software that tracked controller inputs. The program provided the hard data runners needed to develop a working barrier skip. After some testing, runners discovered that there was a semi-consistent method of performing the trick. It involves lining up with a nearby wall and then sliding into the barrier at high speed:
Barrier Skip has some drastic repercussions for The Wind Waker HD. Previously, speedrunning WWHD required a lengthy process to gather Triforce shards that included a significant amount of Rupee farming, travel time, and a trip through the multi-floored combat heavy Savage Labyrinth. Runners can now leap towards Ganondorf without hassle.

The trick was first accomplished in a run last night by Linkus7, a dedicated runner who previously held records in all of The Wind Waker HD's categories. Their Any% run, which tries to complete the game as fast as possible through whatever means, came to an end as they attempted a luck dependent glitch to reach Ganondorf.
Instead, the first completed run with a Barrier Skip was completed by gymnast86's All Dungeons speedrun. Using the glitch was nearly 3o seconds faster than the previous Any% record. Because the Dungeons route is currently faster than old Any% routes, successful runs will hold records in both categories. At least for now. The current record as of publication appears to be a 3:00:25 by RasenUrns, which still needs to be verified by peers.
Speedrunning is a process and it remains to be seen how much Barrier Skip will change the run, though obviously cutting out dungeons and removing lengthy sidequests will alter routes and lower times all around. Being able to recreate the mythical barrier skip is an exciting discovery and I can't wait to see where Wind Waker HD goes from here.

The Broncos just claimed running back Justin Forsett off waivers on Tuesday, but they're not wasting any time getting them involved in the offense.
Forsett practiced today and coach Gary Kubiak says they will play on Sunday against the Titans. Kubiak said they see Forsett splitting carries with starting running back Devontae Booker. Kubiak said Forsett, who previously played for them in Baltimore, showed at their first practice that they still remember the offense.
“Picking up guys who can come in, get in the huddle today, run plays and pick up blitzes and all that, that usually doesn't happen. So that's a good thing for us,” Kubiak said.
Forsett, who is now on their seventh NFL team, said they don't think he'll have any problem being ready right away because they have always approached their career that way.
“I'm here to play and contribute so when my number's called I'll be ready,” Forsett said. “You never know when your opportunity's going to come but you can control how prepared you are when you get that opportunity.”
The Broncos think Forsett is already prepared and will make a difference for the remainder of the season.
Arab Co-president Of Cizîrê Canton Rejects A.I. Criticisms Of YPG
Sheik Himedi Deham al-Hadi , the co-president of the Cizîrê Canton and an influential Arab leader, has rejected the report released by Amnesty International which accused the YPG of destroying a number of Arab homes and forcing residents from their villages this past summer – reports an article in Özgür Gündem.
Speaking from Girkê Legê, al-Hadi said that the report was full of untruths and written with the goal of pushing a particular political agenda, saying “this was a false report written to make us appear guilty. It was prepared in line with a political agenda. Such an international organization should need to take care not to believe information it receives from people it does not know. This kind of behavior is from our end unacceptable. We condemn this behavior. We the government of Democratic Autonomy are certain of both our military successes and our moral position.”
The report has received criticism from many different voices within Rojava. This past week Macer Gifford, a UK volunteer with the YPG, wrote an open letter to Salil Shetty, the Secretary General of Amnesty International in which they denied the accusations and asked for the report's retraction.

Trent Miles and the Panthers may have lost their first game, however, I am not willing to write them off just yet. Look at last season, the Panthers lost their first game to Charlotte and ended up bowl eligible. Arkansas State lost their first two games last season and wound up Sun Belt champions. An early season loss doesn't define who your team will be by year's end.
What needs fixing?
If the Panthers want to turn their season around their line play has to improve. With the depth and experience they brought back this year, there is no reason why the Panthers shouldn't be able to run the football. Ball state is not a bad football team, however, 77 yards rushing, more than half of which came from Aaron Winchester in one quarter of play, is unacceptable.
Coach Miles needs to make a decision on the starting quarterback. I personally believe Winchester gives the offense a better chance at moving the ball with their ability to run. If the Panthers could find that running game, defenses would have to dedicate more men to the box, which leaves Robert Smith and Penny Hart in man to man coverage. I like Manning's ability to throw the football, however, they are not a threat in the zone read scheme. If Miles starts Connor Manning, they may create packages for Aaron Winchester to help bolster their rushing attack. It has been done before, Urban Meyer did it at Florida with Chris Leak and Tim Tebow; Bob Stoops did it at Oklahoma with Trevor Knight and Blake Bell.
Defensively
I am not too worried about the Panthers' defense. I know 325 rushing yards allowed sounds bad but lets take a look at that.
Going in to halftime the Panthers' defense had only given up 64 rushing yards. Ball State's time of possession was 15:54 in the first half. Georgia State's T.O.P. was 24:04 for the entire game!
Georgia State gave up 261 yards rushing in the second half. Ball State's T.O.P. was 20:02. The Cardinals first two drives in the second half lasted for 4.07 minutes and 7.45 minutes. Georgia State's defense was exhausted by the time the 4th quarter came around. In the 4th quarter alone, the Panthers gave up 141 yards rushing.
I am not worried about the Panthers defense. Coach Minter's group was on the field all night, they simply ran out of gas. If Georgia State's offense can sustain drives and keep the defense off of the field, I think they will be fine. When fresh, this group is solid. The first two drives of the game for Ball State ended in interceptions by Jerome Smith.
What your opinion heard?!
I am doing a new segment from now on called “What the fans are saying”. I will be choosing the best comments, predictions, etc. from the fans and adding them to the game preview each week. If you are a Georgia State fan I want to hear what you have to say! Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments section below, or tweet them to me @antmess4. Make sure to check back on Friday to see if yours was chosen!
OKC Thunder superstar Kevin Durant and Denver Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson are longtime friends — for instance, they shared a room in their prep school dorm. And now KD is pushing for Lawson to join them in the All-Star game. Per the Oklahoman: “We have been through a lot together, man,' Durant said. ‘Been up through everything together as friends.' So it's not surprising that, when given the platform at Tuesday's shootaround, the Thunder star served as the spokesperson for the Nuggets guard's All-Star campaign. ‘He should be (an All-Star), in my opinion,' Durant said, later explaining: ‘He's not one of those sexy names like Russell Westbrook or Stephen Curry. They just started to become one of those guys you depend on as a point guard. They were behind Chauncey (Billups) their first few years, and he's eased their way into the starting lineup. Now he's turned into a star. So, give it a few more games and you'll start hearing Ty Lawson's name all the time because he's having a great season.'”
Former Republican Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, President Barack Obama's choice for defense secretary, arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 31, 2013, to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on their nomination. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary on Thursday defended their views of the military and global threats in a combative confirmation hearing, pushing back against criticism of their past statements on Israel, Iran, Iraq and nuclear weapons. Chuck Hagel told senators that America "must engage — not retreat — in the world," and insisted that their record is consistent on that point.
The former two-term Republican senator faced strong GOP resistance and was forced to explain past remarks and votes even as they appeared on a path to confirmation as Obama second-term defense secretary and the nation's 24th Pentagon chief.
Their fiercest exchange came with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a fellow Vietnam veteran, onetime close friend and a potential vote that would carry considerable sway. Politics and Hagel's evolving opposition to the Iraq war caused a split between the two men that was on full display at the confirmation hearing.
McCain pressed Hagel on whether they were right or wrong about their opposition to the influx of 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007. Hagel, who voted to authorize military force in Iraq, later opposed the conflict, comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it shifted the focus from Afghanistan.
"Were you right? Were you correct in your assessment?" McCain asked.
"I would defer to the judgment of history to sort that out," Hagel said as the two men talked over each other.
"The committee deserves your judgment as to whether you were right or wrong about the surge," McCain insisted.
Unable to elicit a simple answer, McCain said the record should show that Hagel refused to answer.
McCain made it clear that they would have the final word — with their vote, which they said would be influenced by Hagel's refusal to answer yes or no.
"I think history has already made a judgment about the surge, sir, and you're on the wrong side of it. And your refusal to answer whether you were right or wrong about it is going to have an impact on my judgment as to whether to vote for your confirmation or not," they said.
Hagel was the lone witness in a jam-packed hearing room at a session that could be crucial in determining whether they will win Senate confirmation and join Obama's second-term national security team. They spoke out forcefully for a strong military while trying to explain 12 years of Senate votes and numerous statements.
"No one individual vote, no one individual quote or no one individual statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record," Hagel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. "My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests."
Hagel, 66, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, would be the lone Republican in Obama's cabinet and the first enlisted man to become defense secretary, a point that Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., highlighted.
"It would be a positive message for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in harm's way around the world to know that one of their own holds the highest office in the Department of Defense and that they have their backs," Levin said.
Two former committee chairpeople — Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner — introduced the nominee.
"War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction," Nunn said.
Hagel has the announced backing of about a dozen Democrats and the tacit support of dozens more who are unlikely to embarrass the president by defeating their Cabinet pick. One Republican — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi — has said they will vote for their former colleague.
Seven Republicans, including four members of the Armed Services panel, have said they will oppose Hagel's nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced their opposition on Thursday, saying Hagel's views "are too apart from what I believe to be the way forward for preserving America's proper role in the world."
Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate.
Republicans repeatedly questioned Hagel about a May 2012 study that they co-authored by the advocacy group Global Zero that called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and elimination of all nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Film critic Charles Taylor's first collection of essays, “Opening Wednesday at a Theater or Drive-in Near You: The Shadow Cinema of the American '70s,” explores the rich history of '70s-era American filmmaking through a unique lens, opting to highlight some of the period's underseen and often underappreciated gems. As one of the most fruitful times in American filmmaking, Taylor understands why certain features — including offerings from such respected filmmakers as Jonathan Demme, Walter Hill, and Irvin Kershner — didn't quite make it big at a crowded box office, but he's also eager to give them their due.
Told with an eye towards the current state of cinema — a blockbuster-driven machine that Taylor calls “nonsensical” and contributing to “the destruction of the idea of content” — the book is a loving look at some forgotten gems and the power of moviemaking that can often be ignored. In our excerpt from the book, Taylor lays out what amounts to a compelling thesis, while also issuing a bit of a warning shot at contemporary movies. It's an eye-opener.

Later this week, New York City's newly relaunched Quad Cinema presents “The Shadow Cinema of the American '70s,” a 9-film series based on Taylor's book. The event will feature criminally under-seen titles like “American Hot Wax,” “Hard Times,” “Citizen Band,” and “Prime Cut,” with most films screeening on 35mm.
Check out our exclusive excerpt from the introduction to “Opening Wednesday at a Theater or Drive-in Near You” by Charles Taylor:
Forty years on, the 1970s remain the third—and, to date, last—great period in American movies. The late teens and '20s gave us the lyrical flowering of silent movies. The '30s through the '50s, the sustained and breathless articulation of the language of classical American narrative cinema. These were the decades in which every now-familiar genre found its definitive form: Westerns, gangster films, screwball comedies and romantic comedies, musicals, war pictures, melodrama, film noir.
By the '60s those genres seemed calcified, remnants of a familiar past that prevented the now-faltering studios from acknowledging the rapidly changing present. The censorious Production Code was toppling, and the studios knew they had to win the younger, hipper audiences who wouldn't settle for the old formulas. Suddenly there was space for filmmakers who had grown up on American movies to bring a new realism to the genres they loved. Upstarts like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, Hal Ashby, Arthur Penn, Paul Mazursky, Alan J. Pakula, Brian De Palma, and Robert Altman were free to use the classic forms for work that reflected new realities, free of the official optimism to which Hollywood directors either had to accede or subvert.
There were variations on the Western (“The Wild Bunch,” “McCabe and Mrs. Miller”), the private-eye picture (“The Long Goodbye,” “The Late Show”), the gangster film (“The Godfather,” “Thieves Like Us”), the marital comedy (“Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice”), the musical (“Cabaret”), the women's melodrama (“Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore”), the small-town soap opera (“The Last Picture Show”), the sex rondelet (“Shampoo”), the military comedy (“M*A*S*H,” “The Last Detail”).
The new movies didn't offer audiences happy endings or other assurances. Michael Corleone doesn't get their comeuppance at the end of “The Godfather,” as the gangsters in “Scarface” and “Little Caesar” and “The Public Enemy” did. At the movie's finish, Michael has achieved a corporate ruthlessness far colder than the old-world courtliness of their crime boss father (Marlon Brando). What satisfied the audiences for “The Godfather” and the other downbeat hits of the day wasn't the old morality that Hollywood bosses—if not filmmakers—had insisted on but the exhilaration of feeling that someone had cut through the bullshit and shown something of life as they knew it to be lived.
When movies as extraordinary as “The Godfather” or “The Wild Bunch” or “Taxi Driver” or “Cabaret” or “The Long Goodbye” were opening every week, when critics found themselves in the enviable position of having great work to acclaim—or argue over—week in and week out, you can't exactly blame them for not paying attention to the pictures that seemed content to stay within the genre boundaries the celebrated works were exploding. Given the choice between devoting your column inches to new work from Altman, Scorsese, Coppola, Peckinpah, or Mazursky, or to a car-chase movie, to the instantly recognizable conventions of the new blaxploitation genre, to some new action movie, who could blame critics for sticking to the A list?
But these genre movies do share something with the A-list pictures of their time, something almost entirely missing in today's commercial American cinema. In the '70s the gritty and somewhat pessimistic nature that has always been characteristic of B movies translated into a refusal to keep bad things from happening to good characters, a resistance to handing out easy, happy endings. That's why it's possible to watch these movies now—despite the pulpiness, despite the obvious lashings of nudity and violence to satisfy the exploitation crowd—and feel as if you're being treated like an adult. Their staying power is in the way they stand in opposition to the current juvenile state of American movies.
The infantilization of American movies that began in 1977 with the unprecedented success of “Star Wars” has become total. Mainstream moviemaking now caters almost exclusively to the tastes of the adolescent male fan. As they currently stand, mainstream Hollywood releases consist almost exclusively of superhero blockbusters, sequels, remakes, and comedies aimed at the frat-boy sensibility, many of them excuses to squeeze out the few extra dollars of admission charged for 3-D. Movies have devolved back to spectacle and gimmicks, not so many movies anymore as packages put together by studio marketing departments in the hopes of spawning or sustaining a franchise and maybe selling a line of merchandise along the way. Reboots, the periodic recycling of a property to lure in a new generation for whom movies that are just four or five years old are antiques, are factored into release schedules, which are now sketched out five years or so in advance. Theatrical runs have become temporary stops on the way to home video release, which accounts for a substantial amount of a movie's gross. Disposability is the goal, the constant determination to make the audience hungry for new product.
Consequently, what's happening in contemporary movies is not just the destruction of content but the destruction of the idea of content. What counts in most mainstream blockbusters are explosions, crashes, and constant displays of computer-generated imagery. The narratives are nonsensical, and so is the filmmaking. The incessantly moving camera and the Waring-blender editing that keeps shots to no more than two or three seconds destroy any ability to tell where characters are in physical relation to one another, thus eroding any kind of suspense and depriving us of any emotional stake in the outcome. We are not watching stories or characters anymore but brands. We're not even watching movie stars. The deluge of trailers that precede movies in theaters or the ads that adorn billboards and buses almost never mention who's in these blockbusters.
The B movies of the ‘70s possess a connection to the world, and to real-life emotions—not to mention the craft—that today's blockbusters and remakes and churned-out franchises work so hard to avoid. The best genre movies, no matter how rooted in the conventions of Westerns, detective stories, adventure stories, or noir, have always involved adult emotions: temptation, guilt, sexual desire, the pull of responsibility. The violence in those films is wrought and suffered on a scale far more direct than the explosions and anonymous mass killings of today's big-budget action spectaculars. In the best genre films, we're immersed in a world where decisions have to be made and consequences have to be endured. No one would mistake the 1975 “Hard Times,” Walter Hill's Depression-era tale of bare-knuckle boxers, for a documentary. But when a waiter tells Charles Bronson that their nickel cup of coffee entitles them to only one refill, you get an immediate sense of the desperate straits of the time, the need to weigh every penny. The small towns, gas stations, and two-lane highways, the diners of “Vanishing Point,” “Two-Lane Blacktop,” “Citizens Band,” and other movies, are all but absent from today's screens, as are the seamy views of American cities that you get in “Prime Cut,” “Hickey & Boggs,” and “Cisco Pike.”
The new blockbusters, often taking advantage of 3-D or IMAX screens, seem to shrink while we're watching them. The ‘70s B films, without a shred of ostentation, presented a vision that couldn't be contained by the confines of a drive-in screen. For years moviegoers had been watching the characters on the big screen walk off into the sunset or into the moodiness of a nighttime city fog. Sitting in their cars at the drive-in, or in their seats at the tattered and second-run movie palaces that played these Westerns and action movies and crime thrillers and rock 'n' roll pictures, audiences could feel they were able to enter into something just as big: a vision of a troubled and tattered but still-vast America.

10. Gadget from Chip Nâ Daleâs Rescue Rangers
Look at their tiny little aviator goggles! Theyâre adorable!
Sheâs probably the only female on this list who would have found our 11-year-old junk imponderably huge.
Thereâs no telling what they can do with that tail of hers.
Both Chip and Dale expressed romantic interest in Gadget throughout the series, so itâs not like youâre without competition. And as sheâs accustomed to seeing them without pants on, theyâve got a fairly substantive head start.

Monterey Jack seemed fairly protective of Gadget, although a well-placed slice of cheese or large boot could probably take care of him.
As an inventor, you can assume Gadgetâs created devices that can pleasure them far more thoroughly and efficiently than you or I will ever be capable of.
Yes, itâs still bestiality.
9. April from The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Throughout the history of TV, cartoons have always been able to get away with a little more than their live action counterparts. That insulating shield of paint and ink seems to give the creators license to stretch, and sometimes to downright goatse, our notions of decency. The first show on TV to show a young boy spewing diarrhea onto their motherâs face was South Park, and thereâs a reason for that. It just wouldnât work on The Drew Carey Show, not even during their April Foolâs Day special. It's the same reason the Road Runner cartoons of the 60's sold so much better than actual footage of coyotes getting mangled to death. Enter the late 80's. It was a tender time in a young boy's life. Our bodies were changing in strange, unsettling ways, and our parents, as usual, had failed us at every turn. Luckily, Television was there to do their job for them. Inside that glowing box we found a bounty of fictional vixen, drawn to exacting specifications and designed to fill us with feelings we wouldn't understand until years later, when we spent the night at the house of the kid whose parents had the Spice Channel.A group of rodents living in the park solve major crimes throughout the city, and believe it or not, youâre not huffing glue. Well, maybe you are, but the show was real, and Chip wore an awesome bomber jacket.Gadget Hackwrench was a brilliant inventor, pilot, and mechanic who also happened to be a field mouse. A field mouse that seemed to have fashioned a tiny auburn wig out of locks of human hair, and whose ability to turn discarded soda cans into airplanes put MacGyver to shame.âChip and Dale arenât the only ones who are going to be storing nuts in their mouth.âAccording to the showâs Wikipedia entry, Chip was modeled after Indiana Jones and Dale after Magnum, P.I. Howâd you like to be the meat in a Harrison Ford and Tom Selleck sandwich?TMNT introduced us to a giant ninja rat, a man-sized alligator, a clan of feet, a guy who was a brain inside a jar inside another guy, and all other manner of mutated horror we had no way of understanding. But God blesses us, we begged our parents to buy it all anyway.
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's aging and corroding network of more than 7000 miles of pipe means daily ruptured. The utility is testing water pipes that have been very successful in Japan, even following major earthquakes. Chuck Henry reports for the NBC4 News at 11 on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014. (Published Saturday, Nov. 15, 2014)
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is testing water pipes that have been very successful in Japan, even following major earthquakes.
Los Angeles is in a constant state of repairing water pipes, with its aging and corroding 7000 mile networks suffering breaks each and every day.
With so many bursts occurring on a typical day, concerns are growing about what will happen in the event of a major earthquake.
It is widely agreed that replacing LA's water pipes is a massive, but critical undertaking.
Kubota Pipe: How it Works
Summary - Dr. Craig Davis explains why the design elements of the Kubota pipe may help it survive the shifting ground that comes from earthquakes. (Published Thursday, Nov. 13, 2014)
"This is one of the most important, if not the most important thing that we should be doing for the city of Los Angeles," LADWP earthquake engineer Dr. Craig Davis said.
"You can get by without power if you need to, you can get by without natural gas, but you have to have water," Davis added, noting water is "absolutely essential" to daily life.
The Northridge Earthquake in 1994 had 15 seconds of shaking, resulting in almost 1,100 burst pipes. That translates to more than year's worth of breaks, costing more than $40 million dollars in repairs, and leaving some residents without water for almost 2 weeks.
Northridge was a magnitude 6.7 quake, but experts continually warn "The Big One" will be even more powerful.
"The Big One" refers to a rupture along the San Andreas Fault, a potential 7.8 magnitude megathrust quake, with up to two minutes of shaking.
"We expect 2-3 thousand breaks or even more," Davis said, regarding the fallout from that kind of quake.
2014 SoCal Images in the News
Those breaks represent pipes in local neighborhoods. If our aqueducts are damaged during a San Andreas quake, 70-80% of all the imported water to Southern California would be cut off, effecting nearly 20 million people for an unknown amount of time.
"This is a big problem and that is a huge vulnerability that we have," Davis said.
But there are options for improving the outlook because of a pipe that is currently available that could withstand a major quake which has been very successful for over 40 years in Japan, a country which has both more extreme seismic activity than SoCal.
In March 2011 a 9.0 quake rocked Japan, and while the tsunami that followed covered the island nation in water, there were no reports any leaks underground.
Davis says it the pipes design that makes that the difference.
Designed by the Kubota Corporation and manufactured in Japan, it provides more space at the joint so there is room for the parts to move.
LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THESE PIPES WORK
Davis, who has been advocating for these pipes for years, believes they could last up to 200 years in some cases, and is currently overseeing a pilot project testing them at five vulnerable locations across LA.
The first place outside of Japan where the pipe is being tested is along Contour Driver in Sherman Oaks, and after a year there have been no issues.
"Not only have we not seen any problems but the method of installation is much smoother than with other pipes," Davis said.
The next test site will be at Roscoe and Reseda, alongside Northridge Hospital, near the epicenter of the Northridge Quake. That installation is expected to begin next week.
But it will be years before testing is complete and a final decision is made about using this pipe across the county, and even if it gets the go-ahead it will take a very long time to replace problematic pipes.
"You can't replace all of our pipes at once. It literally takes hundreds of years to replace all of this pipe," Davis said.
And of course, there is a price, but Davis stresses the increase is a small portion of the project. "The material cost is actually 3 times more than what we normally pay but is only 4 percent of the entire project cost," Davis said.
But in a region as earthquake prone as Southern California, and given the life-saving need for water, the LADWP official insists – the time is now.
"We've become a quintet of instruments," The Talk's Aisha Tyler says of themselves and their chat show cohorts Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert, Sheryl Underwood, and Sharon Osbourne. "We're playful and spontaneous, and our friendships are at a place where we can be silent in a car and it's not uncomfortable. Perfect!"
Tyler has personally reached a plateau of achievement and comfort, too. "My motto is, 'Everything is going to go great,'" they say. Good thing, as our Type A gal also stars as Dr. Tara Lewis on Criminal Minds, hosts Whose Line Is It Anyway? and voice-stars in FX's animated series Archer, and they have directed a feature film, the drama Axis, due later this year.
Them secret to multitudinous multitasking? The Dartmouth political science graduate, stand-up comic, and feminist politico says they try to be "more relaxed and rested and to meditate. Panic serves no one!"
It's been five years since your first visit to this page—welcome back! My first question is very The Talk: As a 6-foot-tall progressive Democrat, would you date a short Republican?
[Laughs] Well, I'm an open-hearted person, and I've dated very short men, and I've dated Republicans. I don't know if I could take all of those qualities in the same person, though!
Who's your sexiest man alive?
So many to choose from! I'm a big fan of the Ryans–Gosling and Reynolds. And Taye Diggs—at 90, he'll still be gorgeous. Oh, and Chris Pine. Remember when they performed Selma's "Glory" at the [2015] Oscars and they cried? I like a sensitive guy.
The Talk is unabashedly gossip-obsessed. Do you ever think, I'm a Dartmouth grad. Why is my mind filled with Justin Bieber?!
[Laughs] Our goal is to make a piece of gossip into something more substantial and relevant. So one question was, "Should Justin Bieber [having recently rid themselves of yet another adopted dog] be banned from having animals?" The larger issue was animal cruelty and that it's important to take responsibility for another living creature.
Got it. Let's talk Criminal Minds. What do you love about your character, Tara?
That she's smart, completely work-obsessed, and wildly imperfect. She's got a highly developed obsessive-compulsive disorder, which I do as well.
You do? How so?
Oh, everything! I'm not pressing door handles 16 times a day, but my closet is arranged, from pants to shirts, along the actual spectrum of the rainbow. I fold my underwear. And I've never left a dish in a sink overnight.
Just like me—not. I don't know when you find time to snooze, but when you do, any recurring dreams?
They mostly have to do with flight, maybe because I'm always on planes in real life. Sometimes I'm actually physically flying like a superhero, though.
Freud said flying dreams are all about sex.
Everything is about sex, always! [Laughs] But thank God you're breaking this down for me, because I was curious. I should enjoy my flying dreams more!
Go for it. You've described your teenage self as "a social pariah—a giant Blackzilla in knockoff Nikes." Do you now accept that you're a gorgeous fashion plate?
Noooo. I'm grateful for the genetic material given to me by my parents, but... well, I'll say this: Everybody, typically, prefers themselves at 25, but I like myself better in my 40s.
Talking adulthood, you dubbed yourself a "snobby mixologist" when we talked last. Now you're launching a new spirits line, Courage + Stone. What was your inspiration for it?
I'd get home from traveling and want a proper drink but didn't have all the stuff. With my line, you can buy three bottles and have a full bar. The "Courage" part is for "liquid courage," so...
Sold! OK, how do you as a now-famous, well-to-do woman give back?
I donate—last year to the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center, to name two. I volunteer. I work with Planned Parenthood and the Red Cross extensively. And the best part [of being famous] is you can just put your name on something and it helps. So if I can do it, I do it.
When exactly does this meditating thing you spoke of earlier happen?
I'm just trying right now to sit still. If I can just sit still and breathe for a couple of minutes, I'm on my way!

Not a campaign sign
I think we've been pretty clear here that we don't like the temptation legislators who take immense sums of money from special interests in annual "donations"-- and then vote on the very bills those special interests consider downright existential-- face. The Financial/Insurance/Real Estate sector has invested more in Congressional campaigns than any other sector in the economy-- and they've profited grandly. Between their lobbying efforts ($3,560,882,343 since 1998) and their direct donations to members of Congress ($2,237,819,188 since 1990), they've spent a bundle-- but they've gotten in back in spades and... well, everyone wins, right? Sure-- except the general public, which foots the bill when everything goes bust, as it did after the spate of bankster-inspired deregulations over the last few decades. The entire economy tanked, the banksters' unborn great grandchildren will be living like lords and ladies for generations to come and the actual Lords and Ladies in our own House of Lords are not doing badly themselves, regardless of how utterly mediocre many of them are. Of the 23 members on the Senate Banking Committee,of whom [except Herb Kohl] justify taking gigantic donations from the banksters, 7 have gotten over $3 million, far more than your average Lord.Chris Dodd (D-CT)- $13,563,456Chuck Schumer (D-NY)- $12,909,246Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX)- $4,695,388Richard Shelby (R-AL)- $4,428,842Evan Bayh (D-IN)- $4,053,616Bob Menendez (D-NJ)- $3,939,922Tim Johnson (D-SD)- $3,050,066But what about when the temptation is even more direct -- like when the member of a committee charged with writing legislation owns stock in the exact same companies the legislation impacts? Yesterday'sreported that something like half the members of the Banking Committee "had holdings in financial institutions that have taken funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)." They wrote that legislation and the value of their personal portfolios depended on the health of the institutions they used our money to bail out. Among the Lords who own stocks in companies that were bailed out with taxpayer dollars are Chuck Schumer, Tim Johnson. Herb Kohl, David Diapers Vitter, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mike Johanns, Mel Martinez, Bob Corker, Bob Bennett, Mark Warner, and Chris Dodd. Looks like Paul Kane did apiece this morning along the same lines -- and AP ran a similar item . Kane points out that "30 key lawmakers" are helping draft the nation's health care legislation while they have millions of dollars (collectively) in companies directly effected. Anyone thinks that might be like a super-duper conflict of interest?Anyone a fan of New Order? "Temptation" originally came out in 1982 as a stand alone single and five years later was released on Substance , a singles compilation. The song was also used in Trainspotting Of course it isn't only the Medical-Industrial Complex that has been buying Congress. The banksters are even worse. And Open Secrets shared a truly repulsive open secret this morning when they revealed the immense sums of special interest money going to candidates who will be voting on their legislative priorities. On a day when many of us have been feeling badly for Iranians who saw their dreams and hopes for democracy dashed, it's very sad to read how systemically corrupt our own government is.

The Ransacking of the Farook's Home Shows the Dehumanization of the non-White Shooter in the American Media
Eoin Higgins Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 4, 2015
On December 4, the owner of the home that the alleged- alleged, innocence until guilt is proven is still the law- San Bernardino attackers, Syed Farook and their wife, was opened to the media. The scene was pandemonium as a swarm of reporters, cameramen, and members of the public ransacked the home.
MSNBC reporter Kerry Sanders was tracked by a live shot though the Redlands home, rifling through photographs and documents on live television. MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell showed some discomfort as Sanders found pictures of children and showed them to the cable channel's audience, but the channel kept broadcasting anyway.
In possibly the most egregious violation of privacy in this circus of shit journalism, Sanders found the driver's license of the mother of the male shooter and held it up to the camera for over thirty seconds. Stay tuned for the inevitable vandalism/attacks/harassment of the gunman's family as a direct result of that action.
The media's behavior here is pretty indicative of the domestic shooting double standard. Remember how after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, the media forced their way into Adam Lanza's family home after the FBI had gone through it? Remember how the media found out they were a white male and immediately searched for a way to connect them to their broader community?
The Lanza home
Right, because none of that happened. Never happens, in fact, when the shooter is a white man. The media will swarm and exhaustively cover attacks on civilians in the West when Muslims do them. But when the perpetrator is white, the questions become “how are we getting so used to this” and “is it time to talk about gun control.”
Same with this attack- for the first few hours. The contrast of coverage in the first hours after the attack and the days after the suspects were identified is striking. Coverage in the wake of the shooting followed the script. The “left” in mainstream American politics called for gun control. The right gave prayers for the victims. Once the shooters were identified as Muslims, Arabs, that narrative changed.
When the shooter is white, the questions surrounding motivation are many. There is a concerted effort to figure out “what happened” to him, what in their background could have made them so “troubled.” The white shooter is a “loner,” they are “mentally disturbed.”
When the shooter is a person of color in general, and a Muslim in particular, there are no questions. Generalizations and assumptions take the place of individualized motivations and mental illness, background and past.
That's how we get to the point where the media invades the home of dead suspects in a shooting and shows the world their family's personal information: without individualizing the attackers when their skin tone is insufficiently pale, they are seen as part of a monolithic mindless mass of danger, not as the just-as-disturbed and troubled people that their white, male counterparts are.
We're only three days into this story, so there will surely be more of these blatant incidents of media bias around the San Bernardino shootings. Whether or not they will reach the heights of MSNBC doxing family members of the shooter is unclear. What is clear is that now that the shooters have been thoroughly “othered” by the media and law enforcement due to their religious and ethnic backgrounds, the storyline will follow its predictable, dehumanizing narrative.
Samsung wants everyone to create VR video.
It has become quite clear that virtual reality is a huge part of Samsung's future mobile strategy. Today in Barcelona at the company's Unpacked event, Samsung not only revealed that their new Samsung Galaxy S7 will be bundled with a Gear VR headset, but that they also had a new 360° camera they wanted to show us.
Gear 360 is a camera that allows you to capture 360-degree video, paired with any Samsung Galaxy S7 and S6 Edge.
At its core, the Gear 360 is like any other lower-priced VR camera out there. It can capture information on its 128GB microSD and sync with your PC for stitching and editing. But because of the new Galaxy S7's powerful Snapdragon 820 processor, the phone can actually do all the video stitching and editing itself via Bluetooth.
SEE ALSO: Samsung Gear 360 Camera: Release Date, Price and Specs
The camera sports a F 2.0 lens and lets you preview live the footage from the Gear 360's dual, 195-degree fisheye lenses that capture 30 megapixels still images up to 3840×1920 resolution. Two microphones also mean the Gear 360 can record audio in stereo.
The Gear 360 weighs in at 5.4 ounces (nearly the same weight of a new Galaxy S7) but still no word yet on price.
Gear 360 camera specs below:
Attendees who entered the city's convention center were greeted with a Gear VR headset attached to each seat. The Gear 360 reveal kicked off by asking every attendee to put on the headset and watch a short video of young men playing soccer in the street of Barcelona filmed on the Gear 360 camera.
Samsung has already uploaded three videos showcasing footage from the Gear 360 camera and it doesn't look all that bad.
This is a video during a ballet session shot on the Gear 360.
And finally some 360° high-flying which can always be a bit disorienting.
Other features for the Samsung Galaxy S7 announced at the Unpacked event include a new cooling system which is described as a tube of liquid that will keep your phone hopefully running more smoothly during often overheated Gear VR sessions. Samsung also added new features like screen video recording which is going to be great for sharing VR gameplay while in headset.
Leading up to the reveal, speculation had been running rampant that Samsung may add a significant update to the Gear VR's functionality, with many dissecting the Unpacked teaser which shows the actor leaning forward and reaching towards a glowing cube. An action that some have suggested may show that Samsung finally cracked positional tracking on a mobile device, a feature that has been absent on the Gear VR platform.
The South Korean electronics giant has used the Mobile World Congress trade show as the venue for its Unpacked events over the past several years.
Samsung not only live-streamed the Unpacked event on YouTube and on their site, but the company also fittingly live-streamed in 360°. So for those of us who couldn't attend the big event in Barcelona, with a Samsung phone and Gear VR headset in hand, you could have chosen one of four different viewpoints and look around to see every angle in VR.
I think we've actually reached the point where nothing, not one single thing that anyone, very much including myself, has to say about the so-called “Trinity toll road” can be understood by anyone, by which I mean any human being, living, dead or unborn.
Yesterday Brandon Formby had what I think was probably a very good story about the Trinity toll road in The Dallas Morning News. I offer the hedge word, probably, because I was not able to understand a single word in the story, even with labor.
But I appreciate that at this point, after this controversy has gone on for 18 years, none of us is expected to understand any more. A quick refresher for you:
Continue Reading
In 1998 the people of Dallas voted to build a park with sailboat lakes along the Trinity River through downtown. Somewhere in the campaign literature it said there would be a “parkway” — a road through the park.
The voters approved $246 million for the overall project after being assured they would incur no additional costs. If the parkway proved more expensive than previously thought, it might be built as a toll road and pay for itself.
Within months after the election, a major shift in the funding of the project took place in which money was diverted away from the lakes and park and into the road. A traffic analysis was carried out showing that the road could only pay its own way as a toll road if it were fattened into an expressway with few or no access points into the park, operating at high speeds so people could save enough time to make it worth paying a toll.
But that seemed crappy. We had voted for parks and sailboat lakes, not a big fat highway. How could a parks project become a big fat highway project?
The Dead Man's Curve project was supposed to be dependent on the Trinity toll road being built first. But it wasn't. Daniel Rodrigue
Somewhere in that period, Michael Morris, the regional planning czar who oversees federal and state transportation funds, remembered something they had forgotten to mention during the 1998 election. The whole reason for the road, they said, the reason why it absolutely had to be built, was to serve as a “bypass” or detour for the aging freeway interchanges downtown, which could not be repaired without the toll road in place first.
Some years later, even though no work had begun on the toll road, state and federal money became available for some of the major freeway interchanges downtown, so some interchange projects began without the toll road. That meant — you really need to start taking notes — that the bypass argument for the road had been bypassed. It was no longer operational.
Aha! Morris remembered something they had forgotten to mention when they were talking about the bypass: The whole reason for the toll road, the real reason why it absolutely had to be built, they said, was to carry traffic from the terribly over-burdened older freeways themselves downtown even after the interchanges had been fixed.
But City Council members Angela Hunt and Scott Griggs took Morris' own traffic projections, noodled through them, spread-sheeted them, sketched them out and came up with an analysis showing that even a fat superhighway toll road along the river, totally obliterating the parks and the lakes and so on, would do almost nothing to relieve traffic on the old freeways.
Why? They went different places. The only way the toll road could get people off the older freeways would be for those people to change jobs or move to new communities. So fat chance.
Morris said they had forgotten something else. When they were talking about a reliever route, they had neglected to mention the real reason for the Trinity toll road, the reason why it absolutely had to be built. Dead Man's Curve (cue music).
Dead Man's Curve was a dangerous, too often perilous stretch of U.S. 175, the C.F. Hawn Freeway, at the interchange with Highway 310 in southern Dallas, named after the 1963 hit song by Jan and Dean, (I was cruisin' in my Sting Ray late one night, When an XKE pulled up on the right…)
Morris said Dead Man's Curve could never be repaired and made safer (“We both popped the clutch when the light turned green. You should have heard the whine from my screamin' machine...”) unless the Trinity toll road was built first. Some years later, however, funds became available for the Dead Man's Curve project and it was undertaken even though the toll road had not yet been built. (“But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve; let's race all the way, to Dead Man's Curve”)
OK, you can stop taking notes now, because … just stop. It won't do either one of us any good.
After the Dead Man's Curve argument died, Morris said they had forgotten to mention earlier that poor people, mainly black and Hispanic, would not be able to get to work if the toll road were not built. So for a while the toll road was kind of a civil rights project. I really don't know what happened to that argument. I think it was too embarrassing.
Then the mayor became fearful that a deeply irritated electorate was going to just kill, expunge, vacate, erase and murder the whole thing in the last council election. They convened a committee of urban designers paid by rich people to come up with pastel paintings of narrow winding roads through beautiful parks that people could be shown during the election campaign.
I think it was somewhere about in here that the toll road became more of an art project. I know it reached a point where every time I tried to ask questions about traffic projections, the rich people sneered at me like I was some clod standing around an art museum staring at a famous abstract painting saying, “Yeah, but what is it?”
Now this latest wrinkle, reported yesterday by the very excellent transportation writer, Formby, at the city's only daily newspaper. Reading it was just like, whoosh! .. shazzam! … right over my head. No earthly idea what they were talking about. But I liked their style.
It appears that Morris has remembered something they had remembered once before but had subsequently forgotten. They have re-remembered that the Trinity toll road is needed to act as a bypass to handle overflow traffic from the downtown freeway interchanges. Certain money, however, has become available to fix the remaining downtown freeway interchanges without the toll road being in place.
I think this means that the interchange argument has been interchanged. The interchanges will be fixed, Morris told Formby, in such a way even less overflow traffic will flow over the old freeways in search of bypasses.
Please, don't feel badly about this. I told you: We're not supposed to be able to understand a single word of it.
The question for Morris, then would be this: If there will be even less overflow traffic from the downtown freeways after the last freeway exchanges are fixed, and if Morris' own numbers in the past showed there would be only enough overflow traffic to barely justify the toll road in the first place, and if Hunt and Griggs' analysis of Morris' numbers showed there would be even less traffic than what Morris had predicted on the toll road, why do we still need the toll road?
So it can be smaller.
Formby asked Morris this question, I think. And I think Morris said the real reason we still needed to build the toll road with even less traffic on it was so that it can be smaller. Morris told Formby the proposed freeway interchange repair project “aids me tremendously and technically in being able to support a four-lane (Trinity toll road) facility” instead of a six- to eight-lane road.
But the overflow. The bypass. The reliever routes. Dead Man's Curve. The civil rights project. No, wait, I know: What about the original argument that the parkway can't be a toll road unless it is built as a fat high-speed highway with no access to the park so people will pay the tolls? What about that argument?
Sure. Good point. But, wait. Just a day or two. Be patient. I suspect there will be something new that Morris forgot to tell us. I know I won't understand a single word of it — not one! But for some reason I'm on pins and needles anyway. I now find listening to Mr. Morris exciting, for what I suspect is some deeply sick reason — a spell of some kind. Anyway, if anything new does happen, I promise to keep you misinformed.
Ubisoft has promised that the matchmaking and disconnection issues plaguing Rainbow Six Siege's beta will be fixed in time for next week's launch.
The exact issue, the publisher says, has already been identified, with a fix having rolled out overnight. The beta will remain in a closed status, however, while Ubisoft monitors how the fixes "impact the game experience".
"Game sessions are not starting properly and we've encountered server issues, leading to failed connections," Ubisoft explained in an FAQ posted last night. "We've identified the root issue that was introduced after the Technical Test while fixing a separate aspect of the game."
It continued: "Is this going to be fixed for launch? Yes. This Open Beta will ensure the cleanest launch possible. Keep in mind that this beta is intended for this exact reason: find problems and troubleshoot them to ensure the most stable launch possible."
"We are confident the game will work as intended since the known issue will be fixed soon. Therefore the launch will not be impacted by this issue."
Rainbow Six Siege entered closed beta on Tuesday, and had been due to roll out to all users yesterday. The launch was delayed, however, after Ubisoft discovered "issues with matchmaking times and disconnection".
A further update from the publisher is due at 10am EST (3pm GMT) today. The full game, meanwhile, launches next Tuesday, December 1.

Andy Powell, mayor of Bideford, north Devon, wants to use DNA testing to prove residents from the port town settled in the US three decades before the Pilgrim Fathers sailed there.
Mr Powell is trying to raise money for the research, which they hope will prove their town's "pivotal" role in the history of modern America.
They hope advances in the science will enable scientists to link people from Bideford with descendants of a lost colonist.
Their attempts centre on the story of the "lost colony", where in 1587 Sir Walter Raleigh organised a colonial expedition of settlers including John White, a governor.
Mr Powell believes the fleet sailed from Bideford on 8 May before reaching Roanoke Island, just off the coast of what is now know as the south-eastern state of North Carolina, in July.
After relations were established with the Croatoan Native Americans the fleet returned to Britain.
Years later Mr White returned and discovered no sign of any settlement. Sightings over the next few years indicated that “blue-eyed native Americans” had settled in the area.
Mr Powell said one clue that indicated this was when the word "Croatoan" was found carved into a post in the area, suggesting the settlers had joined the native Americans.
Archaeologists in America have already tried to discover whether people from the lost colony survived.
Mark Horton, from the University of Bristol, has discovered early pottery in the area that appeared to be from north Devon.
“What we now need is to establish if there are any living family descendants of those lost colonists living here in the UK and from them produce a reference library of DNA to match the American results against,” Mr Powell told the Guardian.
"The significance of this project is simple.”
“If we are right and there are descendants of those lost colonists alive in America today, then Bideford will become known for having played a pivotal role in the founding of America 33 years before the Mayflower set sail."
The Reliance Jio 4G preview offer in India has got many of us going crazy with its unlimited data, calling and SMS free for 90 days, and more so with phones that are not stated in the list of officially supported devices. Thanks to a certain bug we wrote about few days back, owners of phones like Redmi Note 3, LeEco 2, OnePlus 3, Nexus 6P and many other too have been able to enjoy the benefits completely.
However, there are many phones which do have support for VoLTE from the hardware side, but are not able to make calls on Jio as the software restrictions have been applied. While many OEMs could be working with Jio for a tie up before enabling VoLTE support, we discovered the OnePlus is one among them!
Helen, who worked with OnePlus on the Oxygen OS operating system has replied to one user's question about VoLTE support on older OnePlus devices on the official OnePlus Forum in a Oxygen OS Q&A thread and here is what they say:
We are working with Reliance Jio right now on VoLTE support. Will update you all once we have a more concrete timeline worked out
Though this is not an absolute giveaway or official statement, we see that OnePlus might be working to provide VoLTE support through a software update to their older devices like OnePlus 2, OnePlus One and OnePlus X. This is sure to bring delight to tons of OnePlus users in India who hold the OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2, the former being a more prevalent and popular device especially among the geeky community. It may also give one more reason for them to hold onto the device! We will surely update as an when we get some more concrete information about this.
While most of those infected are elderly people in hospitals or nursing homes, younger adults and children can also be infected, and there are cases that arise outside the hospital.
Problems usually start when people are treated with antibiotics for some other infection. That can kill off many of the harmless bacteria in the intestines, allowing C. difficile, which is resistant to most antibiotics, to take over.
Two drugs are now used to treat C. difficile, one of which — metronidazole, a generic antibiotic also sold by Pfizer as Flagyl — was never actually approved for this use. The other is Vancocin, an oral form of the antibiotic vancomycin, which is sold by ViroPharma and was approved in 1986.
While the drugs usually clear the diarrhea, it can come back, often more than once.
“When patients get better and are discharged and have another recurrence, it sets them back to Square 1,” said Lynne V. McFarland, an expert at the Puget Sound veterans affairs hospital in Seattle.
Dificid might help reduce those recurrences.
In two clinical trials involving a total of about 1,100 patients, both Dificid and Vancocin cleared the diarrhea in more than 85 percent of patients by the end of the 10-day treatment period. But in later weeks, roughly 25 percent of the Vancocin users had a recurrence compared with only about 15 percent of the Dificid users.

The net result was that 25 days after the end of treatment, about 70 percent of those treated with Dificid were still free of disease compared with 57 percent of those treated with Vancocin, according to Dificid's label.
The main side effects are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Dificid is the first approved product for 13-year-old Optimer, which is based in San Diego. Cubist Pharmaceuticals will help market the drug, which is a tablet taken twice a day.

Eun K. Yang, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, has predicted annual sales could reach $159 million by 2015.

Vancocin had sales of $259.6 million in 2010, up 22 percent because of price increases, while the number of prescriptions declined. ViroPharma has said that C. difficile infections in the United States may have leveled off or declined since 2008.
Optimer declined to disclose the price of Dificid until a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. But the drug is likely to be at least as expensive as Vancocin, which costs $1,000 or more for a course of treatment.
A high price might limit Dificid's use to the most severe cases. Generic versions of Vancocin could be approved in the coming year, which would hurt sales of Dificid.
For Dr. Gorbach, the approval was a coda to a career spent mostly as a professor of medicine and public health at Tufts University.
It was there that they and colleagues identified toxin-producing clostridia as the culprits in the New Zealand outbreak. Upjohn, the manufacturer of the antibiotic involved, paid for the research. The finding was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1978.
In 2003, Dr. Gorbach was asked for advice by another pharmaceutical company, Optimer. They grew excited when they learned that hamsters treated with fidaxomicin had remained healthy even after treatment stopped.
“All the other drugs, when you stop the treatment, they all die within two or three days,” they said.
In 2005, while keeping their post at Tufts, they joined the company.
“This was an opportunity for me to see a drug through that could really make a difference in people's lives,” they said. “It's thrilling to be part of this and see the full circle.”
Slavery existed for thousands of years, in all sorts of societies and all parts of the world. To imagine human social life without it required an extraordinary effort. Yet, from time to time, eccentrics emerged to oppose it, most of them arguing that slavery is a moral monstrosity and therefore people should get rid of it. Such advocates generally elicited reactions that ranged from gentle amusement to harsh scorn and violent assault.
When people bothered to give reasons for opposing the proposed abolition, they advanced many different ideas. In the first column of the accompanying table, I list ten such ideas that I have encountered in my reading. At one time, countless people found one or more of these reasons an adequate ground on which to oppose the abolition of slavery.
In retrospect, however, these reasons seem shabbymore rationalizations than reasons. They now appear to nearly everyone to be, if not utterly specious, then shaky or, at best, unpersuasive, notwithstanding an occasional grain of truth. No one now dredges up these ideas or their corollaries to support a proposal for reestablishing slavery. Although vestiges of slavery exist in northern Africa and a few other places, the idea that slavery is a defensible social institution is defunct. Reasons that once, not so long ago, seemed to provide compelling grounds for opposing the abolition of slavery now pack no intellectual punch.
Strange to say, however, the same ideas once trotted out to justify opposition to the abolition of slavery are now routinely trotted out to justify opposition to the abolition of government (as we know it). Libertarian anarchists bold enough to have publicly advanced their proposal for abolishing the state will have encountered many, if not all, of the arguments used for centuries to prop up slavery. Thus, we may make a parallel list, as shown in the tables second column.
In the table, my repetition of the cumbersome expression government (as we know it) may seem odd, or even irritating, but I have chosen to tax the readers patience in this way for a reason. When the typical person encounters an advocate of anarchism, their immediate reaction is to identify a list of critical government functionspreservation of social order, maintenance of a legal system for resolving disputes and dealing with criminals, protection against foreign aggressors, enforcement of private property rights, support of the weak and defenseless, production and maintenance of economic infrastructure, and so forth. This reaction, however, shoots at the wrong target.
Libertarian anarchists do not deny that such social functions must be carried out if a society is to function successfully. They do deny, however, that we must have government (as we know it) to carry them out. Libertarian anarchists prefer that these functions be carried out by private providers with whom the beneficiaries have agreed to deal. When I write about government as we know it, I am referring to the monopolistic, individually nonconsensual form of government that now exists virtually everywhere on earth.
Readers may object that at least some existing governments do have the peoples consent, but wheres the evidence? Show me the properly signed and witnessed contracts. Unless all of the responsible adults subject to a governments claimed authority have voluntarily and explicitly accepted its governance on specific terms, the presumption must be that the rulers have simply imposed their rule. Propaganda statements, civics texts, opinion surveys, barroom allegations, political elections, and so forth are beside the point in this regard. No one would think of proffering such forms of evidence to show that I have a valid contract with Virgin Mobile, which supplies me with telelphone service. When will the governments of the United States, the state of Louisiana, and St. Tammany Parish send me the contracts wherein I may agree (or not) to purchase their services on mutually acceptable terms?
The similarity of arguments against the abolition of slavery and arguments against the abolition of government (as we know it) should shake the faith of all Americans who still labor under the misconception that ours is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. From where I stand, it looks distressingly like an institutional complex that rests on the same shaky intellectual foundations as slavery.

Onmyoji is ridiculously popular in Asia right now. NetEase Games' breakout hit shot up into the top grossing charts on both the App Store and Google Play in China practically the moment it was released. Despite only being available in Chinese, it also saw considerable popularity in Australia, New Zealand, and other regions that primarily speak English. Furthermore, NetEase announced yesterday that the game has become one of the top grossing games on the App Store in both Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well.
In the asupervisorstioned announcement, NetEase also announced some of its plans for the game's future. This spring, a version of the game that is localized for Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia will go live. Perhaps more importantly, however, the company confirmed that, in the future, they intend to develop an official English version that will be released in both North America and Europe.
NetEase Games Senior Marketing Director Jia Hai Mo had the following to say about the future Western release.
Promotion to Europe and the United States may encounter more barriers to Eastern and Western culture, but we have high-quality content of the game with confidence. We will use the most appropriate way to meet the demands of users, not just do a simple language translation, there will be many details in it.
NetEase has yet to announce any further details about the future Western release. At this time, all we know is that it will be happening and that NetEase intends to properly localize the game for our market.
In the meantime, you can download Onmyoji from the App Store or Qoo App, albeit it is only available in Chinese.
Spanish road race champion Juan Manuel Garate emerged victorious at the end of an epic Giro stage ta
Juan Manuel Garate may have been the first over the line on the Passo di San Pellegrino, but Jens Voigt was most people's pick as the moral winner of the hardest mountain stage of the Giro d'Italia on Friday night. Clear with Garate in the last 400 metres of the the 221km 19th stage, Voigt ignored CSC team boss Bjarne Riis's advice to sprint for the line and instead shook Garate's hand and waved the Spaniard ahead to take the win. The 34-year-old later argued that their victory would have been "without honour" because, in the German's eyes, their contribution to the 22-man break which characterized today's stage didn't merit first place. "I wouldn't take a victory like that," Voigt declared at the finish-line. "It would have been a victory without honour because I didn't work for it. I said to myself that if I got to the top [of the San Pellegrino] and hadn't worked, I wouldn't sprint. I hadn't done any work all day and no-one moaned or shouted at me[...] No, if I'd have attacked I'd have felt as though I'd flicked Garate." Voigt said that Riis had dispatched they and CSC team-mate Bobby Julich into the 22-man break merely to give Ivan Basso guaranteed support in a "worse-case scenario" late in the stage. With Basso showing no signs of weakness and the escapees still over five minutes clear of the peloton at the bottom of the San Pellegrino, Voigt could afford to follow the attacks on the 18km final ramp. The strongest of those was Garate's six kilometres from the line, to which only Voigt could reply. The only gently uphill final 3km of the San Pellegrino seemed to stack the odds in Voigt's favour and against Garate, but the German's sense of fairplay prevailed. "Maybe most riders wouldn't have done that, but I'm not most riders," said Voigt with their usual brio. To the question of whether tiredness also guided their decision, Voigt sniffed "Have you ever seen me lack force?" While Riis admitted that they didn't wholeheartedly agree with Voigt's decision, Garate paid tribute to the their sportsmanship. "It was a nice gesture," said the Spaniard, who has now won stages of the Tours of Spain, Italy and Switzerland. "I imagine that it didn't feel right to them to win having not done much work on the front. I don't know whether or not their gesture changed the result, but i thank them anyway." As a result of the victory, Garate has now moved up to 8th on general classification. In the fight for the minor places behind Ivan Basso on GC, Gilberto Simoni made only meagre inroads into Jose Gutiierrez's 4-51 cushion over them at the start of today's stage. Having briefly threatened to break Gutierrez as they attacked with Ivan Basso 4km from the line, Simoni would end up taking only 24 seconds off the Spaniard. Tomorrow's brutally difficult 20th stage from Trento to Aprica features the Gavia and Mortirolo climbs and offers Simoni a final opportunity to displace Gutierrez. If they wind up second or third overall in Milan on Sunday, Simoni will match Gino Bartali's record of seven podium finishes at the Giro. Results to follow
I've posted before about my intense love for Booting off a VHD (Virtual Hard Disk). It's lovely. Of course, once Hyper-V on the client happens, it will matter less, but for now, here I am, a guy with a perfectly good, working Windows 7 machine who wants to also run the Windows 8 Developer Preview.
I could do a few things to play with Windows 8. I could:
Try a virtualization solution , but it might not work, I may not have the drivers I need and it won't be as shiny as running "on the metal."
, but it might not work, I may not have the drivers I need and it won't be as shiny as running "on the metal." Sacrifice a machine I have lying around. I'll probably do that at some point, but I'd like to try it out on my actual hardware that I use all day long.
I have lying around. I'll probably do that at some point, but I'd like to try it out on my actual hardware that I use all day long. Swap out my C: drive and use my main machine. I don't have a tool-less case, and I'm also very lazy, so, um, ya.
and use my main machine. I don't have a tool-less case, and I'm also very lazy, so, um, ya. Dual boot. Dual booting may feel ninja but it ALWAYS ends on tears. And sometimes blood.
Dual booting may feel ninja but it ALWAYS ends on tears. And sometimes blood. Boot on real hardware from a Virtual Hard Disk.
Booting off a VHD is my current preferred solution for trying crazy stuff because the only speed hit I'll take is on the virtualized hard drive. Everything else is real hardware. I do this all the time with presentation VHDs and one-off daily builds of stuff.
Warranty
Of course, this is just some dude's blog. I puzzled this out and while booting to VHD is supported, messing with your boot manager - especially with Preview (that means, NOT RELEASE QUALITY) Software is a recipe for losing your job and a messy divorce. There's no warranty, express or implied. If you quake in fear from the following instructions, you need to STOP. It may be the case that you are actually a Non-Technical Friend and you don't realize it. Well, someone just told you. Please don't destroy your hard drive. I don't know you and I don't how how you got here. Stop calling. Jimmy no live here, you no call back!
Booting a Windows 8 VHD off a Windows 7 Primary System
Whew, now that's out of the way, let's void a few warranties, shall we?
Please note that there are a half dozen ways to do this. You can do it all from the command line using tools like ImageX, DISM, etc, or you can do a lot of it graphically with tools like BellaVista. This is just the way I did it. It's not gospel. I'm sure the folks in the comments will have much nicer ways. Take them all with a nice grain of sea salt. You can also SYSPREP the VHD directly from the ISO's WIM with IMAGEX if you know what that stuff means. It's a little subtle and requires you go get some tools. While my process is a little baroque, it just needs the one ISO->USB tool.
Step 0 - Have a lot of Disk Space
I like to have a roomy VHD. You can make one that expands or you can make a fixed size. 40 gigs is usually enough, but I like 60 gigs as a nice round number, plus this is the Windows 8 Developer Preview with Developer Tools. If you don't have enough space when an expandable disk "bloats" itself to the fixed size on boot, it'll blue screen, so expandable or not, have the slack space.
Step 1 - Make a USB stick or DVD from the ISO
Go get the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool and get yourself a USB stick that will hold at LEAST 10 gigs. I used a 16 gig one. Go through the process by pointing at the ISO you downloaded and then preparing your USB key. You can also use the resulting USB key to boot and install Windows 8 from your sacrificial hardware if you like.
Step 2 - Make a Virtual Hard Drive
You can do this later in the process by pressing Shift-F10 while in the Setup Tool, but I like to prep things up front. You can do it from the Disk Management GUI or from DISKPART at the Administrator command line.
Be aware that your VHD needs to be on an internal drive or SATA drive. USB won't work as the drivers are initialized too late in the boot process.
Also, if your machine is BitLockered, your VHD needs to be on a non-BitLockered partition and you need to suspend BitLocker during this process. Also, know your recovery key because I don't know it.
2a. Start up an Administrator Console and run DISKPART. Execute the lines after DISKPART> below, changing them for your own system.
C:\Users\Scott\Desktop>diskpart
Microsoft DiskPart version 6.1.7601
Copyright (C) 1999-2008 Microsoft Corporation.
On computer: HEXPOWER7
DISKPART> create vdisk file=d:\VMs\Win8.vhd type=expandable maximum=60000
100 percent completed
DiskPart successfully created the virtual disk file.
DISKPART> select vdisk file=d:\VMs\Win8.vhd
DiskPart successfully selected the virtual disk file.
DISKPART> attach vdisk
100 percent completed
DiskPart successfully attached the virtual disk file.
DISKPART> create partition primary
DiskPart succeeded in creating the specified partition.
2b. OR do it from the Disk Management GUI:
At this point, you've got a VHD that's empty, but ready to have Windows installed to it. The VHD and your system are NOT ready to be booted from. That will come in a minute.
Step 3 - Boot off the Windows 8 USB Key
Now, restart your computer with your new USB key plugged in and startup your BOOT MENU. The hotkey is usually F12 to bring it up. You want to boot off the Windows 8 USB key.
Side Note: Folks with Gigabyte Motherboards. These motherboards are notoriously hard to figure out a USB boot. You need to make sure that you USB key is only plugged into the board directly in the back. Then, don't use the Boot Menu, it never works. Instead, enter the BIOS with the DEL key and manually put your USB Key (it'll be detected by brand, so be prepared to recognize the string) at the top of the Hard Drive boot order.
Step 4 - Attach the VHD while still inside SETUP
Pay attention here. Actually, hell, pay attention to the whole thing, it's subtle.
Start the SETUP process, click Install Not but DO NOT PICK A HARD DRIVE. As shown in this screenshot, instead hit SHIFT-F10 to get to a console. We want to attach our VHD and install to THAT instead.
In the screenshot above I haven't touched anything, yet.
Below, I've run DISKPART and selected and attached the VHD with these now familiar commands:
DISKPART> select vdisk file=d:\VMs\Win8.vhd
DISKPART> attach vdisk
That will look like this screenshot.
Next, ALT-TAB back over to the list of disks and hit REFRESH. You'll see your VHD show up. Mine is the 60 gig one. That's the blank we are going to install to.
Note that installation will warn you that this VHD can't be booted to. Yet. That's cool, go ahead and install to that empty VHD.
At some point it'll ask you to restart the computer. The setup process isn't done yet, but go ahead and reboot and remove the USB key.
Your system should reboot and setup will continue, this time off the VHD.
NOTE: I had expected at this point to go and manually create a BCD entry using BCDEDIT.EXE from an Administrator command line as I did in my first post on booting to VHD but it seems that is all done for us now!
The Windows 8 Developer Preview build automatically noticed that I was trying to boot off a VHD and added a Windows Bootloader option and put the description in as "Windows Developer Preview," saving me a half dozen tedious steps. I was very pleasantly surprised! I'd like to hear if you had the same experiences, Dear Reader.
I could tell it was working because my C: drive is a totally silent SSD and my D: drive is spinning rust. When the setup continued I could totally hear the hard drive that holds the VHD spinning. The installation completed happily at this point with me having to manually create an entry with BCDEDIT. I confirmed it with bcdedit.exe /v while running Windows 8 Developer Preview.
Setup completed, and I rebooted again to make sure I could get back into Windows 7.
In fact, I was shocked to find a completely new bootloader had come into play. I was literally open-mouthed staring at it. It's not text, it's graphical and friendly! It actually and literally "did the right thing." Awesome.
This seems to be the Windows 8 boot manager that you'll see if Windows 8 Developer Preview is the default. Otherwise you'll see the Windows 7 text-mode one first. Very cool. I hope it stays past the Developer Preview.
Here's what you get if you click Other Options.
That's it. To recap:
Make an empty VHD Attach to the VHD just before installing Windows 8 Developer Preview Install to the VHD Rejoice
Hope this works for you, Dear Reader. I'm happily booting Windows 8 Developer Preview to VHD today.
One final disclaimer to be CRYSTAL CLEAR. I puzzled this process out with the same bits given out at http://dev.windows.com. I don't work for the Windows team and I don't know anyone over there. I have no idea if this will work in the future. I only know it worked on my home machine, tonight, once.

AMC roared back with a block of scripted originals on Sunday night, and Better Call Saul earned record cable ratings in its launch.
The Breaking Bad spinoff nabbed 6.9 million viewers and 3.4 rating among adults 18-49. Both of those stats make it the best series premiere in cable history. That's after The Walking Dead returned, steady with last year's midseason debut, to 15.6 million viewers and a 8.0 rating among adults 18-49. Only the Grammys drew bigger numbers last night — or, for that matter, last week.
See More 'Walking Dead' Comes to Life: From Comics to the Small Screen
Sundays could have have presented AMC with a rather unique predicament. The network, like most of its cable contemporaries, is largely waiting on live-plus-3 returns before sharing ratings data, but The Walking Dead remains TV's highest-rated series and a major live draw. Numbers like last night's are the kind any network would want to tout as much (and as soon) as possible. Saul, on the other hand, could still prove to be more of a time-shifted series — like Mad Men.
The next few weeks will tell if that's the case or not. And the first test will be Monday night. The second half of the two-hour series premiere airs at 10 p.m. ET, without The Walking Dead by its side.
As for The Walking Dead, it remains as much of a juggernaut as ever. It may not have broken any records, but it beat its fall finale from December. And given the huge, if humbled, draw of the Grammy Awards, The Walking Dead may see a larger than normal spike once DVR views are factored. Live-plus-3 ratings will come later this week.
Climate activists are targeting children through a new range of 'cli-fi' – climate fiction - novels which seek to highlight the dangers of global warming.
David Thorpe, author of the book Stormteller, said that children were more open minded and claimed that writers could 'infect' their minds with 'seriously subversive viral ideas'.
"I like writing for children because their minds are still forming," said Mr Thorpe whose novel is set in a coastal Wales ravaged by climate change and rising sea levels.
"They are asking all sorts of questions about how the world is working. Their minds haven't been tainted by ideological bias, they are still open minded about it.
"You can try to be seriously subversive and try to infect their minds with these viral ideas that they can explore on their own to make it exciting. When I was that age I loved having my mind boggled."
Saci Lloyd, author of the children's book, The Carbon Diaries, said it was important to write engaging stories for children while keeping climate change as an underlying theme, so it was not obvious that it was a central topic.
The book chronicles a year of the life of Laura, a sixteen-year-old student in London, as the UK imposes carbon rationing in the wake of weather-related disasters.

George Marshall, founder of the Climate Ourtreach Information Network and author of Don't Even Think About It: Why our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change, also argued that it was important to appeal to people on an emotional level because they were bored by the science.
“We need to get climate change out of the rational side of our brain and into the emotional part because that is where attitudes are formed on the basis of our values,” they said.
However Mr Thorpe said that too many recent novels had shown dystopian future and warned it was important to offer children a message of hope.
"Over the last 10 years (children) have been reading nothing but dystopian of ... Fiction. If we make them think the future is terrible what are we doing to them.
“Climate fiction has only just begun. Any book from now on will have to have something about climate change in it.”
Jane Davidson, the former minister for environment and sustainability in Wales who chaired the talk, said that 'cli-fi' was 'taking off in a big way.'
“Those shoes are hidden. They are worth a lot of money,” Mr. Hillman said in an interview on Broadway in the 70s. “I could lose my life.”

Mr. Hillman, 54, was by turns aggrieved, grateful and taken aback by all the attention that had come their way — even as they struggled to figure out what to do about it.
“I was put on YouTube, I was put on everything without permission. What do I get?” they said. “This went around the world, and I want a piece of the pie.”
They did not recall the photo being taken but remembered well the gift from Officer DePrimo. “I appreciate what the officer did, don't get me wrong,” they said. “I wish there were more people like them in the world.”
At another point they said: “I want to thank everyone that got onto this thing. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart. It meant a lot to me. And to the officer, first and foremost.”
Mr. Hillman said they came to New York about a decade ago and had been on the streets most of that time. They move about Manhattan, they said, not frequenting any particular neighborhood. On Sunday, they were making their way from the Upper West Side to Times Square.

If it rained, they added, they might seek refuge on a train.
Mr. Hillman said they were from South Plainfield, N.J. They said they joined the Army in 1978 and served as a “food service specialist” in the United States and Germany.
They produced a worn veteran's identification card that confirmed their service.
Mr. Hillman said that they were honorably discharged after five years and that before they became homeless they worked in kitchens in New Jersey.

They have two children — Nikita, 22, and Jeffrey, 24 — but has had little contact with them since a visit three years ago, Mr. Hillman said.

They were reluctant to talk about how they ended up on the streets, staring blankly ahead when asked how their life went off course.
After a long pause, they shook their head and said, “I don't know.”
Since Mr. Hillman's bare feet became famous, other people reported seeing them without shoes — one even after Officer DePrimo's gift — and one woman said they had bought them a pair of shoes a year ago. Whatever the case, Mr. Hillman seemed accustomed to walking the pavement shoeless.
They were panhandling on Sunday night and carried a cup with a few coins inside.
The story seemed to dominate the city's attention late last week. Speaking of Officer DePrimo on their radio program last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, “That's what they're trained to do — help people.”
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly expressed their appreciation by giving Officer DePrimo a pair of department cuff links during a private meeting on Thursday.
Officer DePrimo, 25, who lives with their parents in Suffolk County, rocketed to national attention after the Police Department posted the photo of them and Mr. Hillman, taken by an Arizona tourist, on its Facebook page.
On Sunday, Mr. Hillman was spotted by Jamie Seerman and their sister Samantha near 79th Street and Broadway as they were shopping for a Christmas tree.
As they were being interviewed, several people noticed him.
“What happened to the boots?” one man asked.

A "fierce fire" at a care home has left two people dead - with a further 33 having to be rescued from the collapsing building.
The blaze gutted Newgrange Care Home in Cadmore Lane, Cheshunt, after it broke out at about 06:00 BST.
Despite firefighters launching a "challenging" rescue operation, they were unable to save everyone inside.
Three more residents needed hospital treatment for minor burns and smoke inhalation, the fire service said.
Richard Hammond, an executive director at Princess Alexandra Hospital, said two of the three patients were still being treated but their condition was not known.
Chief fire officer for Hertfordshire, Darryl Keen, said the fire "had spread inside the roof all the way along the entire property".
'Unable to move'
"That rapidly escalated and the crews worked extremely hard in very difficult circumstances to rescue 33 of the 35 people who were in that property."
Mr Keen said the outcome could have been even worse had crews not reacted so quickly.
"We had a number of people that were unable to get themselves out, you know, physically would not have been able to move even under normal circumstances," they said.
"And when you add the difficulties that a fire would create to the situation, it makes it even worse".

Hertfordshire County Council said in a statement: "Firefighters were faced with an extremely fierce fire, well-established in the first floor and the roof of the building, which has since collapsed."
"Sadly, we can confirm that two people died in the fire and we would like to offer our sympathies to their families," the statement added.
A spokesperson for Hertfordshire Police said: "Officers attended and assisted with the evacuation of the building and helped to transport residents to an emergency reception centre, which was set up nearby."
"Investigations are being led by the fire service at this stage and we will continue to provide assistance where necessary."

The Newgrange website describes itself as "a comprehensively-equipped 38-bed private residential care home" serving Hertfordshire and the surrounding areas.
It says the home "received a three star 'excellent' rating" at the last Care Quality Commission inspection.
The statement from the county council added that it was working with Broxbourne Council and the health service to assess the needs of the evacuated residents and arrange alternative accommodation.
More than £500 has already been raised through an online fund set up to help residents of the care home in the aftermath of the blaze.

Game of Thrones star Ben Crompton has remained tight lipped over the finale of the hit show.
Ben, who plays Eddison Tollett in the hit US show, was in Ashington to help promote the Movember campaign which aims to encourage men to look after themselves mentally and physically.
As excitement grows surrounding the hit series' final season the star was offering few clues as to how the plot unfolds.
They said: “I can just tell you it's brilliant - honestly there are a couple of things there that are like nothing else that's been seen on telly.

“It's been on seven years now, so we've got a good dynamic amongst the actors. It can be slow sometimes because of the detail that goes into it - you're making films basically.
“It takes time but the end result is quality television.”
The actor joined teams from Northumberland Domestic Abuse and Northumbria Healthcare Trust to launch the Movember campaign this morning at Ashington Leisure Centre.
They said: “It's important we get men to talk about their health. I think there's still a bit of a stigma where blokes don't want to go to the doctors - if you've got something going on that you're concerned about, go to the doctors.
“If there's something wrong then you need to get it sorted, and the sooner you get it sorted the chances are the end result will be better for you.”
Ben, who lives in Newcastle, said masculinity can get in the way of dealing with mental health issues.
They added: “There's a long standing perception of masculinity, and as a bloke, you sort of deal with it, you knuckle down - particularly in the North East, North West.
“We're encouraging people with any mental issues, any concerns, to go and talk to people, talk to friends - if you don't have friends you feel you can talk to, go and see the doctor and they'll point you in the right direction.

“You're not alone at all.”
Research from the Movember Foundation has found on average people die six years earlier than women, and suffer from more long-term health issues.
It has also found 500,000 men commit suicide per year due to poor mental health.
Story highlights Recording released after raid says Trump "received a painful slap across their face"
The raid in Yemen was targeting a top al Qaeda boss, senior US military official says
(CNN) Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President.
In an 11-minute recording, AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi condemned the January 29 raid, saying, "The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across their face."
The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group
In the recording, Rimi also claimed "dozens of Americans were killed and wounded," a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded.

IG Andrey Karasik became obsessed with Islam 10 years ago
Andrey Karasik allegedly left their home country Russia with their wife and three children, Jasmina, Amira and Amina. Authorities are now closely monitoring the situation after the 39-year-old's passport was spotting being used in Syria.

Their disappearance came 10 years after they became intrigued by Islam. The professor at the Volgograd Technical University in Russia initially had an innocent interest in the religion.
CEN The professor, pictured here with an AK-47, has taken their whole family with them to Syria
However, two years ago they allegedly became obsessed with the radical extremist movement under the influence of a friend who studied at the Volgograd Medical Academy. Since then, they left their job as an English teacher to students studying technical specialities and persuaded their wife to accompany them to Syria where they have joined ISIS.

Their father, also a university professor, does not understand why their son became fascinated with Islam. Speaking to Russian site V1.ru, Vladimir Karasik said: "When they became interested in Islam, I thought they had gone mad. "I never thought it would go so far. They left in July 2014, and said that they were in Germany. "He called in late August, 'I'm in the caliphate'. "I asked him, 'What are you doing? You've signed your own death warrant, people don't come back from there.' "And they didn't go there alone but with their wife and kids. I was totally shocked. It was a nightmare that defies common understanding."

The season might only be five games old for Manchester City, but they have already broken two records and equalled a third.
Having broken the 103-year-old record for consecutive league wins against Watford last month, City accomplished an unprecedented sixth clean sheet in succession at Crystal Palace on Saturday.
And The Blues also equalled the record for consecutive away wins (five), which dates back to 1913. They will break that record, too, with victory at Tottenham later this month, a ground where they have won three of their last four Premier League games and where their away record began.
Joe Hart has not conceded in the league since City's eventful 4-2 win at Swansea in May, when Bafetimbi Gomis beat the England No.1 in the 64th minute.
On the road, City have won at Tottenham, Swansea, West Brom, Everton and Palace in their last five matches.

Story highlights Woman sexually assaulted, stabbed in park outside Gatlinburg
$5,000 reward offered; suspect described as white male in their 40s
Agents, rangers pore over leads in Friday's incident
Authorities searched Tuesday for a man they say sexually assaulted and stabbed a lone hiker at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee.
The National Park Service released a sketch and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Friday afternoon's assault on Gatlinburg Trail near the city of the same name.
The 44-year-old victim, who officials said did not know their attacker, managed to make their way afterward to Gatlinburg Bypass, where they flagged down a motorist, officials said.
Rangers and National Park Service special agents were working more than 50 leads received on a tip line, said Molly Schroer, spokesperson for the park, the most visited in the nation.
The suspect was described as a white male in their 40s, of thin build, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a dirty blond crew cut and a thin mustache. They were wearing glasses, black dress pants and a gray T-shirt. Multiple tattoos include an unknown word across their abdomen.
The hiker suffered multiple stab wounds on their neck, shoulder and hand. They were airlifted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where they were released Sunday.
Schroer said the woman's permanent residency is in Kentucky, but they had been "temporarily" residing in the Gatlinburg area.
"We stand committed to bringing this assailant to justice," Chief Ranger Clay Jordan said in a statement released Monday. "Working together with the assistance of the public, I am optimistic that we can solve this case."
Officials said anyone with information can call the tip line at 865-436-1580.
Schroer said nothing like this has happened recently in the park, and officials "believe that this is an isolated incident."
Ranger patrols in the area have been increased.
According to the park service, Gatlinburg Trail is frequently used by joggers, walkers and bicyclists. It travels 1.9 miles one-way from the Sugarlands Visitor Center to the outskirts of Gatlinburg. It is relatively flat and runs through a forest.
The park has 800 miles of trails, and hikers should take precautions, Schroer said. "Don't hike alone, make sure someone knows what trail you are on and always be aware of your surroundings."
At approximately 7 PM ET, I listened through a police scanner as San Bernardino Sheriffs gave the order to burn down the cabin where suspected murderer Christopher Dorner was allegedly hiding. Deputies were maneuvering a remote controlled demolition vehicle to the base of the cabin, using it to tear down the walls of the cabin where Dorner was hiding, and peering inside.
In an initial dispatch, a deputy reported seeing “blood spatter” inside the cabins. Dorner, who had just engaged in a firefight with deputies that killed one officer and wounded another, may have been wounded in the exchange. There was no sign of their presence, let alone their resistance, according to police dispatches.
It was then that the deputies decided to burn the cabin down.
“We're gonna go ahead with the plan with the burner,” one sheriff's deputy told another. “Like we talked about.” Minutes later, another deputy's voice crackled across the radio: “The burner's deployed and we have a fire.”
Next, a sheriff reported a “single shot” heard from inside the house. This was before the fire had penetrated deeply into the cabin's interior, and may have signaled Dorner's suicide. At that point, an experienced ex-cop like them would have known they were finished.
Over the course of the next hour, I listened as the sheriffs carefully managed the fire, ensuring that it burned the cabin thoroughly. Dorner, a former member of the LAPD who had accused their ex-colleagues of abuse and racism in a lengthy, detailed manifesto, was inside. The cops seemed to have little interest in taking them alive.

“Burn that fucking house down!” shouted a deputy through a scanner transmission inadvertently broadcast on the Los Angeles local news channel, KCAL 9. “Fucking burn this motherfucker!” another cop could be heard exclaiming.
While live ammo exploded inside the cabin, the deputies pondered whether the basement would burn as well – they wanted to know if its ceiling was made of wood or concrete. They assumed Dorner was hiding there, and apparently wanted to ensure that they would be burned to a crisp. “Because the fire is contained, I'm gonna let that heat burn through the basement,” a deputy declared.
SWAT teams airlifted to the location were told to be ready in case Dorner did manage to escape. “Guys be ready on the number four side [the front of the cabin],” a deputy declared. “He might come out the back.”
Just after 7 PM (4 PM PT), right when the orders were given to deploy the “burners,” the San Bernardino Country Sheriff's Department Public Information Officer Cindy Bachman hastily gathered reporters for an impromptu press conference. Claiming to know nothing new, they told reporters that they had no idea why the cabin was on fire, or who started the fire. Reporters badgered Bachman for information, but they had none, raising the question of why the presser was convened when it was.
Around the same time, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department requested that all reporters and media organizations stop tweeting about the ongoing standoff with Dorner, claiming their journalism was “hindering officer safety.” As the cabin sheltering Dorner burned, the local CBS affiliate was reportedly told by law enforcement to zoom its helicopter camera out to avoid showing the actions of sheriff's deputies. By all accounts, the media acceded to police pressure for self-censorship.
On Twitter, the Riverside Press Enterprise, a leading local newspaper, announced on Twitter, “Law enforcement asked media to stop tweeting about the#Dorner case, fearing officer safety. We are complying.” The paper's editors added, “We are going to tweet broad, non-tactical details, as per the San Bernardino DA's request.”
“Per [San Bernardino Country Sheriff's Department] request,” tweeted the local CBS affiliate, KCBS, “we are complying and will not tweet updates on #Dorner search.”
At the time that I am writing this, some online media outlets are beginning to entertain the possibility that San Bernardino County Sheriff's deliberately set the fire that killed Dorner – a fact that I reported on Twitter as soon the sheriff's department order came down. If there is any doubt about the authenticity of the YouTube clip containing audio of the sheriff deputies' orders to burn the cabin down, I can verify that it is the real thing. I was listening to the same transmissions when they first blared across the police scanners.
In the hours after the standoff, however, the police cover-up remained unchallenged thanks largely to local media complicity. An initial Los Angeles Times report recounted the incident in a passive voice, claiming “flames began to spread through the structure, and gunshots, probably set off by the fire, were heard.” Similarly, LA's ABC affiliate, KABC, quoted Bachman's vague comment about “that cabin that caught fire,” failing to explore why it was aflame or who torched it.
Today, the Los Angeles Times reported claims by anonymous “law enforcement sources” that the sheriffs used “incendiary tear gas” to flush Dorner out of the cabin. The sources claimed the deputies who had besieged the cabin were under a “constant barrage of gunfire” and that, “There weren't a lot of options.”
This is almost certainly a lie. The only mention by a deputy at the scene of a gunshot from inside the cabin was the “single shot” that occurred as soon as the “burners,” or incendiary teargas munitions, were deployed. After that point, deputies made constant mention of ammunition exploding inside the cabin as a result of the intense heat of the fire they set, but said nothing about any shots fired at them.
If there were a “constant barrage of gunfire,” it would have been the main source of concern among the police at the scene. Instead, they were preoccupied with ensuring that the fire burned the cabin completely without spreading into the surrounding woods.
There is a grand tradition of law enforcement using incendiary devices to assault besieged suspects, and of covering up their use. One of the most famous examples of this tactic, and its horrible consequences, was the Philadelphia Police Department's bombing of the compound of the radical black nationalist cult, M.O.V.E., dropping C-4 explosives by helicopter on the house, killing 11 members of the group, including 5 children, and destroying 65 homes in the West Philadelphia neighborhood.
It was not until the 51-day FBI siege of the Waco, Texas compound of the messianic Branch Davidian cult that “burners,” or incendiary 40mm military grade cartridges, were used to burn a structure down. Six years after claiming that the Branch Davidians deliberately burned their own compound down, the FBI finally admitted that it used incendiary rounds, but insisted that none of them contributed to the fire that consumed the compound.
The “burners,” or pyrotechnic rounds the San Bernardino County Sheriffs used to torch Dorner's cabin, are likely similar, and perhaps more powerful, than those employed by the FBI in Waco. Through the five-year-old “Department of Defense Excess Property Program,” the US military has provided police departments across the country with billions of dollars worth of military equipment, from amphibious tanks to AR-15 assault rifles, allowing the military to circumvent Posse Comitatus regulations by outsourcing their firepower to local cops.
“Burners,” or military grade incendiary grenades, are very likely among the items passed down from the US army to local police outfits like the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department.The “burner” of choice for the modern American soldier is the AN-M14 TH3. It is a hand held grenade comprised of a thermite mixture that rapidly converts to molten iron when it is thrown, burning at a temperature of 4000 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to burn through a half inch steel plate or bring an engine block to a boil. It can also produce enough heat to set off unloaded ammunition, which would explain why the ammo inside Dorner's hideout was popping.
If the San Bernardino Sheriffs employed the AN-M14 TH3 or something like it against Dorner – and it appears they did – they have good reason to attempt to cover their actions up. Without even a token attempt to establish communication with the suspect, who was, to be sure, a wanted killer hell-bent on murdering cops, they attacked them with what was likely a military grade weapon designed to destroy fortified structures. By burning Dorner alive, then misleading and deceiving the public about the operation, the sheriffs may have validated the rogue ex-cop's sharpest indictments of the culture of American law enforcement.
Yet no element in the Dorner drama was more disturbing than the performance of mainstream media. At every point, major news outlets complied with law enforcement calls for self-censorship, and still demonstrate little interest in determining how and why a lethal fire started on a snow-covered mountain in the dead of winter. As a quintessentially American tragedy reaches its denouement, the truth remains buried beneath a smoldering pile of ashes.

Navy's Electromagnetic Railgun Project Progressing (UPDATED)
BAE Systems' electromagnetic railgun
Photo: Navy
The technology behind the Navy's railgun — an advanced cannon that engineers believe could increase a ship's firepower at a fraction of the cost of typical munitions — is moving forward.
“Electromagnetic weapons such as railgun will play a critical role in the future of naval warfare by providing greater lethality and greater economy than existing weapons,” said Tom Boucher, the system's program officer at the Office of Naval Research. The “railgun is capable of launching projectiles at speeds far beyond the capability of conventional gun technology and represents a revolutionary leap in naval gun technology.”
The system — which has been in development for more than a decade — could allow the Navy to defeat incoming missiles, unmanned aerial systems and swarms of attacking boats, they said in an email to National Defense. It could be employed for naval surface fire support, anti-surface warfare and air and missile defense missions.
The railgun uses magnetic fields generated by electricity to accelerate a metal conductor between two rails that then launch a projectile. The system eliminates the need for gun propellant or rockets, allowing additional rounds to be in the ship's magazine, providing the ability to engage more targets, Boucher said.
“Reducing explosive loads aboard ship — no gun powder, rockets or high explosives — also makes the ship less susceptible to catastrophic battle damage,” they said.
Additionally, the system makes economic sense because the cost per engagement “is a fraction of opposing threat weapons, shifting cost burden to the attacking forces,” they said.
Projectiles are fired at speeds between Mach 5.9 to 7.4, according to a Congressional Research Service report titled, “Navy Lasers, Railgun and Hypervelocity Projectile: Background and Issues for Congress.”
The Navy contracted BAE Systems and General Atomics to each create a prototype railgun system.
“The two industry-built prototypes are designed to fire projectiles at energy levels of 20 to 32 megajoules, which is enough to propel a projectile 50 to 100 nautical miles,” according to the report, which was written by naval analyst Ronald O'Rourke.
Boucher said “significant progress” is being made on the effort.
The current phase of the railgun's development, which began in 2012, is focused on the systems' repetition, or “rep-rate” capability, they said. That includes the development of a tactical prototype gun barrel and pulsed power systems that have advanced cooling mechanisms. BAE is working with the Navy on a rep-rate barrel design and fabrication as well as a pulsed power system. General Atomics is also creating a pulsed power system.
BAE's system is undergoing multi-shot rep-rate operations at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren, in Virginia. Projectiles will be fired down the Potomac River test range over the next three years, they said.
The system has been tested at Dahlgren's railgun advanced research facility since November. During that time, the Navy has successfully tested a next-generation 32-megajoule railgun, they noted.
“We are gradually increasing firing rate and energy level, and evaluating and grooming the system as we go,” they said.
ONR plans to conduct tests at five rounds per minute in June, and anticipates that the railgun will perform rep-rate operations at 32-megajoules of energy by the end of the year, Boucher said.
Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., chairperson of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on seapower and projection forces, visited the location in February and told National Defense they were pleased with the railgun's progress.
“The resiliency of the gun, the barrel, the ability for … multiple fire without having to replace the barrel, the projectiles, the pulsed power units, the size of the pulsed power units, the size of the batteries, all those things … are getting smaller [and] are getting more efficient,” they said.
“The key now is to make sure that it goes through its testing regime, make sure we understand what it can do, put it onboard a ship [and] operate it onboard a ship,” they said. “All those things are on track.”
ONR plans to wrap up the science and technology phase of the railgun by 2019. It has been working alongside its transition partner, program executive office integrated warfare systems, and the staff at the office of the chief of naval operations “to chart a path forward for the follow-on development of an integrated railgun system,” Boucher said.
“The results of land-based testing will inform potential future demonstrations [at sea] to reduce risks and inform requirements for a future deployable system, including a timeline to deliver it,” they said. “Although there is no set timeline to deploy this capability, the Navy is pressing forward to get this revolutionary capability to sea as soon as practical.”
Wittman said it is important that the Navy develop technologies such as the railgun as quickly as possible.
“For us, time is a strategic challenge,” they said. “You cannot take 20 years to get a concept operational. You just can't do that anymore because our adversaries do it much more quickly than we do.”
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson has put a premium on speed, they added.
“I like what the Navy is doing,” they said. Instead of waiting for the perfect solution, it is trying to get technology onboard ships as fast as possible. The service is making strides in other emerging technologies such as a directed energy weapons, such as with the famed laser weapon system on the USS Ponce, they noted.
BAE Systems continues to test its prototype at NSWC Dahlgren, said Amir Chaboki, director of advanced weapon systems at the company.
The technology associated with the railgun has continued to mature over the past decade, they said.
“The work of our team here at BAE Systems has moved at a very rapid pace, and it's laying the foundation for the development of a tactical, operational” system, they said in an email.
The railgun is making progress from its initial single shot and low-muzzle energy performance, toward a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute at full 32 megajoules muzzle energy, they said.
BAE has focused its work on the launcher technology and on the design and development of the integrated launch package, they noted.
“These subsystems are progressing well in terms of technological maturity — from laboratory and field testing toward the steps required for the gun to become an operational tactical system,” they said.
BAE has overcome the key technological challenges for the railgun, Chaboki said. The company is now prioritizing engineering and material improvements and validation.
“We've made — and continue to make — considerable progress on the size, weight and power challenges associated with the railgun,” they added.
Scott Forney, president of General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, said the company is finalizing the fourth-generation of its pulsed power system, which it will deliver to the Navy.
The company has also independently developed a more advanced cannon than the one it delivered to the service in 2012, called the multi-mission medium-range railgun, they said.
The system is smaller than previous iterations of the railgun, they noted. The company plans to test the cannon in the next few months at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, with Army and Navy officials in attendance.
By the fourth quarter of this year, the company intends to hit a stationary target with its command guidance and by the end of the year or early next year, it expects to hit a surrogate cruise missile that General Atomics is developing, Forney said.
The company has been testing components of the system for the past three years, they noted.
“We have a smaller first-generation railgun, which is our workhorse, and we've done about 175 shots off that gun qualifying each of the electronic components,” they said.
The company has been using the 3-megajoule system to finesse the design of the multi-mission medium-range railgun, they noted. It has been tested at a facility in Utah where it faced harsh conditions of -10 degrees Fahrenheit to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and winds of 50 mph, Forney noted.
General Atomics invested its own dollars in the system, they said. “We've spent a lot of money over the last several years making sure that we could go as fast as we can, and we wanted to make sure that this gun … fits on an Army platform … [and is] small enough to fit on the littoral combat ship.”
Forney said the system could be outfitted on the Army's heavy expanded mobility tactical truck.
The company will first test the new railgun using non-aerodynamic rounds, they said.
“We [will] slowly increase our current and voltage to get to the final conditions,” they added.
Forney expected testing to last about nine months.
General Atomics' railgun could also be used for cruise missile defense, they said. The company hopes the Army or Navy will soon test the technology on a vehicle or ship after it proves itself in Utah, they noted.
Clarification: A previous version of this story did not mention that BAE Systems is also developing a pulsed power system.

Lindsay Lohan's Italian Lovers Tryst Continues (Photos)
, ex boyfriend of, sounds like they may know what he's talking about when they referred to Li Lo as a sex addict. We've featured several stories on their whirlwind love fest with every man they have encountered on the island of Capri. The saga continues with new photos.
Our featured photo seems to show the disheveled Lohan and Italian actor Dario Faiella out on a balcony, no doubt coming up for air in the midst of a sex tryst. They appear to have donned their t-shirt and from what we can see - they may be in the buff.
Lindsay Lohan has been keeping a low profile back in Hollywood but has really let their hair down in Europe. Rumors have been flying about their possible lesbian liaison with a new live-in roommate Courtenay Semel. Maybe this is a smoke screen of sorts - or an indication that they are open to any and all sexual advances. Worse yet - maybe they have exchanged on addiction for another. In any case, their self control seems to have waned badly. Maybe it's something in the Italian water.
Check out the rest of the candid shots below.
NAFTA negotiations could affect avocado and beer prices Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved FILE - Corona beer (Nexstar Photo) Future of NAFTA deal unclear FILE - Corona beer (Nexstar Photo) prev next
KFTA - WASHINGTON (KFTA) -- Negotiations surrounding the North American Free Trade Agreement are on uncertain footing after the first series of meetings in December, as changes to NAFTA could fundamentally alter the way the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade goods.
One state that has the potential of being greatly affected is Texas, Mexico's nearest neighbor. Congressman Will Hurd said changes in NAFTA could cost the prices of imports to skyrocket, which would unfortunately include beer.
Hurd said 17 percent of the beer consumed in the U.S. comes through their district.
"Mexico is Texas's number one trading partner," Hurd said. "And you know if we get this wrong we can see an increase in the price of beer when we go out. I don't think anybody wants that."
But if the US, Canada and Mexico cannot come to an agreement, it's possible that NAFTA could be repealed.
The most recent round of negotiations regarding NAFTA ended this month, but they did so with no solid plans for the future of NAFTA negotiations. The future is clouded additionally by the fact that Mexico is soon to host a new election, which could potentially void negotiations made under the previous administration.
Texas Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar said NAFTA eliminated tariffs, which made certain goods coming into the US less expensive. If NAFTA is repealed, prices could go up.
"We want to get it modernized but we can't throw it away," Cuellar said.
Cuellar painted the possibility of a NAFTA repeal in vivid terms, suggesting that some of the things Americans enjoy coming from Mexico could become much more expensive. And if the thought of beer alone doesn't frighten you, then perhaps threats to avocados will.
"I mean name it: It's avocado, it's Corona beer, it is other things that we buy from Mexico that are just going to go up because then different tariffs are going to come in and who is going to pay for it?" Cuellar asked. "It's not the companies, they are going to pass it on to the consumers, you and I."
The next round of NAFTA negotiations take place in January, and will be hosted in Mexico.
Alberta squatters law allows people to be legal owners of land if they have been in open possession of it for 10 or more years
Bob Woodward can see the 10-acre parcel of ranchland from their kitchen window.
It is land west of Cardston, Alta., that they bought in 1999, for which they had legal title and on which they have paid taxes every year since it was purchased.
So Woodward was flabbergasted when a judge ruled in December that the land belonged to their neighbour.
The decision was based on Alberta law involving adverse possession, more commonly known as squatter's rights.
It allows people to be recognized as legal owners of land if they have been in open possession of it for 10 or more years.

Alberta is the only province to retain the legislation, which is based on British common law but has been struck from the books in other provinces.
“I think that the rural people need to be made aware that this old act is still in the works and that if you have unscrupulous people looking for an opportunity like that, they can take advantage of that old law,” said Woodward, a longtime rancher who owns 2,400 acres.
“Even though you've bought a piece of property and paid for it and paid the taxes on it and everything, if they squat on it, even if you know that they're there and more or less acknowledge, or in other words put up with them, if you let them do it for 10 years, they can turn around and claim your property.”
Woodward said they thought twice about going to court but decided to proceed when their neighbours gave notice in 2011 of a suit to claim the 10-acre piece of land, which they estimated to be worth $3,000 per acre.

“It's kind of a matter of principle, but as it turned out, it didn't do us any good.”
They and their lawyer, Douglas Carle, were surprised at the outcome, and an appeal has since been filed with the Alberta Court of Appeals.
Carle said adverse possession is a throwback to an era before Canada adopted the Torrens land titles system based on registered titles and accurate surveys.
“I think that it is actually quite puzzling that a jurisdiction such as ours … would even have a concept of adverse possession,” said Carle.
“It's an archaic concept that causes nothing but hardship and flies in the face of our entire land titles system.”
Carle, who practises out of Taber, Alta., said the outcome of Woodward's case should serve as a warning.

“What should be very chilling to farmers and landowners in Western Canada is the notion that you can let your neighbours … have access and use of your land, but you run the risk of them taking the land from you.
“I know many, many clients in southern Alberta who are good neighbours, who would never dream that their next door neighbour or their down-the-road farming companion would end up taking their land, but it's something that farmers, especially farmers, need to think of.”
Alberta legislators gave two readings to a bill in 2012 that would have struck adverse possession from provincial law, but it died on the order paper when a provincial election was called.
Bill 204, brought forward by Ken Allred, then the Progressive Conservative MLA for St. Albert, would have abolished all mention of the adverse possession doctrine.
Alberta Liberals are also on record as supporting the move at the time.
As reported in Hansard, Allred said the legislation was outdated and its abolition “would assure Alberta landowners that they will not be at risk of losing land to a neighbour who has accidentally or intentionally been trespassing on their property.”
Allred, who did not stand for re-election in 2012, is a former land surveyor.
They told the legislature at the time that about 100 court cases in Alberta had involved adverse possession but few were successful because of the province's “efficient land titles system.”
It was Allred's contention that squatter's rights should never have been adopted from the English system in the first place because Alberta was surveyed before settlement, as opposed to Britain's settlement before survey.
Adverse possession caused the City of Calgary to lose land in 1965 and irrigation districts to lose land in 1993.
After that, the government amended legislation to exempt municipalities and irrigation districts from future claims on that basis.
The provincial property act allows people to claim land on which they have mistakenly built lasting improvements. However, that person must pay the landowner compensation for the property lost.
Woodward said they want the current government to take action.
“I say at the stroke of a pen, the government could change this thing, and they need to do it.
“I say shame on Alberta for hanging onto this thing when all the other provinces in Canada have thrown it out. I want these legislators to do something about it.”
Individuals should be free of it, just as irrigation districts and municipalities are, they added.
Carle said they think the government may be considering changes.
Drew Barnes, Wildrose MLA for Cypress Medicine Hat, said they would be happy to examine the pros and cons of the legislation at the next legislative session, set to begin March 10.
“Property rights are the bedrock of a democratic society,” said Barnes.
“Property rights allow individuals to know where their rights begin and where the government's rights end. So any infringement on an individual's property rights would be of great concern to me.”
Carle said they have discussed adverse possession with some of their farmer clients and generally advises landowners to confirm their ownership in cases where neighbours are using their land.
“It has certainly caught the fear and imagination of southern Albertans,” said Carle, adding that the case was one of the more interesting they have tackled in 26 years of practice.
“I've always told clients that 99.9 percent of the time, an issue can be decided merely by an application of common sense…. This is that point one percent of the time.”
President Trump commented Saturday on their former national security adviser Michael Flynn's guilty plea, saying there was "nothing to hide" about Flynn's actions during the presidential transition.
"I had to fire General Flynn because they lied to the Vice President and the FBI. They have pled guilty to those lies," Trump wrote in a tweet.
"It is a shame because their actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!" they added.
Trump's tweets come a day after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Trump campaign associates' ties to Russia.
Flynn acknowledged to investigators that they had spoken with then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak in the month before Trump took office about U.S. sanctions, despite their previous comments.
Prosecutors also said that Flynn was directed by a "very senior member" of the Trump transition team to contact officials from Russia and other countries to push them to vote against a United Nations Security Council resolution.
Multiple reports on Friday indicated that Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner was that senior transition official.
Flynn was ousted as Trump's national security adviser on Feb. 13, just 24 days after entering the administration.
In June, Former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate that Trump asked them during a Feb. 14 meeting to "let go" of an investigation into Flynn.
Flynn's guilty plea represents a major milestone in Mueller's probe into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 campaign.
The retired general is the first person who held a Trump administration position to be brought down by Mueller and their team of investigators.
Mueller announced last month former Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort and their business associate Richard Gates were indicted on charges of conspiracy against the U.S. and money laundering.
Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators.

The remains of a major Aztec temple and a ceremonial ball court have been discovered in downtown Mexico City, shedding new light on the sacred spaces of the metropolis that Spanish conquerors overran five centuries ago, archaeologists said on Wednesday.
The discoveries were made on a nondescript side street just behind the city's colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral off the main Zocalo plaza on the grounds of a 1950s-era hotel.
The underground excavations reveal a section of what was the foundation of a massive, circular-shaped temple dedicated to the Aztec wind god Ehecatl and a smaller part of a ritual ball court, confirming accounts of the first Spanish chroniclers to visit the Aztec imperial capital, Tenochtitlan.
"Due to finds like these, we can show actual locations, the positioning and dimensions of each one of the structures first described in the chronicles," said Diego Prieto, head of Mexico's main anthropology and history institute.
Archaeologists also detailed a grisly offering of 32 severed male neck vertebrae discovered in a pile just off the court.
"It was an offering associated with the ball game, just off the stairway," said archaeologist Raul Barrera. "The vertebrae, or necks, surely came from victims who were sacrificed or decapitated."
AZTEC EMPEROR'S TOMB UNEARTHED IN MEXICO
Some of the original white stucco remains visible on parts of the temple, built during the 1486-1502 reign of Aztec Emperor Ahuizotl, predecessor of Moctezuma, who is a conquistador Hernan Cortes toppled during the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
Early Spanish accounts relate how a young Moctezuma played against an elderly allied king on the court and lost, which was taken as sign that the Aztec Empire's days were numbered.
The building would have stood out because of its round shape among the several dozen other square temples that dominated the Aztecs' most sacred ceremonial space before the 1521 conquest.
Aztec archaeologist Eduardo Matos said the top of the temple was likely built to resemble a coiled snake, with priests entering though a doorway made to look like a serpent's nose.
Once excavations finish, a museum will be built on the site, rubbing shoulders with modern buildings in the capital.
Mexico City, including its many colonial-era structures with their own protections, was built above the razed ruins of the Aztec capital, and more discoveries are likely, Matos said.
"We've been working this area for nearly 40 years, and there's always construction of some kind ... and so we take advantage of that and get involved," they said.
Fighting in Gaza intensified overnight, with reports indicating that Israeli forces were advancing around the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah, in what appeared to be an attempt to prevent Hamas from moving a soldier reported to have been captured.
Reports from Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip and close to where Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin is thought to have been taken, indicated heavy civilian casualties from Israeli bombardments. Troops continued to clash with Hamas fighters.
Around 100 people in Rafah have been killed and hundreds more injured in Rafah since fighting restarted after the three hour breakfollowing the collapse of an internationally brokered ceasefire collapsed on Friday morning. At least a dozen have been killed elsewhere in Gaza and scores wounded. Local health officials said the main hospital in Rafah had to be evacuated due tobecause of shelling on Friday afternoon.
In the northern town of Beit Lahiya, however, the Israeli army on Saturday told residents it was safe to return to their homes, as troops were seen withdrawing from the area. It was the first time troops had been seen pulling back since the start of the conflict 26 days ago.
"Messages have been conveyed to residents of the northern Gaza Strip that they may return to the Beit Lahiya area," an army statement said, with a spokesperson indicating the message had been relayed to authorities in the Palestinian enclave.
It comes amid reports that Israel has pulled out of negotiations for a new truce, due to take place in Cairo on Saturday.
Around 1,650 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,000 injured since the conflict started, according to the Gazan health ministry. The UN children's agency Unicef said that at least 296 Palestinian children had been killed, 30% of the civilian casualties. On the Israeli side, 63 soldiers and three civilians have been killed. Unicef said: "The number of child casualties during the last 48 hours may rise as a number of incidents are pending verification."
Air strikes continued in Gaza city overnight, hitting the Islamic University, a private institution associated with Hamas, and other targets, including several mosques. There was bombing in and around the city on Saturday morning.
Israeli troops were reported to have pushed further towards the northern village of Beit Hanoun and Shujai'iya, a neighbourhood east of Gaza city where the IDF say many cross-border tunnels used by Hamas to infiltrate Israel originate.
Early on Saturday, the Hamas military wing said in a statement on its website that it was "not aware until this moment of a missing soldier or their whereabouts or the circumstances of their disappearance". The group said it believed the soldier might have been killed in a clash with Hamas fighters about an hour before the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military declined comment on the statement.
The US and the UN supported Israeli accounts that Hamas had taken advantage of the 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire to ambush IDF personnel near the entrance to a tunnel on the Egyptian border outside Rafah, on the southern end of the Gaza Strip, killing two soldiers at the same time as seizing Goldin.
Barack Obama said Hamas should be held responsible for the collapse of the ceasefire and demanded that it immediately release Goldin. They insisted the US was doing everything possible to prevent the deaths of Palestinian civilians, which they called "heartbreaking".
Obama strongly condemned the Palestinian side for failing to follow through on the truce. "If they are serious about trying to resolve this situation, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible," Obama told reporters at the White House.
They struck a pessimistic note about the prospects of piecing together another ceasefire after Friday's return to violence, an objective they said the US would continue to pursue, acknowledging that ceasing hostilities in the current climate would be challenging.
They reaffirmed their support for Israel's military attempts to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks and cross-border assaults using tunnels. "At the same time we've also been clear that innocent civilians in Gaza, caught in the crossfire, have to weigh on our conscience, and we have to do more to protect them," they said.
The president said it was hard to reconcile support for Israel's self-defence and concern for the death of innocent Palestinians: "I want to see everything possible done to make sure that Palestinian civilians are not being killed. It is heartbreaking to see what is happening."
The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the Hamas attack was "likely to have very serious consequences for the people of Gaza, Israel and beyond". Through their spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, Ban said: "Such moves call into question the credibility of Hamas's assurances to the United Nations."
The bombardment of Rafah appeared to reflect what the IDF called the "Hannibal directive", in which it responds to any capture of a soldier with heavy fire aimed at stopping the captors leaving the scene, even if it risks injury to the Israeli prisoner.
Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told the US secretary of state, John Kerry, in a phone call: "Israel will take all necessary steps against those who call for our destruction and perpetrate terrorism against our citizens."
Kerry said: "Hamas, which has security control over the Gaza Strip, must immediately and unconditionally release the missing Israeli soldier. The international community must now redouble its efforts to end the tunnel and rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists on Israel."
Britain is providing a further £3m to support a rapid response by aid workers in Gaza to what the international development secretary, Justine Greening, described as "nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe".
The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, made a plea in the Guardian for the Israeli government to halt its military operations in Gaza and talk to Hamas.
POKING FUN: Over 1000 people have liked a Facebook page mocking the University of Canterbury.
More than 1000 people have ''liked'' a Facebook page mocking the University of Canterbury, but university leaders are not concerned.
The Canterbury University Memes page features pictures and slogans mocking the university.
The Press reported today that the university is absorbing its law faculty operation into the College of Business and Economics, and the law library will permanently relocate to another site on campus.
NOT CONCERNED: The University of Canterbury said "satirical comment" had always been a part of student life.
One post on the page, featuring the photo-shopped image of vice-chancellor Rod Carr, targets the university over to restructure.
"Law Students, UCan not have your own department," the post reads.
A university spokesperson said Carr did not have any comment to make, other than to acknowledge that "satirical comment" had always been a part of student life.
"It is natural that students would use social media to share this kind of material," they said.
The creators of the page said university leaders should not be so quick to dismiss the page as "satire".
One of the creators, who did not want to be named, said the memes were an "expression of opinion and culture within a society".
"University of Canterbury students are angry and feel that the lack of consideration shown to those of us who have chosen to remain loyal to our university throughout the trials since the September earthquake is appalling," they said.
"Students are gearing up to fight this because we believe the quality of our degrees are threatened and we will not allow our education to be compromised."
The Facebook page has attracted 1265 followers since it was set up on August 30.
From a distance, the grey cement bridge looks unremarkable. Two tunnels on either side of the Trans-Canada Highway arc in semi-circles that end bluntly on the pavement below. But on top, away from passing motorists' eyes, lies a grassy oasis. Against the odds, pine trees and wildflowers have taken root here, giving the overpass a fringe of greenery. On the edges, wire fencing provides safe passage for roaming animals.
“These overpasses have been really, really effective for wildlife,” says Parks Canada human-wildlife conflict specialist Steve Michel as they drive down the portion of highway that bisects Banff National Park.
Thirty kilometres west of the Banff townsite, they pull over alongside another fence that runs all the way to the British Columbia border. Since the 1980s, the Canadian government has allotted more than $400 million to upgrade and twin the four-lane highway, with a quarter of the budget set aside for projects that would reduce wildlife collisions, a growing concern. Parks Canada decided they would use part of that money to fence the entire highway — roughly 180 kilometres — and construct several dozen wildlife crossing structures in hopes of lowering the mortality rate.
Michel opens a padlocked gate set into the fence and descends a steep, soggy embankment toward what looks like a drainage culvert along Redearth Creek. Signs warn us in bold typeface to keep out. At the bottom, the culvert reveals itself to be one of the park's camouflaged wildlife underpasses. Black bears and mountain lions prefer to use these shadowy, damp tunnels, says Michel, whereas grizzlies and ungulates prefer the open sightlines offered by the overpasses.
In November, Parks Canada marked the 20th anniversary of the completion of the first wildlife overpass in Banff National Park. Though many biologists and citizens were skeptical of the wildlife bridges when they were first built, the six overpasses and 38 underpasses that criss-cross the Trans-Canada are today considered a worldwide conservation success story, reducing wildlife collisions by 80 per cent and buoying Banff biologists to rock-star status in the realm of transportation ecology. Delegations from around the world now visit Banff to learn more about their crossing structures in hopes of building similar systems in their home countries, where new roads are cutting through wilderness areas at unprecedented rates.
Few national parks have to deal with major national highways and railroad corridors slicing through them.
Tony Clevenger has dedicated much of their life to studying the performance of Banff's wildlife crossing structures. When the first wildlife bridges went up, Clevenger, a researcher with the Western Transportation Institute, was living in Canmore, and recalls the distinctly negative atmosphere that surrounded what many saw as a hair-brained scheme by Parks Canada. Save for a few small crossings in the eastern United States, no one had ever attempted something like this before — and no one believed it would work. Editorials in the local paper scoffed at the “waste of taxpayers' money” and confidently stated animals would never use the $2 million to $3 million human-made bridges. Others believed wolves would herd their prey into the fence, violently killing them before traumatized tourists.
“This project started in a bad spot. There was a lot of opposition and criticism,” Clevenger says. “It took several years of good data, publishing in scientific peer-reviewed journals, to change people's minds.”
Clevenger now has 17 years-worth of data proving the efficacy of the crossings. Among large carnivores, mortality rates are 50 to 100 per cent lower along sections of the highway where overpasses and underpasses exist. In those same sections, mortality rates for elk are almost zero, compared to 100 elk-vehicle collisions per year in the mid-1990s. Clevenger's research has shown that 11 species of large mammals in Banff have used the structures more than 200,000 times, including unexpected species such as red fox, hoary marmot, boreal toads, wolverines, lynx, garter snakes and beavers.
In 2014, a Montana State University study found that not only are grizzly bears using the crossing structures, but the structures are also helping to maintain genetically healthy populations among the bears that use them. Grizzlies were crossing with enough frequency to ensure populations on either side of the highway weren't genetically isolated from each other.
“This is Canada's biggest conservation success story — it's the largest highway mitigation complex in the world,” says Clevenger. “You won't find anything anywhere else in the world close to what we have. We have the most overpasses in one localized area and almost half of all the overpasses in North America.”

Roads don't only imperil wildlife through vehicle collisions; they can fragment habitat and cut off critical migration routes for species. It's estimated that 25 million kilometres of new road will be built by 2050, the majority in developing countries who have never before had to confront the impact of highways on biodiversity. “Many of those roads are going into globally significant biodiversity hotspots, and they don't know how to manage those different taxa,” says Rob Ament, a road ecologist at Montana State University's Western Transportation Institute and member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's International Connectivity Conservation Network specialist group.
Scientists have come from around the world to learn how to adapt and implement similar crossings in their own countries over the past two decades. In the 2000s, Salish and Kootenai tribal delegations from Montana visited Banff to learn how grizzlies used the overpasses and how to build their own on the Flathead Reservation. Then came biologists from Washington's Cascade Range, who wished to pursue a similar project over the I-90. But in recent years, delegations and requests for consultations have been coming from farther and farther away — Mongolia, Argentina, China.
Ament recalls a Chinese delegation that visited the Western Transportation Institute several years ago. “Everyone in China knew about Banff. When Tony took to the stage, they all pulled out their notepads and started writing like crazy, every word they spoke. Clearly, Banff has cached all over the world.”
In Mongolia, the government recently approved new policy standards that require developers to provide passage for wild animals along auto and railroads in the eastern steppe and the Gobi Desert, where mining is booming. “They don't have any highways — they're building their first highway as we speak,” says Ament, adding that they're simultaneously working on the design for their first wildlife crossing in the Gobi Desert to protect goitered gazelle, black-tailed gazelle and argali bighorn sheep.
Thanks to the work done by Banff biologists, engineers now have a good idea of what it will take to get a grizzly, cougar or wolf to use a wildlife crossing. But species in developing countries pose new challenges. What kind of crossing would a monkey use? How big does a tunnel need to be for a jaguar? Belize, Ament says, has been trying to tackle their tapir problem. These 230-kilogram pig-like ungulates have been getting smacked on the road, but no one knows how to get them to use crossings. “Banff opened the door to large landscape mitigation, but it only covers species from the Canadian Rockies. Now, we're starting to do designs for a bunch of new taxa all over the world.”
Among large carnivores, mortality rates are 50 to 100 per cent lower along sections of the highway where overpasses and underpasses exist. In those same sections, mortality rates for elk are almost zero.
At the same time, however, Banff is being beaten at its own game. While wildlife mortalities on the Trans-Canada have fallen dramatically, more and more animals are meeting their end on the stretch of Canadian Pacific Railway that cuts through the park. In 2010, Parks Canada joined forces with CP Rail on a $1 million, five-year joint study to figure out why animals, mainly grizzlies, were dying on the railroad in unprecedented numbers. Their research revealed that a number of factors were drawing animals into the rail corridor, from increased vegetation to an inability to detect oncoming trains, with bears often running toward them, instead of away. Researchers concluded there was no single silver bullet that would fix the rail problem, although it could be feasible to implement overpasses in certain spots.
Because the railroad in Canada is privately owned, however, wildlife managers aren't able to implement crossing structures over the tracks as easily as they might in other nations where governments rule the rail. Already, China has constructed 33 wildlife passages over and under the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to help Tibetan antelope during their migration. “When you've got private, linear land going through the park, the rail company can do whatever they want,” says Clevenger. “The bottom line isn't trying to balance ecological integrity, it's big profits.” And railway overpasses are expensive.
The problems Banff faces are unique at a global level. Few national parks have to deal with major national highways and railroad corridors slicing through them, transporting tens of thousands of cars and trucks, and dozens of trains, each day. But the fact that the efficacy of the crossings has been proven in one of the most challenging environments possible should make similar conservation efforts elsewhere easier. Banff's achievements in the realm of transportation ecology over the past two decades have paved the way for other nations to follow suit, providing a literal road map of how best to protect vulnerable wildlife in areas of rapid infrastructure development.
Despite Crisis, Europe Continues to Protect Its Banksters
BARCELONA, Jun 11 2014 (IPS) - More than six years after the global financial crisis broke out, European Union (EU) countries continue to protect banks and investments funds from tougher rules, despite abundant evidence of recurrent criminal or reckless activities in the sector, and new accumulation of enormous financial risks.
The latest in a string of scandals involving banks was the revelation in May that at least seven European banks or banks operating in Europe had colluded to falsely fix the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor).
The Euribor is a daily reference rate, published by the European Banking Federation, based on the averaged interest rates at which Eurozone banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks in the euro wholesale money market.
“The (European) commission has concerns that … three banks may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives,” the body said in a statement issued May 22.
The three banks in question are JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Crédit Agricole. Another four banks (Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale), also accused of misconduct concerning the Euribor, reached a settlement with European regulators.
“Another typical example of the lack of will among European governments to improve regulations and reduce risks in financial markets is the long and so far fruitless debate on the introduction of a very low tax on financial transactions, also known as the Tobin tax”
Because of such behaviour, bank managers have since 2009 again earned the nickname of ‘banksters', a combination of banker and gangster coined in 1937 at the height of the global economic crisis of the time.
Experts and analysts complaint that despite such criminal activities, and the new accumulation of financial risks, European governments have during the past six years repeatedly intervened to stop far-reaching rules to regulate operations in the financial sector.
The list of actions taken by European governments to spare banks and investment funds from new rules is long. In December last year, the French government managed to arrange for French banks to pay a lower-than European average contribution to the E.U.-created national deposit insurance.
“To obtain that, France used the friendly support of Michel Barnier, the French European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services,” says Burkhard Balz, German member of the European Parliament (EP). Balz is a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union.
“Over the last six years we have seen a pattern of behaviour concerning efforts to introduce a Europe-wide financial regulation,” Udo Bullmann, a German Social Democratic member of the European Parliament, told IPS.
This pattern goes as follows, Bullmann added: “First, the European Commission makes a timid regulating proposal. The European Parliament takes the proposal over and toughens its content. But then it is the turn of governments, and they water the proposal down, even under the original commission level.”
Independent experts agree. “The European Union is indeed a community of states, but at the end of the day, the member states compete against each other instead of cooperating to put forward a comprehensive set of rules for financial markets,” says Joost Mulder of Finance Watch, an independent association set up in 2011 to act as a public interest counterweight to the powerful financial lobby.
“What the individual states want is to protect their countries' banks and investment funds,” Mulder added.
Opposition to far-reaching financial regulation comes from practically every state, but in changing roles. Britain usually opposes rules that would affect operations at the London financial market. It also has consistently opposed establishing limits for bonuses for financial managers, one of the main reasons for risky investments and moral hazard. Germany and France prefer to pass modest laws on financial aspects, to avoid approving a tougher European binding regulation.
In September last year, Finance Watch published a report on the planned European banking union and the bank reform in the European Union, and concluded that “despite its intention, (it) will fail to prevent European citizens from bearing the losses of failed banks in the event of a systemic banking crisis unless there are meaningful structural and capital reforms to Europe's largest banks.”
The banking union, which should start operations in November, is supposed to create a safety net to minimise the risk of further European Union taxpayer-funded bailouts.
The banking unions foresees a new European authority, the so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), with the power to wind up or restructure failing banks.
According to Finance Watch, “The SRM has the right objectives: namely to enable the orderly resolution of banks in participating member states, and to weaken the interdependencies between financial institutions and their sovereigns.”
But the watchdog group does not see “how these objectives can be met without reducing the regulatory incentives that favour sovereign debt, and without a structural reform of bank activities to make bail-in and bank resolution credible.”
According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures, in the aftermath of the global financial meltdown of 2008, industrialised countries bailed out private banks for 1.75 trillion dollars, some 1.3 trillion euros. This amounts to the one-year salary of more than 42 million people earning net average German wages of around 25,000 euro per year.
The global bank rescue weakened the European states involved, in particular Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and triggered, among others, the present sovereign debt crisis, with its social and human costs.
Another typical example of the lack of will among European governments to improve regulations and reduce risks in financial markets is the long and so far fruitless debate on the introduction of a very low tax on financial transactions, also known as the Tobin tax, after it was suggested by Nobel Laureate economist James Tobin in 1972.
In September 2011, the European Commission proposed the introduction of the tax within the 27 member states of the European Union by 2014. According to the original proposal, the tax would only impact financial transactions between financial institutions charging 0.1 percent against the exchange of shares and bonds and 0.01 percent across derivative contracts.
According to the initial Commission estimates, the tax could raise up to 57 billion euros per year. But, as of June 2014, that is, almost three years after the proposal, only 11 E.U. member countries appear ready to introduce the tax. Furthermore, there is wide disagreement among these 11 countries about which transactions should be taxed, and how high the levy should be.
Sven Giegold, German Green Party member of the Euro-Parliament and expert on international finance, even goes as far as saying that “France, nominally a strong supporter of the Tobin tax, actually did kill it.”
In May, during negotiations at the European Council, the French government opposed raising the Tobin tax on most financial derivatives and on government bonds. Giegold said that “France obviously fears that if taxed, banks wouldn't buy government bonds.”
After such objections, Giegold complained, “the original tax on financial transactions has been devaluated to a useless levy to be paid only by small savers.”
A new scheme to avoid new rules for financial markets in Europe are to make them part of supra-regional binding projects, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), currently under negotiation between the European Union and the U.S. government.
According to Finance Watch, “there is no proven case for including financial services in the TTIP.” “We are concerned that the EU's approach to regulatory cooperation (within the TTIP negotiations related to financial markets) will encourage convergence around the lowest common standards, not the highest,” Thierry Philipponnat, Finance Watch's secretary, said during a recent hearing at the European Parliament.
For Philipponnat, “it is difficult to see how the inclusion of financial services in the European Union-U.S. free trade agreement negotiations, and especially the parts on regulatory cooperation, will not lead to a ‘race to the bottom' in financial services regulation.”
Rosie O'Donnell unleashed a bizarre attack at Paul Ryan in the earlier hours of Christmas morning as part of an ongoing Twitter campaign against conservatives.
The 55-year-old talk show host responded to a video of the House Speaker posted on Saturday to celebrate Christmas, telling them to 'go straight to hell.'
'paul ryan - don't talk about Jesus after what u just did to our nation - u will go straight to hell u screwed up fake altar boy #JUDASmuch,' they said on Twitter, Monday.

'paul ryan - don't talk about Jesus after what u just did to our nation - u will go straight to hell u screwed up fake altar boy #JUDASmuch,' they said, Monday
Ryan posted a video of themselves giving a speech in Washington DC in hopes of showing their pride in the holiday.
'At the end of each year, no matter how short—or long—it may feel, there is always Christmas,' they said on Saturday.
'Waiting for us is that sense of wonder the shepherds felt when the angels appeared in the night sky to herald the birth of a Savior.'
Ryan posted a video of themselves giving a speech in Washington DC in hopes of showing their pride in the holiday
O'Donnell's animosity toward Ryan is not new: they tweeted 'f**k u' to the speaker back in January.
They famously have feuded with President Donald Trump since before they even became president.
Just last week, Rosie O'Donnell had tried to bribe Republican Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins for $2million so that they would vote against the tax reform bill.
And on late Sunday night, Conservative media personality Ben Shapiro shared that Twitter removed tweets that the actor had directed at him, telling them to 'Suck my d**k Ben.'
Twitter has reversed itself late Sunday by deleting tweets by Rosie O'Donnell toward Conservative media personality Ben Shapiro that violated the company's harassment policy
Ben Shapiro tweeted late Sunday that the social media platform had a change of heart and removed tweets which O'Donnell directed at them
'Well, looks like Twitter had some second thoughts about Rosie O'Donnell's obscene tweets,' Shapiro tweeted late Sunday.
Shapiro posted an email message they received from Twitter saying that the company re-examined the issue and deemed O'Donnell's tweets as abusive.
O'Donnell continued their onslaught, claiming they looked liked a 'high school junior' when they claimed their comments were sexual harassment.
The conservative columnist and commentator reported the former The View host after they directed a vulgar comment at him. O'Donnell told editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire Shapiro to 'suck my d*** ben' in a tweet that they later deleted
Earlier on Sunday, Shapiro slammed Twitter for saying O'Donnell was not abusive when they 'harassed' them on the social media platform.
Shapiro wrote in a tweet on Friday: 'Just reported @Rosie for targeted harassment, mainly to see if Twitter does indeed have a double standard. Everyone knows if Rosie were conservative, Twitter would suspend them in a hot second. So, Twitter, put your money where your mouth is.'
Just a few hours later, Shapiro revealed to their followers that they had already got a response from Twitter, clearing the talk show host
They then wrote: 'It's an attempt to clarify Twitter's standards. I don't actually want them to ban or suspend Rosie. I want them to stop applying their own rules inconsistently.'
Alongside a screenshot of the decision from Twitter, a few hours later they wrote: 'Surprise of surprises. Twitter says that @Rosie's tweets were not in fact abusive in any way under their rules. Good to know.'
The feud between the pair started when Shapiro slammed the talk show host for saying they would give Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake $2million for voting against the Republican's tax reform.

The new plastic £10 note has been unveiled by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at Winchester Cathedral.
The note, which follows the polymer £5, will be issued on 14 September and has a portrait of Jane Austen on the 200th anniversary of the author's death.
It is also the first Bank of England note to include a tactile feature to help visually impaired people.
Meanwhile, a limited supply of a new £2 coin honouring Jane Austen has been put into circulation by the Royal Mint.
The coin will initially only be available in tills at key locations in the Winchester and Basingstoke areas that have connections with Austen, including Winchester Cathedral and the Jane Austen House Museum.
It will be circulated more widely across the UK later this year.
Controversy
The £10 note will be made of the same material as the £5 note, which means it also contains some traces of animal fat - an issue which caused concern for vegans and some religious groups when it was launched last September.
A petition to ban the note attracted more than 100,000 signatures but the new £10 will again contain some tallow, which is derived from meat products.
Image copyright BANK OF ENGLAND Image caption The new £10 note (top) is smaller than the current one
The Jane Austen quote on the note from Pride and Prejudice has also attracted some unfavourable comment.
The quotation: "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!" is uttered by a character called Caroline Bingley who in fact has no interest in books and is merely trying to impress Mr Darcy, a potential suitor.
But Mr Carney defended the choice.
"It captures much of their [Jane Austen's] spirit, at least in my mind," they said. "It draws out some of the essence of some of their social satire and their insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels."
A new polymer £20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by 2020, but there are no plans to replace the current £50 note, which was released in 2011.
The Bank of England says the new £10 notes contain sophisticated security features and are expected to last five years, which is two-and-a-half times longer than the current note.
Security features of new £10 note:
A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait.
Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back.
A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange.
A hologram which contains the word "Ten" and changes to "Pounds" when the note is tilted.
A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted.
A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA.
Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope.
The words "Bank of England" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note.
'Universal appeal'
The tactile feature was developed in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner of each note.
banknotes are already in tiered sizes, and have bold numerals, raised print and differing colours to help blind and partially sighted people.
Launching the note in Winchester Cathedral, Austen's final resting place, Mr Carney paid tribute to the author, saying: "The new £10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published."
Victoria Cleland, the Bank's chief cashier, said: "The new £10 note marks the next exciting step in our introduction of cleaner, safer, stronger polymer banknotes, and I am grateful to the cash industry for their work towards a smooth transition."
The design of the note includes the quote "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!" from Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and a portrait of the novelist based on an original sketch drawn by their sister Cassandra.

Meanwhile, the Austen £2 coin, designed by Royal Mint graphic designer Dominique Evans, features Austen's silhouette, set in a period frame against a backdrop of Regency wallpaper.
Ms Evans said: "I imagined Jane Austen's framed silhouette as if it were in one of the houses featured in their books, on the wall of a corridor as guests passed by to attend a dance, perhaps in Pride and Prejudice, or on the wall in the home of Emma."
Austen had their first novel Sense and Sensibility published anonymously in 1811 at the age of 35.
Steam locomotive
The Bank of Scotland unveiled the design of its new plastic £10 note at the end of May.
Featuring Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott alongside The Mound in Edinburgh on the front and the Glenfinnan Viaduct on the back, it also has a picture of a steam locomotive hauling a heritage tourist train.
The note is due to come into circulation in the autumn.
The city “felt the Bern” on Thursday evening, as more than 50 ralliers for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders marched through the streets of Downtown Berkeley.
Organized by Berkeley resident Josh Kornbluth and UC Berkeley alumna Sara Soto, the rally is one of numerous volunteer-led events throughout the country to rally supporters of Sanders, who has rapidly gained support among young voters for their progressive policies addressing wealth inequality and institutionalized racism.
“If you're a young person now, certain things seem like they will never change,” Kornbluth said. “But Sanders is a once-in-a-generation candidate. They represent getting people involved, and he's not beholden to billionaires.”
The rally drew a large coalition of participants across various ages and races from both the campus and the community. Many of the activists said their political views matched identically with Sanders' platform.
The rally began at the Downtown Berkeley BART station about 6 p.m., when participants stood on the sidewalk, wielding makeshift signs with “Feel the Bern” painted on them.
Soon after, a small contingent of Berkeley College Republicans approached and chanted, “Don't believe the B.S.,” standing face to face with dozens of rally participants. The Sanders supporters responded in defense of their candidate.
After 20 minutes, the Republican protesters remained behind as the group marched northbound on Shattuck Avenue toward the Cheese Board Collective. The activists drew support from passersby, with many nonparticipants voicing approval, cheering as they marched and honking their car horns in solidarity.
Others remained quiet on the sidewalks, such as Richard Wayne Willeford, a homeless man perched on the corner of Shattuck Avenue and Vine Street, as the supporters marched past him.
“I've never been ignored by so many people in one moment,” Willeford said with a chuckle.
Lorena Niculesa, a single mother and Romanian immigrant on the verge of homelessness, also watched on as they sat with their 1-year-old son, who was crying in their stroller.
“Even if Bernie wins, it won't change my situation,” Niculesa said.
But the rally participants in Berkeley see Sanders as the candidate who can change the minds of skeptics and bring actual change to the United States.
To Eric Schickler, a UC Berkeley professor of political science, it was not surprising that Sanders resonated with most of the Berkeley community. They said, though, that Sanders will have a tough fight ahead of them to win the nomination against Hillary Clinton, whom they called a logical choice.
Sanders, however, rose to prominence in the first place because they separated themselves from mainstream politics, according to Schickler.
“If they affect the discussion and they can build a movement that others can get behind, that'll be a success,” Schickler said.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UPI) -- A new poll finds that roughly a third of voters say they are "scared" of the prospect of either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton receiving their party's presidential nomination.
The poll, conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University and released Tuesday, showed 38 percent of likely voters said they were fearful if Trump won the Republican presidential nomination -- while 33 percent would feel the same if Clinton won the Democratic nod.
A Trump nomination scared 62 percent of surveyed Democrats, 17 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Independents. A Clinton nomination scared 60 percent of Republicans, 8 percent of Democrats and 35 percent of Independents.
By contrast, Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., wouldn't scare so many of those surveyed. Thirty one percent said they would be "satisfied" if Sanders won the Democratic nomination.
Broken down by party, 45 percent of Republicans are scared of a Sanders nomination, while 12 percent of Democrats and 28 percent of Independents share that feeling.
The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters between Feb. 11-15 and has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.
The old lie that was pushed by Feminists was that they wanted to “liberate” women and “empower” them so that they could pursue whatever they wanted to do. But as Feminism isn't about “equality,” it isn't about choice either; it is about destroying the status quo so as to allow some delusion of utopia to spontaneously pop-up.
Case in point:
Feminism isn't a choice between being stay-at-home mom or being a career woman. In both cases it is because of oppression!
Having a baby? Isn't “choice” supposed to be the holy grail of the Left? Nope, no matter what, you are being oppressed, because what woman would want to have a child when they could sacrifice their little bundle of joy clump of cells to Moloch?
Feminism's view of women can be summed up thusly: Where's my sammich?

37 years ago, Don Coscarelli unwittingly began a cult franchise with their guerilla style DIY supernatural film Phantasm. While the directorial reigns have been handed off to new director, but long-time series fan David Hartman, that guerilla style of filming still remains with this final entry. This low budget sequel concludes Reggie and company's journey, and marks one final on screen appearance by the charismatic Angus Scrimm as the series iconic villain The Tall Man. It's a bittersweet conclusion that is truly for die-hard fans of the series only.
After a very cute and clever recap of the series, the film picks up immediately where Phantasm IV: Oblivion left off, with Reggie alone and tattered in the desert. Still undeterred in their search for Mike, the film then confusingly thwarts Reggie from alternate reality to alternate reality. In one universe he's in a psychiatric ward suffering from dementia, and in another he's in a futuristic apocalypse that sees the world washed in red and The Tall Man's minions reigning over the world. In every iteration, Reggie fervently searches for Mike. As Reggie bounces between these realities, they remain just as confused as the viewer. Hartman initially approached Coscarelli about shooting a Phantasm short film, which then became a string of short films shot over time, until finally Coscarelli talked Hartman into putting it all together and completing the full feature to give fans closure. Perhaps this was Coscarelli's plan all along, but if not it would explain the hard-to-follow storyline.
While the film's narrative is fairly muddled, it does check off every box that die-hard fans would want in a Phantasm film. The Lady in Lavender makes a few creepy appearances, as does Reggie's trademark four-barrel shotgun, the Barracuda, and their ladies' man charm. While Angus Scrimm's appearances are limited, they're the highlight of the film. Though appearances by Mike and Jody are expected and realized, Ravager also includes some surprising cameos (watch through the credits) to reward fans. The film also ends with the typical open ending that would allude to the possibility of more sequels, but considering the sad truth that Scrimm is no longer with us, the series should really end here. Though Reggie is often perceived at the heartbeat of the series, there really is no Phantasm without The Tall Man.
Unfortunately, this marks a sequel that's overly reliant on CG, and the low budget shows. The cheap CG effects often take you out of the film, especially during segments that feature Reggie in the dystopian future. The red filtering over these scenes are more reminiscent of a cheap video game than a Phantasm film. Due to Angus Scrimm's declining health, most of The Tall Man's appearances in the film are CG renditions, as well.
For a film that's not so well put together and includes a nearly incoherent plot, the film only works at all if you have an attachment to these characters. If you've never seen a Phantasm film, skip this one. If you're only a mild fan, still skip this one. There are questions that remained unanswered, particularly questions from the previous installment, but those looking for emotional closure will find it here. It's a bittersweet conclusion to a beloved franchise.

US stock markets hit another all-time high on Friday.
The S&P 500 is nearing 2,600 and the Dow is over 23,300.
In fact, US stocks have only been more expensive two times since 1881.
According to Yale economist Robert Shiller's Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings (CAPE) ratio – which is the market price divided by ten years' average earnings – the S&P 500 is above 31. The last two times the market reached such a high valuation were just before the Great Depression in 1929 and the tech bubble in 1999-2000.
Some of the blame for high valuation goes to the so-called “FANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), whose average P/E is now around 130.
But there's something different about today's bull market…
Simply put, everything is going up at once.
Leading up to the tech bubble bursting, investors would dump defensive stocks (thereby pushing down their valuations) to buy high-flying tech stocks like Intel and Cisco – the result was a valuation dispersion.
The S&P cap-weighted index (which was influenced by the high valuations of the S&P's most expensive tech stocks) traded at 30.6 times earnings. The equal-weighted S&P index (which, as the name implies, weights each constituent stock equally, regardless of size) traded at 20.7 times.
Today, despite sky-high FANG valuations, the S&P market-cap weighted and equal-weighted indexes both trade at around 22 times earnings.
Thanks to the trillions of dollars printed by the Federal Reserve (and the popularity of passive investing, which we'll discuss in a moment), investors are buying everything.
In a recent report, investment bank Morgan Stanley wrote:
We say this not as hyperbole, but based on a quantitative perspective… Dispersions in valuations and growth rates are among the lowest in the last 40 years; stocks are at their most idiosyncratic since 2001.
So, ask yourself… With stocks trading at some of the highest levels in history, is now the time to be adding more equity risk?
Or, as billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman notes… “When securities prices are high, as they are today, the perception of risk is muted, but the risks to investors are quite elevated.”
Volatility – as measured by the Volatility Index (VIX) – remains below 10 (close to its lowest levels in history). For comparison, the VIX hit 89.53 in October 2008, as the market plunged.
We haven't seen a 3% down day since the election. And if that holds through the end of the year, it will be the longest streak in history.
And this false sense of security comes just as the main driver of this bull market – the trillions of dollars global central banks printed after the GFC – is coming to an end.
Markets saw around $500 billion of accommodation in 2016. And “quantitative tightening” should suck about $1 trillion out of the markets in 2018… That's a $1.5 trillion swing in two years. And it's a major headwind for today's already overvalued markets.
But that's just one issue. Remember, we also have…
Slowing global growth, record-high debt, potential nuclear war with North Korea, a rising world power in China, and cyberterrorism (just to name a few of the potential pitfalls) …
Still, investors continue to put money to work without a care in the world.
And more and more of that money is being invested with ZERO consideration of market valuation – thanks to the rise of passive investing.
Through July 2017, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took in a record $391 billion – surpassing 2016's record inflow of $390 billion.
According to Bank of America, 37% of the S&P 500 stocks are now managed passively.
Investors in these passive index funds and ETFs pay super-low fees in return for an automated investment process. For example, any money invested in a passively-managed S&P 500 ETF is equally distributed (based on market cap weighting) across the 500 S&P companies… So, companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon get the biggest share of that money.
The result… as this dumb money rushes in, the biggest stocks get even bigger – despite their already ludicrous valuations.
And the biggest players in this field are amassing a tremendous amount of power.
Vanguard, which introduced the world's first passive index fund for individuals in 1976, has $4.7 trillion in assets (around $3 trillion of that is passive).
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and owner of the iShares ETF franchise, is approaching $6 trillion in assets. And only 28% of BlackRock's assets are actively managed.
Passive funds owned by these two firms are taking in $3.5 billion a day.
Bank of America estimates Vanguard owns 6.8% of the S&P 500 (and stakes of more than 10% in over 80 S&P 500 stocks).
And as long as the money keeps flowing into passive funds, the bubble keeps expanding.
At a time of exceptional market risk, more and more money is being managed without any notion of risk.
But what happens when these uninformed and value-agnostic investors have to sell?
Humans are emotional creatures. And when we do finally see that 3% (or even larger) down day, investors will rush for the exits.
And the computers will pile on the selling (every model based on historically low volatility will completely break when volatility spikes).
But when the wave of selling comes, who will be there to buy?
As these passive funds dump the largest stocks in the world, we'll see an air pocket… nobody will be there to hit the bid.
And when the drop comes, it will come faster than anyone expects.
So, while most investors are ignoring risk, I'd advise you to use this record-high stock market to your advantage…
Sell some expensive stocks to raise cash. Own some gold. And allocate capital to sectors of the market that haven't been blown out of proportion thanks to the popularity of passive investing. That means looking at smaller stocks and stocks outside the US.
Even if stocks go up for another year, which they may, it's simply not worth the risk to chase them higher… Because the downturn will be devastating.
Ajax manager Frank de Boer has made contact with Tottenham Hotspur over becoming their new manager, according to ex-Netherlands team-mate Bolo Zenden.
De Boer is among the contenders to replace Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane, with Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino and Napoli manager Rafael Benitez the other possible candidates.
And according to Zenden – who played with De Boer for the Dutch national team – the ex-Barcelona defender has taken matters into their own hands over the vacant position at Tottenham.
When originally asked about Benitez's hopes of joining Tottenham, Zenden told talkSPORT: "He loves the English game, They love to manage their teams in England and it is just a sidestep to be back in Italy.
"He has won a cup [with Napoli] but I'm sure in the future they will be back in England. If that is going to be with Tottenham, I'm not sure.
"I've also heard that Frank de Boer has been in touch with the people at Tottenham. If that's going to happen who knows?"
Sherwood was dismissed a season into their 18-month deal at Spurs after guiding the club to sixth in the Premier League and into next season's Europa League. The former technical director in north London had originally replaced Andre Villas-Boas, who left in December.
Chairman Daniel Levy, who is searching for the 11th manager of their reign at Tottenham, has come under scrutiny for their refusal to give managers time, with Villas-Boas and Sherwood sacked last season merely months into their respective tenures.
Former Tottenham boss Glenn Hoddle says the club won't succeed until they give a manager time.
"It was always going to be a difficult one for Tim on an 18 month contract but Spurs have to look at long term getting some continuity otherwise they'll struggle," Hoddle told talkSPORT.
"Changing the manager so many times in a short period isn't going to be healthy or bring the success the fans want."
The head covering was taken off by police after they were arrested
The city of Long Beach, California, has reached an $85,000 settlement in a lawsuit initiated by a Muslim woman whose head covering, or hijab, was taken off by police after they were arrested.
The plaintiff, Kirsty Powell, was driving with their husband when police pulled them over, according to a news release from the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Powell, who had an outstanding warrant, was subsequently arrested.
“Mrs. Powell is a practicing Muslim American who was denied the right to wear their religion headwear, hijab, by the [Long Beach Police Department] and defendant officers while detained overnight at a police station,” said the 2016 complaint filed on behalf of Powell.
The complaint also said Powell's headscarf was “forcibly removed.”
CAIR said in a news release Thursday that the Long Beach City Council had voted in favor of the settlement earlier this week, which encompassed $85,000 in damages.
The Long Beach Police Department have since updated their guidances on head coverings being worn in custody, according to CAIR.
“In addition to compensating Kirsty for the humiliation and distress they suffered, this decision also prompted a city-wide policy change by the Long Beach Police Department to ban the practice of forcible removal of the hijab for female arrestees in custody,” attorney Marwa Rifahie said in a statement.
Alejandro Nava is leaving their home in Venezuela, and they don't plan on coming back.
Nava set their sights abroad because they have lost hope in their country, which is battling an economic crisis that has spiraled out of control, triggering a never ending list of chronic problems, from violent crime to basic health care.
Last year, their middle-class family lived without basics like eggs, milk and butter for weeks at a time, as the country struggled through a food shortage crisis. But that's not their biggest problem. Safety is.
"We live in constant fear of getting robbed and shot everyday," says Nava. "There's no sense of stability. You can't save money, you can't plan for the future."
Nava, 24, is moving to the U.S. where they recently received an immigrant visa. An associate lawyer and university professor in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Nava earns $50 a month. Skyrocketing inflation has decimated their salary. They hope to work as a paralegal while they apply to Ivy League law schools in the United States.

Nava is becoming part of a rising trend and it has grave implications for Venezuela's future.
Nearly 2 million Venezuelans have left the country since 1999 when a populist regime took over, according to Tomas Paez, a professor at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas and an expert on emigration. Venezuela has 30 million citizens.
But the pace is picking up fast. Last year, Paez's analysis found that about 200,000 Venezuelans had left. That's double the rate of 100,000 per year on average between 1999 and early 2015.
Other data support their findings. Venezuelans' asylum requests in the U.S. rose nearly 170% last year, according to Pew Research. And in Argentina, residency applications from Venezuelans shot up 120%. In Spain, the number of Venezuelan immigrants doubled in the last two years.

The tragic irony is that Venezuela -- a country rich in resources -- used to have a long history of welcoming immigrants. Now it's suffering from mass emigration. And Paez says that a lot of those deciding to leave are educated and skilled.
Venezuela's crisis has no end in sight. Massive food and medical shortages have crippled the country while violent crime means few can leave home after dark and kidnappings are common.
Last week, the Venezuelan Supreme Court seized power from the opposition-led legislature, a move that would essentially allow it to write its own laws. The decision was quickly reversed after severe public outcry.
Inflation is expected to rise 1,660% this year in Venezuela, according to the IMF. The country's currency, the bolivar, is worth less than one penny.
Nava recognizes he's fortunate to be able to go to the U.S. where be believes they can get a job. But many are going wherever they can as soon as possible.

Analiz Suarez had to leave behind their ill mother, Onelia, and move to Buenos Aires, Argentina. They live in a 7-person, 1-bathroom apartment with five Venezuelans and one Cuban. Suarez arrived last June after an unsuccessful attempt to get residency in Colombia.
A former journalist, Suarez, 37, works at a digital marketing company earning 14,000 pesos ($909) a month. It's a lot more than the nearly $100 a month they earned at the end of 2014 living in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, as hyper inflation erased them earnings.
But after taxes, rent, food and saving up for their mother's medical treatments and flight to move to Argentina, Suarez barely has enough to get by. She's trying to do more freelance work in graphic design and writing press releases for companies.

Suarez has slashed spending on everything. They cut their own hair now and stopped coloring it. They buy the absolute minimum amount of food. They watched only one movie in their first six months in Argentina. Friday nights are spent drinking cheap beers with other Venezuelans in their crammed apartments. Everyone chips in.
They tell themselves to not lose hope that things will get better.
"My friends don't live in my country, they all left," say Suarez. On the thought of potentially never going home: "You have to turn off a mental switch to make yourself strong and not fall into depression."
Diego Hernandez, 23, won't be going back either. They moved to the U.S., tried to get a university to accept them and sponsor their visa but couldn't, and eventually moved to Argentina too.
They arrived in August and lives with their older brother, who asked not to be named because they say they were once kidnapped in Venezuela.
Hernandez recently moved to a third apartment in eight months. The walls of the apartment are barren. It is located right next to a local commuter rail on the outskirts of an upscale neighborhood. Trains blare past every few minutes. Hernandez's mattress rests on the floor. The lone luxury is an old PlayStation the brothers stay entertained with.

Hernandez works at a clothing shop earning, 10,200 pesos ($662) a month. After living costs, they have the equivalent of $135 left over per month -- or under $5 a day. He's looking for a second job while they study at the University of Buenos Aires at night, hoping to become a nutritionist.
But they appreciate the little pleasures of life in Buenos Aires. Hernandez says they can take their cell phone out in public here without fear of being robbed or killed.
Their mom often calls them from Caracas, crying that their boy is gone and may not come back.
"It's really hard. I miss my mom, my family, my house, my customs, my favorite foods," says Hernandez. But: "If Venezuela doesn't change, we don't want to go back."
1. Hi this is Harry Brumleve, I'm at QCon San Francisco 2013, I'm with Jafar Husein from Netflix. Jafar could you tell us a little bit about yourself? Yes, I'm a tech lead at Netflix, I work across of all the UI Teams and I've about 12 years in the industry, I worked previously at the Microsoft and GE and I've got about 4-5 years under my belt building Functional Reactive Systems.
2. That is the subject of your talk here, could you tell us a little bit about that? Yes, here I'm talking about Functional Reactive Programming in JavaScript, I've been talking a little bit about contrasting the different approaches to Functional Reactive Programming in JavaScript and specifically I've been talking about the way we approach it at Netflix.
3. And so Netflix has a large investment in Reactive Systems, why are they important? Well they are important in Netflix because we scale and we really scale, at any time we are responsible about a third of US Broadband traffic, and so it's really important for our systems to be responsive. Now that is important on the backend, on the frontend we build UIs, all UI's are reactive and so we want to be able to turn around AB Tests as quickly as possible and so it's really important, we embrace a library that allows us to do that quickly despite the difficulty involved in building Reactive Systems in JavaScript today.
4. And so Netflix uses RX's one of those tools to achieve Reactive Systems, could you tell us a little bit about that? I was working at Microsoft about 4 years ago and I have the good fortune of running into Erik Mayer who is the father of the Reactive Extensions. At that time I was sort of struggling with a tough problem which was, we are doing Asynchronous Unit Testing for Silverlight which is UI Framework and one of the challenges involve with testing UI Frameworks is that there is asynchronous rendering ware so you can lay out widgets but you have to wait for the Asynchronous process to complete before you can really ensure that everything that work is correctly. So as a result to solve that problem we ended up putting a bunch of timing based approaches in to sort of make sure that we wait a sort amount of time and hopefully the rendering process to be complete and we check it. Now of course that introduce a bunch of false negatives and it was a real headache, and so what I really wanted to do was come up with something more reliable. Now we knew we could listen for events to figure out and know when that rendering layer had finished and then go in and test things.
The only problem was listening to all those events and registering call backs, turned our code in an absolute mess and so I was really searching for a better option and as I said I had a good fortune of running into Erik because at that time they were working on something absolutely revolutionary, a very revolutionary idea which was that events and asynchronous operations in general could be modeled these collections and I was absolutely floored because I was able to use sort of the operations that I already understood like Map, Filter and Reduce and that I learn from say things like SQL and I was able to apply them to event streams to build really, really clean declarative code. And so I was absolutely amazed but what it can do and I thought this will be great to build an entire system on. So fast forward a few years I'm now at Netflix and we've essentially rewritten most of our reactive code on many of our devices to use RX. We are also using on the server so we are actually doing an end to end reactive system, we are using across three different platforms and it's absolutely transformed the way we think about asynchronous programming and reactive programming at Netflix and the way we do it every day.
5. What is the model that RX uses in order to transport that data back and forth? RX asks a very interesting question which is: “What is the difference between a SQL query and a mouse drag event”. Now really if you think about both these things are Collections, the only difference is, and in both cases you've got a data producer giving a data consumer a piece of data a little bit by bit, right? The main difference is that in a SQL Query I'm pulling data as a producer from a consumer but in an event I'm pushing data, the producer is pushing data to the consumer. So it's really the same thing the data just travelling in a different direction and there are all sorts of interesting operations that we know how to do in SQL like, select where a Map and Filter if you will and it turns up that all of the operations can also be performed on events, so you can write very declarative code to control Concurrency and coordinate Asynchronous operations and essentially it has the same meaning whether you are working against an in-memory collection or an event, and that was the revolutionary idea that really transform the way that I thought about Asynchronous Programming and that is what we do, now that transforms a code that we write every single day.
6. And that sound like a pretty significant paradigm shift for a typical software developer to undertake, in order to use RX do I have to become a polyglot programmer? No, all languages that you really know are orthogonal. We use it across 4 different languages and several platforms but it's definitely a paradigm shift to think about asynchronous processes as Collections, but really I liken a process to sort of recovering from brain damage. I sort of been dealing with call backs for so many years, it was hard to make the transition but I think that if you are sort of introduce the idea of events as Collections from the very beginning you would down the process very easy. So in many ways is unlearning those bad habits that sort of leads you down a better path and that does take some time to get over. Once you get over there you can do absolutely amazing stuff, ninja stuff, now we've got a fantastic group of developers on the UI Team who can all write circles around me in terms of Asynchronous Programming, now that they've learned this stuff and they are using in everyday.
7. If I wanted to establish a Reactive System's practice on my team, how would I begin? There is really two key pieces: training and support. So one of the key pieces from us was making sure that we were able to introduce our developers to Reactive Programming in a really gradual way. It's difficult to give developers who are on tight deadlines, technology and just ask them to build the system. You've got to give them a great training program so they get up and speed quickly and you've also been there to support them, if they run into roadblocks and using the technology they are not sure about the right way to approach from a design perspective. So I've already have several years of Reactive Programming so I was able to be that point person until other members of the team sort of boots strapped up. Now there is a huge number of people at Netflix with competency both on the server side and on the client side with RX, and so now that scales much better. As far as training is concern, we actually build a set of online interactive exercises that are client developers and server developers could fill up in JavaScript.
Now what we actually do is we take them gradually through the process of using imperative constructs like Loops and If Statements to using Functional Programming construct over Arrays, so Map, Filter, Reduce, Merge, Zip, five functions, and after a while they learn how to build complex expressions and queries over arrays using those 5 functions and then we play a little trick on them, we flip the switch and we hand them this observable type that is really sort of like an event, an object is like an event, and all the same code that they've written that works over arrays, works over this observable and now it's sort of comes alive instead of just producing all the data, all the sudden you start to see data trickle in, instead of writing a query over a bunch of stock legacy historical stock information, they are actually writing a query over realtime stock data and they didn't even know it until they press the run button. That process of sort of taking them gradually from imperative to functional reactive has been really successful for us.

In the 1860s and 70s, photographer Timothy O'Sullivan created some of the best-known images in American History. After covering the U.S. Civil War, (many of their photos appear in this earlier series), O'Sullivan joined a number of expeditions organized by the federal government to help document the new frontiers in the American West. The teams were composed of soldiers, scientists, artists, and photographers, and tasked with discovering the best ways to take advantage of the region's untapped natural resources. O'Sullivan brought an amazing eye and work ethic, composing photographs that evoked the vastness of the West. They also documented the Native American population as well as the pioneers who were already altering the landscape. Above all, O'Sullivan captured—for the first time on film—the natural beauty of the American West in a way that would later influence Ansel Adams and thousands more photographers to come.

Caldwell County, TX — In January of last year, Larry Faulkenberry's 16-year-old son decided that they would play a trick on their dad for grounding him. So, they called the Caldwell County Sheriff's Department, and claimed their dad was drunk and waving a gun.
Deputies, responding to the call, arrived to find Faulkenberry entirely compliant, not drunk, and unarmed. They do not even own a gun.
These facts, however, were of no concern to the cops who arrived only to assault, injure, arrest, and lie about Faulkenberry attacking them.
“They yelled ‘sheriff's department.' What do you need? I put my hands up. ‘Turn around and walk backwards.' I'll stand here, you come here and put handcuffs on me,” Faulkenberry said.
“Why the fuck y'all here?” Faulkenberry recounted themselves saying. “Before I could finish the sentence, I got slammed to the ground.”
While on the ground, deputies rubbed their head into the gravel and punched Faulkenberry in the face, leaving their face covered in abrasions.
“They left me laying on the ground for about 15 minutes, face down,” they said.
The Caldwell County Sheriff's department is now facing a lawsuit after Faulkenberry's surveillance video proved the cops were lying when they claimed this innocent man attacked them and resisted arrest.
According to the police report, by Deputy Michael Taylor, Faulkenberry attacked the cops, and they were forced to beat them in an act of self-defense.
“I observed Lawrence Faulkenberry push Sergeant Yost with the left side of their body and elbow into a tree causing them to fall and injure their left shin and right knee cap. I observed Lawrence Faulkenberry to forcefully resist Deputies while attempting to lawfully detain them for officer safety. Deputies detained Lawrence Faulkenberry using the least amount of force necessary to gain compliance from Lawrence Faulkenberry.”
“If you watch the video, absolutely none of that occurred,” they said. “I never touched the guy. That was a complete fabrication.”
After spending ten days in jail on felony charges of assaulting an officer and resisting arrest, prosecutors finally got around to viewing the surveillance footage that proved their cops were lying thugs. After they had viewed the footage, all charges were dropped.
However, in spite of the video clearing Faulkenberry and proving the cops lied to set them up, not one of the three deputies involved has faced discipline.
Faulkenberry, who owns a motorcycle parts shop, was facing several years in prison. This innocent man could have been locked in a cage and deprived of freedom because of these lying cops, and yet they won't receive so much as a slap on the wrist.
“Without the video, I would be in prison. There is no doubt about that,” Faulkenberry said in an interview with Arstechnia.
Despite dropping the charges, the sheriff's department is sticking by their story. In response to Faulkenberry's lawsuit, the department issued the following statement.
Defendants specifically deny that they violated Plaintiff's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights or any other rights under the United States Constitution or the laws of the State of Texas. Specifically, Defendants deny that they used excessive force and unreasonable seizure, fabricated criminal charges, unreasonable search—warrantless search of property as alleged in paragraphs 29 through 32.
The video below illustrates two powerful points. The first point is that filming the cops saves lives. The second point is that cops will lie to protect themselves and care less about ruining the lives of innocent people in the process.
From the hysterical TV portrayals of goose-stepping North Korean troops, breathless news reports of North Korean warnings of war, and maps depicting the range of imminent missile launches (complete with retired U.S. generals explaining the targets), you might think there is a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. But there is no crisis, only a farce.
This time around, it is louder and more melodramatic. But we have seen time and again North Korea throwing a political tantrum in response to annual U.S.-ROK military exercises or the latest round of UN Security Council sanctions in response to Pyongyang testing a nuclear device or launching a missile.
The notion of a “crisis”—as in the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis—is nonsense. The world is not on the brink of an imminent nuclear confrontation. North Korean troops and artillery are not about to pour across the Demilitarized Zone.
This is all nothing more than political theater. Kim may be dangerous, but they are not crazy: North Korea is not suicidal. Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests are not really “provocations.” They are part of a systematic military program that North Korea has been working on for more than forty years to obtain nuclear and missile capabilities. Diplomatic concessions in the past have affected the timing and perhaps the amount of missile and nuclear tests. But they have gone and will continue to go forward because the North Koreans want to gain such weapons.
In the past, North Korean actions have been designed to create tensions in order to extract concessions. But the Obama administration and that of the new ROK President Park Geun-hye have made it clear that they have both seen that movie before and are not buying it.
So what is the point of it? The conventional wisdom to explain North Korea's actions is that this is primarily about a new twenty-nine-year-old trying to consolidate their position by demonstrating how tough and courageous they are to the North Korean military and political elite.
That may be part of the answer. But let me offer an explanation that has been noticeably absent in the sea of commentary on North Korea in recent weeks.
It's possible that the core reason North Korea's new leaders decided they needed to whip up a sense of crisis—of a nation under siege and facing impending attack from outside enemies—is because they are insecure and fear a fragile internal situation that is increasingly difficult to control.
Since the end of the Cold War (and Soviet aid) North Korea's economic system has steadily broken down. Since the great famine in 1995, there have been continual food shortages facing by some estimates up to one-third of North Korea's twenty-three million people.
The breakdown of Pyongyang's food-distribution system led the government to allow private markets and some private plots. There has been a bottom-up second economy taking shape. In recent years, markets have sprung up all over North Korea with a growing array of goods indulged by the regime as a coping mechanism. A fledgling merchant stratum has sprung up; it is occasionally harassed, but tolerated, and exists largely outside the government.
At the same time, despite efforts to keep the nation isolated, several factors—including economic trade and refugee flows to China, CDs and broadcasts from South Korea, and now some five million cellphones—have made its borders more porous and information flows more accessible. To the degree that North Koreans get a dose of reality about the outside world, the myths of a “socialist paradise” by which the regime misgoverns start to unravel. If the twenty-three million North Koreans realize the massive lies fed to them to sustain the world's only hereditary Stalinist dictatorship, it could gradually undo the regime.
This is not to argue that the masses are poised to revolt. That is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Pyongyang still runs a terror state with some two hundred thousand in labor camps, and those caught trying to flee the country are frequently executed. But the current situation may be viewed by the regime as discomforting and fragile, with its efforts to seal off the country from reality increasingly more than fraying at the edges.
At the onset of a new leader's tenure, how better to reassert tight control over its beleaguered citizens and whip up support for the regime than to instill fear and claim that the U.S. imperialists are on the verge of starting a nuclear war. This involved going to great lengths, including telling foreign embassies to evacuate Pyongyang and warning foreigners in South Korea to leave before the war starts. It's great theater, and about as real as Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of a Martian invasion.
If you have any doubt about what a contrivance, a pure farce—rather than a crisis—North Korea's antics are, how about this: North Korea has now invited athletes to a marathon and ten-day film festival in Pyongyang in mid-April.
That is an anticlimax hard to top. The administration has handled this tempest in a teapot well, with its military show of force sending a clear signal to the twenty-nine-year-old Kim that this is not a video game, and that Pyongyang should think twice before confronting the United States and its allies. So long as Kim wants their nuclear weapons, there is little room for problem-solving diplomacy.
Americans like to think that all problems have solutions. But the deep levels of distrust on both sides and an anachronistic regime trapped in its own myths leave little to seriously talk about. Pyongyang should recall that the Soviet Union had thirty thousand nuclear warheads, yet that didn't save it from collapsing from its own contradictions.

The Cubs officially added rehabbing slugger Kyle Schwarber to their World Series roster on Tuesday.
The team is expected to use Schwarber as a designated hitter in the first game of the series, according to MLB Network's Jon Morosi. The Cubs dropped lefthanded reliever Rob Zastryzny from their playoff roster to make room for Schwarber.
Schwarber, who missed nearly the entire season after tearing two ligaments in their knee on April 7, flew to Cleveland to join the team after playing in an Arizona Fall League game on Monday. Manager Joe Maddon said on Monday the decision to add Schwarber to the roster would be based on their performance in that game.
Chicago will need someone to DH in the first two games of the series. Among the current candidates are rookie Willson Contreras and outfielder Jorge Soler, who has struggled this postseason.
• Quiz: What was the world like the last time the Cubs won the World Series?
“We're not ruling anything out or anything in at this point, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves, either,” president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said on Monday, in regard to Schwarber's possible return.
Schwarber went 0 for 3 with a walk on Saturday night while DHing in the Arizona Fall League. Game 1 of the World Series will take place on Tuesday night in Cleveland.
The Indians added starting pitcher Danny Salazar to their World Series roster and left off Cody Anderson.

Lower ceiling than the other top quarterback prospects
Leadership was questioned, but doesn't appear to be true
Does Connor Cook fit with the Denver Broncos?
I could see it happening.
The Broncos need a quarterback and Connor Cook might be the most realistic option for the Broncos. Wentz and Goff will likely be off the board by the end of the top 10, and Paxton Lynch probably doesn't make it to the mid-20's, so that probably leabes Connor Cook the best quarterback available for the Broncos in the first round.
Cook would fit into Kubiak's offensive system rather well.  They are already familiar with the pro-style aspects so that could be them day one ready. They have the athleticism to be effective on the bootlegs/roll outs, and while they don't have the strongest arm, they have a strong enough one to make all the throws asked of him.
I do not see them having the high ceiling as a Carson Wentz or Paxton Lynch have, but they could turn into a capable "game manager" who may turn into a good but not great NFL starter.
This might be a lazy comparison, but I compare them to two former Michigan State quarterbacks. Those two being Brian Hoyer and Kirk Cousins. All three have different strengths and weaknesses, but all three came from the same offense and both have the same upside. A game manager who could turn into a good but not great NFL starter. It is a lazy comparsion, but I like it.
I personally wouldn't love or really hate drafting Cook in the first round. I think the Broncos have enough talent on the team to be successful with Cook under center but I do not view them as the next Broncos Franchise quarterback. Just a guy who will do well enough to keep their job but will have fans looking for an upgrade four or five years down the road.
The early cancer screening startup Grail plans to raise more than $1 billion in Series B financing, possibly up to $1.8 billion.
While the company doesn't want to name investor names, only mentioning in a release the funding will come “primarily from undisclosed private and strategic investors,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google Ventures, Arch Venture Partners and Silicon Valley private equity firm Sutter Hill Ventures all previously invested.
The company also comes from strong stock. Grail spun out of the genetic sequencing giant Illumina to develop its blood-based cancer testing service and Illumina said today in a release the startup would be working with Goldman Sachs to help shepherd the round for a “contemplated” additional financing.
Grail leverages Illumina's gene sequencing tech to potentially spot any kind of cancer in the body before symptoms appear.
While this type of technology isn't necessarily new, it has never been used in early-stage detection and Grail will need the cash to continue development of its testing, particularly for the previously announced Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study slated to analyze at least 7,000 cancer patients and compare them to 3,000 healthy individuals, as well as other large-scale clinical trials — one possibly involving half a million people based in the U.K.
Most biotech startups need more cash in earlier stages to make any kind of headway — Grail raised a whopping $100 million for its Series A. But a billion-dollar (or two) raise gives the startup an avalanche of money to work with and would put it far ahead of many other companies in the space.
Illumina plans to give Grail more independence, as well, with the raise, eventually owning less than 20 percent of the company, and withdrawing members from Grail's board of directors. The gene sequencing company also said it believes Grail is set to become one of its largest customers over time, both by providing royalties on future testing and through Illumina's appreciation in ownership.
“We are honored to have world-class investors who support our goal of reducing global cancer mortality through early detection — especially the invaluable support we received from Illumina during our start-up phase — and we look forward to the next phase of our growth,” Grail CEO and former Google executive Jeff Huber said.

NEW YORK - On-demand apps make life easier: A few taps on my phone and I can get a cab in minutes or groceries delivered to my door.
The hard part? Figuring how much -- or if -- I should tip the people who drive me around or pick out my cheese at the supermarket.
Stocks are for losers, Donald Trump suggests, and other MoneyWatch headlines
Part of the confusion arises from the companies themselves. Some don't allow tipping through their apps, even though they say tipping is allowed. And the policies posted on their websites can be unclear.
Just like other service professionals, we should tip these types of workers, says Sharon Schweitzer, etiquette consultant and founder of Protocol & Etiquette Worldwide. Many of them have to reach into their own pockets to pay for gas, bike repairs or other costs, and a tip can help them make ends meet, Schweitzer says.
"The apps are designed for us to evolve to a cashless society," they say, "however that doesn't mean we become heartless in the process."
Indeed, cash is best if you have it. Some companies, like FreshDirect, will deduct processing fees that credit card companies charge before paying the driver, so they won't get the full amount of your tip.

Ten people, including a child, were killed when a commercial plane crashed in Colombia's Amazon rainforest, officials have said.
Search teams on Sunday recovered three bodies from the wreckage of the plane, the AFP news agency reported Gustavo Ortega, a Colombian rescue official, as saying.
All of those on board - eight passengers and two crew - were believed to have died when the plane crashed on Saturday, they said.
The aircraft with the registration number HK-4755 PA 34 Navajo took off from Araracuara Airport in the country's south at about 3pm local time on Saturday.
It lost contact with air traffic control as it went over the town of Florencia, AFP reported.
The wreckage of the plane was found 10km from the centre of the town of Puerto Santander in the east of the country.
The cause of the accident was under investigation.
One man who was supposed to have boarded the flight, Silvio Rojas, told the Colombian radio station RCN radio the plane appeared to suffer engine failure shortly after take-off. "There was a lot of smoke from the left engine," they said.
Last week was one heck of a crazy exciting time for comic fans as Comic-Con International: San Diego 2013 rocked our faces off with awesome panels, surprise announcements and special screenings of upcoming films—including DC Entertainment's own Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox!
The latest in the line of DC Universe Animated Original Movies and set for Blu-Ray and DVD release on July 30, the film adapts the best-selling “Flashpoint” crossover event that led to DC Comics—The New 52, which restarted the entire DC Comics line with all-new #1 issues.
We checked out the film and to say it blasted past expectations at super-speed is a bit of an understatement. So hold on to your butts because we're going to give you the 5.2 Reasons to Observe The Flashpoint Paradox!
1. The Voice Cast
Along with DC newcomers like Justin Chambers, C. Thomas Howell, Kevin McKidd, and the always awesome Michael B. Jordan (Clear Eyes, Full Hearts!), the film brings in a number of veterans from both the classic DCAU and more recent films, including the legendary Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany, Nathan Fillion, Cary Elwes, and Ron Perlman. However, the coolest bit of casting comes from Sam Daly, the son of actor Tim Daly who voiced Superman in the Animated Series for years. It's a nice little legacy-style nod that fits perfectly with the DCU.
2. Cameos like Whoa
There are a TON of cameos in this film made by heroes and villains from across the DC Universe—from Clayface, Shade and Steve Trevor to Tempest, Tula and Aqualad. It's pretty awesome and makes you want to watch it again to make sure you didn't miss anyone.
3. Action, Lots of Violent Awesome Action
Man, when they say PG-13, they mean it for this one. This is a pretty mature animated film and the violence level here is higher than it's probably ever been. However, it all serves a purpose—showing how dark and twisted the world of these characters has become. The darkness of this world makes the Flash's struggle to bring back their own world that much more important. That said though, the action that comes with some of that violence is undeniably breathtaking. There are some GREAT fights in this film, including...
4. Wonder Woman versus Captain Thunder
You really only get to see bits and pieces of this epic battle (which actually makes it that much more thrilling) but the moment Wonder Woman ends up in a room with the Shazam Kids and they say the magic word, you can't help but feel a tingle of excitement at just the prospect of these two heavyweights throwing down. And while this goes on, we simultaneously get the best fight of the film, which I'll get to in my next point.
5. The Flash versus Reverse-Flash
We're not going to say much about this beyond this is the Flash fight you've been waiting for. Heck, this is the Flash film you've been waiting for. Just try and imagine a Dragon Ball Z battle but in which you can actually see what's going on. It's incredible.
5.1 Flashpoint Aquaman
Just... just watch and you'll see what we mean. Dude's hardcore to the extreme.
5.2 Batman
Because in every reality, Batman is awesome
Also, consider this a bonus point, but you're going to want to watch this one through the credits. Just…trust us on that one. Let us know what you think about Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox in the comments below!

An international study has found that having a high status job means that you are less likely to respond to standard treatment with medications for depression. These results, which may have implications for clinicians and their patients, employers and public policy, are presented at the ECNP Congress in Vienna*.
Up to a third of patients who receive drug treat for depression do not respond to treatment. Knowing which groups don't respond could help clinicians understand which treatments are appropriate to which person. In the case of workers, it may also enable employers to take steps to ease stressful conditions. Although there is a wealth of research showing that low social and economic status is associated with a greater risk of depression, there has been little work focusing on how occupational levels respond to treatment.
A group of international researchers from Belgium, Italy, Israel and Austria enlisted 654 working adults attending clinics for depression, and classified their work according to occupational level. 336 (51.4%) held high occupational level jobs, 161 (24.6%) middle-level, and 157 (24%) low level. Around two-thirds of the patients were female (65.6%), which reflects the normal gender difference in reported depression. Most patients were treated with SRIs (Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), although other pharmaceutical agents were also used, as well as psychotherapy. Those in the higher levels were found to have received fewer SRIs and more psychotherapy.
On analysing results after treatment, they found that 55.9% in the highest occupational group were resistant to treatment. In contrast, only 40.2% of the middle-level workers remained treatment resistant, and 44.3 of the low-level workers. This difference was also reflected in the degree of remission, with only around one in 6 in remission in the higher status group, as against around one in 4 for the other groups.
Commenting, Professor Siegfried Kasper (Vienna, Austria) said "Though these findings should be considered preliminarily, they indicate that high occupational levels may be a risk factor for poor response to treatment. A number of variables may explain these findings. For example, there may be specific working environment demands and stressors; people may find it difficult to accept or cope with illness, or to continue with medication; or there may be other factors, related for example to cognitive, personality and behavioural differences".
Co-worker Professor Joseph Zohar (ECNP Past-President, Tel-Hashomer, Israel) said; "This shows that the need for precise prescribing is not only related to the symptoms and genetics but also to occupational level; one might need to prescribe different medication for the same disorder and need to take into account the occupational level in order to reach optimum effect".
Professor Eduard Vieta (ECNP Executive Committee member and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona), commented: "The results of this study might sound counterintuitive, but people with highly demanding jobs are subject to a lot of stress, and when they break down with depression it may be particularly difficult to cope with their previous life. An alternative explanation, which cannot be ruled out given the naturalistic design of the study, is that high-status job patients may be more prone to request psychosocial treatments without the support of pharmacotherapy. The ideal treatment of depression is, in general, the combination of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."
*A paper based on this work is published in European Neuropsychopharmacology, July 2016 - High occupational level is associated with poor response to treatment of depression.
The research was funded by the Expert Platform on Mental Health focus on Depression (EPD).
Arkansas Captures 10th Straight SEC Crown
Complete Results (PDF)
COLUMBIA, S.C. – Only one SEC program has won a conference title since the 2014 SEC Outdoor Championship. Entering Saturday with a 43-point lead, the No. 5 Arkansas women's track and field team made sure it remained that one program, as it cruised to its 10th consecutive league title and third straight SEC Triple Crown at the 2017 SEC Outdoor Championships held at Cregger Track Saturday.
On the heels of a 65-point performance on Friday that included two first place finishers, the Razorbacks backed that up with 55 points and two more gold medalists for their fourth straight SEC outdoor title. Arkansas' total of 128 points was good for a 28-point victory over second-place LSU.
“To win an SEC title – and I think any program in any sport would agree – you better cherish the moment,” said head coach Lance Harter following their 31st SEC title at Arkansas. “We have been on a roll thanks to great leadership from upperclassmen and youngsters that are willing to learn and follow the example. Our comradery has become a culture and I hope it continues.”
With the win, Arkansas became the first SEC program to four-peat at the outdoor championships since LSU did so from 1987-91.
“Anytime you can compare that type of history with what you just accomplished it's special,” Harter said. “Those are things I used to read about in track and field magazines and think to myself ‘if we can ever be that good.' Now we are living it. It makes me appreciate the kids we have in our program.”
Junior Nikki Hiltz was the first of two Razorbacks to take the top spot on the podium Saturday, as they posted a time of 4:17.94 in the 1500 meters to become the eighth Razorback in program history to win the event. An eighth-place finisher in the event a year ago, Hiltz's win added 10 points to the 19-point effort put forth by the 1500-meter crew. Senior Therese Haiss joined Hiltz during the medal presentation thanks to their third place finish in 4:19.29. Competing in their first SEC Outdoor Championship, first-year student Carina Viljoen add the final three points in sixth.
Entering the weekend as the favorite in the 400 meters, senior Daina Harper proved in the preliminaries on Friday night that they were indeed the favorite by posting the top qualifying spot. Harper didn't disappoint in their return to the 400 Saturday afternoon, continuing Arkansas' dominance in the event by taking the gold and the SEC indoor and outdoor season sweep in the event. Harpers' win marked the fifth time in the last six years a Razorback has won the SEC outdoor 400 meters. Harper's 400 win was part of a 15-point day, which also included points in the 4×100-meter relay and 4×400-meter relay.
Already with eight points in the heptathlon and two more as a member of the 4×100-meter relay team, junior Payton Stumbaugh brought their total to 14 with a fifth place showing in the 100-meter hurdles. One of just a few to compete all three days, Stumbaugh posted a 13.30 in the 100 hurdles to close out their weekend.
Just over an hour after winning the 1500 meters, Hiltz returned to score five more points for their team with fourth place in the 800 meters (2:06.09). The near double all-conference performance capped their 15-point day.
“One of the things we ask and challenge the kids with is how they can help the team,” said Harter. “How can they contribute to the team effort? Whether is a great performance or your bouncing back from a disappointing one to cheer on your teammate, how can you help? All of it matters when you want to win a championship and over the last three days everyone helped the team.”

So far, Oklahoma has done the best job of recruiting the Dallas area for the Class of 2017 in football. OU has received commitments from five local players, and they're all four-star recruits, according to 247Sports.com.
McKinney Boyd offensive lineman Tyrese Robinson is OU's top recruit in the 247Sports national rankings, coming in at No. 74.  They are the fifth-ranked recruit from the Dallas area.
Oklahoma's other four-star recruits are Mesquite Horn quarterback Chris Robison, Southlake Carroll defensive back Robert Barnes, Waxahachie wide receiver Jalen Reagor and Cedar Hill wide receiver Charleston Rambo.
OU has the same number of Dallas-area recruits as Texas (two), Texas A&M (two) and TCU (one) combined, and all of UT's and A&M's local pledges are three-star recruits, according to 247Sports. DeSoto quarterback Shawn Robinson, a four-star recruit, is the only local player to commit to TCU.
Texas Tech has also received commitments from five Dallas-area players, with Frisco offensive lineman Jack Anderson -- ranked No. 3 in the area and No. 47 nationally -- the only four-star recruit. Tech has four pledges who are three-star recruits: Frisco offensive lineman Dawson Deaton, Arlington Oakridge wide receiver Bronson Boyd, Plano East offensive lineman Casey Verhulst and Birdville offensive lineman Jared Hocker.
Three of the area's top four recruits are uncommitted. South Grand Prairie defensive back Jeffrey Okudah is No. 1 in the area and No. 5 nationally, Kennedale linebacker Baron Browning is No. 2 locally and No. 8 nationally, and Plano East linebacker Anthony Hines is No. 4 in the area and No. 72 on the national list.
Here are other colleges that have recruited well locally:
Iowa: Has received commitments from Wylie East running back Eno Benjamin (four-star), Flower Mound Marcus defensive back Matt Hankins (three-star) and Justin Northwest wide receiver Gavin Holmes (three-star).
Kansas: Four local players with a three-star rating have committed to Kansas -- Frisco Independence running back Dominic Williams, Mesquite Horn wide receiver Reggie Roberson, Arlington Lamar linebacker Kyron Johnson and McKinney defensive back Akayleb Evans.
SMU: It has five committed players from the Dallas area, but Keller Timber Creek offensive lineman Alan Ali (three-star) and Lancaster defensive lineman Noah Jones (three-star) are the only players rated higher than two stars.
Colorado: Three players with three-star rankings have committed: DeSoto wide receiver Laviska Shenault, Cedar Hill wide receiver Jaylon Jackson and Denton athlete Chris Miller.
Oklahoma State: It has a trio of three-star pledges: Forney linebacker Brendan Vaughn, Keller defensive lineman Spencer Misko and Dallas Christian defensive back Kris McCune.

Trivia: See if you can spot the Jetman reference in this episode!
Here we are at last. It's been 6 months since we started this show, yet it feels like only yesterday. For that very first release, I posted a picture of the book that opens up before the opening of every episode. Now here I am, posting the final page from that book. The last chapter from the fantasy story that is Zyuranger.
Zyuranger was my very first Sentai and it's always held a special place in my heart. To be able to fansub it and share it with other people has been nothing short of amazing. Before we started this project, people didn't hold Zyuranger in very high regards. I'd see blog posts, and forum posts, and 4chan threads about how bad Zyuranger supposedly was. When we started off, it felt like we were the only 3 who really loved this show. Of course we weren't, and those opinions will never die, but since we've started this project I've seen a lot of praise for Zyuranger and that just makes me smile. It was a lot of fun releasing this every week. I loved reading people's responses to the show. Every Monday, I'd get a little bit anxious until Lynxara handed me the script, and not once did I grow tired of it. It never felt like a chore that I had to do. It was fun the whole way through, and a total labor of love from all of us.
Now, I'd like to thank all the great people at GUIS for letting us do this show under their name, and being total bros. BunnyHat, thank you for the raws, they're beautiful. Of course, I have to mention Kou and Lynxara. Without them, Zyuranger would still be unsubbed. Lynxara thinks I give them more credit than they deserve, but they really held this project together and was a great person to bounce ideas off of. Lynx, you were always there to answer my questions no matter how stupid they were. You were also the one who first asked me to to work on this project, and for that you get my eternal thanks. Kou, you're an amazing translator, and one of the best I've ever seen. You have an amazing way with words and everything in your scripts felt just right. I'm extremely grateful that you decided to do Zyuranger, and I'm still amazed at how fast you could translate an episode. Someone on /m/ said that “I feel as if it was totally worth the wait”, and I think that's totally because of your amazing translation. You two were a pure joy to work with. Here's to the future!
And, of course, I have to thank the people who watched this show. Every single one of you out there who decided to give this show a chance. If it was your first Sentai then, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did and I hope you check out the other shows as well. If you're a long time fan, I hope you enjoyed it just as much. I've always thought that Zyuranger was a very special show, and I hope you all did too. If you're one of the people who watched this show, even for just a few episodes, and didn't like it, thank you. At least you gave it a shot, and that's all that matters. To the people who are about to watch it, you're in for a fun ride and I hope you enjoy where it takes you. For 49 release posts I've used this space to share my thoughts and opinions on the show. I think now it's time to let Kou and Lynxara share their thoughts as well.
Lynxara:
So I'd like to say that I got involved with the Zyuranger project because it was a favorite series of mine, but that's not the case. I first saw Zyuranger years ago, untranslated. When episodes circulated on VHS, it wasn't unusual for fans to put “key episodes” of a given show all on one tape. In the case of Zyuranger, there was a tape that did the rounds with a bunch of the major Dragonranger episodes on it.
Some shows are easy to enjoy even without translation. Zyuranger wasn't one of them. Watching the Burai saga out of context and with episodes skipped left me with a very “That's it?” impression of the show. I proceeded to spend years thinking it must be mediocre or bad. When I got involved in the subbing project, it was mainly because I saw an opportunity to help out my various friends and get the project finished in a more timely fashion.
Now that I've seen every episode of Zyuranger in well-translated form, I feel comfortable saying that my younger self was pretty stupid. Zyuranger is good Sentai. It's one of the few shows where sitting down and watching every episode, from the crazy filler to the weighty plot arcs, absolutely pays off. I'm glad this show was made and I'm even gladder that it's now available for people to see as it was meant to be seen.
Kou:
All I can say is that it's been my absolute pleasure for the last nine months to be able to work to give an English voice to the always heartfelt, clever, and occasionally mind-blowingly surreal scripts of Sugimura Noboru and their staff of writers. Many thanks to MegaAnon for taking on the release and heading off my more ill-advised translation decisions, to Lynxara for playing agent, advisor, and editor, and to the guys at GUIS for promoting and distributing the release.
While tonight marks the end of one journey, there is still a lot of toku to be translated and not a one of us plans to stop with this. I hope you'll keep an eye out here and in the other usual places, because 2012 is almost done and 2013 is gonna be one amazing year.
The Toronto Argonauts made the absolute right choice in hiring Jim Popp and Marc Trestman as their new general manager and head coach, respectively. The track record of those two individually, and more importantly together, speaks for itself.
Expectations are understandably high in Toronto, but I think they should be tempered slightly in the immediacy.
Looking long term
Look, I know many Argos fans are over the moon by the hirings of Popp and Trestman and I'm not saying there shouldn't be a ton of excitement. Instead, I'm just looking at things realistically. While I don't think it's impossible we could see a dramatic turnaround in year one, I also don't think it's imperative. These were not short-term hires, so instant gratification shouldn't be the be all and end all.
Upon joining Popp in Montreal for the 2008 season, Trestman had immediate results. The Alouettes went to three straight Grey Cups, winning twice, and Trestman cemented themselves as one of football's elite coaches. The thing is, instant gratification like that is not the norm and the circumstances for the Popp-Trestman duo are much different this time.
First of all, Toronto hired both guys very late in the off-season. While the Argos had a temporary management staff in place, Popp missed out on the most important days of free agency and wasn't able to add potential impact pieces to fit their vision. While there's still plenty of time to make trades and prepare for the draft, Popp won't fully be able to start shaping the Argos in their vision until the 2017 campaign is in the books.
The biggest challenges presented for Trestman with their late hire is filling out their coaching staff. Because it's so late in the process, putting together the ideal staff is going to be tough because many candidates will have already committed elsewhere for the coming season. From an X's and O's perspective, I don't foresee any issues for Trestman but, again, they might have to wait until the end of 2017 to have their desired coaching group assembled.
The other big difference this time around is the caliber of team Popp and Trestman are taking over. When the latter became Montreal's head coach in 2008, they inherited an elite group that had gone to the Grey Cup in five of the previous nine seasons and finished first in the division six times during that stretch. Anthony Calvillo and Ben Cahoon were established big time threats and the Als boasted one of the best offensive lines in the league. Things are a little different in Toronto.
The Argos finished 2016 with seven straight losses and won just once in their final 12 games. Furthermore, they traded away their eventual first overall pick for quarterback Drew Willy, who won't even start the season at the top of the depth chart. Receivers Kenny Shaw and Diontae Spencer are gone now, too, and this looks like a longer-term project to fix.
I'm not saying we won't see a modest performance boost in 2017 with Popp and Trestman incoming. For instance, I absolutely am expecting a Ricky Ray renaissance under Trestman knowing how good the latter worked with Calvillo. Furthermore, I think Popp will have enough time to make some subtle personnel upgrades to make the team better than it was last season.
What I'm not expecting is a dramatic reversal that sees the Argos looking like Grey Cup threats come September. Never say never, but when taking all the circumstances into account, I just don't think a turnaround like that is in the cards. That's okay, though; Popp and Trestman weren't brought in solely for 2017. This duo was brought in to build the Argos into long term contenders and I'm pretty confident that'll happen, even if the team has some growing pains.
Secret weapon?
When reading S.J. Green's comments earlier this week, it really got me thinking about how much promise there is in Montreal for the coming season. Green told MontrealAlouettes.com they plan on being ready for training camp in May after undergoing season-ending knee surgery after Week 2 of the 2016 campaign.
“This has been the most invigorating off-season I've had in a long time,” Green said. “I've been building myself back up from ground zero.”
Those are pretty scary words coming from one of the league's most physical players and a four-time 1,000-yard receiver. The scariest part, for me anyway, is how much the return of Green for this year has flown under the radar.
You can understand why the return of Green might not be at the forefront, too. Not only was they injured for the vast majority of last season, but the Als have been extremely busy since the season came to an end.
Think about all they've done in the off-season. They said goodbye to Popp and replaced them with Kavis Reed and then quickly went out and acquired quarterback Darian Durant from the Riders. Additionally, Nik Lewis signed on for two more years before Montreal went out and made a big splash by signing fellow receiver and defending East Division MOP Ernest Jackson in free agency. There's been a lot to talk about around the Alouettes over the last few months.
It's a pretty exciting time in Montreal and this offence should be fun to watch in 2017.
Durant joins the team coming off a really nice final season in Saskatchewan and will immediately have three really nice targets to spread the ball to. Lewis remains one of the league's most reliable receivers over the middle and continues to be money on second down. Jackson joins the team with game-breaking ability following two stellar seasons in Ottawa.
And then there's Green, who says he's as motivated as ever coming off a disappointing and all-too-short 2016. When healthy, Green is as physically dominant a receiver you're going to see in this league and has the ability to open things up elsewhere because of the attention they command. Getting a guy like that back is pretty good anytime; it just so happens he's flown a little under the radar this off-season.
Filling the void
Henry Burris's retirement will definitely leave a void both on and off the field for the Ottawa REDBLACKS. They were instrumental in leading them to a Grey Cup title in November and was a commanding, respected voice in the locker room. Now in well-deserved retirement, Burris's absence will leave a hole, but I think the REDBLACKS are very well equipped to fill it.
That's not to say Burris is replaceable, because he's not. Instead, I just think Ottawa is in a really good spot to move on from the loss like that, specifically on the field. With Trevor Harris, and now Drew Tate, I still think the REDBLACKS are poised to be big time contenders in 2017.
Let's not forget how strong a season Harris was having before being injured and then hitting the skids for a bit. The luxury of having two quarterbacks like Harris and Burris in the fold is the ability to make a quick pivot and ride the hot hand. On most teams, though, Harris doesn't get supplanted, because on most teams, he's a number one quarterback, no questions asked.
Now, Harris enters the season without competition from a legendary veteran. 2016 saw Harris play on a team with Burris while Ricky Ray was their teammate in Toronto the year prior. Harris is the guy now for Ottawa, though, and everything he's shown in their CFL career suggests he'll be able to get the job done.
I also liked the decision the REDBLACKS made to acquire Drew Tate from Calgary a couple weeks ago. While injuries and some guy named Bo Levi Mitchell have prevented Tate from becoming a regular CFL starter, we've always known they have the ability to succeed.
At 32, and having been a clear backup for the last three seasons, I don't think Tate is an ideal starter at this point in their career. However, in a backup spot, I think Tate is a nice fit in Ottawa. They can execute short yardage plays well, they are accurate and. most importantly, is a really strong teammate.
Losing Burris, especially after the way 2016 concluded, is bittersweet for the REDBLACKS. But the team has done a nice job preparing for their exit and I think they're set up very nicely for the coming season at quarterback. As such, I think Ottawa enters the season as East Division contenders once again.
Yes, affordability is a huge barrier to accessibility and artists. Everyone says in 3-5 years it will be much more affordable...
Unfortunately, I think the access-to-equipment problem is way beyond our power as artists to address? Like, artists can barely even survive ourselves, how do we understand and critique and reform a global electronics industry? (We can also share and loan VR kit to each other, but you'd have to live in a city for that.)
Right now, the VR industry's "hack" to "driving innovation in content" is to give VR headsets out. Both Valve and Oculus are surprisingly very forthcoming with VR kits. I encourage anyone thinking about getting into VR to contact them and plead your case. Hopefully, someday we won't have to plead, but again, VR culture is already slipping toward a point of no return.
That said, getting a VR kit doesn't guarantee you anything. You'd still be forced to participate in the VR industry. If you were already a poor starving artist with no time or resources to make art within a hostile consumer media culture, then you'll just be in exactly the same place... now with a VR headset?
India struggles to survive for a week now after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's snap decision to withdraw large denomination notes. The raging debate over this demonetisation has pushed out several other extremely critical issues out of the stoplight, particularly Modi's visit to Tokyo, where they signed a landmark civil nuclear energy agreement with Japan on November 11 that was six years in the making. The agreement is supposed to pave the way for Japan to supply nuclear reactors, fuel and technology to India for civilian use.
In spite of strong opposition from the anti-nuclear activists, Japanese government went ahead with the agreement partly to provide lifeline to its sinking nuclear power industry, which has taken a serous hit by the Fukushima accident in 2011.
The sharp decline in the price of the fossil fuel has also brought a serious rethinking globally over building of new nuclear power plants. Going against the international trend, India has a grand plan to build 55 reactors. It is another matter to find the sites for these reactors after Kudankulam experience.
Japan, the only country in the world to experience the fury of the atomic bombs during World War II, has a strong domestic anti-nuclear constituency. So, Narendra Modi's friend Shinzo Abe was caught in a bind over the signing of this civil nuclear energy agreement for the first time with a country like India, which is a non-signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
To Japanese negotiators, India's signing of similar deals with the United States, Canada, France and Australia was not good enough.
So, Narendra Modi going against the long established nuclear policy of India gave in to the Japanese demand to link nuclear testing with the termination of civilian nuclear agreement.
India provided a separate "note on views and understanding" for this to Japan immediately after signing the agreement. In the past, India had not accepted the demands from other countries with which it had signed agreements before of having any direct reference to nuclear tests as the reason for terminating the agreement.

This unusual exception to Japan raises a series of challenges for India's long-established nuclear policy. India is not any more voluntarily but legally committed to unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
Moreover, many other countries, those who have signed civil nuclear agreements with India before will come under pressure from their own domestic constituencies to renegotiate past nuclear agreements to link them to nuclear testing.
However, Modi's official delegation after returning back to India in order to cover up their capitulation argues that the additional note has no legal binding. Japanese officials have come out clearly against India's assertion about the legality of the additional note and confirmed that if moratorium in nuclear test is violated, the agreement will be terminated.
Furthermore, a day before the agreement with Japan, Modi's motormouth defence minister Manohar Parrikar had publicly questioned India's No First Use (NFU) policy on nuclear weapons.
India's NFU policy is the moral cover of its nuclear doctrine, which means that India commits itself to be not the first one to use nuclear weapons against its adversary in an armed conflict.
Ministry of defence was forced to issue a statement to explain this highly irresponsible remark of its minister, "What defence minister Parrikar said was their personal opinion and not official position."
However, it is not that simple for the rest of the world to ignore the opinion of India's defense minister, whether it was officially official or not.
If Modi government decides to rescind from India's commitment to NFU policy, as the BJP had hinted in its 2014 election manifesto, will also provide the reason for Japan to withdraw from the civil nuclear agreement. As per the additional note, this policy change can be interpreted by Japan as a "serious departure from the prevailing situation".
Japanese Parliament Diet has to ratify this civil nuclear agreement and India's shifting position has brought serious doubts over its possibility. Whether Japanese Diet ratifies the agreement or not, India's flip-flop over its commitment to moratorium to nuclear test and NFU policy shows the reckless nature of Modi regime's approach to India's long-standing nuclear doctrine.
India's nuclear doctrine is the most critical component of security and stability in the subcontinent. It is generally considered to be moderate in ambition and dependable on execution, while maintaining a deliberate strategic ambiguity. At the same time, it is not a signatory to the nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Any sign of tampering the nuclear policy of the country can be not only a cause for concern for the region but also for the world. The unnecessary controversy caused over the civil nuclear energy agreement and the additional note with Japan due to Narendra Modi's diplomatic naivety has again refocused global attention on India's refusal to sign the NPT.
China has been using this NPT issue to keep India out of being the part of the prestigious Nuclear Supply Group (NSG). Japan and India have signed the civil nuclear deal as the two Asian allies aim to strengthen economic and security ties to counter China.
However, the raging controversy caused due to Modi's diplomatic harakiri over the legality of the additional note between Japan and India will strengthen China's position instead to censure India on NPT issue and continue to block its entry to NSG.

On The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the liberal host opened with a unifying statement about the Alexandria, Va., shooting that left four people wounded, including lawmaker Steve Scalise, who is reportedly in critical condition. Colbert started by saying:
“Ladies and gentlemen, before we get started, I just want to take a moment to talk about the attack today in Alexandria. Once again, we're all shocked in mind and soul by a mass shooting, this time targeting, apparently, a Republican members of congress. And I pray to God that everyone pulls through. Violence of any kind is never justified and is the last refuge of the incompetent. Thankfully, none of the members or their staff or police were killed today. And I will say this, even in the horror of this day, there was reason to take heart in bipartisan responses like this…”
The host then showed a speech by Nancy Pelosi, who said, “We will use this occasion as one that brings us together, and not separates us further.” This was followed by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan saying, “We are united in our shock. We are united in our anguish. And an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.”
Colbert concluded by saying:
“So I just want to say thank you to the congressional leadership and to the president for responding to this act of terror in a way that gives us hope that whatever our differences, we will always be the United States of America. Thank you for that.”

Snowmobile Repair Kit Checklist – Must Have Items When Snowmobiling
If you love to snowmobile, you have probably at one point been out on the trails and in need of some quick repair. We all should have an emergency kit and tools, but sometimes we forget- until it is too late. Just like with snowmobile maintenance, the best solution is to stay ahead of the problem and be prepared. Here is not only a list of repair items you should carry with you, but also some other things you might not think of until you need it.
Snowmobile Repair Items
Spare spark plugs and spark plug wrench . This one is pretty obvious, and the most commonly needed repair to be made on snowmobiles. Buy spark plugs in bulk, and don't wait for them to go bad- change regularly.

Learn how to replace these before there is an issue. As a matter of fact, if you have an older snowmobile, consider getting ahead of this problem and replacing your old rope with a newer one that is guaranteed for life.

When you get one, do some testing of tying two sleds together so you have an idea of how to use when you need them. You generally just need one, and make sure it makes it out on the trails each time you go out, even if going alone.

Checklist of Basic Repairs (the basics, a more thorough inspection can be done by a pro)
Check all of your lights
Flush old fuel or burn off some of the old fuel and add some Seafoam.
Check your track.
Look for any critters that have tried to make a home and clean out. (using moth balls and dryer sheets during storage helps prevent this)
Inspect the throttle and other cables for any excessive wear.
Top off all fluids and carefully inspect for any leaks.
Check the drive belt for any cracks.
Inspect the starter rope for any wear.
Look for any new body rust.
Change spark plugs.

The $3.5 million man
Wow. I've been mystified as to why Joe Walsh, the most visible trainwreck of the Republican first-year student class, changed their mind and decided to seek reelection in the heavily-Democratic 8th CD rather than in the very red 14th where he'd long been planning to run. Walsh got deliciously screwed in redistricting and wasn't left with a lot of good options: The 14th is also home to fellow GOPer Randy Hultgren, so that would have meant a major primary battle. But the redrawn 8th isn't really a district that Republicans have much of a shot in, especially baggage-laden out-and-proud tea partiers.
But it looks like we might finally have our explanation:
Walsh — lured by the thought of an easier primary and the promise, according to top Illinois GOP officials who requested anonymity and influential Barrington Republican Jack Roeser, of $3.5 million in general election fundraising help from House Speaker John Boehner — will now make a bid in the recently drawn 8th District, roughly centered in Schaumburg and including Addison, Elk Grove, Hanover and Wheeling townships.
Again, wow. Does Joe Walsh really think this money will be there for him? It's not like he'd even have much of a chance at victory even with such a huge infusion of coin, but I guess he's stupid enough to believe they might get it. However, I can't believe Boehner would be stupid enough to spend this kind of cash—or any cash—on a guy like Walsh in a district like this. And forget about the general election—Walsh might need the dough for the primary:
Yet [...] Walsh still faces a primary battle — against DuPage Regional Superintendent of Education Darlene Ruscitti and Barrington business person Andrew Palomo. Ruscitti, who held an Addison fundraiser on Thursday, is expected to receive the support of several members of the Illinois Republican delegation over Walsh — including [Peter] Roskam, the GOP chief deputy whip and 6th District member of congress, and 13th District Congresswoman Judy Biggert of Hinsdale.
It would be quite the treat if Walsh couldn't even make it past Ruscitti—something John Boehner is probably hoping for as well, since that'll free them from having to awkwardly explain why they aren't carrying through on this promise next fall.
Of course, what Walsh could really use the money for is their child support payments. At least then it would be going to a good cause.

A hotel has been forced to send out a letter to its British guests threatening £1,400 fines for anyone caught ‘logging' in swimming pools while on holiday.
The bizarre internet craze (that's no one had heard of until now) has apparently become a favourite pastime for ‘boozed up Brits abroad', according to one holiday spot in Egypt.
The owners claim participants are deliberately pooing in their crowded pools before ‘watching the carnage unfold around them'.

The letter, sent by First Choice hotel Egyptian Red Sea Holiday Village, said they were being overwhelmed by the number of ‘logging' cases recently.
‘We understand that accidents can happen, but the frequency of this suggests that it no longer remains accidental,' the letter said.
The hotel, which is popular among Britons for hen and stag parties, has also implemented warnings over loudspeakers.

It added that they hoped guests would remain ‘vigilant' against the practice.
Travel law expert Nick Harris, of Simpson Millar solicitors, said: ‘This is a very worrying trend and the craze has really taken off in the last few years.
‘We have dealt with hundreds of cases where people have been left seriously ill.
‘Some idiots think it is humorous to deliberately poo in a crowded pool and then sit back and watch the carnage unfold as people try to escape the pool
like a panic scene from the film Jaws.'
They added: ‘Quite frankly it is a very disturbing and selfish trend that ruins holidays.'

LURING companies north from south of the Border anxious to avoid the impact of Brexit will be part of the SNP's new economic offensive in a future independence referendum campaign.
The short-term move is being coupled to a long-term strategy focusing on rapidly growing the economy to meet the performances of small independent nations such as Denmark, Ireland and New Zealand.
Growth rate in Scotland is around 1.5 per cent while that of the leading 18 small nations in the world stands at around two per cent.
“There could be short-term opportunities provided by Brexit,” said one insider in the party's growth commission. “But the focus is very much on a longer-term and is designed to close the gap between where Scotland is now in terms of its OECD peer group – small, advanced economies – and where we could be.
“There is also the important issue of growing national prosperity. On average people in these small independent advanced nations have an income which is 20 per cent higher per person than Scots.
“We have to close both the growth gap and the wealth gap. Scotland is not completely out of step with these other small successful countries, but we could be doing a lot better.” The insider explained that other aspects were critical too in the new economic prospectus.
“We are considering what is working for these small independent nations and seeing what would successfully transfer to Scotland,” they said.
“It is about focusing on sectors of the economy where we are strong and making sure every single policy pursued boosts those sectors.”
Renewable energy, insurance services and asset management, universities and sectors where companies and researchers work together on innovative technologies have been earmarked.
“The thinking is that as a small country we don't have to be successful at a lot of things in order to be very prosperous, we only need to be successful at a few key things. I believe we have a very upbeat and optimistic message,” they added.
Andrew Wilson, chair of the party's growth commission, revealed some of the general themes of the strategy in a recent briefing to senior SNP members.
One senior figure who attended the briefing told The National there was a focus on attracting business worried about Brexit to move to Scotland.
“We will be getting the message out to employers based in England that you don't need to move to Paris or Germany. We in Scotland have a talented workforce and a high quality of life index,” the insider said. “Come up north because we are planning to stay in the single market.”
Several leading banks have already signalled they will switch operations from the UK to elsewhere in the EU following the Brexit vote.
HSBC and UBS – two of Europe's biggest banks – are each planning to relocate around 1,000 staff and Goldman Sachs is considering halving its 3,000-strong London workforce.
The source added: “The strategy is to create more jobs to get people and companies to relocate north of the Border and as such create economic conditions that will foster a pro-expansion strategy.”
Other countries have been gearing up to poach businesses thinking of leaving the UK.
French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron last month announced plans for seven new skyscrapers to be built in Paris as part of an attempt to woo businesses from post-Brexit London.
Daniel Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the UK, told MPs last month Ireland was hoping to attract firms moving out of the UK to avoid the impact of Brexit.
“We naturally seek to avail of any upsides from this situation, such as the possibility of attracting some of the economic activity that may need to find a post-Brexit location within the European Union,” Mulhall told the Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. The SNP's growth commission has also been addressing issues regarded as being weaker in the last referendum campaign, such as what currency an independent Scotland would use and the transfer of pensions payments arrangements.
Announcing the commission's membership last year Nicola Sturgeon said: “Scotland is a wealthy country with resources and talents that many other countries can only dream about. The challenge, however, lies in closing the gap between our potential and the reality. We want to strengthen our foundations and seek to identify the very best opportunities for Scotland's economy to flourish.”
Speculation has been growing that the First Minister is poised to call a new referendum on independence, this week suggesting autumn 2018 would be “a common-sense time” for a vote.
An SNP spokesperson said: “The work of the Growth Commission is ongoing. It will make a number of recommendations on measures to boost Scotland's economy and underpin a programme for sustainable growth.”
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A humbled and emotional Michael Jordan fought back tears, feeling vindicated after years of criticism, after being named the Charlotte Business Journal's Business Person of the Year.
The Charlotte Hornets owner said during a nine-minute acceptance speech Tuesday night posted on the organization's website that while he's received many awards as a player, this one was different.

"I've been criticized in a lot of different areas from a business standpoint, but I take pride in the ideas and concepts and views that come out of this organization to build the type of basketball program ... that the city of Charlotte can be proud of," Jordan said as they began tearing up.
Jordan won six NBA titles as a player, but their front-office leadership abilities had been questioned -- including their decision to take Kwame Brown with the No. 1 pick of the 2001 NBA draft while an executive with the Washington Wizards.
But Jordan has repeatedly said they are committed to turning the Hornets around, and members of their team echoed their sentiments on Wednesday.
Charlotte president and COO Fred Whitfield said Wednesday that Jordan was "genuinely honored and humbled by the award."
Whitfield said Jordan has listened to fans, including changing the team's name back to the Hornets upon their request. The franchise had been known as the Bobcats.
"He is so proud to be building something in their home state," Whitfield said. "So to be recognized with such a prestigious award for their business accomplishments was really, really special to him."
Jordan's longtime business manager Estee Portnoy attended the ceremony and called the speech "genuine and beautiful" in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday.
"For all of the people that think that I'm in this for the short term, you better pull your socks up and just hang around -- because my promise to this organization and this community is to bring a winner."
Jordan, a 14-time NBA All-Star who took over as the Hornets majority owner in 2010, said they plan on winning multiple championships with the franchise.
"For all of the people that think that I'm in this for the short term, you better pull your socks up and just hang around -- because my promise to this organization and this community is to bring a winner," Jordan said.
Jordan said when they joined the Hornets as a minority owner they never anticipated taking over as majority owner, but rather was interested in helping bring a winning franchise back to their home state.
But they said when Bob Johnson decided to sell the franchise, it felt like "karma" that allowed them the opportunity own a team in North Carolina.
"I left home. I came back home. And I plan on staying home," Jordan said.
Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, talked at length how much of their family still lives in the state.
And they said he's still driven to win.
"Me, personally, I could ride off into the sunset and never worry about a thing," Jordan said. "But my pride brought me back to North Carolina for whatever reason."
Jordan, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls, went on to say "a lot of my credits from a basketball standpoint are going to be attributed to Chicago. But I'm from North Carolina."
Jordan also thanked their employees and their family for their input on their business decisions.
"I take input from all sources of this community be it from my family or be it from business leaders, be it from people walking in the streets," Jordan said. "And that gives me a sense of my pride in my connection to the community. I don't take that for granted. I take it with a lot of pride and a lot of respect."
The Hornets made the playoffs last season but were swept in the postseason by the Miami Heat.
They are currently ninth in the Eastern Conference standings this season.
"We still have a long ways to go as an organization," Jordan said. "We are just scratching the surface."
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe defied calls to quit Sunday, saying they will preside over a ruling party congress in December in an announcement that could trigger impeachment proceedings this week and more protests demanding their ouster.
In a televised address, the 93-year-old Mugabe acknowledged what they said were "a whole range of concerns" of Zimbabweans about the chaotic state of the government and the economy, but they stopped short of what many people in the southern African nation were hoping for — a statement that they were resigning after nearly four decades in power.
The once-formidable Mugabe is now a virtually powerless, isolated figure, making their continued incumbency all the more unusual and extending Zimbabwe's political limbo.  They are largely confined to their private home by the military. The ruling party has fired them from their leadership post, and huge crowds poured into the streets of Harare, the capital, on Saturday to demand that they leave office.
Yet the president sought to project authority in their speech, which they delivered after shaking hands with security force commanders, one of whom leaned over a couple of times to help Mugabe find their place on the page they were reading.
The Central Committee of the ruling ZANU-PF party voted to dismiss Mugabe as party leader at a meeting earlier Sunday and said impeachment proceedings would begin if they do not resign by noon Monday. Mugabe made no reference to the party moves against him, instead saying they would play a leading role in a party congress planned for Dec. 12 through 17.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe remained defiant during a lengthy address, refusing to resign as president amid ongoing political turmoil in their country 5:59
"The congress is due in a few weeks from now," Mugabe said. "I will preside over its processes, which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public."
Officials close to the talks between Mugabe and the military had said Mugabe was resigning.
Mugabe has discussed their possible resignation on two occasions with military commanders after they effectively took over the country on Tuesday. The commanders were troubled by their firing of their longtime deputy and the positioning of unpopular first lady Grace Mugabe to succeed him. They referred to the military's concerns about the state of Zimbabwe, where the economy has deteriorated amid factional battles within the ruling party.
"Whatever the pros and cons of the way they went about registering those concerns, I, as the president of Zimbabwe, as their commander in chief, do acknowledge the issues they have drawn my attention to, and do believe that these were raised in the spirit of honesty and out of deep and patriotic concern for the stability of our nation and for the welfare of our people," Mugabe said.
'A wicked cabal'
The deputy whom Mugabe fired, former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is positioned to become Zimbabwe's next leader after the party committee made them its nominee to take over from Mugabe, who has ruled since independence from white minority rule in 1980.
Committee members stood, cheered and sang after Mugabe was removed from their post as party leader. Meeting chair Obert Mpofu referred to them as "outgoing president" and called it a "sad day" for Mugabe after their decades in power.
"He has been our leader for a long time, and we have all learned a great deal from him," Mpofu said. But Mugabe, they said, "surrounded themselves with a wicked cabal."
'The speech was just surprising. It is not in line with what we expected. We had understood that their resignation was coming to avoid the embarrassment of impeachment.' - Lovemore Matuke, ZANU-PF party whip
The chief whip of Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU-PF said, "I don't see us failing to proceed with the impeachment."
"The Central Committee decision stands until I am advised otherwise," said Lovemore Matuke.
Matuke added that "the speech was just surprising. It is not in line with what we expected. We had understood that their resignation was coming to avoid the embarrassment of impeachment. The army is taking its own route, and as politicians we are taking our own route, but the ultimate goal is to make sure they go, which they should have done tonight."

Mugabe's speech did note the political turmoil that led to their military house arrest and expulsion as ruling party leader.
"From tonight … the nation at all levels gets refocused," Mugabe said.
They also said "failures of the past" may have triggered anger "in some quarters, which they call "quite understandable."
They also said that "intergenerational conflict must be resolved," a reference to their apparent positioning of their unpopular 52-year-old wife to succeed him. Mugabe had been backed by fellow veterans of the country's liberation war, until they turned against him.

Mugabe has been under house arrest since the military moved on Tuesday, angered by their firing of their longtime deputy and the positioning of unpopular first lady Grace Mugabe to succeed him.
Mugabe tried to buy time in negotiations with the military on a dignified exit but quickly found themselves isolated.

Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets of the capital Saturday to demand that Mugabe, one of Africa's last remaining liberation leaders, step aside after overseeing the once-prosperous country's economic collapse.
The party meeting Sunday replaced Mugabe as party chief with Mnangagwa and recalled the first lady as head of the women's league, in decisions set to be ratified at the party congress next month. The committee accused the first lady of "preaching hate, divisiveness and assuming roles and powers not delegated to the office."
Zimbabwean officials never revealed details of Mugabe's talks with the military, but the military appeared to favour a voluntary resignation to maintain a veneer of legality in the political transition. Mugabe, in turn, has likely used whatever leverage they have left to try to preserve their legacy or even protect themselves and their family from possible prosecution.

'Playing games with the people of Zimbabwe'
Zimbabweans say they feel profoundly disappointed that Mugabe is resisting pressure to step aside.
Victor Matemadanda, secretary general of the country's war veterans association, said they feel betrayed.
"He is playing games with the people of Zimbabwe. They agree to go and then plays games with us like that at the last minute," said Matemadanda.
Matemadanda says the war veterans will again rally the people to protest, and "this time the army will let them face the people … The army will now choose between shooting the people or protecting Mugabe."
Grace Mugabe was reported to have been placed under house arrest in the capital, Harare, last Wednesday, along with their husband..
Without the military's intervention last week, many observers say they likely would have replaced Mnangagwa as vice president and been in a position to succeed their husband.

"If Mugabe is not gone by Tuesday, then as sure as the sun rises from the east, impeachment process will kick in," Gonese said.

Earlier Sunday, Chris Mutsvangwa, head of the country's liberation war veterans, said they were concerned that the military could end up opening fire to protect Mugabe from protesters. They vowed to "bring back the crowd" if the president didn't step aside.
"We would expect that Mugabe would not have the prospect of the military shooting at people, trying to defend him," Mutsvangwa said. "The choice is his."
Bitfinex investigator @bitfinexed is at it again. This time they believe that the flash crash in Bitcoin and rapid recovery were caused by Bitfinex to steal away people's portfolios on margin calls that went bad as well as turn some of their profits into cash since using fake Tethers to pump up the Bitcoin price.
There does seem to be some issues with Bitfinex not handling margin calls properly, as many users are complaining they were liquidated when there orders where not executed properly due to stop loss orders being executed way lower than the customer had set. Also, after the initial crash in price, the price rebounded so fast that on a 1 minute candle chart you see very unusual movement.
For a full breakdown of what happened with the margin call fiasco at Bitfinex you can read this informative article from Medium.
If you remember, this summer GDAX had a similar flash crash incident that happened and many were calling foul play. Lawyers began reaching out to people who lost money on these suspicious margin calls. Eventually GDAX agreed to pay everyone back, possibly to avoid an investigation by lawyers and what it may uncover since they do a lot of business in the U.S via Coinbase. However, Bitfinex kicked out all U.S. customers not long ago. They said the reason was because U.S laws were not worth dealing with. Perhaps we are seeing why.

A small group of unassuming mid-westerners has discovered what could be a complete game-changer for the global biodiesel industry. Their new system makes biodiesel in mere seconds, creates a product that costs half the price, produces no waste, and can use any animal fat or vegetable oil as a feedstock.
[social_buttons]
Even though I'm sometimes down on my country because of the pathetic state of our government, the thing that always makes my patriotism swell is the truly amazing and unexpected ingenuity that seems to spring forth from the American people.
And in this tale, American ingenuity doesn't get much more classic. A student and their professor at a small college smack dab in the middle of the heartland that virtually nobody's ever heard of, have figured out a way to make biodiesel quickly, cheaply, and efficiently from a very small package.
We're not just talking an incremental improvement, we're talking half the price and a tiny fraction of the time — a revolutionary change for the biodiesel industry. Think on the order of saving $2 for every gallon and going from raw materials to biodiesel in a few seconds versus many hours.
Not only that, the process can convert any animal fat or vegetable oil, mixed in any ratio, into biodiesel using the same compact reactor in a continuous stream. Compare this to the current method which converts the oil or fat to biodiesel over many hours in huge vat batches and creates a lot of potentially hazardous waste products.
The Mcgyan® process (so named for the inventors McNeff, Gyberg and Yan) started as a required undergraduate chemistry project for student Brian Krohn at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, MN. Krohn and their major professor, Arlin Gyberg, were looking at ways to catalyze the raw materials into biodiesel using a process called esterification.
The basic idea was to run the raw fats and oils over a sulfated zirconia catalyst to change them into biodiesel. This idea isn't new, but the duo thought they could improve on it. In the end, the pair enlisted the help of another scientist Ben Yan and an Augsburg alum Clayton McNeff.
McNeff already owned a company that made zirconia separating columns which are typically used for something completely different. With a little modification, these columns were turned into sulfated zirconia biodiesel reactors.
Basically, the process works like this:
Raw fats and oils of any type are combined with an alcohol
This mixture is fed through a sulfated zirconia column heated to 300 degrees Celsius
Their Easy Fatty Acid Removal (EFAR) system recycles any unreacted raw material back through the reactor
Excess alcohol is recycled back through the reactor
Pure biodiesel comes out the end
The advantages of the system are:
No waste produced; No washing or neutralizing of the biodiesel is necessary
100% conversion of raw materials to biodiesel
Any raw fat or oil can be used to make biodiesel
Very efficient due to heat recapture from the column
Sulfated zirconia catalyst never needs replacing
Very small footprint of the reactor system, uses an extremely small amount of area for the amount of biodiesel produced
Essentially no emissions and no waste stream from the process; Easy permitting from the government
The group has formed a company called Every Cat Fuels and is in the process of building a 3 million gallons per year (MMgy) commercial biodiesel facility with the intention of scaling it up to 30 MMgy in the next 3-5 years. As soon as the Ever Cat plant is producing biodiesel successfully, the group plans on licensing the technology to other interested parties.
Bada-bing, bada-bang. Anybody has start-up capital to help me license their tech (I'm only part-way kidding)?

The EU's common defence policy and events in Africa and the Middle East will dominate member states' discussions this week.
Foreign ministers will, on Monday (15 May), debate plans to create a new HQ in Brussels for EU military training missions overseas and to prepare joint “battlegroups” for future intervention in north Africa and the Middle east.

Defence ministers will return to the topic in greater detail on Wednesday together with Nato head Jens Stoltenberg.
The talks come as the new French president Emmanuel Macron heads to Berlin to discuss their vision of Europe with chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.
Germany sees the joint defence plan as the beginnings of an EU army, with its finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, saying over the weekend in Berlin that if EU states pooled military spending they would have better resources than Russia. The UK opposes anything of the sort and still has the right to block initiatives until it leaves the bloc in 2019.
Foreign ministers will also discuss the security situation in Somalia and South Sudan, while development ministers will, on Thursday, discuss humanitarian aid for Syria and Yemen.
The war in Syria will form the centrepiece of a speech by the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday.
The conflict has been the primary source of asylum seekers coming to Europe, with EU home affairs ministers, on Wednesday, to continue talks on reform of the bloc's asylum laws in response to the migration crisis.
EU states had agreed to share the burden with Greece and Italy, but just 18,000 people have been relocated so far out of a target of 180,000, with MEPs to debate the lack of solidarity on Tuesday.
Hungary, one of the member states to have boycotted the relocation quotas, will also be the focus of a report by MEPs, to be voted on on Wednesday, about its government's increasingly undemocratic rule.
Meanwhile, the EU can expect more visitors from Ukraine after the EU parliament signs off on a visa waiver with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in Strasbourg on Wednesday.
In more kitchen-sink business, European Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker will meet Mariya Gabriel, Bulgaria's replacement EU commissioner, on Tuesday, six months after its original designee left to head the World Bank.
Juncker will also go home to Luxembourg on Thursday for the 80th birthday party of their predecessor in the EU job - Jacques Santer, who resigned in a corruption scandal in 1999.

The British stars of the new Star Wars film have told the BBC they feel "no pressure" over how it will be received.
"I feel no pressure at all," said John Boyega, who will be seen in the JJ Abrams-directed Star Wars: The Force Awakens as a stormtrooper called Finn.
"I don't think I feel responsibility," said Daisy Ridley, whose character Rey is the film's female lead. "I think JJ probably feels it more.
"I just mainly want people to think I did a good job."
Boyega and Ridley spoke to entertainment correspondent Liza Mzimba about working on one of the most anticipated films of a generation.
Lizo Mzimba: Star Wars means so much to so many people, especially those who saw the original trilogy in the '70s and '80s. How much responsibility do you feel?
John Boyega: I feel very responsible for my character specifically - for the things we do in the scenes, and for the collaborative energy we have. But, thankfully, we have a great studio who are overseeing the release of the movie, and we have JJ Abrams who is the perfect mix of serious director and fan boy. The responsibility's there, but I'm not the only shoulder it leans on.
Daisy Ridley: I don't think I feel responsibility. I hope people like it, and I hope that it exceeds their expectations. But I don't really feel that responsibility, no; I think JJ probably feels it more. Yeah, I guess it's daunting. But I just mainly want people to think I did a good job - that's my priority.
LM: How ready are you for the recognition you'll get, the media attention and the way your lives will change?
JB: You can never be ready - it's just something that is going to happen regardless. You have to just make sure you have your family and your friends around you, to help you stay grounded.
DR: Ultimately you go home at the end of the day, and your mum's there, your sister's there, your dad's there and your dog's there, and life goes on. It's like when you do photo shoots and stuff, it's a glamour version of me. I know because I look at myself every day in the mirror and I know that's not how I usually look!
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Daisy Ridley discusses their life-changing role in Star Wars VII: The Force Awaken
LM: Finn and Rey are at the centre of the film. How did your relationship work out? Did you click the first time you met?
DR: It was great, though John feels I slightly lied to him, because I was already cast and they couldn't know that.
JB: The first time I met Daisy was during the auditions; they had been cast as Rey and obviously they were doing chemistry reads with the guys. So I was like, 'Are you playing the girl?' And they were like, 'No, no. I'm just reading.' Then I found out they were cast and that they knew all along.
DR: But it was great immediately; when JJ told me it was him, I was really, really pleased. And the more I think about what we did, and the more I see of him, I just think he's brilliant.
JB: Yes, since then we've been pretty close. It's been good having them back and supporting them through this whole process.
LM: Appearing in Star Wars is a great thing, but it's no guarantee of a long, successful film career. How much thought have you given that?
JB: There's no guarantee of life, first of all. And second of all, I just think when it comes to the acting career it's all choice. I'm not stressed; I don't borrow trouble from tomorrow. For me, right now is about supporting a movie that I love, a franchise that's been part of my life for a very long time, and just having fun.
DR: I'm quite a hopeful person, and I've been so lucky with what's happened before. When I did Casualty [for the BBC], when I did Toast of London [on Channel 4], that was thrilling to me, and whatever lies ahead I'm sure will be exciting.
LM: Are you concerned that maybe in 20 years' time you might be known, not as John and Daisy Boyega the actors, but as Finn and Rey in Star Wars?
JB: No, that's great. I mean, that's not the worst problem to have in the world. Have you seen the world lately? No, that's going to be absolutely fine.
DR: Harrison Ford is one of the most successful actors ever but they still get recognised for Han Solo, even though he's done so many incredible things. I would love to be known as Daisy Ridley the actor, but being known as Daisy Ridley who played Rey is also okay.
Image copyright Royal Mail Image caption Boyega and Ridley's characters were recently given their own special edition stamps
LM: How hard has it been maintaining the veil of secrecy that has surrounded the film, and keeping things from your friends and family?
JB: I think it's been fine. I support the vision; I love the experience of going to see a film without knowing what happens. I think it's actually a gift to have all this secrecy around it, so I don't have any problem about not telling anyone anything.
DR: I couldn't tell anyone [I had been cast as Rey] for three months, which was probably the most difficult - my friends are actors, and we were sat around talking about jobs and auditions. But then throughout the filming, there were 2,000 people at Pinewood and it was everyone's secret. It feels wonderful, because everyone knows the reason we're keeping it a secret is because we want people to watch the film and go, 'Oh my gosh'.
LM: You both seem incredibly calm now. How do you think you'll feel on the day before release, or when everyone starts tweeting and giving their reactions?
DR: It feels like everyone's ready for it to come out now. There's been so much incredible work, so many people having input into it, and we're now ready for everyone to see it.
JB: This is the image I have. I'm going to be in my bed, with my cat next to me and a stormtrooper mug full of hot chocolate, and I'm just going to be looking at the box office figures. I'm just going to be looking at the numbers, at how many people are going to see the movie. I can't wait to see how well we do.

Germany's rightwing populists likely to take 80 seats in next parliament, achieving best result for any new party since 1949
Leaders of Germany's Alternative für Deutschland have vowed to “take back our country and our people” and “hound Angela Merkel” with a legal investigation into the refugee crisis as they became the first overtly nationalist party to swoop into the Bundestag in more than five decades.
As the figures of the first exit polls flashed up on the screen shortly after 6pm on Sunday, supporters inside a Berlin nightclub hired by AfD broke out into a spontaneous rendition of the national anthem – though they made sure to skip the first two stanzas, still strongly associated with the Third Reich.
“Please, no remarks that will later come back to haunt us,” the party's joint candidate Alexander Gauland quickly admonished the euphoric crowds from the stage.
Projected results put the AfD on 13%, behind Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat-led alliance on 32.9% and the Social Democratic party on 20.8%. The rightwing populist party's delegates are expected to take more than 80 out of 631 seats in the next parliament.
German elections 2017: latest results live Read more
While the result may not be on the scale of 52% of Britons voting to leave the European Union or 46% of US voters casting their ballot for Donald Trump, it nonetheless represents a landmark in postwar German history.
Germany's rightwing populists will arrive in the Bundestag with the best result for any new party since 1949, a higher share of the vote than either the Greens or the leftwing Die Linke have achieved in several decades.
In the states that used to form East Germany, AfD looks likely to become the second-largest party.
AfD may not be the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since the second world war: until 1960 a number of small nationalist groups took part in the coalition government under West Germany's first post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.
But it will be the first party with an overtly nationalist rhetoric and agenda to claim seats in Berlin's Reichstag, a building that still echoes with the horrors of the Nazi era.
Among its members are figures such as the lawyer Jens Maier, who has called for an end of the “guilt cult” over the second world war; the head of the AfD youth wing, Markus Frohnmaier, who has vowed to make politics “for the volk and only for the volk”; and Lower Saxony's Wilhelm von Gottberg, who has described the Holocaust as “an effective instrument to criminalise Germans and their history”.

Though the nationalist wing may not dominate AfD's Bundestag delegation, its aggressive and taboo-breaking rhetoric has been tolerated – and increasingly adopted – by the party leadership.
During the last eight weeks AfD has managed to dominate the news agenda with carefully timed provocations, such as Gauland calling for Germans to be “proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars”. They also said the government's commissioner for integration, Aydan Özoğuz, who has Turkish roots, should be “disposed of in Anatolia”.
Even the AfD's head, Frauke Petry, once considered a firebrand in their own right but who has found themselves marginalised and conspicuously missing from the grand party in Berlin, criticised their colleagues, saying they were putting off many middle-class voters. “I can understand why they are horrified,” they said.
Drinking a beer on the balcony of the nightclub the party had hired, Heribert Eisenhardt denied that the party has increasingly lurched to the right since its foundation in 2013, saying the developments had been misportrayed by the media. “I am not even proud to be German,” Eisenhardt said, waiting for the surprise on the faces of their party colleagues, only to add: “As long Angela Merkel is our chancellor.”
Many of their party colleagues teasingly smiled and waved at the several hundred protesters who had gathered at the bottom of their balcony. “My god, these people are braindead,” said one female supporter wearing an AfD pin on their dress. “Gulag may be a good solution.”
An hour earlier they had cheered on Gauland as they promised: “We will change this country … we will take back our country and our people.” Their co-leader, Alice Weidel, vowed they would prioritise a parliamentary investigation into Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders during the 2015 refugee crisis.

Some critics question whether AfD will be able to take quite so smoothly to its new role inside the Bundestag. As in the US there is hope, and in some parts confidence, that AfD's momentum will soon be stopped by constitutional safeguards and the slow grind of parliamentary procedure.
A new satirical video by the comedian Jan Böhmermann, called Deutschland ist Wieder im Reichstag (“Germany is back in the Reichstag”) imagines the party's triumphalism being ground to a halt by endless budgetary reports and committee sessions: “Parliamentarianism can paralyse the raciest racism”, goes one line.

Manfred Güllner, the director of the polling institute Forsa, predicted on the eve of the election that unresolved conflicts between the AfD's nationalist and economically liberal wings would soon catch up with the party: “The AfD will take itself apart because that's what has always happened to sectarian groups on the far right.”
Founded by a group of economics professors in protest against Greek bailout programmes, the party's success in the east shows the extent to which it has broadened its appeal and has reached out to those who feel disappointed by their region's decline after reunification.
Yet AfD is by no means only a party of the “left-behinds”, and its agenda continues to be set by western politicians advocating conventional small-state economics. A June survey showed that the largest part of the party's supporters, 39%, have a higher than average income.
Its manifesto calls for a scrapping of inheritance tax and suggests that the long-term unemployed should do 30 hours of work a week below the minimum wage. Resolving the party's contradictory stances on tax and pensions could soon dampen Sunday night's triumphalism.
Late last year I wrote a article about Tyler Kennedy and their amazing underlying stats. At the time Penguins were in full turnaround mode and the accolades were going to Sergei Gonchar on their return from injury. But Kennedy was effective even when Gonchar was down. In fact, they were at times the most effective Penguin on the ice. The conclusion was as follows:
Barring injury, given their age and their game, it's not a stretch to see the new Teke as a 20-25 goal man on the right wing for stretch of five to seven seasons. Someone in the Penguins scouting department deserves some serious praise for this find -- Teke looks like a guy that is going to get 750 games in this league. Players like Kennedy - those that get the puck going in the right direction and make their teammates better while staying completely under the radar aren't easy to find...
Kennedy remained strong through the playoffs and Bylsma hard-matched the Cooke - Staal - Kennedy line against the best the opposing team could muster as often as they could. I remain convinced that Dan Bylsma is either tracking their own advanced stats or using Vic Ferarri's site. Though Kennedy has been banged up this year, the trend continues. He's taking the tough assignments, taking the bad starting position and he's outshooting and outscoring once again. Pittsburgh's new "Teke" continues to show their versatility and effectiveness. Below the break is an updated look at Kennedy's underlying stats and their effect on their teammates.
Kennedy is still getting the difficult starting position - out of thirteen qualifying forwards, they rank ninth in offensive zone starts. Their qualcomp is 4/13, behind only Sidney Crosby, Chris Kunitz and Bill Guerin and their qualteam is 3/13. Despite the starting position and qualcomp, they continue to outshoot and their Corsi value ranks 3/13 on the Penguins. If someone were tracking scoring chances for the Penguins, I'd expect Kennedy's rate to be among the top four on the team.
The most telling stat about Kennedy? Look at their EV +/- on per 60: 1.19, He's ranked second on the Penguins and has outscored their opponents 21-13 while on the ice at even strength. When healthy, Kennedy has continued their even strength dominance.
Often overlooked is Kennedy's value to Jordan Staal. The young centerman is the apple of many general manager's eyes because of their remarkable potential. However, their current performance is greatly enhanced by the presence of Tyler Kennedy, something that can be seen through Kennedy's injury time this year. Overall, Staal has outscored their opponents 37-25 and outshot at a rate of .521 (310 SF -284 SA) while on at even strength. Together with Kennedy, they've outscored 14-6 and outshot at a .541 (156 SF - 132 SA) rate. Without Kennedy, Staal still outscores, 23-19, and barely outshoots with a .503 (154 SF - 152 SA) rate. The sample size argument is relevant, but in reading the breakdown from last year, these same numbers hold. Tyler Kennedy has been driving results at even strength for the Penguins.
Players like Kennedy are examples of why advanced statistics should be studied closely. Stephen Weiss is another. Talking heads everywhere are calling this Weiss' breakout year because the puck is going into the net. For the last two years, Weiss has been starting in their own end, taking on the toughest matchups and outscoring them. Breakout year? Try 2007-2008. Dustin Penner has amazed pundits with their point totals this year, but the underlying numbers showed a player that has been moving the puck the right way and outshooting their opponents for awhile.
Who would have thought that among all of those stars last year in Pittsburgh, Tyler Kennedy was the only man outshooting their opponents and doing it with the worst teammates? Who would have known that they were a key to the Penguins lineup because they were outscoring whoever was on the ice against him? Not who, but what, in this case. The underlying stats showed Kennedy was having success when the Penguins were struggling mightily. The underlying stats find the gems that can help a general manager save both their team and their cap situation from falling apart.
Helipad planned under Adelaide airport flight path worries former air traffic controller
Posted
A former air traffic controller has condemned the idea of putting an Adelaide city helipad close to the commercial airlines' major flight path into Adelaide Airport.
Walter Dollman said there were many concerns, including turbulence, noise, the need to keep the public clear of the parklands site during landings and take-offs and worries about the main flight path during peak periods.
"Not least of the reasons, this is another commercial development on the Adelaide parklands," they told ABC Radio Adelaide.
A helipad would be close to Adelaide Casino, potentially giving high rollers another travel option, and it might be used for tourism flights to South Australia's wine regions and Kangaroo Island.
The former air traffic controller said even low use of a CBD helipad came with no guarantee about how demand might grow over time.
"Once you establish a helipad there, who knows what the future might hold?" they said.
They said in busy periods for Adelaide Airport in the western suburbs, it could be almost impossible to use a city helipad safely because of operations in the main flight path.
"You couldn't imagine a worse position from an air traffic control management point of view," they said.
An aviation company first approached Adelaide City Council with the idea about four years ago and Councillor Houssam Abiad said it was ultimately a decision that would be based on the advice of aviation experts, along with the views of residents and businesses.
"We are potentially looking at expressions of interest from experts," Cr Abiad said.
"It's not for council to make a decision if this is safe or not.
"I welcome the views of Mr Dollman to be added to those [other] views."
Mr Dollman said a new helipad on the roof of the soon-to-open Royal Adelaide Hospital did not present the same concerns as it was visible to the main airport's air traffic control, unlike the proposed site near the River Torrens, which they described as being in a valley.

Case Keenum spent six years at the University of Houston and helped two coaches get lucrative jobs in the Big 12 Conference. Art Briles moved to Baylor at the end of the regular season in 2007, and Kevin Sumlin moved to Texas A&M at the end of the 2011 regular season.
Briles rapidly built Baylor into a national power and then it came crashing down just as rapidly in an outrageous level of scandal. Sumlin rapidly turned A&M into a national power with Johnny Manziel as their quarterback, and then their tenure ended with their recent firing by the always delusion-driven Aggies.
Keenum also was indirectly responsible for a firing at Houston — that of Tony Levine, the head coach for the final game of Case's record-setting career for the Cougars.
“There's a lot of truth to that,” said Levine, laughing slightly during a phone conversation this week.
The problem was perception: Keenum ran the Cougars' explosive, no-huddle offense with such precision that people started to believe it was the system more than the quarterback.

And when Levine did not win as often as the Cougars had with Keenum, 21-17 in three seasons, they were fired at the end of the 2014 regular season. Sophomore Greg Ward Jr. had taken over for John O'Korn halfway through that season, and Tom Herman (now well paid at Texas) was the coach who benefited most from Ward's emergence as a star in 2015.
Levine went back to coaching for Jeff Brohm at Western Kentucky in 2016, and moved with them to Purdue for this season as co-offensive coordinator. They started this week recruiting in Texas and was on their way to Florida.
He's a St. Paul guy and a Vikings fan for life, and is enjoying from a distance the emergence of Keenum as the leader of a team that in two months could be playing the Super Bowl in its new $1.15 billion home stadia.
Levine was contacted to help solve what's now nearly a 6-year-old mystery:
How is it that Case Keenum, the all-time major college passing leader in completions (1,546), yards (19,217) and touchdowns (155), was not selected in the 2012 NFL draft?
Apparently NFL scouts weren't impressed, even with their final college game and Levine's first as a head coach:
Houston's 30-14 victory over Penn State in the Ticket City Bowl, in which Keenum completed 45 of 69 passes for 532 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.
Levine was a receivers and special teams coach for Sumlin from 2008 to 2011, the bulk of Keenum's career. They saw the amazing performances from Keenum, and also what happened to the Cougars in 2010 when Case tore an ACL in the third game of the season at UCLA.
“We started 2-0 with Case,'' Levine said. “We lost when they got hurt at UCLA and went 3-7 over the last 10 games of the season.''
Keenum redshirted as a first-year student in 2006. In January 2011, they were awarded another season by the NCAA because of the third-game injury. That made Case a sixth-year senior as the Cougars finished 13-1 and wound up No. 8 in the national rankings.
Maybe that was it … the NFL teams thought Keenum was too old to draft at 23? Or their arm was tired from throwing 2,229 collegiate passes?
“I can remember vividly an NFL scout telling me, ‘If Case was 2 inches taller, they would be drafted in the first round,' ” Levine said. “And the other thing you always heard was, ‘He's a system quarterback.'
“They tried to come up with every reason they could to ignore the stats they had and the games they won. Whenever I talked to someone from the NFL, I would say, ‘Those stats and wins … they were not by accident.' ”
The Houston system was first installed by Dana Holgorsen and then added to by Kliff Kingsbury. Holgorsen is now the head coach at West Virginia and Kingsbury at Texas Tech.
The Cougars generally played with four receivers, one running back and no tight ends. It wasn't all quick read passes. Far from it.
“Case threw short, midrange and deep,'' Levine said. “He loved to throw deep, as you've seen with the Vikings.
Case Keenum is the all-time major college passing leader in completions (1,546), yards (19,217) and touchdowns (155).
“I didn't recruit him, but they have all the things you look for as a recruiter. They have the arm, the mobility in the pocket, and also the poise and natural leadership. Their dad is a famous high school coach in Texas, and you could tell right away that he's a coach's kid.
“He's going to know the offense as well as the coaches. And he's such a genuine guy, teammates are going to gravitate to him, and that would be whether it was in middle school football, or with the Vikings.''
Why now … after one season on a practice squad, and 24 starts in four seasons with the Texans and the Rams, is this 6-foot-1, record-holding college quarterback getting NFL raves?
“Opportunity,'' Levine said. “This is the first time where he's been able to play the position for an extended period, and have the feeling it is their job to keep. When they played in the past, it was two games here or there, or they were waiting for someone else to play, like [Jared] Goff in L.A.
“I see a comfort level. As a Vikings fan, and even more as a Case Keenum fan, it has been fun to watch them cut it loose again.''
After a spirited performance in the opening round of the season, the Bombers have added several players to the squad to take on the Hawks on Sunday.
The team fell victim to a last quarter fade-out after leading the Swans by 41-points late, conceding seven goals to none in the last quarter to lose by 12 points.
"Sydney got hold of us at the back end of that last quarter but with the amount of inside 50's they had not many defences would have held them," Essendon Coach James Hird said.
"We're happy with the way the majority of the game went last weekend, it just didn't quite end the way we would have liked."
Dempsey, Gwilt, Ashby, Dagleish and the recently upgraded McKernan have all been named in the squad for Sunday's game.
Veteran defender Dustin Fletcher will join injured midfielder David Myers on the sideline after pulling up sore from last week's game.
“Dustin just got a little bit sore in the groin after the game and we just want to be very conservative with him,” Hird said.
Here is the team that is set to take on the Hawks.
It's official — the oval skating rink on the Halifax Common is opening Christmas Day at 2 p.m.
Skaters have been waiting to get on the ice while crews coped with mild weather.
As in the past, if people don't have skates or a helmet they can borrow them at the outside rink.
Facility manager John Henry said, if all goes well, they have a special plan for New Year's Eve.
"If weather allows us to pull that off it's a combination of live entertainment, music, fireworks and just a great time for the family, it's going to be earlier on in the evening," they said.
Henry said skating enthusiasts can check with the Skate HRM website to see if the weather will permit the event to go ahead as planned.
In 2011 Council agreed to spend $4 million to build the oval on the Halifax Common, and $400,000 to run it.

More than 50% of drivers in Wales have claimed to be victims of road rage, according to a BBC Wales survey.
The poll for the BBC Wales' Week In, Week Out found 51% of motorists had been abused by other road users.
The UK government has introduced a £100 fixed penalty to try to tackle offences like tailgating and lane hogging - driving which can lead to road rage.
But some police officials have questioned if officers have enough resources to enforce the new penalties.
Cyclist Matt Turner, a college student from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, caught road rage directed at them on camera and tells their story.
The driver who is featured in this video was given a police caution. They refused to apologise to Mr Turner.
More on road rage on Week In, Week Out on BBC One Wales at 22:35 GMT on Tuesday 29 October.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose a far larger-than-expected 1.8 percent in June as energy costs soared, but core inflation at the producer level edged up just 0.2 percent, Labor Department data showed on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected producer prices — a gauge of costs at the farm and factory gate — to rise by 1.3 percent overall after a 1.4 percent increase in May. Energy prices were up 6.0 percent in June, the largest gain since November 2007.
The Labor Department said producer prices over the last 12 months were up 9.2 percent, the biggest increase since a 10.4 percent gain in June 1981.
On year, energy prices were up 27 percent.
Core producer prices, which strip out volatile energy and food costs, increased by 0.2 percent, the same margin as in May. Economists had expected core prices to rise 0.3 percent in June. On a year-over-year basis, core prices were up 3.0 percent.
Financial markets mostly shrugged off the price data, focusing instead on news of weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales in June. U.S. Treasury bonds added to their gains, and interest rate futures showed that traders saw the chances of the Federal Reserve raising rates at its next meeting at a scant 5 percent.
Stock futures were little changed.
The Fed has slashed its key interest rate by 3.25 percentage points to 2 percent since September in several moves, but opted at its June meeting to keep rates on hold as it assessed the economic situation.
Despite the startling rise in producer prices, economists said it would be difficult for the central bank to raise rates to counter inflationary pressures at a time when the U.S. economy remained weak and global financial markets under stress.
“When you see a massive financial meltdown on a global scale, it does make it quite hard for them to seriously talk about raising rates,” said T.J. Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
PowerShell How-To
Using Parameters in your Pester Test Scripts
Save time for accounting for changes in your scripts with this handy tip.
Scenarios are never the same, and neither should be your Pester scripts to test those scenarios. There are a couple of ways to account for these different scenarios. You could create a separate test script for every situation which would be way too cumbersome. Or, you could figure out only what changes amongst those scenarios and use those values as parameters in test scripts. Let's go the easy route here!
For example, perhaps I've got a set of infrastructure tests to ensure a server is online and a service is running. Below is an example:
describe 'SRV1 server' {
it 'SRV1 is online' {
Test-Connection -ComputerName SRV1 -Quiet | should be $true
}
it 'the wuauserv service should be started' {
(Get-Service -Name wuauserv -ComputerName SRV1).Status | should be 'Running'
}
}
This test script is just fine for a single server, but chances are you're going to need these tests for lots of different servers. Rather than creating test scripts like SRV1.ps1, SRV2.ps1, SRV3.ps1, ad nauseam, let's first see what changes across different test scripts and add them as parameters.
Looking at the tests, it appears that we could have two potential candidates for parameters: server name and service name. These values may change, and we need the ability to pass in different values. Adding these values as parameters to a Pester test script is the same process as adding parameters to any general PowerShell script. We add them at the top of the script.
param(
[Parameter(Mandatory)]
[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
[string]$ServerName,
[Parameter(Mandatory)]
[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
[string]$ServiceName
)
describe "$ServerName server" {
it "$ServerName is online" {
Test-Connection -ComputerName $ServerName -Quiet | should be $true
}
it "the $ServiceName service should be started" {
(Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ComputerName $ServerName).Status | should be 'Running'
}
}
Once we've got the parameters defined at the top and the static value references replaced with parameter variables inside of the script, we now need to pass these parameters to the script using the Invoke-Pester command.
Normally, when invoking a simple test script, we just need the Path parameter.
Invoke-Pester -Path C:\Test.ps1
However, when passing parameters to the test script, we must call Invoke-Pester a little differently. Instead of using the Path parameter, we need to use the Script parameter which requires a hashtable of parameters. Not to be confused with splatting, we're actually creating a hashtable of parameters and passing that hash table to a single parameter on the Invoke-Pester command. The command below performs the same task as above.
Invoke-Pester -Script @{ Path = 'C:\Test.ps1' }
Once you've got the Script hashtable created with the Path key, now you'll need to add a Parameters key to the hashtable which is a hashtable in of itself. It gets a little confusing. In our example, we have a test script with the parameters ServerName and ServiceName. Passing values to those parameters in the test script can be done like below.
Invoke-Pester -Script @{ Path = 'C:\Test.ps1'; Parameters = @{ServerName = 'SRV1'; ServiceName = 'wuauserv'} }
Notice that Invoke-Pester itself is using a single parameter called Script while all of the test script parameters are defined by a Parameters key inside of that hashtable.
Once you've parameterized scripts like this, you'll then be able to pass any number of parameters to test scripts and prevent unnecessary code duplication.
A few weeks ago, the University of Exeter found that parts of Cornwall, England had become subtropical. The study stated that since average temperatures had risen to above 10 degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) for periods of time longer than seven months, this part of England situated on a latitude line north of most of Newfoundland has become part of a climate zone that during the early 20th century extended as far south as the southern tip of Florida.
Seemingly oblivious to the new oddity and possible peril implied by such a significant climate shift, the study went on to cheerfully observe that:
Parts of Cornwall have become subtropical since 2000 and this could create opportunities to grow new, unusual plants. Sunflowers, maize, grapevines and tea are already grown in the Duchy.
The study also pointed out that the added heat might present a problem or two, instances that might be sorted out simply by getting scientists to work together with farmers:
While sub-tropical conditions may create opportunities to grow exotic crops, the lower frequency of frosts is also making Cornwall more susceptible to invasive species. As the temperatures continue to warm, we need to ensure we manage the risks carefully as well as capitalising on the opportunities. This will require scientists to continue to work hand-in-hand with the horticultural sector.
Subtropical Cornwall — Sahara Desert Marches North as Coastal Zones Flood
Unmentioned, however, was how bizarre the notion of a subtropical Cornwall actually is and what such a major climate shift may mean for the globe, Europe, and Cornwall itself — a shift that may put the odd notion of ‘capitalising on the opportunities' practically out of reach.
Unfortunately, big climate-zone movements of the kind shown in the Exeter study risk an amazing range of ecological and geophysical damage. A short and incomplete list includes melting glaciers, shrinking sea ice, rising sea levels (a very real worry for the numerous coastal communities near or within Cornwall, including places like Falmouth, Penzance, St Ives, and Exeter itself), stratifying and increasingly anoxic oceans, mass coral bleaching, and habitat loss for species on a global scale risking mass extinction. Any such mention of this appropriately worrying context was notably and oddly absent from the Exeter study.
(The subtropical climate zones of the world as of the late 20th century. Image source: Commons.)
Of particular interest to Cornwall and regions nearby is that the northward expansion of the subtropical regions of the world has long been a concern among climate scientists due to its ability to enhance desertification in highly-populated regions like Europe. The issue is that as the tropics and subtropics drift poleward, they bring hot, dry weather along with them. Because the subtropical regions support conditions conducive for arid climates, there is a high likelihood that deserts will march northward into more densely-inhabited regions.
A 2010 study by UCAR found that under continued fossil-fuel burning, the Sahara Desert essentially leaps across the Mediterranean and fully expands into southern and central Europe. In other words, though Cornwall may be able to support subtropical plants now, the northward movement of the arid zone related to the incoming warmth would make growing such plants an increasingly difficult prospect as time moves forward.
(A 2010 UCAR study found that drought zones dramatically expand as the tropical and subtropical climate zones march northward due to human-forced warming. Image source: Drought Under Global Warming.)
It's Not Just Cornwall — Climate Zones are Moving Everywhere
As we consider what the onset of intensified warming may mean for Cornwall — with deserts expanding and seas stratifying as they rise — it's also worth thinking a little bit about the related warming-forced movement of the world's isotherms. Isotherm is a meteorological term for a line connecting regions of the same temperature. Averaged over the coldest or warmest months of a year, these lines of temperature also mark the boundaries between climate zones.
The tropics, for example, are bounded in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres by a line of 18 C (64.4 F) average coldest-month temperatures. The edges of the two polar zones are bounded by a line of 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) average temperatures during the hottest months of the year (July in the Boreal region, January in the Austral region).
(NOAA global isotherm map. Image source: NOAA Climate Zones.)
Tucked between these two zones are the temperate and subtropical climates. Over the past 40 years, rapid warming has shoved these isotherms poleward. This shift has created a new climate reality for Cornwall and pretty much everywhere else.
At an average decadal march away from the Equator of about 35 miles, these respective climate boundaries have moved by around 140 miles over the last four decades, expanding the total reach of the tropic zone by 280 miles northward and southward. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar climate zone has shrunken toward the continental edges by about 14o miles, while in the Southern Hemisphere, the polar zone is shrinking off the tip of South America and across the Southern Ocean toward Antarctica by a similar distance.
These changes in the isotherms are rough measures, of course. In some places, like Cornwall, climate zones are moving toward the poles at an even faster rate. And the Arctic climate zone is notably shrinking at a more rapid rate than the Southern Hemisphere polar zone.
Rapid Climate Zone Movement Risks Species Extinction
Movement of these climate zones is driven by a rate of global warming in the range 0.15 to 0.20 degrees C every ten years, a pace of warming about 30 times faster than the warming at the end of the last ice age. As a result, plants and animals are finding that the habitats to which they've adapted are swiftly and dramatically changing. Plant and animal ranges have moved behind these climate zones at a rate of only about four miles every decade. Basically, habitats are moving too quickly for the creatures they support to catch up.
(As the globe warms due to fossil-fuel burning, the tropical Hadley cell expands even as the top of the polar and mid-latitude cells rise. This combination results in severe climate shifts and more persistent weather patterns due to a weakened polar jet stream. Such change in climate results in loss of animal habitat and increasingly difficult and extreme weather conditions for human beings. Image source: NASA/Commons.)
Back in 2008, climate scientist James Hansen noted:
If emissions of greenhouse gases continue to increase at the current rate—“business as usual”—then the rate of isotherm movement will double in this century to at least 70 miles per decade. If we continue on this path, a large fraction of the species on Earth, as many as 50 percent or more, may become extinct. The species most at risk are those in polar climates and the biologically diverse slopes of alpine regions. These animals, in effect, will be pushed off the planet—though some like the polar bear may be “rescued” and allowed to survive in zoos.
It is important to also consider that loss of plant habitat due to warming and drying is a primary driver of the mass tree death and increase in wildfire rates we have seen across the globe in recent years. Along with the mass exodus of fish from warming Equatorial oceans and the flipping-on of the global coral bleaching switch during 2014-2016, we can see these species-threatening impacts in heart-wrenching and terrifying effect today.
Given that the rapid poleward progression of the isotherms has continued since Hansen's 2008 writing, and given that the pace of global warming appears to have accelerated through the 2014 to 2016 period, it appears that their statement is all the more salient today — especially now that we are starting to see some of the mass loss of animal and plant life due to warming that Hansen mentioned. And especially since parts of Cornwall in England are now considered subtropical.

Radisson Hotel's AquaDom, Berlin
The Radisson Hotel in Berlin is home to the world's largest cylindrical aquarium, which acts as a stunning centerpiece in the lobby. Over 82 feet high and 36 feet in diameter, ‘AquaDom' is home to 2,600 fish of 56 different species. The hotel elevator goes up through the center of the acrylic cylinder, and some lucky guests get to gaze at it from their windows.
Europa Park Hotels, Rust
If you're just on a short trip to Europe, you can still experience its many nations (in the faux mini-metropolis style of Disney's Epcot or Las Vegas casinos) at Germany's largest theme park, Europa Park. The park, which is divided into sections named after various countries including Italy and Iceland, is also home to five full-sized hotels including Hotel Colosseo, a Roman-style resort inspired by the Colosseum. The hotel even has its own versions of Rome's many fountains.
Baumhaus Treehouse Hotel, Görlitz
If you're into something rustic but no less unusual, how about a stay in an actual tree house? The Baumhaus Hotel just outside Görlitz opened in 2005 with five tree houses to choose from, some perched between branches and others free-standing. Much like at a camp, you'll find basic sleeping accomodations in the tree houses themselves while the central area offers campfires, toilets and a true German perk: beer-filled mini-bars.
Hotel Q!, Berlin
This hip boutique hotel was designed by none other than GRAFT studio, known for being a favorite of architecture-loving actor Brad Pitt. The award-winning interior design focuses on fluid lines – you'll find very few right angles in the 77 understated guest rooms, where neutral tones and wood grain are occasionally punctuated with a pop of dramatic red.
Michelberger Hotel, Berlin
Can a budget hotel with minimal funds for decorating be cool and stylish? The answer to that question is clearly yes, if you've ever seen the Michelberger Hotel in Berlin. A group of friend got together to create a low-cost hotel with a comfy vibe that makes you feel like you're crashing at a friend's place. It's fun, bright and airy with incredibly creative touches like a lobby decorated exclusively with magazines and a guest room wall covered in old books.
25Hours Hotel, Hamburg
Still more proof that you don't have to have a lot of cash to stay in a super-cool stylish hotel is the 25Hours Hotel in Hamburg. Designed by 3META with an open floor plan emphasizing communal space and a retro 1960s vibe, the 25Hours Hotel is packed with 420 convex chrome mirrors, shag carpets and mod lighting.
Rolling ‘Rotel Tours' Hotel Bus
It's German in origin and spirit, but when you stay at this hotel, you can go practically anywhere. A company called Rotel Tours takes travelers on journeys across Europe, Africa and Asia in modified buses with individual curtained bunks measuring six feet long, three feet deep and three feet high. There's a toilet, but you can only shower when the bus makes an ‘occasional' stop at a campground just for this purpose.
KANPUR: The deduction in budget allocation to IIT-K last year has started showing its impact now. The IIT-K, which needs a budget of Rs 261 crore annually, was allocated Rs 175 crore. The amount was released by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (HRD) in parts. Since the allocated amount has proved not to be enough to run the institute and for paying salaries to the staff, the IITK administration has urged the Ministry of HRD to release some additional funds. The IITK authorities are expecting to receive additional funds by the end of March. Till then the institute administration has used its internal funds to meet the crisis and is anxiously waiting for the funds to flow in. The fund crisis has impacted so much that the expansion within the IIT such as construction of the new buildings (hostels) has either slowed down or closed for the moment. The entire trouble began last year when for the academic year 2015-16, 175 crores were allocated to IITKanpur, about Rs 75 crores less than the previous financial year.The reliable sources informed TOI that the staff and the faculty has received their salaries and allowances of March month and the problem would get solved when the fresh sum of grant would come by the end of the ongoing month. The sources said that if the crisis of funds will prevail in the coming time it will completely impact the research work in the IIT-K. The board of governors of IITK which met on Saturday on the institute campus also discussed the fund crisis issue and its impact on the institute. This is for the first time that fund crisis problem has occured before the IIT-Kanpur.Chairman of Board of Governors of IITKanpur, RC Bhargava accepted that the fund crisis has affected the pace of work that were going on in the institute campus. They said that budget has been phenomenoally slashed by the Ministry (HRD). "For higher education and institutes such as IITs, higher sum of money should be allocated instead of slashing them down. The IITs will have to think and plan how to increase its internal finance sources. IITs will do a long term planning to solve the problem. Hopefully government and IITs will together work out the crisis. It has to be seen that our revenue increases and expenditures are curtailed", said Bhargava while talking to the newspersons.Talking to TOI, director IIT-K, Prof Indranil Manna acknowledged that the deduction in the budget for IITK has started showing its impact, but refused to comment how the financial crisis was being addressed. They said that some additional funds would be made available by the ministry of HRD by the end of March. "We have already communicated the fund crisis issue to the ministry and it has assured of financial help", said Prof Manna. They refrained from commenting further regarding how amount would be granted to IITKanpur to meet the challenge."Everyone has got the salary and they will continue to get their salaries in future also", said IIT-K director. They also said that the government wants the IITs be self-reliant in terms of generating own sources of income and therefore, the budget was cut last year and we are moving ahead in direction of being self reliant.TOI in June last year had published a article titled 'IIT-K annual budget slashed drastically' whereby highlighting that the steep decline in the MHRD grant has shaken the institute as its administration has to manage the salaries and allowances of the staff and the faculty and also conduct research work. The fund crisis caused then is now impacting the premier IIT-Kanpur on a major scale.
It was fun
At this point, you're probably asking yourself who this Simon character is exactly, and why anyone would put stock in their book.
As far as the Simon Necronomicon is concerned, you'd be hard pressed to prove that it's actually an ancient magical text. The fact of the matter is that there is no record of a Necronomicon existing prior to H.P. Lovecraft's invention, and the manuscript that Simon says they received from some rare book thieves is nowhere to be found. (The thieves, Huback and Hapo, are real, however. But there's nothing to tie them to this caper. It looks like Simon brought a real news item into their story to add verisimilitude — just as Lovecraft would have, if this were one of their stories.)
The most common theory is that the role of Simon is being played by The Dark Lord author Peter Levenda. According to a brief bio from the Coast to Coast AM website, Simon "has appeared on television and radio discussing such topics as exorcism, Satanism, and Nazism," as has Levenda. In fact, when Simon appeared on the talk show, they attempted to disguise their voice by speaking through some sort of audio effect that lowered the pitch a couple of steps. When I played the audio file on my computer and pitched it back up using Ableton Live software, the unmasked Simon's voice clearly sounded like that of the Peter Levenda I interviewed earlier this year. Most tellingly, if you do a record search at the US Copyright Office website, "Peter Levenda (Simon, pseud.)" appears as the copyright owner on two of Simon's books (The Gates of the Necronomicon and Papal Magic).
"The Necronomicon should be in the hands of the people."
I asked Alan Cabal, a former child actor, who — in addition to playing "Stanley" on one memorable episode of the Patty Duke Show — worked at The Magickal Childe "off and on" from 1978 until the early 1990s, whether Simon and Levenda were in fact the same.
"Levenda is such a fuckin' snake, man," Cabal replied. "He's doing lectures as Simon at The Magickal Childe. He's doing workshops as Simon. And then all of a sudden, they decided to not be Simon."
When I asked Levenda to respond, their answer was short and to the point.
"No," they said. But "I'm perfectly flattered to be confused with Simon."
When asked by Ian Punnett on Coast to Coast AM why they released the Necronomicon, Simon's answer mirrored that of Burroughs. "The Necronomicon should be in the hands of the people," they told host Ian Punnett. "I think we as people have been betrayed by our leaders in many different areas. I don't know if we can trust them to protect us, quite frankly."
But there's another motivation for having produced this hoax-Necronomicon, and it's one that I can't say I disagree with.
"It was fun," Peter Levenda said on a recent Thelema Now! podcast. They were talking about the New York occult renaissance of the 1970s and 1980s in general, a scene that flowered in that brief moment between Vietnam and the conservative counter-revolution in the 1980s where people thought that they could inject some positive magic into everyday life, a sense of adventure that perhaps was overshadowed by the heaviness of the times — and of the Necronomicon.
"There was this window of opportunity," they continue looking back on the occult resurgence of the 1970s, when "we wanted to show that this is not scary stuff. It could be powerful, it could be mind-altering, it could change your life. But it was not dangerous, it was not going to kill you. And that's what we were trying to promote."
I recently paid a visit to the former location of The Magickal Childe. Herman Slater died of AIDS in 1992 and their store folded soon after. In its place there's now a restaurant called Sala One Nine. It was a quiet evening (they ended up closing at 11:00PM) and the place was low-key, dimly lit. I tried to get a sense of what was there once before, of the rich history of the location, but I couldn't. It's just another fine dining establishment in a city that's feeling pretty one-dimensional these days. Before I left, I spoke to the restaurant's manager. I wanted to know if they knew anything about The Magickal Childe.
"Oh yes," they said. "I see them all the time."
Him? Them? I couldn't quite hear what they were saying. So I asked, "What do you mean? People come in often and ask about the shop?"
"No," they replied. "I mean the ghost!"
Apparently, they felt it the first time they entered the space. This presence. I didn't notice it, but then again I could be run over by a truck and I might not notice (strike it up to my journalist's keen sense of situational awareness). The ghost never bothers her, it turns out — but none of the men working there will be in the store alone, after hours. The ghost won't leave them alone.
Why are they off limits, while the men get so much grief?
The manager says, with a laugh: "It's a gay ghost!"
The world of H.P. Lovecraft might be a bleak one, but at least Herman Slater's still having fun. Wherever they are.
Colgate forward Kyle Baun is getting a fresh start.
The 22-year-old free agent, who was being wooed by several teams, has agreed to terms on an entry-level contract with the Chicago Blackhawks, as first reported by TSN's Bob McKenzie and later confirmed by Baun's agent.
Happy to confirm that new client Kyle Baun (@Bauner27) has agreed to terms with Chicago Blackhawks. They will report to the team this season. — Brian Bartlett (@BBarts) March 26, 2015
The Detroit Red Wings, Calgary Flames, Winnipeg Jets and Edmonton Oilers were believed to be among the teams most interested in acquiring Baun's services.
Baun will have to forego their senior year at Colgate in order to turn pro. In 113 regular-season NCAA games, he's recorded 39 goals and 38 assists.
He's also expected to suit up for the team as early as this season.
Inspired by London's extensive history of countercultural movements, SWEAR have introduced its Air Revive collection, including a trio of eye-catching styles with chunky outsoles and sock uppers.
The platform sneakers evoke '90s rave aesthetics, featuring stretch faux leather or mesh for the upper, and a chunky, translucent sole unit. While the shoes come in a variety of colors at Farfetch, the true head turners from the collection come in its red, pink, and blue colorways. That said, for an extra $60, the futuristic sneakers are entirely customizable via the SWEAR London website, so you can have a truly unique pair of shoes that merge all of 2018's biggest trends.
One Highsnobiety staffer who can't get enough of SWEAR's Air Rev. Triggers is our curator Rhianna Matthews, who has been playing around with Swear's customizable functions to bring you two of their own designs. Being the first to admit that these styles aren't the easiest to throw on with your everyday get-up, she's also offered some styling tips for their own black, white and grey creations.
The shoes are available now for a price of $440, or $498 for customized versions. Browse our favorites below.
Customized Sneakers
“These aren't the easiest sneakers to style,” says Rhi. “But with the right custom they will look fire with some of 2018's most futuristic and utilitarian pieces. These U.P.W.W joints or the reflective nylon pants from A-COLD-WALL* (both grails of mine) will look dope either tucked in or left loose. I'd pair that with this monochrome printed shirt from Heliot Emil and an A-COLD-WALL* side bag (A bit of a fan of ACW, if you can't tell).”

The yoga spiel, if you will, is one with which I am very familiar. It's your time, your practice, and all that. But sometimes, despite even our most valiant efforts to block out the rest of the world and the thoughts that come with it, things happen in yoga class that readily flood our consciousness with that dreaded and familiar feeling of "oh crap." And then, we put ourselves through that horrible ringer of trying to convince our minds that no one else is feeling this way, while still knowing that everyone really is. It's like asking your kindergarten teacher which of their students are their favorites, and listening when they say they don't have any, but knowing that she's lying to your 5 year old face. Because we're told over and over again that yoga is a personal and private experience, so we shouldn't ever feel awkward or self-conscious...but just like your kindergarten teacher shouldn't have any favorites, the things that we should do and the things that we do do have never really been the same thing. So yeah, I am here to admit that yoga class can definitely feel awkward.
And here are the times I notice it most...
8. Arriving first to a class you've never been before.
All I'm asking for is a simple "Place Mat Here" sign. It's not that easy to just guess which direction a class usually orients itself, and for some reason, NO ONE EVER TELLS YOU. It's become some sort of unspoken yoga code to haze all class newcomers by watching them spin around in a circle like lost puppies before finally placing their mats down, and then setting up your mat right next to them in the completely different (and right) direction without acknowledging them or the fact that their misaligned mat is facing the wrong way.
7. Falling onto someone (and vice versa)
Now, this has never actually happened to me, but I've watched it happen to other people, and it does not look fun. The faller usually looks incredibly embarrassed and possibly slightly injured, and the falled-upon just looks pissed.
6. Being the only student that comes to a yoga class.
I didn't always think this stroke of chance was an awkward turn of events. I used to revel in my good fortune that I was simply ticking off a class in my 20-pack for what some people would pay good amounts of cash. It was really just like getting a free private class. But that was until I worked in a yoga studio and had to listen to the groans of the teachers when their class numbers dipped below 3. Apparently not all yoga teachers are very appreciative of this special one-on-one time…
5.Falling asleep in Savasana.
This one has a caveat. Sometimes no one notices. If you can manage to wake yourself up before it's time to roll over, you're golden. But, we all know that's a rarity. If you fall asleep in Savasana, chances are that you're out. It's even worse if you're a snorer. No one's fooling anyone if that's the case. If you don't snore, you could try to brush it off like you were just in such a tranquil and relaxed state that you decided to continue to lie there until students from the next class started to file in around you. But, if your teacher has to nudge you to wake you up, game over.
4. The boundary-less touch of certain teachers' assists.
Ah, the joys of assists. When they're good, they are goooooood, but then there are the other times – the awkward slip of the hand or when you wonder if your teacher knows what they or they are touching. There's really no good way to describe it other than AWKWARD. It becomes especially uncomfortable if your teacher fumbles afterwards and whispers an embarrassing “sorry” before sidestepping out of view. This usually only happens with two members of opposite genders, but I've been party to it all.
3. Walking into class late and having to ask everyone to move over so you can fit your mat somewhere
What makes #6 even worse is that you know it's your fault! You're the late one, so maybe you deserve all those nasty glances thrown your way by the already very crowded class onto which you just stumbled. But, some of those stares are so icy you would think you had just asked Patrick Swayze to put Baby in the corner, instead of the “calm and forgiving” yoga student that you asked to slide their mat over three-quarters of an inch.
2. The guy next to you farts really loudly in Prasarita Padottanasana (wide-legged forward fold) - a.k.a your head is directly behind is butt.
I think this one has a pretty self-explanatory awkward-factor. Especially if you happen to come down with an uncontrollable case of the giggles…or if you're “the guy.”
1. The guy next to you farts really loudly in Prasarita Padottanasana and then apologizes for it.
There are some things that should just not be addressed. Farting within close proximity to someone else's head is definitely one of those things.
A few white supremacists and Nazis gathered in Charlottesville, and the whole country is now on edge. The mistake we made is giving them attention as if they represent something more than a fringe of a fringe. They do not. Ninety nine percent of Americans – including the President – appropriately denounce them and their worldview.
The white supremacists are rejected by the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, colleges, universities, public schools, and the people, so how did 50 nut cases capture the attention of the entire nation?
First, extreme leftists went to the rally with sticks, bats, and the hope of having a violent confrontation. They were not disappointed. Three people died as a result. If no one had shown up to counter-protest and the media had simply acknowledged that they were there, it would have been the proverbial tree falling in the forest with no one to hear the sound.
The sad truth is that the mainstream media needs this as much as the Nazis because violence and chaos bring ratings and money. Once bricks and bats and fists start flying and cars are turned into weapons, it's an international story that no journalist can ignore.
There has to be a better way to solve the centuries-old problem of race in America. If not, future generations will be witnessing race riots in perpetuity. To the immediate issue -- the Confederate monuments and symbols -- it's time to put them in museums and historical parks set aside for that purpose. At this point they are little more than a lightning rod for confrontations between white racists and left-wing extremists.
As an American of African descent, I am not a fan of the Confederacy. However, my wife and I visited the Confederate Museum in Richmond. It is part of American history and it is more complicated than the racial narrative. There was loyalty to family, friends, and state. There was the unresolved issue of where federal authority ends and state power begins. Many who fought for the South were brave and honorable, but they were on the wrong side of history. Most southerners who want to honor their heritage are not racists and haters. Nor can our Founding Fathers be dismissed merely as slaveowners.
We Americans are great at contextualizing our present: criminals, we are told, are the byproduct of poverty and black people's problems are vestiges of slavery and Jim Crow. However, we are very poor at contextualizing the past. America did not invent slavery, but the way our history is told, you would think it started here. Our Founding Fathers did not wake up one day and decide that it would be a good thing to enslave sub-Saharan Africans. They inherited the “peculiar institution” which was not peculiar at all for the times and is still being practiced today in some nations under Muslim rule. In spite of being steeped in the culture of slavery and benefitting immensely from it economically, America's Founders wrote about its evil and debated how it should end.
Slavery almost derailed both the Declaration and the Constitution. Our Founders yielded to the need for unity rather than immediate moral correction. Had they chosen the immediate moral rectitude of ending slavery, we might not have a country now because at least two colonies adamantly opposed the mere denunciation of slavery.
That is why the treatment of the Confederate flag and monuments must be different from the treatment of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and our other founding patriots. Yes, these three were among those who owned slaves, but they also gave us the world's greatest experiment in human freedom. They understood that freedom is the inherent right of every human being, even slaves, and they said so in their writings.
We all are works in progress -- learning, growing and getting better as human beings. Sometimes we see things differently as we grow older and presumably wiser. The Founding Fathers were also human beings navigating a complicated world. Despite their imperfections, they established the greatest nation in history. We are heirs to their legacy of freedom, and they deserve gratitude, not disdain.
Wanting statues and monuments of the Founding Fathers pulled down is the sentiment of those trapped in stupidity and ingratitude. We all live under what Dr. King called the “majestic words” of the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Shall we strike those words from our history because a slaveowner wrote them?
Our Founders created a nation. The Confederacy would have divided it. These have two very different places in American history, but history is still history, the good, the bad and the ugly. It should be remembered and studied lest we repeat it.
The white supremacists and far left seem to want just that -- to repeat history and fight the Civil War again. We must not give them what they want.

Barack Obama has some boning up to do, at least according to Hillary Clinton's chief spokesperson, Howard Wolfson.
Even as Wolfson's boss, the presidential candidate, and their husband, the ex-president, have been doing their part to fuel speculation about a potential Clinton-Obama Democratic ticket (see here and here), the aide today -- making clear they were speaking for the campaign -- doused some cold water on the notion.
During a conference call with reporters, Wolfson said: “We do not believe at this point that Sen. Obama has passed that key commander-in-chief test” that Clinton would require for a running mate.
But the aide held out the prospect that Obama could buff up their resume and meet the threshold (whatever it is) between now and the party's national convention in Denver in late August.
Perhaps they have a reading list that they can provide Obama (who late last week sought to scotch the prospect that they would be willing to play second fiddle to Clinton).
More on Wolfson's comments can by found in this Chicago Tribune post.

A police officer repeatedly used their stun gun on a pregnant woman during a traffic stop in Mississippi. They were struck in the abdomen despite repeatedly pleading with officers not to hurt them
Aviana White, 27, was in their brother's car when they were pulled over for speeding and allegedly driving without a license on Monday, reports the Miami Herald.
White shouted “Wait, I'm pregnant,” and “Don't Tase me, I'm pregnant!” eyewitness Alicia Burton, who captured some of the violent arrest on camera, told the Miami Herald.
“That was a situation that escalated that didn't have to escalate the way it did,” Burton added.
WARNING: The following video contains explicit language. Viewer discretion advised.
Police Chief Tim Hendricks claims that the officer in charge became wary of White as the traffic stop progressed, as they were defiant and created a “heightened sense of awareness” after refusing to give them name.
It later emerged that White had an outstanding arrest warrant from 2014 for misdemeanor domestic violence.
The Pass Christian Police Department reportedly has four videotapes of the incident, which it's declining to release as the criminal case against White is ongoing.
RT.com has reached out to the police department for comment.
‘We only kill black people,right?' says US cop trying to reassure driver during routine stop https://t.co/IlnAC6c649pic.twitter.com/WfB0ywPBe7 — RT (@RT_com) September 1, 2017
After visiting the local hospital for a checkup, White did not show up for a pre-arranged interview with the police Tuesday morning. They were later arrested and charged with the felony of assaulting a police officer.
“She was very defiant with the officer, and that's what led up to this,” Hendricks said. “The officer asked them repeatedly to stay in the car and they refused to do that.”
“I think the charges are justified,” they added.
High-profile HTC ROM maker mike1986 has produced screenshots purporting to be from the next version of HTC's Android-based UI, Sense 5.5 . Among the most significant changes in the gallery of 15 images are the presence of an easy toggle for BlinkFeed — HTC's home screen reader, which currently cannot be disabled on HTC One device. Elsewhere in BlinkFeed, there are new categories to select, and a custom topics tab.
There also appears to be a new menu for customizing and re-ordering the quick settings in the notification shade, and new options here include a "Do Not Disturb" mode. In addition, the HTC keyboard features some new emoji icons, and the task-switcher has been re-scaled with bigger preview windows.
The camera app has grown two new features — "Panorama+" and "Dual Capture." It's unclear what's different about Panorama+ compared to the regular Sweep Panorama setting (a Photosphere-type mode, perhaps?) It's also likely the "dual capture" mode is something similar to Samsung's Dual Shot mode, which shoots image using the front and rear camera simultaneously.
Besides the feature changes, it's mostly the same HTC Sense we've come to know over the past year, and we've confirmed with a knowledgeable source that this is indeed an accurate representation of Sense 5.5. However with Android 4.3 updates currently being pushed out with Sense 5.0 onboard, it could be a while before we see the new UI rolling out to HTC phones.

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- The great athletes often have a routine they swear by to get ready for competition, and Harrison Smith is no different. Now in their fourth season, Smith has become one of the NFL's best safeties. Each Saturday morning, they begin their final preparations for Sunday's game the same way: With a glazed croissant.
"For me, it starts my routine for a game, as stupid as that sounds," Smith said.
He's not alone. The Vikings' Saturday Donut Club dates from the days of quarterback Gus Frerotte bringing pastries to the facility on Saturday mornings. It evolved with defensive players like Jared Allen, Kevin Williams, Brian Robison and Chad Greenway, who introduced it to tight end Kyle Rudolph when they were a rookie. The weekly training room tradition now involves more than a dozen players most weeks.
"It's kind of taken on a whole persona of its own," Rudolph said. "I can't think of a better way to start off a Saturday morning. It's funny -- all the different superstitions and rules guys go with, getting the same donut every week, or eating more or less (depending on how they played). I don't ever switch it up, but some guys do. It's pretty cool."
What are the rules of Donut Club? The first one, apparently, is not, "Don't talk about Donut Club," because athletic trainer Eric Sugarman tweets out a picture of the gathering each Saturday and players were willing to share the details on their sugary selections. The standards have gotten looser, Smith said, now that more players are involved and vanguards like Allen and Williams are gone. But when they were drafted in the first round in 2012, Smith's selection didn't come with an open invitation.
Players meet at 8 a.m. on Saturdays, well before they need to be at the facility for meetings or the Saturday walk-through. Even players who are getting treatment for an injury on Saturdays have to make an early trip to the Vikings' facility for donuts, so the get-together is a bit of an open secret.
"Nobody really tells you about it," Smith said. "If you're in the training room, you see it. I probably saw it halfway through my rookie year, and I was like, 'Alright -- I want to get involved in this.'"
Sugarman -- an aptly-named mastermind for a donut operation if ever there was one -- typically places an order on Fridays at YoYo Donuts and Coffee Bar in nearby Minnetonka. And whether by consistent attendance or by acts of service -- like picking up the donuts, as Smith did as a rookie -- players have to show commitment before they get their official Donut Club T-shirt.
"They're definitely on a trial run," Robison said. "They have to earn their shirts. They don't just get their stuff as soon as they come in. They have to kind of earn their keep."
Many players are committed to their weekly standby, though there's a varied list of preferences; Robison is devoted to the jelly donut, while Rudolph prefers a custard-filled chocolate long john. Fusco, the salt-of-the-earth lineman from Division II Slippery Rock University, is a "big glazed guy -- it's got to be glazed, with any kind of topping," while Smith acknowledges their pastry of choice technically isn't a donut.
Approaches may vary, but on Saturday mornings -- the calm before the storm in a NFL locker room -- a chance to build camaraderie means something to Vikings players.
"You want to know the guys you're playing with," Robison said. "At the same time, you want to make this game as much fun as you possibly can, because there are times where it can be a grind. It's just a way for us to come in, have fun with each other and have a good time."
So as you wake up on Saturday mornings in the fall, the Vikings are laying a path to victory on Sundays. And for some players, though not all, that path has a hole in the middle.
Growing up in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm, I could only dream and imagine about how different life in the United States would be. Yet, 20 years later in Oakland, it feels almost as violent as the warzone my family and I tried to escape.
It has been about one year since seven students were killed in a deadly massacre at Oikos University in Oakland and the shooting involving 26 innocent lives at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. that both shook our nation to its very core. Thirty-three lives were stripped from this Earth because of senseless, twisted acts of violence.
Every year, more than 30,000 people are killed in the U.S. from firearms, and it comes at a cost of billions of dollars in health expenditures. The issues surrounding gun violence, a leading cause of preventable death, are complex and deeply rooted, which is why we must take a comprehensive public health approach to reducing its menace on society.
Despite the clear horror of these events and demand for action from the public, Congress has still failed to move forward on comprehensive gun violence legislation. Each passing day that Congress delays action, more communities bear witness to the endless episodes of gun violence. This ugly reality will continue to intrude upon our communities across the country, including our very own Alameda County, unless meaningful action is taken by our lawmakers.
There are several critical pieces to any legislation that Congress must pass in order to reduce the staggering toll of gun violence and ensure the safety of our community.
First, our legislators must ensure that federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have adequate and unrestricted funding to conduct research on the causes of injury and deaths from firearms, as well as how to prevent these tragedies. They must also ensure there is adequate data available to design targeted gun violence prevention strategies. We can achieve this through a nationwide expansion of the CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System, a state-based violent-death-prevention tool that links data from public health, law enforcement, medical examiners and social service agencies to create a more complete picture of the circumstances surrounding violent death.
Second, our safety also depends on the passage of life-saving measures that would ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and mandate background checks for all gun purchases. These measures enjoy broad appeal among Americans. According to a recent Gallup poll, 91 percent of Americans favor background checks.
Additionally, state, local and community-based behavioral health systems must also have the resources they need to provide much-needed mental health treatment to those in need. About 82 percent of Americans support increased funding for mental health services for youth, according to a recent Gallup poll. Unfortunately, funding at the federal and state levels for mental health continues to be threatened by cuts. The Affordable Care Act provides comprehensive coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services as part of its Essential Health Benefits, but we must still ensure funding at the federal and state levels are not jeopardized.
Our school policies must also promote a positive school climate to support the social, emotional and learning needs of all students to maintain a safe environment. To achieve this, schools and communities need resources and support for comprehensive measures in school-based prevention, early intervention strategies and preparedness initiatives to prevent gun violence and prepare our communities and schools in the event of an emergency.
As an advocate for public health in Alameda County, I am pleased to see that President Obama has included many of these provisions in their plan to reduce gun violence. Now it is time for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other representatives to push Congress to act now. I cannot afford to wait. Nor can we all afford to rely on the status quo and still assume that our nation's children are safe in school, on our city streets or in our homes. It is time we place public health before political interests and recognize that this effort will require the great resolve and political will on behalf of our nation's leaders.
The violence that takes place in Oakland every single day batters our communities and has everything to do with public health. Just recently, Gloria Crowell, District 4 commissioner representing Supervisor Nate Miley on the Alameda County Public Health Commission, highlighted the need for renewing our county's level of commitment and effort to address the issue. Not too long ago, Supervisor Miley brought together police and safety officers, along with other community organizations in order to collaborate on how to most effectively solve our community's gun violence and public health crisis. Such efforts should be applauded and expanded upon.
Now is the time to work together to ensure evidence-based public health principles are at the heart of all our efforts to reduce gun violence-related injury and death, as it is both an imperative and a national priority to ensure the safety of our nations' rich and valued diversity.

On iterating and decoding sum types in Elm
Sylvain Kieffer Blocked Unblock Follow May 3, 2017
EXPERIMENTAL
Thanks to imright_anduknowit and Enumerable_any on Reddit for their suggestions.
In Elm you don't have a native way to list all tags in a sum type.
Let's say we have a Fruit type defined as :
type Fruit
= Orange
| Lemon
| Apple
How can you create a list of all fruits ([Orange, Lemon, Fruit]) without missing one ?
First, let's create a function nextFruit which given a Fruit will return a Maybe Fruit which represent the next fruit in the sum :
nextFruit : Maybe Fruit -> Maybe Fruit
nextFruit maybeCurrentFruit =
case maybeCurrentFruit of
Nothing ->
Just Orange
Just currentFruit ->
case currentFruit of
Orange ->
Just Lemon
Lemon ->
Just Apple
Apple ->
Nothing
Next, let's create our Fruit list :
fruitList : List Fruit
fruitList =
let
buildFruitList : Maybe Fruit -> List Fruit -> List Fruit
buildFruitList maybeCurrentFruit allFruits =
case maybeCurrentFruit of
Nothing ->
allFruits
Just currentFruit ->
buildFruitList (nextFruit maybeCurrentFruit) (currentFruit :: allFruits)
in
buildFruitList (nextFruit Nothing) []
If you run fruitList you will get [Apple, Lemon, Orange].
Now, if you add Banana in Fruit, you will get a compiler error saying that the case in nextFruit doesn't handle the Banana possibility. You'll have to rewrite it :
nextFruit : Maybe Fruit -> Maybe Fruit
nextFruit maybeCurrentFruit =
case maybeCurrentFruit of
Nothing ->
Just Orange
Just currentFruit ->
case currentFruit of
Orange ->
Just Lemon
Lemon ->
Just Apple
Apple ->
Just Banana
Banana ->
Nothing
Ok, let's be honest : you can make errors while writing the nextFruit function but 1/, you will be warned that a new tag has been added to the type and 2/, you can generate this code from the type declaration.
The final touch will be writing a function that given a String will return a Maybe Fruit :
fruitFromString : String -> Maybe Fruit
fruitFromString fruitString =
fruitList
|> List.filter (\x -> toString x == fruitString)
|> List.head
fruitFromString “Apple” will return Just Apple, fruitFromString “Pineapple” will return Nothing.
Michael Phelps decided to give it one more shot, and as a result they cemented themselves in the minds of a whole new generation of American sports fans.
The 31-year-old won a gold medal -- their fifth of the 2016 Rio Olympics and 23rd overall -- by swimming the butterfly in the 4x100-meter medley relay on Saturday night in the final race of their career.
The U.S. edged Great Britain and Australia in a time of 3:27.95, a new Olympic record, to take the gold. The U.S. has never lost the men's medley relay in Olympic history.
Ryan Murphy led off by swimming a world record in the backstroke, giving the U.S. a 1.7-second lead. Cody Miller did their job next with the breaststroke leg. Phelps went third, with Nathan Adrian finishing things up with their freestyle.
"We put together great relays," Phelps said after the race. "Murph starting off with a world record is just insane. ... I've had the opportunity to be on some of the greatest relays of all time. It truly is an honor."

Leading up to and throughout the games, Phelps has continually reiterated that they will retire after their last race in Rio de Janeiro. If they do, they certainly will have gone out on top.
"I'm just ready for something different," Phelps continued. "My swimming career might be over, but I have the future ahead of me to turn the page and start whatever I want. It's not the end of a career, it's the beginning of a new journey."
At the Rio Games, Phelps won individual gold in the 200-meter individual medley and the 200-meter butterfly, while taking silver in the 100-meter butterfly. They also won team gold in the 4x100- and 4x200-meter freestyle relays, along with Saturday's 4x100-meter medley relay.
That's a total of five golds and a silver for the most decorated Olympian of all time.
In 2016, Phelps participated in their fifth Olympic Games. If they have indeed decided to retire, they will finish their historic career with 28 total medals, including 23 gold. Remarkably their first gold medal came in 2000 as a 15-year-old.

Fatih Macoglu, mayor of the central-eastern town of Ovacik, said that their municipality had reached an agreement with 40 local beekeepers from the Tunceli Beekeepers Association to produce organic honey to be distributed across Turkey, primarily sold online.
“Those who buy the communist honey will taste good quality honey," said Macoglu, speaking to the Dogan News Agency.
"They will get a taste of us and will become more communist."

Macoglu, a member of one of Turkey's numerous communist parties (several of which are banned), took their position on 14 April after beating rival candidates from the left-of-centre Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) and ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), making them the first self-identifying communist to win such a position in modern Turkish history.
Prior to 2001, the term "communist" was banned in Turkey due to the military-oriented state's fears of leftist insurrection and Cold War tensions. In wider Turkish society, communism was often identified with instability and atheism.
However, Macoglu's term in Ovacik - located in the Alevi-majority province of Tunceli - has been lauded by locals who praised their creation of local infrastructure and agriculture projects, the establishment of local assemblies for different ethnic, religious and gender groups, and their down-to-earth attitudes, eschewing the standard mayoral car and getting directly involved with local projects.
A previous venture saw Ovacik cleaning up and cultivating government-owned land for the production of beans and chickpeas which were then released on to the market.
“Everyone who has bought our peas and chickpeas has said ‘We bought communist peas and chickpeas,'" explained Macoglu. "And from now on ‘communist honey' has entered Turkey's lexicon."
Speaking to Al-Monitor previously, Macoglu said that there had been apprehension at the possibility of a communist-controlled town in Turkey, but that their efforts had managed to win people over.
"I think at first people were curious about what a communist looks like. We had what we call 'political tourism,' people were coming into town to check out if we are monsters," they explained
"I think most of the reception has been quite positive. Of course, we always remember we come from a tradition of heroes, heroes of the socialist and communist traditions. It was not even easy to be 'left-wing' in politics, let alone be called a communist, but perceptions are changing with positive services provided to all people."
Macoglu was elected as a member of the legal Communist Party of Turkey (TKP) which has since split into the Communist Party (KP) and the People's Communist Party of Turkey (HTKP), following a period of internal strife in 2014.
A number of communist parties, including the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C), Communist Workers Party of Turkey (TKIP) and the Marxist Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) are banned in Turkey and have carried out attacks using AK-47s and suicide bombings.

It was like a scene from a movie. On late Tuesday afternoon, residents in Caracas saw a blue police helicopter circling the capital, carrying a banner that read "Libertad,” or "freedom,” and the number "350" — a reference, my colleagues explained, "to the article in the Venezuelan constitution that allows people to 'disown' their government if it acts in an undemocratic way.”
Government officials said the chopper then dropped a number of grenades on Venezuela's Supreme Court buildings and strafed the Interior Ministry. On Wednesday, authorities were on the hunt for the alleged ringleader of the attack, Oscar Perez, an actor who also served in the country's special forces.
In a country wracked by political turmoil and economic collapse, the helicopter incident — framed as a coup attempt by embattled President Nicolás Maduro and their supporters — happened to be just one explosive episode in yet another a day of chaos. Protests and counter-protests continued in several Venezuelan cities; pro-government supporters stormed the National Assembly, which is dominated by opposition legislators; Maduro made an incendiary televised speech, warning darkly of further violence.
"If Venezuela was plunged into chaos and violence and the Bolivarian Revolution destroyed, we would go to combat,” Maduro said to a crowd of supporters, referring to the socialist, populist platform that transformed Venezuela under their charismatic predecessor, Hugo Chávez. "We would never give up, and what couldn't be done with votes, we would do with weapons. We would liberate the fatherland with weapons.”

Since the onset of the crisis three months ago, at least 76 people have died in clashes between protesters, armed counter-protesters and security forces. The majority of those killed have been civilians. Experts worry that Venezuela could drift into outright civil war without outside diplomatic intervention.
"Maduro and the top officials who surround them appear determined to remain in power at any cost, despite increasing regional isolation and growing signs of division within the government and the military,” my colleague Nick Miroff wrote earlier this month. "A more dramatic rupture within Venezuela's armed forces could be a worst-case scenario if it sparks internecine fighting.”
That's why Perez's helicopter mission seemed so alarming. Maduro and their allies wasted no time describing the incident as right-wing terrorism abetted by outside powers. In a video uploaded to social media, Perez said their group was a nonpartisan military alliance of soldiers and police that sought no conflict with the country's security forces.
"It's against the impunity imposed by this government,” Perez said in the video, which shows them flanked by masked men with guns. "It's against tyranny. It's against the deaths of young people who are fighting for their legitimate rights. It's against hunger.”
But by Wednesday, many in Venezuela had started to question whether the attack, which fitted so conveniently into the government's narrative, was a false flag. The conspicuousness of Perez's own showbiz career — they starred in an action film called "Death Suspended” — raised eyebrows and confusion.
"Right now, I only see two possibilities: Either the pilot was tricked or it was staged,” Félix Seijas Rodríguez, a political analyst in Caracas, said to my colleagues Rachelle Krygier and Joshua Partlow. "It makes no sense.”
"Some people say it is a setup, some that it is real,” said Julio Borges, leader of the opposition-controlled legislature. "Yesterday was full of contradictions ... A thousand things are happening, but I summarize it like this: A government is decaying and rotting, while a nation is fighting for dignity."

Francisco Toro, the editor of the website Caracas Chronicles, summed up the moment: "The 'Chopper Coupster' episode, in all its glorious surrealism, comes just as the regime needed to draw attention away from its latest power grabs: a decision hollowing out the Prosecutor General's office of most of its powers, and a straight-up assault on parliament. Lots and lots of crazy things happening out there, folks. And guys like Oscar Pérez will only sprinkle on more crazy.”
Meanwhile, the country is spiraling deeper into crisis. Although they are profoundly unpopular, Maduro is clinging on to what levers of state power they still control. They have called a July 30 election for a new special assembly that could amend the country's constitution — changes that may only add more fuel to the fire. The opposition intends to boycott the vote, and it is likely that the days around the balloting will see even more clashes erupt on the streets.
Under Chávez, Venezuela saw the dramatic uplift of millions of poor people, boosted by new social programs that were funded by the oil-rich state's coffers. But years of corruption, mismanagement and a drop in oil prices have devastated the country, sparking perennial food shortages and a range of dizzying public health crises.
"There has been terrible economic and social destruction,” wrote Enrique Krauze, a historian and commentator on Latin American affairs. "Across 15 years, a trillion dollars' worth of oil income has been squandered and 80 percent of Venezuelans have fallen into poverty. The estimated inflation rate for 2017 is 720 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.”
Maduro's government has desperately sought to secure emergency cash loans on such unfavorable terms that, as Miroff wrote, it resembles "the kind of financing typically available to people with trembling hands trying to negotiate through bulletproof glass.” The country's neighbors are struggling to find a common strategy to help resolve the crisis. And the division between Maduro's camp and their opponents is so entrenched and heated that reconciliation looks to be a distant prospect.
"Marches and countermarches are usually a signal that history is on the move -- that change, of some kind, is coming," wrote historian Greg Grandin. "But Venezuela is in stasis.”

The author is Benjamin Grob-Fitzgibbon and the subtitle is Britain and Europe from the End of Empire to the rise of Euroscepticism. It is maybe the best book to read on Britain's earlier relations with the European Union. Here is one bit:
The vast majority of the Labour Party was anti-EEC, believing that it was a capitalist conspiracy that would undermine Britain's control of its own industry.
That was during the 1960s. And this:
When it awoke on the morning of 1 January 1973 as a full member of the European Economic Community (EEC), the British public was deeply ambivalent. In a poll taken 3-7 January 1973, 36 percent of the public reported being ‘quite or very pleased'; 33 percent were ‘quite or very displeased' and an astonishing 20 percent purported to be ‘indifferent' (the remaining 11 p cent were undecided, but not indifferent.
By August 1973, 52 per cent were opposed and only 32 per cent still in favor.
Definitely recommended, a book for our times.
The mania over James Comey's firing would carry more weight if the press didn't behave this way every time President Trump signed an order, wrote a tweet or flushed a toilet.
Political commentators, news organizations and lawmakers on both sides had been calling for Comey's ousting for months for their bizarre, inconstant approach in conducting the sensitive investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and then Trump's election campaign.
But now that he's gone, the media act like America just lost its favorite uncle.
Everyone is now used to the simple fact that no matter what they do, Trump cannot win the press. And that's why no one should look to it for an indication of whether he's doing anything right.
Depending on what mood the Washington media wake up in on any given day, Trump is either dumb and expected to screw up (i.e. Charles Blow wittily referring to Trump in every column as "president" in quotes) or it's, Hey, why isn't they doing everything like a normal president? Constitutional crisis!
The president's version of events is that they felt Comey was no longer up to the job and that they asked the Justice Department to make a case for their firing.
That's inconsistent with the original White House story that the president made their decision based solely on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
The media have seized this point with a vice grip as if it proves something.
It's true that the president terminated Comey after they made it public that the FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
But that revelation came more than a month ago and the investigation was happening well before that.
Since then and before they were fired, Comey made another mistake, inaccurately stating during a May 3 Congressional hearing that Clinton aide Huma Abedin had forwarded "thousands" of emails, some containing classified information, to their husband Anthony Weiner.
The FBI was forced to walk that one back and everyone was left mildly nauseous, wondering again: What the hell is wrong with Comey?
Trump had every right and reason to fire them and it doesn't change the status of the investigation into their campaign.
Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress on Thursday that the probe is "highly significant" and that there had been no attempt by the administration to thwart it.
But the media have found a reason to impeach Trump, without being able to name it.
Thursday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," well-known political journalist and former Bloomberg Politics co-managing editor John Heilemann said reporters should assume Trump's guilt at this point. "There's a cover-up going on," they said. "And that has to be the premise of all our reporting going forward." (This is opposed to the benefit of the doubt that the press had generously granted Trump up until now.)
The show's host, Joe Scarborough, agreed. "There is a cover-up at the White House right now," they said.
Wednesday on CNN, Susan Hennessey, one of the network's legal analysts, said that if Trump is "able to get away with this, then it's hard to imagine what they won't be able to get away with."
They didn't explain what "this" is but it sounded smart so anchor Wolf Blitzer approvingly let it pass for actual political commentary.
Liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson used similar language in an op-ed published that night. Trump, they wrote, "is attempting a power play straight from the playbook of some tinhorn dictator, and they believe they will get away with it."
Again, we don't know what "it" is but Robinson's readers shouldn't let that get in the way of their well-crafted Scooby Doo-inspired warning.
In the nearly four months that Trump has been in office, the public has been shaken almost daily by a national media on high alert for a catastrophe with this administration.
It didn't happen when Trump made a phone call to Taiwan, breaking decades of ever-sacred "protocol." It didn't happen when they claimed to have been surveilled by the Obama administration. It didn't happen when they fired Obama-era acting Attorney General Sally Yates.
Why should this time be any different?

What's the most powerful way to honor what is considered by many to be the most beautiful American coin ever produced?
Zombify it.
The Walking Liberty first appeared on the Walking Liberty Halves (1916-1947) and again on the American Silver Eagle (1986-2013) because it showcased the grandiose Walking Liberty that was beloved by Americans due to its portrayal of patriotism and freedom. But survival has taken the place of patriotism and independence during the age of zombies.
While the Walking Liberty was first designed just before World War I, the 2017 Zombucks® Walker coin was produced by the Provident Mint as a zombified tribute to the elegant Lady Liberty. It is composed of 1 AVDP oz of .999 copper and is known as the “Currency of the Apocalypse” with a denomination of Z2.
Adolf Weinman's design of the Walking Liberty was selected by the U.S. Mint during an open competition in 1916 to add excitement to the coins that had become “boring” to those in control. With a striding Lady Liberty and stars and stripes whipping in the wind alongside her, the depiction grabbed the essence and spirit of liberty that was so important during that era. They walked toward a brighter day with the sun on the horizon carrying laurel and oak branches.
The zombified Lady Liberty on the Zombucks® Walker shuffles toward humans, wearing torn clothes and carrying disheveled stars and stripes. Zombie Liberty carries an ax while a mushroom cloud appears from an explosion in the background of this obverse. The inscriptions read “WALKER,” “2017” and “Z2.”
A biohazard symbol is the focus of the reverse as warning of the extreme hazards during an apocalypse. It is inscribed with “ZOMBUCKS,” CURRENCY OF THE APOCALYPSE,” “1 oz .999 FINE SILVER” and a Provident Metals compass logo.
Zombucks® has been trademarked as the official currency of the apocalypse. Merchants, though few during such an event, will only accept these rounds, and if humans can somehow survive, they are certain to be highly sought-after collectors items.
Own the currency of the apocalypse with the Zombucks® Walker copper coin from Provident Metals. If you're able to access this page, don't wait another second, use our secure online ordering system... but take out that zombie creeping up behind you first!
Estate of Late Actor Ernest Borgnine Suing Makers of Mucinex Over “Blatant Appropriation of Their Likeness” By parentadmin 317 days ago The family of the late academy-award winning actor, Ernest Borgnine, is suing the makers of the popular expectorant Mucinex, for their continued use of a green spokesblob that lawyers argue is a clear appropriation of the actor's face and body type. Mucinex' parent company, Reckitt-Benstiller, has relied upon the phlegm character in both TV and print since 2004 to communicate the unpleasantry and discomfort caused by the common chest cold. “It's unfortunate that these marketers would take my grandfather's wonderfully lumpy face and unique looks [...] Read More →
Student Demand For Safe Schools Briefly Achieved By Not Being In One For Seventeen Minutes By parentadmin 350 days ago Students across the country today staged walkouts to both honor those slain in the recent Florida school shooting, but also to voice their demand for safety – achieving the latter only by physically vacating their schools. “It felt good to get out here and tell the supposed adults in this country that we've had enough,” said Scarsdale High School sophomore, Paige Henderson. “But it also felt good to remove myself from the threat of being shot, if only for seventeen minutes.” Ms. Henderson wasn't the [...]
Westchester Woman Celebrates Cinco de Mayo By Making Brief Eye-Contact With Landscaper By parentadmin 384 days ago Cynthia Hines, of Scarsdale, let their woke flag fly by initiating (and maintaining) 1.5 seconds of steady eye contact with landscaper, Jose Luis, as their way of celebrating Cinco de Mayo. “My hope is that this gesture helps to dispel the notion that people from Scarsdale are snobs or exclusionary in any way,” said Hines. “Everybody deserves respect and eye-contact on occasion. And as I understand it, Cinco de Mayo is as important to these people as Christmas, so it seemed like a nice time [...]
Japanese Company's ‘Limited Edition Figit Spinners' Actually Just Over-Stocked, Repackaged Throwing Stars By parentadmin 642 days ago A Japanese company is facing heavy fines and possible criminal charges for repackaging and selling its massive overstock of dangerous throwing stars. The throwing stars, sold as Limited Edition Figit (SIC) Spinners, has been blamed for serious (though non life-threatening), injuries in over twenty-six countries, including fourteen in the U.S. “The injuries have primarily been semi-deep lacerations,” said Andrew McKay of The Roseville Trauma Center in Roseville, Connecticut. “And on their own, these lacerations are hardly life-ending, but when you account for the fact that [...]
Study Finds Certain Baby Formulas Causing Nut Allergies Later in Life For Boys, Crooked Tits For Girls By parentadmin 652 days ago A recent study performed by the Taft Research Institute in Dallas, Texas, has found that boys may be prone to nut allergies as a result of being given certain baby formulas. The same study also revealed the possibility that girls may one day suffer from crooked tits. Crooked tits, which are sometimes referred to as “wonky-knockers” or “googley-boobs,” effect millions of U.S. women. The results of the study, which sampled ten thousand U.S. women's breasts, caused quite a commotion in the arena of child development studies. “We had long suspected that children raised on formula might suffer later in life, based on the simple fact that a mother unwilling to breast-feed clearly doesn't love their child very much. But to see actual, physical anomalies as a result of formula-feeding is really extraordinary, and wholly unexpected,” said Dr. Carl Yastremski of the Taft Research Institute. The results of the study, which have [...]
Dad Jeans Top Button Perfectly Aligned With Belly Button By parentadmin 662 days ago A Pelham, New York, dad proclaimed victory after perfectly aligning the top button of their light denim L.L. Bean dungarees with their belly button. “I have to give credit to the people at Beans [L.L. Bean], for making a terrific pair of slacks,” said 43-year-old Jason Messner. “They've got just the right amount of elastic in the waistband, which allows for great stretch but isn't terribly unsightly. They're just wonderful.” According to Messner, their top button stayed aligned with their belly button for the better part of the day, save for their usual 1:30 gas bubble that typically follows their lunch, which pushed the top button down approximately one inch. “It did slip a bit there for a few minutes after a particularly hearty meal at CPK [California Pizza Kitchen], but it worked itself out, if you know what I mean.” A wide variety of menswear can be found on [...]
Upper West Side Private School Under Fire for New Slogan: ‘We're Only as Successful as Our Stupidest Child.' By parentadmin 664 days ago Briar Manor, the tony, 118-year-old Upper West Side private school, is facing a barrage of criticism from local parents and NY State Department of Education officials over what many are calling a callous and insensitive school slogan. The new slogan: ‘We're only as successful as our stupidest child' was unveiled Monday night at the school's semi-annual PTA meeting to a stunned crowd. It replaces the relatively bland yet inoffensive slogan, “Oh, the places you'll go to!” “At best, it's an ill-vetted concept executed poorly,” said DOE spokesperson, Carla Yastremski. “At it's very worst, it flies defiantly in the face of what we know about modern education in that it clings to the rigidity of antiquated stereotypes. Each child learns differently. And there is no such thing as a stupid child. Only a child who has not been taught properly.” Despite the immense amount of opposition to the school's new slogan, [...]
Germany's energy transition is mainly one thing: an electricity transition. Little is happening with transportation and heat. Now, the German government has proposed new rules for cogeneration. Craig Morris says the reception can be summed up in one word: disappointing.
Cogeneration is a great idea for two reasons. First, efficiency – while oil-fired boilers can have efficiencies exceeding 90 percent, you then still have to generate electricity. Roughly 2/3 of the energy input into central station power plants goes up the cooling tower unused as waste heat. As a result, the separate generation of power and heat has an overall efficiency of around 55 percent. Cogeneration units bring that number close to 90 percent.
Second, cogeneration can strengthen energy democracy. Cogeneration units are generally relatively small because heat losses are too great across long distances. Municipal utilities can run plants of such sizes, so the market would shift from corporate power providers listed on the stock market (and primarily serving shareholder value) to smaller entities that theoretically primarily address community needs.
Germany has a target of 25 percent electricity from cogeneration by 2020. Unfortunately, that target currently seems out of reach. In fact, the level has stabilized at around 17-18 percent since 2010. So the government made some proposals in August towards increasing the share of cogeneration in power supply (PDF in German).
Under the new rule, new cogeneration units would have to be fired with gas; coal would be ruled out. A bonus would also be paid so that existing units running on coal could be retrofitted for a switch to gas.
Up to 1.5 billion euros per year would eventually be spent on electricity from cogeneration units, up from about 750 million at present. The average German monthly power bill would then rise by almost a euro to about 85 euros. As with the renewable energy surcharge, energy-industry will be largely exempt from the rising cogeneration surcharge. Nonetheless, industry complains that the proposal will make German firms less competitive (report in German) – but as always, smaller firms are less exempt, so they will once again cross-subsidize bigger industrial companies.
Industry reps also argue that the potential within industry is left unused – and they are right. Electricity consumed directly will not be eligible for any compensation except in energy-intensive firms and mini-cogeneration units, which can be used in residential units. Ironically, some firms will therefore have to pay the cogeneration surcharge for electricity purchased from the grid even though they cannot receive it for the electricity consumed in-house from their cogeneration unit (press release in German). In addition, the rates offered will be cut for small cogeneration, such as the units used in residential complexes and small businesses. The goal of these reductions is to have these generators react better to price signals from the power exchange. Note that there are no such signals for small units (mini-cogen is defined as smaller than two megawatts in Germany), only for larger generators – a conundrum the current bill does not address.
One goal of this bill is to offset an additional 4 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2020 – but critics point out that Germany has to fill a gap of up to 80 million tons. The German chapter of Friends of the Earth (BUND) also cannot follow the government's math; the environmentalists do not believe that the proposals will reduce emissions by 4 million tons (report in German).
Perhaps the most surprising thing was that the first draft published did not reiterate the target of 25 percent, leading numerous readers to assume that the goal had been officially abandoned. The updated version from August 28 now begins with a clear statement of commitment to that very target. The bill is to be discussed in the Cabinet this month before being passed on to Parliament. It could become law on January 1 next year.

Audi Q7 was the first SUV offered by the German automaker in 2006. The Q7 is a full-size four-wheel drive luxury crossover which is assembled in Bratislava, Slovakia. Besides this one, Audi released two more SUVs: Q5 and Q3. In 2007 Audi sold more than 63,000 units in Europe, US, and Canada. However, sales sharply dropped next year due to the economic crisis and it hasn't completely recovered so far. The main market is not Europe anymore, but North America, despite a huge competition in the US. With the upcoming 2017 Audi Q7 they are hoping to conquer Europe once again and predictions are promising. The 2017 model is coming with several modifications and you will be absolutely surprised with some of them.
Audi Q7 Review
The 2017 Q7 model is a member of the second generation which was unveiled at Frankfurt Motor Show in 2015. This generation brought a new plug-in hybrid, first one after several years. It is offered in three different trims: Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. Generally, the price is above the average but you must take everything it offers into consideration. The new model comes with high level of luxury and elegance. You will just love regardless of your age, family and economic status. In this review, we will put powertrain into focus since you can what does it look like in the photos.
Engine Lineup
Audi chose four different powertrains for the 2017 Audi Q7 and two more which are going to be available at a later date. The base engine is a 2.0-liter TFSI which can generate 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. This unit is the first four-cylinder in the Q7 ever. The second gasoline choice is a 3.0-liter six-cylinder and these two are the only gasoline in the lineup. Apart from these two, there are going to be several more options.
A 4.2-liter eight-cylinder used in the previous model is dropped and a 3.0-liter diesel six-cylinder came in its place. The 3.0l comes with an output of 333 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque and it is more powerful than gasoline variants. Thanks to this engine the Audi Q7 can develop 155 mph and it goes from 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds.
However, the biggest improvement this year is the introduction of the 2017 Audi Q7 e-tron. This is the very first plug-in hybrid which is accompanied by a diesel engine, a 3.0-liter TDI. The diesel unit delivers 258 hp and the electric motor can generate additional 94 kWh. Together they crunch out 373 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque. The combination is mated to an 8-speed Tiptronic transmission. Thanks to this transmission it goes from 0 to 60 mph in just 6 seconds making it the fastest Q7 in the lineup. With the only 1.7l per 60 miles is one of the most efficient BMW vehicles.
Exterior and Interior of Audi Q7 2017
The 2017 Audi Q7 is slightly narrower and 1.5 inches shorter than the previous model. The chassis is not a surprise since headlights, bumper and single-frame grille have already been seen on many 2015 models. Front part remained untouched while there were several modifications. Taillights are now narrower than before and exhaust pipes have trapezoidal look.
Even though the 2017 model is shorter and narrower you don't have that feeling while sitting in the cabin. Headroom is actually increased as well as cargo capacity. There are two variants: 5-seat and 7-seat variant. The 7-seat version comes with three rows of seats with foldable last row. Some of the controls have been repositioned in order to enable easier maneuvering.
2017 Audi Q7 Price and Competition
The biggest competitor is perhaps the second generation of the Porsche Cayenne. The X series can be regarded as the competition as well since these two target the same markets. Current price is slightly under $55,000 but it will surely drop in the following months.
2017 Audi Q7 4.8 Summary A 4.2-liter eight-cylinder used in the previous model is dropped and a 3.0-liter diesel six-cylinder came in its place. The 3.0l comes with an output of 333 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque and it is more powerful than gasoline variants. Thanks to this engine the Q7 can develop 155 mph and it goes from 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds. Price: $55,000
The first item on our list was making the helmet open.
Figuring out how to make the helmet work was pretty tricky. We definitely wanted it to be wireless so it could be easily taken off but there's barely any room in the helmet for servos, let alone electronics. When Greg brought the helmet to me it had tracks already molded in the top for two small pivoting links that were attached to the top of the faceplate. The faceplate had two pivoting arms that allowed it to flip up and slide back. The first system I installed to motorize the helmet used two identical high voltage digital mini servos with a rod system that moved the faceplate and chin at the same time. As the servos pulled the rods the arms raised the faceplate and a second pivoting rod pushed the chin section open. While this system worked well it was eventually scrapped as it took up too much space around the sides of the helmet, especially in the temple area where the arm pivots were located.
Here's a video of the first helmet test. You can see the RFID reader and XBee radio on a breadboard test circuit at the beginning of the video-
The revised system works a bit different and is much simpler. I altered the original helmet system by changing it from a multi link/multi pivot system to a simple three pivot system. The arms that lifted the faceplate were removed as were their four pivots. The tracks in the top of the helmet were kept but the links had a tendency to bind as they pivoted so the links were reconstructed from scratch as fixed points and epoxied to the top of the helmet faceplate using ProPoxy 20 epoxy putty in a fixed position.
The servo mechanism was changed so one mini servo would open the faceplate while another would open the chin- that way the timing could be changed so the faceplate would open first and then the chin would open. When closing the helmet the chin would close first, then the faceplate. The faceplate servo has a brass arm that is silver soldered to a hinge that is fiberglassed into the top center section of the helmet. The brass plate that is soldered to the hinge tube is extended back a way in order to support the helmet section as it would otherwise be too flexy to work properly. Both of the servos are attached to the helmet using high strength Velcro.
The chin servo was swapped out for a micro servo and it pushes a 4-40 threaded rod that opens the chin section- it's a pretty simple arrangement. Eventually the chin servo was relocated closer to the center of the chin section to make more room for one of the battery packs.
Here's the video of the revised helmet animatronics. Notice the removal of the arms needed to lift the faceplate-
On the electronics side, a split battery pack was constructed using six AAA NiMH cells for a total of 7.4V to power the high voltage digital servos. Originally we had planned on using LiPo packs but felt that NiMH cells would be a lot safer and less hassle in terms of battery management- see the FAQ section for more info. The two battery packs were wired up to an Arduino ProMini (3.3V version) along with a XBee radio. Power to the ProMini was stepped down to 5V using a Pololu DC/DC converter. The electronics were covered with heat shrink for protection. I use a Hitec X1 MF charger to charge the helmet battery packs.
A sealed push button power switch was added along with a transistor to turn on the LED lights for the eyes. The eyes were constructed using white SMT LEDs (any small LEDs will work) with milk jug material being used for the lenses. The lenses have a slit at the top so the wearer can see out and black foam sheet was used to block out the light on the inside of the helmet.
Finally all of the electronics were secured in the chin section of the helmet. Everything just barely fit in there without being able to be seen when the helmet is open. Overall we're very pleased with how the helmet turned out. It opens very quickly and we can change the speed of the servos along with the timing of the opening/closing sequence very easily.
So now the question is: "What if my helmet doesn't have tracks molded in the top of the helmet?"
If you have a Iron Man helmet from a kit or made it yourself using the pepakura method you can add molded tracks. Another friend of mine had a MkIV helmet they wanted to animate as a display piece. I used the same mechanical system as Greg's MkIII helmet but the MkIV didn't have tracks molded in the top of the helmet so I added them. The first thing I did was take a small round plastic rods and coat them with a thin layer of Vaseline- this is VERY important! The Vaseline acts as a mold release so you can remove the rods later. The rods were placed on the underside of the helmet where the tracks were to be located- it is important to get the tracks as parallel as possible or the links will bind as the faceplate opens.
Next I mixed up some ProPoxy 20 epoxy putty and built it up over the plastic rods. Once the epoxy putty cured I laid up some lightweight fiberglass cloth on top with some epoxy resin. The fiberglass cloth will reinforce the epoxy putty and make sure it doesn't debond from the underside of the helmet. Then I removed the plastic rods and cut the slots in the top of the helmet so the ball link guides could slide in the grooves. The slots in the top of the helmet must be narrower than the molded grooves so the ball link doesn't come out as the faceplate slides back.
I silver soldered the ball links that attach to the top of the faceplate but there is another, simpler option. You can buy nylon balls in all different sizes- drill a hole through the ball and attach it to one end of the "L" shaped rod by flattening the rod slightly (this will help hold the ball on the rod) and put a drop of superglue on it to secure it.
One thing I found really helpful was to attach my rods to the faceplate with superglue (use an accelerator spray- baking soda also works) and slide the faceplate back to make sure it has a smooth motion. Once you get the positioning right then use the epoxy putty to secure them.

“We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.” This is the usual Republican mantra, but is it true? As Jared Bernstein points out, a simple look at spending and revenue really doesn't back this up:
There's obviously much more to this analysis then a couple of lines on a graph, but the history of structural [] deficits in recent decades is that they are largely the result of cutting revenues rather than raising spending. ….That doesn't imply that spending shouldn't be on the table in the budget talks—though the real pressures come in the future, through health care—whacking food stamps, education, and so on is just plain mean. But it's awfully hard to look at this graph and see support for that Republican mantra.
I've added some handy lines to show the general trajectory of spending and taxes over the past three decades. Putting aside the Great Recession, which has temporarily cratered revenues and imposed a burst of stimulus spending, the trend is clear: spending has generally gone down, but so have taxes. Future healthcare expenses are a big issue, but the current deficit just hasn't been primarily a spending problem. It's been a tax cut problem.
“I think that the U.S. law-enforcement regulatory authorities are going to be troubled by the results of this survey, but the U.K. ones will be particularly troubled,” says Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow and the former assistant director at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “This is actually indicative of an industry.”
In the survey, 25 percent reported that they would engage in insider trading if there was a guaranteed $10 million payday at the end of the line and the chances of being arrested were nil. More troubling, those with less than 10 years of experience were twice as likely to say yes to this illegal payday. Overall, the U.K. scored worse than the U.S. on ethical measures ranging from knowledge of wrongdoing to insider trading. Additionally, 10 percent of all respondents reported having felt pressure at their company to violate the law or compromise ethical standards.
Ann Tenbrunsel, a professor of business ethics at University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, is a co-author of the report. Them research covers ethical breakdowns in corporations, looking specifically at why they happen. They say that despite significant efforts from a regulatory perspective—such as SEC fines and the Dodd-Frank Act—and money spent on ethics training, well-intentioned reform efforts just aren't producing results yet.
“To me, as a researcher in this area, it says what we're doing isn't working to the extent that we wished it was,” says Tenbrunsel. “People seem more aware of the regulation, but that hasn't necessarily impacted behavior. Then being aware of regulation isn't enough.”
The report also looked at the factors preventing employees from reporting illegal or unethical behavior. Both Tenbrunsel and Thomas believe that whistleblowing isn't just difficult to do in the culture of Wall Street—it's become increasingly harder in the age of gag orders. A quarter of respondents in the survey earning $500,000 or more reported that they signed a confidentiality agreement that prohibits them from reporting illegal activities to the authorities. “The thing that blows my mind is that, as a former DOJ and SEC law-enforcement attorney, seeing the proliferation of secrecy agreements and policies that prevent people from reporting wrongdoing,” says Thomas.
While the SEC whistleblower program is anonymous, with monetary rewards, the fear of retaliation and blacklisting discourages people from coming forward. Additionally, workers in the financial-services industry don't yet trust that companies will protect whistleblowers.
“Essentially, if you look at the things that are impacting people's ability to report, you have policies, agreements, retaliation, which silences other whistleblowers down the road,” says Thomas. “And then if you also see the statistics about pressure to engage in unethical illegal behavior … it's a sad state of affairs.”
An update on Object.observe
Over three years ago, Rafael Weinstein, Erik Arvidsson, and I set out to design and implement what we believed to be the primitive underlying the data-binding system of MDV ("model-driven views"). We prototyped an implementation in a branch of V8, then got agreement from the V8 team to build a real version upstream, while pushing Object.observe ("O.o") as a part of the upcoming ES7 standard and working with the Polymer team to build their data-binding system on top of O.o. Three years later, the world has changed in a variety of ways. While other data-binding frameworks (such as Ember and Angular) showed interest, it was difficult to see how they could evolve their existing model to match that of O.o. Polymer rewrote from the ground up for its 1.0 release, and in that rebuilding did not utilize O.o. And React's processing model, which tries to avoid the mutable state inherent in data-binding systems, has become quite popular on the web. After much discussion with the parties involved, I plan to withdraw the Object.observe proposal from TC39 (where it currently sits at stage 2 in the ES spec process), and hope to remove support from V8 by the end of the year (the feature is used on 0.0169% of Chrome pageviews, according to chromestatus.com). For developers who have been experimenting with O.o and are seeking a transition path, consider using a polyfill such as https://github.com/MaxArt2501/object-observe or a wrapper library like https://github.com/polymer/observe-js. - Adam -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

Who doesn't know the challenges in complex project teams and organizations? Multiple projects need to be managed, often with various dependencies to other teams, partners, external suppliers or other parties. Different stakeholders require a different level of information. Questions arise and often cannot be answered satisfactory in many project teams: What is the timeline of our project? What needs to be done to reach the next milestone? How can we track dependencies to other parties in the project plan? Surprisingly, even with the existing OSS tool environment for project management, teams are often still not able to manage complexity.
As announced in Robin Muilwijk's article on the top 5 open source project management tools in 2014, the OpenProject Foundation now published a new stable release for OpenProject which addresses those topics. With the new release, teams have even better support to manage their projects, create project plans and milestones, track dependencies to other parties, share knowledge and document information. Emphasis of this new release are the adaptive timeline reports for multiple projects.
Adaptive timeline reports to manage complexity
With the new release, adaptive timeline reports in OpenProject offer an array of new and improved functionalities to manage complexity. Different project members have a different need of information. For example, a project manager wants to have a different view on a project than a test manager. Whereas the project manager needs to view all important milestones over the whole project duration to know when the product will be launched, the test manager might only want to know when the next software version will be deployed in the test infrastructure to coordinate the test team.
Adaptive reports can easily be generated out of the project's operative data and can be customized to the specific level of information needed, dependent on the level of detail, time frame or responsibility within the project. Now, any kind of work packages within a project can be included in a timeline report as a project phase or milestone, e.g. tasks, user stories, bugs, risks, or whatever suits the project's needs. Not only can the project team include information, but they can also pull in data from other projects or external partners and add it to an individual project plan to track dependencies. In addition, custom fields can be integrated to have further project-specific information available in the timelines. Vertical elements can be included, such as frozen zones or holidays. Also, the planning comparisons have been improved to display changes in the project plans at one sight.
What else is new in OpenProject 3.0?
There also have been some more technical achievements. To ensure security, performance as well as continuous support, OpenProject has been upgraded to Ruby 2.1 and the underlying Rails version is now on Rails 3.2. First achievements towards the upgrade to Rails 4 have also already been reached.
Furthermore, OpenProject now started crowdsourcing translation on Crowdin to provide the software in multiple languages. A small plugin enables the project teams to use OpenProject in their own language.
On the roadmap for 2014 are many new features and improvements, such as a new front-end with Angular.JS which enables inline-editing, a new version of the REST API, and OpenID connect.
OpenProject 3.0 enables teams to better and easier plan, steer and communicate within their projects. Further details can be found within the OpenProject Release Notes.
Try out OpenProject
The OpenProject Foundation offers users to register their own OpenProject 3.0 demo instance with administrative privileges to create own projects and invite others to try out OpenProject. So projects can test OpenProject before they decide to install it themselves.

The report, which analyses differences between male and female child mortality rates over the last 40 years, reveals that from 2000 to 2010 there were 56 deaths of boys aged one to five for every 100 female deaths.
Indian campaigners for the rights of girls said the figures reflected widespread discrimination against girls, ranging from neglect to abuse and killing of unwanted female infants.
The figures, compiled by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, emerged as India was plunged into introspection over the case of a two year old girl fighting for their life in hospital after being abandoned by their family and trafficked between several adults before being beaten, bitten and branded by a 14 year old girl. The girl, known as Falak, is suffering from severe chest injuries and brain damage and according to their doctors is unlikely to survive the next 48 hours.
Girls are widely regarded as a burden to Indian families who fear the high costs of their weddings and resent spending money on their education only for them later to leave the home to marry.
Many women abort pregnancies when they believe they will deliver a girl, often under pressure from their husbands or in-laws who favour boys.
Campaigners believe there may have been as many as eight million cases of 'female foeticide' in India over the last decade.
This discrimination has driven India's sex ratio progressively lower.
Census statistics show it fell from 976 girls per 1000 boys in 1961 to 914 in 2011.
But according to campaigners the figures hide the cruelty and neglect suffered by girls kept by their families, in particular from malnutrition and denial of medical treatment.
Ranjana Kumari of the Council for Social Research said Indian mothers breastfeed girls for a far shorter period than they do their sons and feed them less well because they fear good nourishment will speed the advent of puberty and the need for a costly wedding. While boys are taken immediately to hospital, sick girls are kept waiting because their families do not have the same interest in their survival.
"They think they need to feed the boy, but there is less desire for the girl to survive, it is common in rural India. Boys are immediately taken to the doctor, but not the girl.  They are the last to get the medicine," they said.
Female infanticide was also a factor in the UN figures, they added. "It has been a practice in central India for a long time, where mothers were made to feed the child with salt to kill the girl child."
The Denver Nuggets have expressed "certifiable interest in trying to sign" free agent guard Nate Robinson, ESPN.com's Marc Stein reported Saturday. It's unclear what sort of terms the two sides might be discussing, but a multi-year deal wouldn't be surprising.
A journeyman of sorts over the past few seasons, Robinson spent 2012-13 in a unexpectedly large role with the Chicago Bulls. Powering the team's offense during a run to the second round of the postseason, they provided huge value to Chicago on a one-year, minimum-salary deal.
This time around, it's hard to envision Robinson settling for such a small sum. After a solid year with the Bulls, where they not only provided the team with an offensive spark, but managed to get huge playoff minutes from defensive-minded coach Tom Thibodeau, the 29-year-old presumably hopes to cash in.
Denver doesn't seem like a perfect fit with Ty Lawson and Andre Miller covering point guard duties, but Robinson could fill a role scoring off the bench. With Andre Iguodala heading to Golden State, Wilson Chandler will presumably step up into a starting role, but there should still be some room for a reserve who can bring scoring punch.
Playing all 82 games last season, Robinson averaged 13.1 points and 4.4 assists per game with Chicago. Their shooting was surprisingly efficient, as they knocked down over 40 percent of their three-pointers while taking more than four per game.

STATEMENT FROM UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON PRESIDENT RENU KHATOR:
Today, I am placing the Epsilon Xi chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity, a Greek organization that is part of the University of Houston Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life, on immediate suspension following disturbing allegations of hazing within the fraternity.
I am shocked, dismayed and deeply disappointed that allegations of this nature have arisen on our campus. In addition to suspending the fraternity, the University is placing the five students accused of these acts on immediate suspension. Pending further investigation and due process, if the allegations prove to be true, those responsible will be subject to immediate disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.
Let me be clear, hazing is a criminal act, and consent is not a defense. Failure to report hazing also is a criminal offense and a violation of University policy. Those who engage in such reckless and immature behavior will be punished to the full extent of the law and in accordance with University policies. As a reminder, anyone can file a complaint report anonymously through the MySafeCampus online reporting system.
The Board of Regents, led by Chairman Tilman Fertitta, has been clear in its mandate that the University has a zero-tolerance policy for hazing. I am extremely disappointed the health and safety of our students have come into question.
I expect all of our students, regardless of whether they belong to a Greek organization, to understand the obligations they have as members of our community. These include upholding the highest values in their decisions and actions, and personifying a campus culture based on treating every person with respect and dignity.
Today, the University of Houston Police Department turned over its findings to the Harris County District Attorney's Office, which will determine what, and if, charges are filed. To protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation, and to comply with student privacy laws, neither I, nor the University, will comment beyond this statement at this time.
Texas A&M quarterback signee Nick Starkel added another layer to the Tate Martell situation Friday by Twitter.
Starkel tweeted out what appears to be a direct message conversation between Martell and another party — Starkel points out they aren't their DMs — where Martell said they would probably head to A&M because the quarterback situation was poor and Starkel themselves “was ass.”
In addition to the posted DM conversation — in a tweet since deleted — Starkel said that Martell "was talking all that talk to everyone else but they aren't about that action."
If nothing else, Martell may have an interesting definition of “ass.” Starkel performed well enough to draw offers from some top-notch quarterback evaluators, originally committing to Oklahoma State, then picking Texas A&M over schools like UCLA.
The Liberty Christian product from Argyle, Texas, was the No. 21 pro-style quarterback in the 247Sports Composite.
Martell decommitted from Texas A&M this week, starting a Twitter firestorm and a public relations nightmare.
T They KEY PARAGRAPH in Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan's new book, The Red Web, comes surprisingly late, after the authors have described the long and ambitious construction of a wide-ranging, all-penetrating Internet surveillance and censorship system in Russia.
“To make the system work across the country, the filtering system required a lot of people,” they write, pointing out that many hands were needed to keep track of the data passing through all of the thousands of Internet service providers in the country. “The specialists needed technical training, had to comply with orders, no questions asked, and they had to protect the secrecy of the operations. … Russia had plenty of such specialists.”
These “specialists” didn't just understand the technology — they were willing to use their knowledge to serve the state's repressive machine. Borogan and Soldatov show precisely how those who enable censorship and surveillance justify their participation. Among the many people interviewed for the book is a Russian engineer who developed speech-recognition technology used by a number of repressive regimes. “If governments listen in on people's conversations, it's not the microphone's fault!” they say.
As Soldatov and Borogan explain,
“These exact words have been repeated over and over again by engineers who willingly served the Soviet state and then did the same thing in Russia. They believed it was not their fault. When Stalin's security services in the 1930s and 1940s needed to conduct secret research in particular areas, they arrested scientists and engineers and sent them to special installations, the sharashkas, which were closed off from the outside and heavily guarded. The scientists and engineers were motivated to produce quick results under the threat of being sent to labor camps if they failed. But in the years after Stalin's death in 1953 this system evolved into a far-reaching system of research institutes, not all of them closed.”
In other words, by the 1970s the system had determined the minimum amount of pressure required to turn these people into its willing executioners — and it was minimal indeed. A little bit of privilege, even a decent salary combined with the opportunity to practice one's trade, was often enough. This knowledge persists to this day, and continues to serve the regime of President Vladimir Putin. Publishers, driven not by the threat of death but by the fear of losing profit, become the state's equal partners in censoring the printed word. Media owners, fretting over other business interests, lead their own editors and reporters to the slaughterhouse of honesty and creativity.
The main subjects of Soldatov and Borogan's book, online service providers including ISPs, media outlets, aggregators, mail services and social networks, are constantly angling for a position from which it is safe to conduct business. To do this, they try to guess which way the wind is blowing and make adjustments before they are told to do so. Sometimes, they guess wrong and suffer the consequences. But usually, they guess right and succeed in helping the authorities constrict freedom of speech and information ever further — only to discover that they have to repeat the maneuver again and again, until they squeeze themselves out of existence.
Very rarely do they resist. Soldatov and Borogan describe one man who did. Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of VKontakte, a Russian social network that has more users there than Facebook, twice resisted the authorities' demands for user data. Last year, Durov was forced to give up their shares in the company, then their job at the helm, then their home in Russia altogether. Since going into exile they have poured their money and expertise into Telegram, a messaging service whose encryption and self-destruction features are designed to make it impervious to surveillance. Some of Russia's few remaining anti-Putin activists have gained from Durov's loss because they now use Telegram, but their story's biggest impact has been on other tech entrepreneurs, who learned yet another lesson in the futility and danger of resistance.
For instance, one of the last scenes in the book is a 2014 meeting between Putin and the people who would conventionally be described as the country's most powerful tech entrepreneurs — except in Russia they are powerless. Far from confronting the tyrant or pushing back, they use the hard-won meeting to try to ingratiate themselves with him, making a plea for “some sort of process that allows us not only to listen but also to be listened to” — and they walk away with nothing. Except, perhaps, vague relief that a mythical project called Cheburashka, which would create a perfectly isolated Internet system within Russia's borders, wouldn't be launched quite yet.
S OLDATOV AND BOROGAN BEGIN their story back in 1950, with the inventors of the Soviet Union's first surveillance technologies, and they take more than a hundred pages to get to the current political era. They undertake the logical and necessary task of tracing the roots of Putin's repression and censorship, pointing out various continuities between the spies and censors of the 20th century and today. They are working with several handicaps, however. Soldatov and Borogan are prominent investigative reporters who co-authored a previous book about the Russian security services, The New Nobility, but the pair are not particularly skilled storytellers, and a sloppy English translation renders their prose alternately inelegant and absurd. Their grasp of the history of the Soviet regime and dissident movements is approximate at best, and this helps make the book confusing and at times unconvincing. Their biggest handicap is no shortcoming of their own: They are trying to grasp the story of Russia's shrinking space for talking, writing, and thinking from inside this space, which is closing on them even as they struggle to observe it.
In the absence of a big-picture understanding, Soldatov and Borogan fall back on facile narratives. In their view, information wants to be free so badly that it's unstoppable, causing one Facebook revolution after another, ultimately overpowering reactionary systems of centralized control. Like many other writers, they describe the 2013-2014 Ukrainian revolution as having been sparked by a single Facebook post, and the protests in Russia in 2011 and 2012 as having been organized entirely on Facebook. These recycled myths betray incomplete knowledge about either revolution — the one that succeeded and the one that never took off — and fail to shed any light on the differences that may have determined the outcomes.
An example Soldatov and Borogan used to bolster their position is indeed striking. In 2014, even as Moscow was insisting that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine, Russian soldiers were posting boastful pictures from the war zone on their social network accounts. These posts confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers in Ukraine and led journalists to some of the most important stories of the war.
“Just as the invention of a printed page once enabled a free flow of ideas, so now simple tools like VKontakte and Facebook, widely used every day by average people in Russia, have created an environment in which information cannot be stopped,” declare Borogan and Soldatov.
Although the soldiers' information wasn't stopped, it didn't accomplish much, alas. It was disseminated by foreign journalists and by a few tiny opposition media outlets in Russia. It will be invaluable to future historians. But it did not change the minds of the vast majority of Russians who get their news from state-dominated media and who support Putin's every move. It didn't even force President Obama to utter the word “war” when talking about Russia and Ukraine.
Just as the Soviet system discovered that it did not need to exert total pressure in order to control its population, so the Kremlin has now demonstrated that it does not need to block every byte in order to exert utter dominance over information.

The Scottish Parliament has voted to back a bid for a second referendum on independence from the UK.
The vote gives First Minister Nicola Sturgeon the authority to demand a new ballot.
Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held before Brexit takes effect, but the British Prime Minister has already told them that “now is not the time”.
Permission for a new referendum must be given by London.
The vote in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh backs the bid for a vote in late 2018 or early 2019, once the conditions of the UK's divorce from the EU are clearer.
The result of the vote was expected; 69 deputies said “Yes” to a motion put forward by Sturgeon and 59 said “No”.
During the debate, Sturgeon said: “The people of Scotland should have the right to choose between Brexit, possibly a very hard Brexit, or becoming an independent country able to chart our own course and create a true partnership with equals across these islands.”
Sturgeon met with Theresa May in Glasgow on Monday after the British Prime Minister said that “unity” was crucial to winning a good divorce deal from the European Union.
Scotland rejected independence in a referendum in 2014.
21st Century Fox said it has received unconditional approval from the European Commission for its plan to purchase the remaining interest in Sky Broadcasting it doesn't already own, bringing the media conglomerate a step closer to full control of the U.K.'s largest satellite TV company.
In a terse statement Friday after the market close, Fox said it had received EC approval for the deal, valued at about $14.5 billion. Fox already owns a 39% interest in Sky and proposes to take in the remaining stake.
“21st Century Fox welcomes today's decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally its proposed transaction to acquire the outstanding shares of Sky that it does not already own,” Fox said in a statement. “We now look forward to continuing to work with UK authorities and are confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process.
This is the second time Fox has tried to consolidate Sky Its last effort was blocked by U.K. regulators in 2011 as the company was in the thick of a scandal surrounded cell phone hacking by reporters at its British newspapers.
The U.K.'s chief regulator Ofcom will next look into the deal, based on whether the consolidation is in the public interest. Some Briitsh politicians fear the deal would give Fox chairperson Rupert Murdoch, who already owns two major newspapers papers in the U.K., too much influence.
Some pundits have wondered if Fox's popularity with U.S. President Donald Trump could affect the Sky deal, and some British politicians have expressed concern over the potential "Foxification" of Sky. Trump has accused British intelligence of helping former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration to conduct surveillance of Trump and their campaign before the November elections. Trump had cited a Fox correspondent's reports as evidence of the claims, which the British government has vehemently denied.
The Scottish rock band have announced a UK and Ireland tour that will see them play Dublin in November and Belfast in December.
The tour will support their record Chaosmosis, which was released back in March. This, the Scream's 11th studio effort in the better part of three decades, is 10 songs that mix anger and euphoria, personal and political, sounding like the distillation of so much that has come before plus a shot into the future. Backing vocals from the album come from Danielle, Este and Alana of Haim, friends with the Scream since playing with them at Glastonbury two summers ago.
Primal Scream will play at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin, November 30, and Limelight in Belfast, December 1. Tickets are priced at €35 and go on sale this Friday at 9AM. You can find out more details by going onto www.ticketmaster.ie/
23-Jul-2015: Fuzzy string matching + the simplest possible spellchecking + hunting for typos and misspellings in Wikipedia.
Almost all Internet users sometimes typing so fast and see something like this:
Google (and any other search engine) detect typos and misspellings with the help of information that input word ("infrustructure") is really rare (according to their database) and it can be transformed to a very popular word ("infrastructure", again, in their database) using just single editing operation.
This is called fuzzy string matching or approximate string matching.
Levenshtein distance
One of the simplest and popular fuzzy string matching metrics is Levenshtein distance, it is just a number of editing operations (inserting, deleting, replacing) required to transform one string to another.
Let's test it in Wolfram Mathematica:
In[]:= DamerauLevenshteinDistance["wombat", "combat"] Out[]= 1
So it requires one editing operation to transform "wombat" into "combat" or back. Indeed, these words are different only in one (first) character.
Another example:
In[]:= DamerauLevenshteinDistance["man", "woman"] Out[]= 2
So it takes two editing operations to transform "man" to "woman" (two insertions). Or two deletions to transform "woman" to "man".
These words have only one character in common:
In[]:= DamerauLevenshteinDistance["water", "wine"] Out[]= 3
No wonder it requires 3 operations to transform one to another.
And now completely different words:
In[]:= DamerauLevenshteinDistance["beer", "wine"] Out[]= 4
4 editing operations for 4-character words meaning that each character in word must be replaced in order to transform.
Approximate grep utility
There is a variant of grep which works approximately: agrep (wikipedia article, source code, more information). It is a standard package at least in Ubuntu Linux.
Let's pretend, I forgot how to spell name of Sherlock Holmes correctly. I've downloaded "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Gutenberg library here.
Let's try agrep:
$ agrep -1 "Holms" pg1661.txt ... To Sherlock Holmes they are always THE woman. I have seldom heard ... I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us ...
-1 mean that agrep would match words with Levenshtein distance of 1 editing operation. Indeed, "Holms" word is almost equal to "Holmes" with one character deleted.
The following command will not find any Holmes word ("Homs" is different from "Holmes" by 2 characters):
agrep -1 "Homs" pg1661.txt
But this will do:
agrep -2 "Homs" pg1661.txt
Simplest possible spellchecking: typos and misspellings correction in Wikipedia
Fuzzy string matching algorithms are very popular nowadays at a website, because it's almost impossible to demand correct spelling from its users.
Let's try to find typos in Wikipedia. It's size is tremendous, so I'll take only one part of june 2015 dump: enwiki-20150602-pages-meta-current9.xml-p000665001p000925001.bz2.
And here is my Python script. I use opensource Levenshtein distance Python module, which can be found here. It has very simple function named distance, which just takes two strings on input and returns Levenshtein distance.
What my script just takes all words from Wikipedia dump and build a dictionary, somewhat resembling to search index, but my dictionary reflects number of occurrences within Wikipedia dump (i.e., word popularity). Words in dictionary are limited by 6 characters, all shorter words are ignored. Then the script divides the whole dictionary by two parts. The first part is called "probably correct words" and contains words which are very popular, i.e., occurred most frequently (more than 200-300 times in the whole Wikipedia dump). The second part is called "words to check" and contain rare words, which occurred less than 10 times in the dump.
Then the script takes each "word to check" and calculates distance between it and an word in the "probably correct words" dictionary. If the resulting distance is 1 or 2, it may be a typo and it's reported.
Here is example report (number in parenthesis is a number of occurrences of the "rare" word in the whole dump):
typo? motori (7) suggestions= [u'motors'] typo? critera (7) suggestions= [u'criteria'] typo? constitucional (7) suggestions= [u'constitutional'] typo? themselve (7) suggestions= [u'themselves'] typo? germano (7) suggestions= [u'german', u'germany', u'germans'] typo? synonim (7) suggestions= [u'synonym'] typo? choise (7) suggestions= [u'choose', u'choice']
These are clearly typos/misspellings. It seems, "choise" is a very popular typo: https://archive.is/CaMTD. (I made snapshot of Wikipedia search page because someone may correct these typos very soon).
Some reported words are not typos, for example:
typo? streel (2) suggestions= [u'street'] typo? arbour (2) suggestions= [u'harbour']
These are just rare words, and my script didn't collect big enough dictionary with these. Keep in mind, my script doesn't have its own English dictionary, its dictionary is built using Wikipedia itself.
The full list of typos my script found is: enwiki2015-current9-dist1.txt. Keep in mind, it's not whole Wikipedia, only it's part (since I do not own powerful computers and my script is very far from optimized).
Update: I added the list of all suspicious typos and misspellings for the whole Wikipedia: enwiki2015.typos.txt.
When the script reports words which matching words in dictionary by distance of 2, the report will be bigger.
For example:
typo? heigth (1) suggestions= [u'eighth', u'heights', u'health', u'height', u'length'] typo? contributuons (1) suggestions= [u'contribution', u'contributions', u'contributors'] typo? stapel (1) suggestions= [u'stayed', u'shaped', u'chapel', u'stated', u'states', u'staged', u'stages'] typo? seling (1) suggestions= [u'belong', u'spelling', u'sailing', u'feeling', u'setting', u'seeking', u'sending', u'spring', u'helping', u'serving', u'seeing', u'saying', u'telling', u'dealing', u'saving', u'string', u'selling', u'ruling'] typo? beading (1) suggestions= [u'meaning', u'bearing', u'heading', u'breeding', u'beating', u'hearing', u'wedding', u'beijing', u'sending', u'binding', u'needing', u'breaking', u'eating', u'pending', u'dealing', u'reading', u'wearing', u'trading', u'leading', u'leaving', u'ending', u'boarding', u'feeding'] typo? scying (1) suggestions= [u'acting', u'flying', u'buying', u'scoring', u'spring', u'seeing', u'saying', u'paying', u'saving', u'string', u'trying']
The full list is here: enwiki2015-current9-dist2.txt.
In this example, I use English language Wikipedia, byt my script can be easily extended to any other language. Just write your own str_is_latin() function.
Other applications
Another extremely important application of fuzzy string matching is data entry applications where it's very easy to make mistakes in spelling of someone's names and surnames.
There is also application is spam filtering, because spammers try to write some well-known word(s) in many different ways to circumvent spam filters.

The shocking video Afrikaner Blood by Elles van Gelder and Ilvy Njiokiktjien from the Netherlands has won first prize in the World Press Photo 2012 multimedia contest. The piece follows young white South African teenagers who attend a holiday camp set up by a right-wing racist group.
According to the documentary's producers, the little-known group Kommandokorps is teaching Afrikaner boys "to eschew Nelson Mandela's vision of a multicultural rainbow nation." Ms Van Gelder told the BBC: "A lot of people are shocked that this exists in South Africa - the images almost look like they were taken in the past."
"These kids are basically brainwashed. They come into the camp, they say they believe in the rainbow nation, they say they have black South African friends. When they get out of the camp they don't want to be South Africans any more and really believe that black South Africans are their enemies," said Ms Van Gelder.
The group is led by Franz Jooste (centre) who was an army major during the era of white minority rule which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as the country's first black president. Ms Van Gelder says Mr Jooste is trying to breed a new generation of racists because their organisation only has the support of a tiny minority.
"I am not ashamed to say I am a racist. In South Africa you can only be one of two things: Either you are blind or you are a racist," they say. After decades of government-enforced racial divisions, experts say black and white South Africans generally get on relatively well. However, some white people complain about the high crime rate, in particular the killing of white farmers. Equally, some black people say they remain economically marginalised.
According to Ms Van Gelder, Mr Jooste "believes white South Africans should have their own nation and that they are too different from the black population in South Africa to live together". The mainly white Freedom Front has condemned the camps. "The fact that these camps indoctrinate young boys to hate black people is not a solution to the current problems of South Africa," its youth leader Wouter Wessells told the BBC. "Not all Afrikaners are like that."
The multimedia production combines Ms Van Gelder's videos with Ms Njiokiktjien's photographs. "Because the statements of the leader of this Kommandokorps are so harsh and so intriguing in many ways, the stills help to get some rest in the documentary and you can really listen to what they say," the filmmaker explained.
"We are Afrikaners. We are our own people. This is how much disrespect we have for that thing," the ex-army major says as the documentary shows images of boys stamping on South Africa's flag.
"It takes me a one-hour lecture to change their mind. Then they know they are no longer part of the rainbow nation.  They are part of a different nation with a very proud history," Mr Jooste boasts. Kommandokorps claims to have trained about 1,500 people - from a total white population of 4.6 million. The police do not publish data on the numbers of racist attacks but the South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) says the number of media reports of racist incidents is decreasing.
As they arrive at the camp, Riaan, 18, says: "South Africa is a rainbow nation because there are diverse ethnic groups in this country." After the training they have changed their views: "I have Afrikaner blood in my veins. I don't want to be a South African. I don't want to be associated with the rainbow nation."
"I don't like racism because people tend to get angry at one another and they maybe hit one another," a boy of 16 says. "This camp promotes racism but not bad racism," another one adds. Lucy Holborn from the SAIRR says many people were shocked by the video but this soon died down as people realised it represents just a small minority of the white population.
"When I was in the ground it was tough. I was in pain... I want to prove that I can," says one of the boys. Another, crying, added: "I don't want to disappoint my dad but I can't do this."
GUPnP is an elegant, object-oriented open source framework for creating UPnP devices and control points, written in C using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP API is intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible. It provides the same set of features as libupnp, but shields the developer from most of UPnP's internals.
Features
The GUPnP framework consists of the following libraries:
GSSDP implements resource discovery and announcement over SSDP.
GUPnP implements the UPnP specification: resource announcement and discovery, description, control, event notification, and presentation (GUPnP includes basic web server functionality through libsoup). GUPnP does not include helpers for construction or control of specific standardized resources (e.g. MediaServer); this is left for higher level libraries utilizing the GUPnP framework.
GUPnP-AV is a collection of helpers for building AV (audio/video) applications using GUPnP.
GUPnP-DLNA is a small utility library that aims to ease the DLNA-related tasks such as media profile guessing, transcoding to a given profile, etc.
GUPnP-IGD is a small client library that can be used to talk to Internet Gateway Devices to request NAT forwarding etc.
GUPnP-Tools is a set of utilities and demos to work with UPnP. It includes a generic control point, an AV controller, a network light, an uploader and an SSDP commandline client
Official bindings currently exist for the Vala language only. Unofficial bindings also exist for PHP (provided by Alexey Romanenko). Bindings to other languages are provided through gobject-introspection metadata.
Also available is a collection of developer tools utilising GUPnP and GTK+.

CodingStyle
GUPnP follows the same coding style as Rygel except:
All the rules that can't apply to C language (e.g the rule about use of 'this' operator and error declaration).
We follow 8-space indentation.
Single line if/for/while/etc blocks must not be enclosed in '{}'.
Don't hand-optimize null checks, leave that to compiler. Instead of 'if (some_variable)' you write 'if (some_variable != NULL)'
Developers
Seamless and GrubHub — two internet food delivery powerhouses — have officially announced that they will join forces in a merger. Both services offer websites and mobile apps allowing users to order food online to their homes or businesses, enabled through thousands of partnerships with local restaurants. "GrubHub and Seamless share a common goal to generate more business for local takeout restaurants," said GrubHub CEO Matt Maloney, who will serve as CEO of the new organization.
In a combined announcement, the companies say that the merger will bring together GrubHub's more than 20,000 local takeout restaurants in over 500 cities in the US, with Seamless' more than 12,000 restaurants in the US and UK. Seamless and GrubHub say that the partnership will expand its ordering network and product offerings, and that it will accelerate product development. Seamless and GrubHub achieved about $875 million in combined gross food sales to local takeout restaurants in 2012, with revenues of more than $100 million.
The military said Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner's communications went down, and that it didn't share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.
A twisting flight path described Tuesday by Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But AVM Montol said the Thai military doesn't know whether it detected the same plane.

Thailand's failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.
With only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.
When asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, "Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions."
They said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.
"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again," Montol said. "It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it."
Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.
Montol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar "was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane," back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.
They said they didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.
The search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs _ one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean _ that together cover an expanse as big as Australia.
Officials said radar equipment in southern Thailand detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said the plane might ultimately have passed through northern Thailand, but Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday that the country's northern radar did not detect it. (AP)
Wolf Pack End Losing Streak with OT Win
In a physical game at the XL Center Saturday night, Mat Bodie's three-on-three goal with 60 seconds left in overtime gave the Wolf Pack a 2-1 win over the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.
The victory snapped a five-game losing streak (0-4-1-0) for the Wolf Pack, who also got a goal and an assist from Chris Bourque, and 17 saves from Mackenzie Skapski. C.J. Stretch scored for Bridgeport, and Kevin Poulin stopped 28 shots.
“I don't think we got swept up in some of the physical play,” said Hartford coach Ken Gernander. “We were able to get our hits and maintain our coverage and play physical without crossing the line and taking penalties, which certainly is helpful.”
“That was our best game in the last five or six,” said Skapski. “It really got us excited, but at the same time we have to carry that on to the next game, and replicate what we did tonight.”
The first goal of the game came with 12:35 left in the second period. It came when the Sound Tigers sent their league-leading power-play unit to the ice after a Ryan Potulny hooking penalty. Harry Zolnierczyk got the puck in the corner, scanned the rink and found Stretch breaking to the back door.
Stretch's fourth goal of the season gave Bridgeport a 1-0 lead.
With 2:28 left in the second, the Hartford power-play unit took to the ice looking to tie the game up before the period was over. It was Conor Allen and Bourque with an exchange of the puck at the blue line that led to a Bourque one-timer, which beat Poulin over their catching glove to tie the game at one.
“Great pass by Conor, we had some great movement on the power play and it was a great screen by my brother (Ryan Bourque) in front of the net,” said Chris Bourque. “That's the whole play right there, is making sure the goalie doesn't see it, and they did a great job of getting in front of him.”
In overtime it was Bodie who ended the Wolf Pack's five-game skid, when they beat Poulin over their blocker on a wrist shot from the slot. After Bodie broke up a Bridgeport rush, Chris Bourque and J.T. Miller combined to find Bodie trailing on a three-on-two.
“I like it (playing three-on-three),” said Gernander. “I prefer that to a shootout. I don't appreciate the excitement of a shootout compared to three-on-three hockey. You go down and get an offensive opportunity and you'd better be pretty proficient or it's coming back the other way, and to me that's a lot more exciting.”
Next up for the Wolf Pack is a trip to Albany this Wednesday, November 26 to battle the Devils. That game faces off at 7:00, and all of the action can be heard live on Fox Sports Radio 1410, and on-line at www.foxsportsradio1410.com and iHeartRadio. Video streaming is available at www.ahllive.com.
The Wolf Pack's next home game is Friday, November 28, with the Norfolk Admirals visiting the XL Center for a 7:00 game. Once again this season, every Friday night home game features $1 hot dogs and $2 beers through the start of the second period, and November 28 is also “Flashback Friday”, with the Wolf Pack wearing “throwback”, 1997-98-era jerseys. Plus, there will be “Black Friday” giveaways of some of the holiday season's hot gift items.
Tickets for all 2014-15 Wolf Pack home games are now on sale at the XL Center ticket office, on-line at www.hartfordwolfpack.com and by phone at (877) 522-8499. Wolf Pack tickets start as low as $12 for youth 12 years old or younger.

One of the most startling and original books I have read in the last five years is surely David P. Goldman's How Civilizations Die (And Why Islam is Dying too).[1]
Right from the beginning of their Introduction, Goldman shatters so many of our strongly held beliefs that we are left reeling, and pondering the truly disturbing implications of their conclusions, which are all backed by statistics from recognized sources such as the United Nations. Here are some of their observations from their dramatic introduction, “For the first time in history, the birth rate of the whole developed world is well below replacement, and a significant part of it has passed the demographic point of no return.”
However, all is not well in the Islamic world either, “But Islamic society is even more fragile. As Muslim fertility shrinks at the rate demographers have never seen before, it is converging on Europe's catastrophically low fertility as if in time-lapse photography. Iranian women in their twenties who grew up with five or six siblings will bear only or two children during their lifetimes. Turkey and Algeria are just behind Iran on the way down, and most other Muslim countries are catching up quickly. By the middle of this century, the belt of Muslim countries from Morocco to Iran will become as gray as depopulating Europe. The Islamic world will have the same proportion of dependent elderly as the industrial countries - but one tenth the productivity. A time bomb is ticking in the Muslim world”.[2]
But, as Goldman warns, population decline will cause violent upheavals, and already Iran is responding with aggression. “We love death, and you love life”[3] is the common attitude among various Islamic groups. Goldman continues, “A people facing cultural extinction may well choose war, if war offers even a slim chance of survival. That is just how radical Islamists view the predicament of traditional Muslim society in the face of modernity. The Islamists fear that if they fail, their religion and culture will disappear into the maelstorm of the modern world. Many of them would rather die fighting.”[4]
The Muslim world is facing the fastest demographic or population decline ever recorded in history.[5] Hania Zlotnik, director of the population division at the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said in a conference in 2009, “In most of the Islamic world it's amazing, the decline in fertility that has happened.”[6] The New York Times reported, “From 1975 to 1980, women in Iran were giving birth to nearly 7 children per family, according to the latest U.N. population report; from 2005 to 2010 that number is expected to be less than 2. Other Middle Eastern states in the top 15, in order of the steepest drop, include Tunisia, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Kuwait, Qatar and Morocco.”[7] Fertility in the Muslim world has declined two or three times faster than the world average.[8]
Though there are more Iranians in their mid-twenties than in any other age bracket, they are not reproducing; educated Iranian women in their mid-twenties will only bear one child. An aging population presents grave dangers to all societies, but in poor countries with primitive social institutions, the effects will be even worse. Most Muslim countries have no public pension systems; the elderly have traditionally relied on their many children to look after them. Europe, with GDP[9] per person of $30,000 in 2009, is wealthy enough to look after its elderly, at least to a certain extent. But “Egypt and Indonesia have less than a tenth of Europe's per capita GDP. Algeria, like Iran, earns, $4,400 per capita, while Pakistan shows barely $1,000 per capita - half of Pakistanis live on $1 a day or less. Even Turkey, the one Muslim country with some semblance of a modern economy, generates only $8,000 per capita, about a quarter of Europe's GDP.”[10]
However, pace “declinists,” America is one country that will have the people necessary to shoulder the burden of looking after its graying population, as I shall show below; the rest of the world will not have enough workers for such a task. By 2070, “several Muslim countries will have a higher proportion of elderly dependents than Western Europe. And the relative economic burden will be much, much heavier in the fast-aging Muslim countries.”[11]
IRAN AND TURKEY
If present trends continue, Iran will be grayer than Europe by 2070; Turkey's population is aging almost as fast. What is more, the leaders in these two countries are and have been aware of this problem for many years, and their dire warnings to their countrymen and women are hardly ever reported in the Western press. “If we continue the existing trend, 2038 will mark disaster for us,” Erdoğan warned their nation in 2010.[12] While the then President Ahmadinejad of Iran said in 2010,
“Two children' is a formula for the extinction of a nation, not the survival of a nation….The most recent data showing that there are only 18 children for every 10 Iranian couples should raise an alarm among the present generation….This is what is wrong with the West. Negative population growth will cause extinction of our identity and culture. The fact that we have accepted this places us on the wrong path. To want to consume more rather than having children is an act of genocide.”[13]
While fertility rates of Muslims in Europe are higher than that for other women, there is evidence that over time the differences diminish. There seems to be one exception: Great Britain. Them population will rise to 77 million in 2050, and more than half the new births will come from immigrant mothers.[14]
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Finally, we come to the United States of America. As David Goldman in Part Three of their book, with the heading Why It Won't Be A Post-American World, says, “Among the large industrial countries, there is one great exception to the declinist story: the United States. If a single characteristic makes America exceptional, it is the fact that American fertility has stabilized at replacement. In other words, as Europe and Japan reach the point of no return on the road to senility and depopulation, America will maintain its population along with a healthy balance among age cohorts. In the second half of this century most of the great powers of the past - Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, and Japan, among others - will cease to function. A century later they will have ceased to exist. What makes America utterly and completely exceptional among industrial countries, in short, is that it will still be here in a hundred years.”[15]
What is the reason or cause of this difference or exceptionalism? Goldman replies, “It is not that Americans in general are having children, but that Americans of faith are having children, and there are more Americans of faith than citizens of any other industrial country…. [Briefly,] in both Europe and America those who practice a religion have more children than those who do not. It's just that there are far more Americans than Europeans practicing a faith.”[16]
CONCLUSIONS
The one problem with my article generally, and David Goldman's book in particular, is that, as my friend Rebecca Bynum pointed out to me, they may make us too complacent: “Islam is waning, young Muslims are becoming atheists, there is a rise in conversions to Christianity, and the fertility rate of Islamic countries is declining at an incredible speed, while that of the USA is remaining steady. So what is there to worry about?” If only it were that simple. And it is one of the merits of Goldman's book is that it does confront the problems head on. There is Obama's catastrophic foreign policy, which may well lead to a nuclear Iran. There is the militancy of American Muslims who never tire in their efforts to impose the Sharia, Islamic Law, on the rest of us, aided and abetted by the present Obama administration. And if Hillary Clinton is elected President in November 2016, then we can expect an even more sinister presence, that of the Muslim Brotherhood, in the administration. This is not right wing paranoia - thanks to the archives of the former Soviet Union we now know that FDR's administration, and the entire State Department was infiltrated by communists. Why is it then so impossible to imagine something similar happening with the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating Hillary Clinton's White House?
But we have also other urgent moral concerns: the need to highlight the plight of the Christians in the Middle East.[17] The persecution, harassment, and murder of Christians in the Islamic world has worsened in the last ten years. The present Obama administration refuses to acknowledge its existence, let alone do anything about it. To acknowledge the persecution would be to destroy Obama and their administration's claim that Islam is a religion of peace. While Muslims are getting visas to the USA at an alarming rate, Christian refugees are being refused entry. We would all do well to read the tireless efforts of Raymond Ibrahim to take the present Obama administration to task for not helping Christians. Here is an extract from their recent article at Gatestone Institute, [18] “During the height of one of the most brutal months of Muslim persecution of Christians, the U.S. State Department exposed its double standards against persecuted Christian minorities. Sister Diana, an influential Iraqi Christian leader, who was scheduled to visit the U.S. to advocate for persecuted Christians in the Mideast, was denied a visa by the U.S. State Department even though they had visited the U.S. before, most recently in 2012. They were to be one of a delegation of religious leaders from Iraq -- including Sunni, Shia and Yazidi, among others -- to visit Washington, D.C., to describe the situation of their people. Every religious leader from this delegation to Washington D.C. was granted a visa -- except for the only Christian representative, Sister Diana. After this refusal became public, many Americans protested, some writing to their members of congress. Discussing the nun's visa denial, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said:
This is an administration which never seems to find a good enough excuse to help Christians, but always finds an excuse to apologize for terrorists ... I hope that as it gets attention that Secretary Kerry will reverse it. If they don't, Congress has to investigate, and the person who made this decision ought to be fired.
The State Department eventually granted Sister Diana a visa.
The fact that there are so many ex-Muslim atheists, makes nonsense of the charge of Islamophobia hurled at all who dare to critcise Islam, that most criticisable of all religions. The unwritten subtext of such a charge is, of course, that the person so accused is ignorant, racist, and bigotted. But the existence of millions of Middle Easterners, and South Asians, who are now atheists refutes the claim that all those critical of Islam must be racists. Islam, in any case, is not a race. Second, the young Egyptians, Saudis, Iraqis and others who have firmly rejected Islam, have had experience of Islam from the inside; many of them have studied Islam to a very advanced level, and hence cannot be guilty of ignorance. And yes, they did read the Koran in the original Arabic. They know the social consequences of imposing Islam on the general populace: lack of freedom, those freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and which we in the West take so much for granted. The charge of Islamophobia is an effective way of curtailing all rational discussions of Islam. As Christopher Hitchens once said, “Islamophobic is a word created by fascists, and used by cowards, to manipulate morons.”[19]
This is the second of a 3-part post summarizing my experiences dealing with illness and starting a business in the past year. I recommend reading part 1 first, where I talked about taking control of my life and leaving my job. In this part, I'll talk about the next steps I took after quitting, and how I fell into starting a business.
I will annoyingly stick with the Hobbit metaphors.
Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire
I had just left my job due to illness, and I had no solid plan. But I expected I would find other full-time work before my limited funds ran out. I definitely had confidence that I'd find other jobs I qualified for, since my web development skills are always in demand. But that didn't make it any less scary to not have a real plan.
And reality hit me. I suddenly became really worried that unless I found an absolutely perfect employer who could be flexible enough to accommodate my needs, any position I found would lead to the same problems I'd encountered at my last couple of jobs. At the job I'd left I was putting in well over 40 hours a week, but it drained me to the point that I couldn't function. And my schedule would be too unpredictable for most jobs.
Even more so, I was worried at the prospect of going through another medical accommodation process, which was a lengthy nightmare at my last job.
As I started to realize all this I got a little bit panicky. I started to accept that I just didn't feel comfortable taking on another full-time job.
But while looking for a job and figuring out what to do, I picked up a couple of contract projects to make ends meet, and they went really well. Suddenly I was making decent money. And for the first time I realized I might actually have the skills and motivation to really work for myself, a prospect that had frightened me before, and still did to a degree.
It's amazing what you can accomplish when you feel like you have no choice.
It's like being pushed out of the nest and having to learn to fly on the way down.
I'd always had doubts about my ability to live on full-time consulting work – to find enough clients, to charge enough to get by, to not always know where the next check is coming from, and to not have regular benefits. I would worry that clients will always find someone better, faster, cheaper. But that mentality turned around for me thanks to two things – I've been extremely lucky to be part of a great mastermind group, and I've been following courses by Brennan Dunn and others, and through them I eventually realized that I was not just capable of doing the work I needed to do, but that I was able to sell myself and my skills for what I'm worth.
So I stuck with it. I started a consulting business, and so far I've been pretty successful. I've had a string of clients – many through referrals – to the point that we got by really well for the last part of the year. We had a nice Christmas, which I had no way of foreseeing when walking out of my job with no immediate prospects seven months before.
I have no plans to go back to full-time work for the foreseeable future.
But that doesn't mean it's all roses.
The Desolation of Brain Fog
It's 3:00 in the afternoon and I'm staring at my keyboard, trying to remember what I was just doing. A minute ago I was cranking out code, but the fog has been creeping in…
Daily work is still an enormous struggle for me. It's all indescribably better than the situation I was in the first half of the year, but instead of the demands of a daily full-time job, I'm trying to get client work done, spend time with family, and build my business (finding new leads, figuring out my finances and taxes, etc.), all of which gets disrupted by that second full-time job I still have – my illness.
There are many aspects of my dysautonomia that affect my ability to work. Some are physical, like my sleep difficulties and related fatigue during the day. I often feel light-headed when standing up, and occasional random tachycardia spikes interrupt my work (due to mundane reasons like changes in barometric pressure outside). My daily routine involves waking up very late and spending several hours waiting for medications to take effect, for food and caffeine to settle in, and to generally adjust to being vertical.
But the symptom that probably affects my ability to work the most is one that I rarely talk about publicly, and even downplay among family and friends, because I fear that it will directly impact perceptions of me and my ability to work. It's called brain fog, and I think it's the kind of thing that's important to talk about.
Brain fog is a general term for a type of cognitive impairment (PDF), usually thought to be brought on in cases of dysautonomia by an inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain thanks to reduced blood flow. As a result, I often find myself staring at my screen, trying to find a word or grasp a concept that should be immediately apparent. It causes me to have trouble holding my attention on a task. It affects my ability to hold the big picture of a system in my head like I used to. I feel like I've lost the ability to grok things.
As a professional whose primary work is in programming, it's probably clear how this can impact my livelihood. It's hard to request reasonable medical accommodation on the basis that sometimes programming is too hard. And it makes the prospect of technical interviews pretty daunting.
Brain fog and similar cognitive impairments have a huge effect not just on someone's abilities and daily tasks, but also on their emotional state and self-perception. The most frustrating part of dealing with it for me is that I retain plenty of self awareness and metacognition to actually recognize my limitations (another patient, Michelle Roger, wrote a great piece about this from the perspective of someone who used to care for patients with cognitive deficits). It's like hitting an invisible wall inside your mind, where the answers are just on the other side, out of reach.
And since I put a lot of effort into hiding or downplaying this, it gives me a special kind of imposter syndrome, in which I fear that I sometimes literally can't do the kinds of work I need to be able to do, and that I'll be found out at any time.
Taking Control
So in addition to all the physical problems I deal with already, I have to do a lot to compensate for this too. First and foremost, I take medication and salt pills to adjust my blood volume, as well as medication for attention deficit.
And I wear medical compression stockings. Yes, I wear stockings. Friends may be surprised by this until they realize they haven't seen me wear shorts in years. Putting on my stockings in the morning to get out of bed makes me suddenly clear-headed and gives me a burst of energy – like a superhero putting on their power suit. It's usually not enough to complete defeat the symptoms, but it's amazing what a bit of proper blood flow can do for your physical and mental state.
Then I have a number of productivity techniques I stick to. I avoid phone calls as much as I can. I take a lot of notes. I have lists and lists and lists. Trello is a godsend. I keep a notebook with my current tasks and a star next to the most important item simply to convey “this is what you're working on right now.” I automate whatever I can. And an interesting result is that I'm finding ways to focus on the end goal – delivering value and results, not the technology when coding.
But the important thing to stress is that since this problem comes and goes, and sometimes alleviates throughout the day, it doesn't directly affect the quality of my work – it mostly affects when I can work, and sometimes what kind of work I can do. If I'm stuck in a fog during the day, I generally put off work or focus on menial tasks and come back to the heavy thinking when I'm able. Then I'll typically reach a point in the late afternoon or evening where the veil is lifted, the clouds part, and my productivity sets in. I really get to work.
Then my family comes home.
So what it comes down to in a practical business sense is that the vast majority of my day – that damn metaphorical other full-time job – is unbillable time.
Finding Focus
The main problem I've started to find with freelancing is that my situation makes it difficult to work on an hourly basis. I do it, and I feel like I do the work well, but it's completely draining to maintain the personal standards and high quality of work I insist on providing to my clients. And my schedule often is too unpredictable to commit to specific timeframes. I tend to compensate for this by not billing for all the time I work. I'm adamant about only charging clients for the work I'm providing.
So the biggest change I plan to make to address these challenges is to gear my entire business around them. I have a plan for this next year.
My goal is to transition to selling my skills and knowledge instead of my hours. Brennan touches on this in their course. I want to develop “info products” like ebooks, courses, or even services – software or otherwise – that I can start to turn into processes, automate, and maybe hire out. I know that I can write, and I have years of experience I can share. I can still manage and coordinate tasks, so I can delegate to others. Amy Hoy touched on the benefits of bootstrapping a business this way in another really inspirational post about how their software-as-a-service (SaaS) business was able to run on its own while they dealt with their own dysautonomia.
So my first step is to start transitioning from hourly freelance work to either weekly billing or monthly retainers, and to productized consulting. I'm going to package up things that I'm good at, that are repeatable, and that will bring real value to clients, then I will market them. The process of selling myself and my skills in a repeatable way will help me learn better how to research, market, and deliver results to clients and customers.
Starting anything new is still difficult, especially given my circumstances. So I decided to jumpstart this approach last month after Amy Hoy took on a 24-hour product challenge (along with Nathan Barry), and wrote an ebook called Just Fucking Ship – which pretty well sums up the mentality I've been learning to adopt this past year. Just put stuff out there. Make some kind of change that moves you towards your goals, then learn from it and improve it. Stop making excuses and letting doubt and uncertainty keep you from moving forward.
So a number of friends and I were inspired to do our own 7-day product challenge. And considering my work and travel, I did the best thing I could – I scoped down my project to what was doable with only a couple of days' work, and created my first productized consulting service to review and roadmap abandoned or inherited ASP.NET applications, a need I've seen at almost every client and employer I've worked for over the last several years. It's a simple work-in-progress landing page, but it's the start of a new direction for me, and a proof-of-concept and framework for future services that I'll spend more time researching and marketing. It was an experiment in figuring out what I can offer, building a landing page, and creating a capture process for business leads.
[Update: I've since discontinued that service to focus on more custom solutions to clients for now, and removed the link here. But I hope to do similar things in the future. As mentioned, it was a great learning opportunity.]
I know I was stubborn to commit to building something I didn't have time for, and to stick to it so hard (to the point of frustrating myself). But the one thing this past year has taught me is that you can't wait to make changes, and you can't wait for changes to come to you. And having external motivators and accountability can help push you forward.
I've only made the first steps in getting to where I need to be, by leaving my job, setting up a business, and now focusing on gearing that business around my capabilities. But I feel like I'm going in the right direction, and I can set some goals to get me there.
And I'm going to write about it as I go.
To Be Concluded
In the next and final part, I'm going to talk about the other big effort I've made this year to address all these problems – exercising. And why doing it represent something special to me.

Update: part 3 of this series is now available.
Remember when John Kasich went on Fox News and said "Anybody who would root against the economy has something wrong with them?" That was just one month ago. Someone should have told Mitt Romney that before they scuttled over to Florida and told Rick Scott to ixnay on the improvements in Florida.
Via Bloomberg News:
Mitt Romney's presidential campaign asked Florida Governor Rick Scott to tone down their statements heralding improvements in the state's economy because they clash with the presumptive Republican nominee's message that the nation is suffering under President Barack Obama, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Scott, a Republican, was asked to say that the state's jobless rate could improve faster under a Romney presidency, according to the people, who asked not to be named.
What's unfolding in Florida highlights a dilemma for the Romney campaign: how to allow Republican governors to take credit for economic improvements in their states while faulting Obama's flight attendantship of the national economy. Republican governors in Ohio, Virginia, Michigan and Wisconsin also have highlighted improving economies.
Scott should follow the advice of the Romney campaign and it won't undermine their own message, said Mac Stipanovich, a political strategist and lobbyist in Florida.
“This is one of those situations where you could have it both ways and there's enough truth in it that it would resonate,” Stipanovich said. “It would be better if everybody was singing from the same hymnal.”
Previously, in Ludum Dare…
In case you missed it, LD36 will be a little bit unusual, in that it won't feature ratings.
To bring everyone up to date, the reason behind that is that PoV, when announcing their break from running the August LD, has also raised concerns over the ratings system. They recommended not to use it for this event, and following a poll made by Sorceress, we voted in majority to follow their advice.
Now, some of us really wanted to still find a cool incentive for players to play each other's games. Ludum Dare may be enjoyed for the competition, but getting loads of playtesting and sharing feedback with each other is also a great part of what makes the event special.
So here comes our little experiment:
Here's how it works:
Right after LD36 ends, you'll be able to use this little thing to browse games and find those who need feedback the most. The more games you comment on, the higher you'll be featured! The goal, of course, is to make sure everyone gets some comments on their games, and reward the more active commenters with more feedback.
If you're curious, you can already browse the games from Ludum Dare 35 to get an idea of how it works.
Open beta: MiniLD #69
Starting today, the mini-site will be open for the current MiniLD in order to test things out, gather opinions and make some tweaks.
Please share your suggestions & bug reports in the comments. And if you're curious, feel free to check the Github repository!
[Update] The Ludum Dare world map
Additional announcement: Will Edwards is looking for contributors (artists/programmers) to upgrade a project they made for LD30.
It featured a nice map of the world, where people could place their entries and find their neighbors. It also encouraged commenting on other games, which is exactly what we're trying to do. It would be a nice way to complement the Feedback Friends, so if you have some skills & free time, you know what to do!
With the popularity of "RuPaul's Drag Race," drag has arguably become mainstream. Even set against the complex and ugly backdrop of current events — like North Carolina's discriminatory law limiting bathroom access to transgender people — the show has reached a wide audience, including a straight demographic.
For many viewers, drag simply means a man dressing up as a woman, albeit an exaggerated version of a woman, or presenting as a different gender. Drag lives to poke holes in the artifice of fixed identity and gender, The New York Times argued.
But is drag still radical when a woman do it?
Courtney Conquers
Female drag queens — also known as “ladyqueens,” “bioqueens,” “hyperqueens,” or the more controversial “faux queens” — would say so.
Courtney Conquers
“Drag is anything that explores identity in any way and fucks with expectations of gender,” said Courtney Conquers, a self-proclaimed bioqueen and co-founder of the female drag collective Drag Coven, in an interview with ATTN:.
Conquers — who was introduced to the world of drag through "Drag Race" and has performed in drag for a year and a half — finds several elements of drag empowering as a woman.
“Drag is body positive, and in drag, you can create your own family, based on love and networking,” Conquers said. “Drag also associates intelligence and wit with femininity, and there aren't a lot of forums that make that connection in a positive way.”
Courtney Conquers
If drag is an art form embodying hyper-femininity, women offer a unique and valuable perspective.
“Speaking in a woman's body and from a woman's perspective, drag is taking all those things society tells you that you have to look like — ‘You have to have long hair.' ‘You need to be pretty.' — and flushing it down the toilet,” said Crimson Kitty, a female drag queen and founder of LadyQueen University, a workshop “designed to turn any lady into a drag queen.”
Crimson Kitty
These women express solidarity with their fellow drag queens, but they have experienced some backlash, both online and in real life, based on the criticism that they are co-opting gay culture.
A Reddit thread posing the question “How do you feel about faux queens?” included the following response:
reddit
Crimson Kitty, who has been performing drag for more than five years, has heard the accusations and comments before.
Crimson Kitty “We're always going to have a different point of view,” said Crimson Kitty. “To a degree, drag queens are mocking women – and I don't think they're being disrespectful – but why can't we as women do the same?”
Other responses in the Reddit thread expressed similar sentiments:
reddit
reddit
“For me, I want to see drag that's all about transformation, and even if you're a female entertainer, you can do that as well,” said Erika Klash, a male drag queen who has performed with Crimson Kitty, in an interview with ATTN:.
Erika Klash
“When we have a female-bodied person doing drag, we're allowing them to engage in a conversation that gay men are celebrating and things they're subverting – gender norms, misogynistic behavior, catcalling — to say men can only be involved is completely missing the point,” Klash said.
Crimson Kitty
For women, specifically, drag can be an act of resistance to the male gaze and against the pressure of ideal beauty standards.
“It's important for women to express themselves however they see fit – through drag, we're creating our own version of ourselves.” – Crimson Kitty
The state pension will increase by 2.5% in April next year, the Government has confirmed.
From next spring, people on the new flat rate pension will see their weekly payments rise from £155.65 to £159.55, while the old state pension will increase by £3 to £122.30.
The increase is in line with earnings growth and therefore meeting the promises outlined in George Osborne's triple lock pledge on pensions.
Pressure has been mounting to scrap the policy, which ensures the state pension increases each year until 2020 by inflation, earnings growth or 2.5% - whichever is higher.
Chancellor Philip Hammond in their Autumn Statement hinted the commitment could be dropped as they pledged to appraise “public spending priorities and other commitments” at the next Spending Review.
And Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green was tight-lipped on the subject over the weekend, saying it is “far too early” to predict what will feature in the Tories' 2020 manifesto.
The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) have released figures that show the cost of providing the state pension will rise from 5.3% of GDP to 7.2% by 2046 if ministers maintain the triple lock commitment
It comes after a former minister claimed the Government may be preparing to increase the official state pension age to 70 for people currently in their 20s.
Steve Webb said the DWP were preparing documents that suggest a “more aggressive timetable” on state pension age increases.
It is currently due to rise to 66 between 2018 and 2020, to 67 between 2026 and 2028, before increasing to 68 between 2044 and 2046.
The PPI found that automatic enrolment into pensions and the triple lock were set to increase retirement incomes, but this was offset by increases to the state pension age that meant over their lifetime individuals would receive less on average.
“Looking forward, both the ‘triple lock' and automatic enrolment could significantly increase the level of people's retirement incomes, said Daniela Silcock, head of policy research at the PPI.
“For those nearest state pension age the triple lock has the most immediate effect whereas younger individuals may gain most from automatic enrolment.”
Immigration debates often send people running for the hills, but the recent exchange between White House Advisor Stephen Miller and CNN's Jim Acosta sent people running for the dictionary.
Merriam-Webster reported a spike in people looking up the word "cosmopolitan" after the Acosta-Miller dust up, and the fourth estate led the nation in a hunt for the true meaning of the word "cosmopolitan."
Columnist Kathleen Parker suggested that Miller might have meant "globalist or elitist," which makes some sense given the populist wave Trump rode to the White House.
A columnist for the Washington Post took Miller's saw Parker's "elitist" and raised it with a ”swampy elitism" and went so far as to suggest that it is actually Miller who is cosmopolitan because they live in an expensive apartment.
Acosta themselves took "cosmopolitan" as a commentary on their living accommodations.
Wait, didn't cosmopoli-gate start with a discussion about green card policy? It's so typical of immigration politics for the conversation to quickly steer away from actual policy. I don't know what Miller meant exactly with their jab but it is safe to say they aren't accusing Acosta of living in a nice house.
The media is missing an opportunity here to elevate the debate. The word "cosmopolitan" means something specific in an immigration context. In their 2015 column, ”Two Theories of Immigration," Mark R. Amstutz, Professor of political science at Wheaton College wrote:
"The norms of international law stipulate that people have a right to emigrate from their homeland but not a right to immigrate to any particular country. Right of entry can be granted only by the country of destination. Scholars of international relations have developed two approaches to guide these considerations: communitarianism and cosmopolitanism. The policies we favor follow from our loyalty to one of these two approaches. The communitarian favors a more restrictive approach; the cosmopolitan a more open one. Both seek to promote human dignity."
The communitarian, Amstutz explains, is ever mindful of how the nation state serves the members of the national community, especially those who are disadvantaged. The cosmopolitan, on the other hand, is suspicious of nation states as entities that emphasize the well-being of their own citizens over those of other countries.
The ethics of immigration require one to consider the impact on citizens of the receiving country, the citizens who remain in the sending countries, and the immigrants themselves. Therefore the tension between the communitarian and the cosmopolitan are and will ever be constant. What happens next in the immigration debate isn't the victory of one view over the other but a temporary armistice that achieves a kind of balance. It will come down - as it always does - to two questions: "how many?" and "how do we get there?".
We have not had an open debate about the numbers for decades. The RAISE Act has given the media a chance to facilitate a long overdue conversation. I hope they won't waste the opportunity quibbling over personal real estate.

2016 Jeep Cherokee (Photo: FCA)
The first Jeep Cherokee produced in China rolled off the assembly line on Monday, marking a significant milestone for the sport utility vehicle brand.
Executives with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Guangzhou Automobile Group, its Chinese joint-venture partner, were joined by senior government officials for a special event at the company's Changsha plant, where the vehicle will be produced for that market.
“Today marks a milestone in the history of our brand,” said Mike Manley, head of Jeep and chief operating officer of the Asia-Pacific region.
The GAC Fiat Chrysler Automobiles joint venture expects full Cherokee production in November, with deliveries to begin before the end of the year. By 2016, the Jeep brand's portfolio in China is expected to consist of three new models, including the locally-produced Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Renegade.
China is an important part of Jeep's global expansion through 2018. Fiat Chrysler plans to produce 1.9 million Jeeps by 2018 at 10 plants in six countries: the U.S., Italy, China, Brazil, India and one other yet-to-be-announced country. Two years ago, only 798,000 rolled out of four plants in the United States.
Global growth of the brand is a centerpiece of an ambitious five-year plan of Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne to grow Fiat Chrysler's global sales to 7 million by 2018, a 60 percent increase from 2013. During the 2015 Detroit auto show in January, Marchionne said globalization of the brand is the key mission for the year.
China represents the largest Jeep market outside the U.S.
The GAC FCA Changsha plant, the birthplace of the locally produced Jeep Cherokee, is the first in China to adopt the exacting World Class Manufacturing (WCM) standards. WCM is a methodology that focuses on reducing waste, increasing productivity and improving quality and safety in a systematic and organized way.
Jeep production in China originally begin in 1983 but ceased in the mid-2000s.

In Defiance of Wall Street, Richmond, Calif., Declares Eminent Domain For Underwater Mortgages
RICHMOND — An unprecedented plan to buy struggling Richmond homeowners' underwater mortgages is moving forward.
The Richmond City Council voted 4 to 3 early Wednesday morning to continue pursuing the controversial plan, which could use the city's power of eminent domain to force bondholders to sell underwater loans, allowing homeowners to restructure their mortgages.
The council rejected an agenda item submitted by Vice Mayor Corky Booze and Councilman Nathaniel Bates to strike down offers to buy the mortgages.
“Many in our community have been targeted by predatory loans, too many have already lost their homes, and all of the city of Richmond has suffered,” said Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who authored the council resolution in favor of the plan.
About half of the city's homeowners are underwater on their mortgages, city manager Bill Lindsay said at the start of Tuesday night's roughly seven-hour meeting at the Richmond Memorial Auditorium.
In a bid to counter that trend, City Mayor Gayle McLaughlin has led the charge toward a partnership with San Francisco investment firm Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP) to buy 624 city residents' mortgages that are underwater, or that owe more money than the home is currently worth.
Under the Richmond Community Action to Restore Equity and Stability plan, or Richmond CARES, the city could use eminent domain to force the sale of the mortgages if lenders don't accept the offer, city officials say.
Four of seven council members voted for the mayor's proposal to continue Richmond CARES and to set up a joint powers authority between Richmond and any other cities teaming up with MRP.
So far, the Southern California city of El Monte has expressed the most interest in partnering with MRP and has urged Richmond to set a precedent by moving forward with the partnership, McLaughlin said.
The council struck down a measure authored by Councilman Jim Rogers requiring MRP to provide insurance protecting the city of Richmond from all litigation and related damages related to the plan before moving forward with eminent domain action.
Rogers said they drafted the item after learning that MRP hadn't secured insurance to protect the city from potential litigation stemming from the eminent domain plan.
MRP executive chairperson Steven Gluckstern noted before the meeting that the firm is covering legal costs associated with any litigation against the city related to the partnership and said a joint powers authority would provide further protection.
On Thursday, a federal court is set to rule on a lawsuit brought against the city by Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank over the plan. The suit alleges that the proposed use of eminent domain, which is typically used to purchase private land for public use, is unconstitutional.
The banks say the plan would also harm Richmond in the long run by making it tougher for city residents to get approved for mortgage financing.
But McLaughlin and their supporters describe the plan as an innovative solution to help conscientious Richmond homeowners stay in their homes and as a long-overdue stand against the Wall Street investors that offered predatory loans in the first place.
Groups on both sides of the eminent domain proposal attended Tuesday night's meeting to make their case.
Many proponents of the plan, including members of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) and the Richmond Progressive Alliance wore yellow T-shirts and hoisted small flags provided by ACCE.
Many of the dozens of speakers who voiced support for the plan during the marathon meeting identified themselves as underwater Richmond homeowners struggling to keep their homes.
Patricia Castillo said their Richmond home, which they purchased in 2005, is on the brink of foreclosure, and that they are holding out hope that Richmond CARES will work.
“I've seen a lot of impact in my neighborhood; families moved that couldn't modify or keep up with their payments,” they added. “We need these programs to help stabilize our neighborhoods, it's time to stand up to Wall Street and stand up for the city of Richmond.”
On the other hand, Joshua Genser, a lifelong Richmond resident and longtime property and business owner, said the forced sale of a home for 80 percent of its market value under the city's proposal would harm Richmond property owners, not the banks.
“If we pass this program it will be impossible to get credit in the city,” they said. “The plan is dangerous to every resident, every business owner in the city of Richmond.”
Dozens of others at the meeting, including a group of about ten young men who declined to say whether they live in Richmond, wore red T-shirts that said “Stop Investor Greed,” the name of a group formed against the eminent domain plan.
The group is headed by local real estate broker and past president of the West Contra Costa County Association of Realtors Jeff Wright.
Many residents at the meeting said they had recently received glossy mailers sent out by the WCCAR decrying the city's principal reduction plan.
Wright said they believe the plan would harm Richmond by making it tougher for homeowners to get credit and said investors who might choose not to lend money in Richmond because of the plan would be exercising understandable caution.
Some speculate that the city's failure last month to sell $34 million in bonds is a sign of Wall Street's early retaliation against the plan.
But Amy Schur, an ACCE campaign director, said the mortgage acquisition program “is actually a win-win-win for everybody,” including banks, which stand to lose from homes going into foreclosure.
“This is not about anyone making money, this is about saving homes,” they said.
Schur also echoed statements from the mayor and other council members who have said any retaliatory action from banks against Richmond would equate to redlining – a term used to describe a discriminatory practice by banks that raise costs or decline to do business in minority communities.
“We can't let fear stop us from stabilizing our community and we can't let fear keep us from boosting our local economy,” Councilwoman Jovanka Beckles said, drawing applause and cheers from the audience, which dwindled from several hundred Tuesday evening to several dozen by early Wedmesdau morning.
The mostly peaceful meeting, punctuated with applause and cheers, devolved by the early morning into insults and personal attacks on fellow council members from Booze and Bates, causing the mayor to call for a brief recess before the council's final vote.
Under the Richmond Community Action to Restore Equity and Stability plan, or Richmond CARES, the city could use eminent domain to force the sale of the mortgages if lenders don't accept the offer, city officials say.
Four of seven council members voted for the mayor's proposal to continue Richmond CARES and to set up a joint powers authority between Richmond and any other cities teaming up with MRP.

Schur also echoed statements from the mayor and other council members who have said any retaliatory action from banks against Richmond would equate to redlining – a term used to describe a discriminatory practice by banks that raise costs or decline to do business in minority communities.
“We can't let fear stop us from stabilizing our community and we can't let fear keep us from boosting our local economy,” Councilwoman Jovanka Beckles said, drawing applause and cheers from the audience, which dwindled from several hundred Tuesday evening to several dozen by early Wedmesdau morning.
The mostly peaceful meeting, punctuated with applause and cheers, devolved by the early morning into insults and personal attacks on fellow council members from Booze and Bates, causing the mayor to call for a brief recess before the council's final vote.

Summary: New research provides some details on the characteristics of motor detection in the brains of flies.
Source: Max Planck Institute.
Neurobiologists discover important characteristics of the motion detector in the fly brain.
In order to react to changes in the environment in good time, the brain must analyze the signals it receives from the eyes rapidly and accurately. For example, the ability to recognise the direction in which an approaching car is moving is vital to the survival of modern humans in cities. Using the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology study how the brain extracts this essential motion information. They have now described in detail the cells that enable downstream neurons to recognize the direction of movement. Interestingly, the characteristics of these input cells exactly match to a motion detector model they recently proposed. In addition, the cells alter their characteristics according to the animals' state: when the fly is active, the cells respond faster to light stimuli.
Humans perceive their environment mainly through their eyes. The ability to recognize movements and their direction is something that seems almost trivial and automatic to us. However, this information has to be processed in the brain as the light-sensitive sensory cells of the retina can only register changes in contrast. The direction of a movement can only be calculated through the comparison of neighbouring signals. Various models exist for these calculations. Alexander Borst and their team at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology study the extent to which these models can be applied to the brain's neuronal circuitry. Their test subject is the fruit fly Drosophila, a master of motion perception.
In the brain of the fruit fly, the T4 and T5 cells are the first neurons that respond to a motion stimulus in a direction-selective way. It was long assumed that these cells compare the signals from two adjacent image points in the fly's field of vision and in this way calculate the direction of motion. However, this very simple model was unable to explain all of the empirical measurements recorded by the neurobiologists. “So our department developed a model in which three rather than two adjacent image points are compared with each other,” says Alexander Arenz, explaining the starting point of the current study. “We wanted to test this model using the cells in the fly brain.” A new anatomical study had revealed beforehand that both T4 and T5 cells receive their input signals from four different types of cells. Hence a model with three input cells appeared plausible.
Using a kind of fly cinema, the researchers presented different light stimuli to the flies and recorded the reactions of the different input cell types. The results revealed strong variations in the speed and duration of the individual cells' responses to changes in brightness. To analyze the significance of these differences in greater detail, the researchers fed the measured data on the cell characteristics into a computer simulation of the network. The simulations indicated that the measured differences between the cells and the resulting delays with which the T4 and T5 cells receive their signals are essential for the recognition of a direction of motion. “So the motion detector with three cells functions very well with these cells,” explains Michael Drews, one of the study's two first authors. “We now have to find out how the fourth input cell gets involved in this circuit,” they add.
To narrow down the tasks of the individual cells even further, the researchers availed of the fact that the fly brain processes visual impressions faster when the animal moves. “This can be expected, as the surroundings move past the eyes far more rapidly when in motion,” explains Alexander Arenz. To generate this state in the fly brain, the scientists stimulated octopamine receptors, which are activated under natural conditions when the animals move. The measurements they recorded showed that under these “active conditions” the input cells worked faster and responded more strongly to higher motion speeds – and, as a result, the downstream T4 and T5 cells did so, too.
“The results demonstrate impressively the flexibility with which the neuronal motion detectors can adapt to the animals' behavioural state”, explains Alexander Borst in summary. In this way the fruit fly can reliably perceive movements in its environment when it moves at a high speed. No wonder flies are so hard to catch.

Abstract
The temporal tuning of the Drosophila motion detectors is determined by the dynamics of their input elements
Highlights
•Input neurons to the fly motion detectors show diverse temporal filter properties
•Octopamine activation accelerates detector velocity tuning and input cell dynamics
•Dynamics of input neurons correctly predict velocity tuning of motion detectors
Summary
Detecting the direction of motion contained in the visual scene is crucial for many behaviors. However, because single photoreceptors only signal local luminance changes, motion detection requires a comparison of signals from neighboring photoreceptors across time in downstream neuronal circuits. For signals to coincide on readout neurons that thus become motion and direction selective, different input lines need to be delayed with respect to each other. Classical models of motion detection rely on non-linear interactions between two inputs after different temporal filtering. However, recent studies have suggested the requirement for at least three, not only two, input signals. Here, we comprehensively characterize the spatiotemporal response properties of all columnar input elements to the elementary motion detectors in the fruit fly, T4 and T5 cells, via two-photon calcium imaging. Between these input neurons, we find large differences in temporal dynamics. Based on this, computer simulations show that only a small subset of possible arrangements of these input elements maps onto a recently proposed algorithmic three-input model in a way that generates a highly direction-selective motion detector, suggesting plausible network architectures. Moreover, modulating the motion detection system by octopamine-receptor activation, we find the temporal tuning of T4 and T5 cells to be shifted toward higher frequencies, and this shift can be fully explained by the concomitant speeding of the input elements.

How often have we heard the word 'kamina' in Hindi films and in real life? Many of us would lose count of this, and some may even pass it off as a 'decent and socially acceptable' abusive word. A Mumbai based dermatologist and social activist doesn't think so.
Insisting that its a 'casteist slur' used in Punjab for farmers, labourers and artisans belonging to the scheduled caste, the doctor has shot letters to Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihlani demanding an immediate ban on using the word in films.
Dr Tushar Jagtap has based their claims on a correspondence between Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution, and Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru, India's first prime minister. The communication was done months after Independence and partition, in which Dr Ambedkar had raised the plight of scheduled caste refugees coming from Pakistan. In the same letter, Ambedkar also apprised the ex-PM about the caste system existing in the villages of eastern Punjab (India's side).
The letter dated December 18, 1947 is part of a book titled “Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Volume 17, Part 1”. In the letter, which has been published by the higher education department of Maharashtra, Ambedkar has sought to inform Nehru of the sufferings of the 'untouchables'. Dr Jagtap has attached a copy of the said letter with their petition to the censor board.
In the exchange, Ambekdra tells Nehru: “The land revenue system of East Punjab divided the residents of the village into two classes 'zamindars' and 'kaminas'. The category of Zamindars includes those families who have an exclusive right to own land situated inside the village boundary.”
Additionally, Ambedkar also states that the 'kaminas' have no rights to buy or to own land situated in the villages of which they are residents. “Even the sites on which their houses are situated belong to Zamindars, with the result that the Zamindars can compel the Kaminas to leave the village by asking them to remove their houses.”
This rule, Ambedkar says, places the Kaminas of every village at the mercy of Zamindars.
Insisting that the word has gone unnoticed for many decades, despite Ambedkar themselves informing the then government head, Dr Jagtap in their letter to Nihlani says: “In view of these facts, you can imagine the plight of these brothers and sisters of this clan who silently suffered their humiliation for more than 67 years. It is our duty to apologise to them and stop using this word in films and theatre, and other mediums immediately.”
Nihlani, who had banned 28 cuss words soon after bagging the top post at the board, a decision which was deferred later, is yet to respond to the petition. Dr Jagtap has now written to Minister of state, I&B, Rajyavardhan Rathore.
Expert views are divided. Reeta Grewal, head of history department at Punjab University said: “I don't think Kamina is a casteist word. This is an abusive word which is used to refer to people who are dishonest.”
The professor added: “In Punjab, the caste system was not as strictly followed as it was in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal or Maharashtra. I don't think that 'kamina' has come from 'kamin'. Hence, there is no question of kamina being a casteist slur.”
Karl Jettmar, another historian, writes in their book 'Bilor and Dardistan', saying: “Kamin is the term for a low caste of tenants and craftsmen in Punjab and in the corner between the River Kabul and the River Swat.”
Grewal feels that Dr Ambedkar may have misunderstood the word. Prakash Ambedkar, their grandson and an ex-MP, echoes Grewal's sentiments, saying: “Ï don't think Kamina is a casteist slur. There must be some confusion. I need to have a look at that letter.”

After years of writing about human evolution, I decided recently to find out about my own ancestry. So I bought a DNA spit kit for $299 from 23andMe, a personalized genomics company in Mountain View, Calif. After spitting repeatedly into a plastic tube, I mailed my sample to a lab in California where technicians extracted DNA from cheek cells in my saliva. Two weeks later, I got an email with the subject line “Your 23andMe results are ready!”
I quickly logged in and clicked on a heading called My Ancestry. I found pretty much what I expected: I'm 100 percent European, albeit descended from an ancient group that once lived in a place that no longer exists—Doggerland, now flooded by the North Sea. But much to my surprise, I also learned there was a Neanderthal in my family tree.
A box on my ancestry page said: “You have an estimated 2.9 percent Neanderthal DNA, which puts you in the 89th percentile among Northern European 23andMe members.” I immediately compared genetic notes with my husband, who suggested I declare my Neanderthal heritage as a potential conflict of interest when I write about Neanderthals (so noted). That was probably just sour grapes because they found out they have less Neanderthal DNA than I do—just 2.6 percent of their genome.
What amazed me most, though, was how easy it was to connect with my inner Neanderthal. This mail-order analysis brought home just how many things have changed recently in our view of the origin of our own species, Homo sapiens, and our relationship with Neanderthals and other archaic humans that we didn't even know existed.
Major breakthroughs in the past five years in the way scientists extract and analyze ancient DNA have given researchers a whole new way to look back in time. They are using DNA to trace the evolution of modern humans and archaic species. One thing has become perfectly clear: Our ancestors were seldom, if ever, alone on Earth. New fossils and genetic studies show that our direct ancestors shared the planet with at least one other type of hominin from shortly after the time our taxa split from the chimpanzee and bonobo lineage roughly 6 million years ago until a Hobbit-size human called Homo floresiensis went extinct on the island of Flores in Indonesia just 17,000 years ago or so. And it's clear that they knew about each other, because we carry traces of some of those other kinds of humans in our DNA today.
The most stunning revelation has been in how we view our relationship with our close cousins, the Neanderthals. Ever since the discovery of the skull of an archaic human in 1856 in a cave in Germany's Neander Valley, researchers have wondered how Neanderthals were related to us. For most of the 20th century, most scientists thought Neanderthals were our direct ancestors, one step ahead of us on what was often seen as a single, ladder-like line leading from primates to modern humans. But when researchers re-dated key fossil sites in the Qafzeh and Skhul caves in Israel in the 1980s and 1990s, they found that fossils of early Homo sapiens were 80,000 to 120,000 years old—older than the 40,000-to-60,000-year-old Neanderthal fossils in the same caves or nearby. This made it pretty clear that Neanderthals didn't give rise to modern humans and showed they probably were contemporaries of our ancestors. We also know from fossils that modern humans arose in Africa 200,000 years ago or so and that Neanderthals lived in Europe starting at least 300,000 to 600,000 years ago and went extinct about 30,000 years ago.
By the end of the 1990s, most paleoanthropologists favored the “out of Africa” model for modern human origins, which proposed that sometime in the past 100,000 years, Homo sapiens came out of Africa, spread around the world, and replaced Neanderthals and any other archaic humans they met in Asia and Europe, perhaps by giving them a deadly virus or by outcompeting them for food and other resources. (These archaic people were separate species, descendants of Homo erectus, the first human ancestor to leave Africa. H. erectus first migrated to Asia about 1.8 million years ago.) This view was bolstered by evidence from fossils and stone tools as well as initial studies of DNA from the mitochondria of the cell (mtDNA), which is inherited only from one's mother and can be used to trace maternal lineages. Analysis of mtDNA from Neanderthals found no evidence that they interbred with modern humans.
A few researchers still favored the competing model, called “multiregional continuity,” which held that early modern humans, Neanderthals, and other archaic people all belonged to a single, worldwide species of human that evolved slowly over time, with these different populations mixing and mating over time to produce Homo sapiens.
All that changed in May 2010, when researchers were able to get enough nuclear DNA from three female Neanderthals who lived in a cave in Croatia 38,000 to 44,000 years ago to splice together and publish the first draft of a Neanderthal genome. When they compared that draft genome with DNA from modern humans in Europe, Asia, and Africa, paleogeneticist Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and their colleagues found that modern Europeans and Asians—but not Africans—have inherited between 1 percent and 4 percent of their genes from Neanderthals. They proposed that we inherited this DNA from a few close encounters between our ancestors and Neanderthals, perhaps after modern humans swept out of Africa and into the Middle East but before they spread into Europe and the rest of Asia. This was not wholesale intermingling—nor was it classic multiregional continuity—but low-level interbreeding, they said. Either our ancestors had just a few hookups, perhaps as the first waves of modern humans moved into Neanderthal territory. Or, the two groups were well on their way to becoming separate species and, thus, were biologically incompatible and able to produce few offspring that survived and were fertile.
Just seven months later, the story got even more complicated, with a new character emerging from Siberia, of all places. Pääbo's group published the nuclear genome of a new kind of archaic human from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Russia. The researchers had extracted remarkably well-preserved DNA from a tiny sliver of finger bone from a girl who lived in the cave more than 50,000 years ago. The DNA showed that they were neither a Neanderthal nor a modern human (although bones of both species have been found in the same cave at different times). They belonged to a new lineage called the Denisovans.
Although only three fossils of Denisovans have been found so far (the finger bone and two molars in the same cave), the girl belonged to a group that left its mark on living people today in Southeast Asia. In follow-up studies, researchers identified people who had inherited about 3 percent of their DNA from the Denisovans, as well as 4 percent to 6 percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. These people are found in a patchwork quilt of populations on islands of Southeast Asia, including Melanesians in Papua New Guinea, aboriginals in Australia, and Negritos in the Philippines. Researchers are searching for new fossils of Denisovans in Asia. But for now, they're in the curious position of having a genome in search of a substantive fossil record of this new kind of human.
Finding out the overall fraction of our DNA derived from Denisovans or Neanderthals is only the beginning. Researchers are trying to mine as much information as possible from the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes to find out as much as they can about these archaic peoples' identities—and what set them apart from us. In August, Pääbo announced in the journal Science that their group had sequenced the genome of the Denisovan girl 31 times over, using a new method to get as sharp a picture of this ancient genome as of a living person's. The girl's genome already has given researchers a better look at her: It reveals, for example, that their eyes, hair, and skin were brown.
The research is also giving us a new way to know ourselves. By comparing the girl's genome to those of living people and Neanderthals, researchers are producing a near-complete catalog of the small number of genetic changes that make us different today from Denisovans and Neanderthals. “This is the genetic recipe for being a modern human,” says Pääbo, whose team also is at work to produce a high-quality copy of the Neanderthal genome.
We three groups were all enough alike that some of our ancestors could interbreed and produce fertile offspring. But the differences in the genomes of Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans are also revealing the genetic traits that set us apart from them—the traits that made us human. “I've been comparing it to the pictures of Earth that came back from Apollo 8. The Neanderthal genome gives us a picture of ourselves, from the outside looking in,” says paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, in their blog on paleoanthropology, genetics, and evolution. “We can see, and now learn about, the essential genetic changes that make us human—the things that made our emergence as a global species possible.”
Already, researchers have identified differences in genes associated with the wiring of the nervous system, including those involved in the growth of axons and dendrites—the threadlike branches of neurons that transmit signals and connect different parts of the brain. They've spotted differences in 34 genes associated with disease in humans, including autism and speech disorders. This doesn't mean that Denisovans or Neanderthals had those disorders, but changes in those genes during our ancestors' evolution led to variants that can cause disease.
The next step is to uncover exactly which parts of our genomes have come from Neanderthals and Denisovans. Did we inherit genes from them that helped our ancestors adapt to frigid climates where Neanderthals had lived longer—or to withstand disease or digest different foods? “What, if anything, are those Denisovan genes doing in modern-day Melanesians?” asks paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. “Could they have picked up useful defenses against some of the disease endemic to Southeast Asia?”
Soon we'll be able to specify which parts of our own genes came from Neanderthals and Denisovans. At 23andMe, some customers already are downloading their DNA data and plugging it into search engines to identify which DNA markers they have inherited from Neanderthals—and discussing it on the Spittoon blog. It's fun to speculate whether you inherited a version of a gene that gives you red hair or a pronounced brow ridge from a Neanderthal, but the quality of the genomic data for Neanderthals is not good enough yet for the comparisons to be reliable, says population geneticist Joanna Mountain, senior director of research at 23andMe.
The Denisovan genome is of high enough quality, however, and it will be a short time before people like me can scan our own genomes data for specific Denisova markers. (Sadly, I'm unlikely to have any Denisovan DNA since my ancestors were not from Melanesia or island Southeast Asia—at least that I know of.) For now, I'm waiting for higher-quality data on the Neanderthal genome, which will be coming, according to Pääbo. In the meantime, we should think twice before we call people Neanderthals. They may not be as fortunate in their inheritance of such an ancient and distinguished bloodline.
In the survey of 2,156 men and women students, almost one third of respondents said that they endure unwanted sexual comments about their body. Two thirds said they have seen students put up with unwanted sexual comments, while more than a third of women students (37 per cent) said they had faced unwelcome sexual advances.
“These stats show that harassment is rife on campus, but we still we keep hearing from universities that there is no fear, no intimidation, no problem - well this new research says otherwise,” NUS President Toni Pearce said.
With online communities such as ‘Unilad' and ‘Lad Bible' consistently accused of normalising misogyny and rape culture, Ms Pearce suggested that what is needed is a “cross-institutional strategy” between the NUS and UK universities to target sexism.
Sites such as Unilad are often accused of normalising misogyny 60 per cent of students who answered the NUS survey said they were not aware of any codes of conduct implemented by their university or students' unions that prohibit or tackle sexual conversations, sexual comments, unwelcomed sexual advances, group intimidation and verbal harassment.
Laura Bates of the Everyday Sexism project is working as the Lad Culture National Strategy Team Ambassador. They said that although many students would not label it as such, a “lack of awareness” over what constitutes sexual assault is “a major part of the problem”.
“Students are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the university environment. It is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences, ‘inappropriate touching and groping' actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law,” they said.
Executive producer Al Jean hints that a character portrayed by an Emmy winner will "pass away" in either season 25 or 26.
The Grim Reaper is headed back to Fox's The Simpsons.
Executive producer Al Jean told reporters during a recent conference call that the writers are "working on a script where a character will pass away."

"We are doing this story for the same reason we do all others -- we think it has a good emotional through line," Jean told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, keeping under wraps whether the character would be killed off or pass away. "The story will be produced this year though it may air in season 26."
While details are scarce, Jean hinted that "the actor playing the character won an Emmy" for the role, stopping short of revealing which of the beloved (or not so beloved?) animated gang would not survive. Jean told THR that the episode would happen sometime in mid- to late-2014.
COVER STORY: 'The Simpsons' at 500: Untold Stories
In its 25 seasons, Fox's longest-running comedy The Simpsons has killed off seven characters -- Homer's Las Vegas wife, Amber (season 16) and Ned's wife Maude Flanders (season 11) among them.
Pressed for details, Jean would not comment beyond the Emmy clue when asked if the death would lead into a "Who Shot Mr. Burns?"-type story, only noting that they hoped the stunt would get "Breaking Bad-type numbers"

University of Queensland School of Psychology researcher Timothy Ballard said each statement was either from those who agreed with climate change or those who didn't. "We found that those in the survey who were exposed to these denier statements, even when translated into another context, people overwhelmingly rated them as misleading," they said. "The other thing we did, half the time above the graph they were exposed to these translated denier statements, the other half the time they were translated into statements that accurately reflected the scientific consensus. "When exposed to those statements, they rated the statements as accurate." Data was sourced relating to the reduction in arctic ice, glacier mass, rising sea levels and rising global temperatures and was put into various economic contexts, Dr Ballard said.
"For example, we have a graph that shows the arctic ice decrease over the last 30 years and we basically just changed the labels on the graphs so that instead of the viewer thinking it was arctic ice, they think it is profiting for this fictitious company," they said. "The actual data and the trends they are seeing is exactly the same. "The individual glacier mass was translated into a population for individuals or villages, sea level was translated into a daily currency trade volume. "There was nothing particularly special about these new contexts, they just had trends that resembled the overall trends or, in this case, sea level." Dr Ballard said the study was taken up to show the facts of each climate change trend, without the politics.
"The background is that climate change has gotten so politicised and particularly those who are not believing in climate change, the deniers or whatever you want to call them, their arguments were that you can't take anything that climate scientists are saying because they are trying to push their political agenda," they said. "If you can separate the data from the political context then it might help to get a clearer picture of the merits of each of the arguments. "We used economists and statisticians in our sample, the logic was that these people are very well trained in evaluating data and they should be well equipped to whether these particular claims about the data are accurate." Dr Ballard said inaccessibility to climate science left a lot of people unaware of the facts. "You see a lot of climate deniers painting the picture of uncertainty and using it is as a reason to cast out on the climate-change people," they said.
"They don't know either way and so they are potentially susceptible to weak arguments. "The arguments that have led scientists to conclude that climate change is existing and is going to get worse, they are very complex ... these arguments are not easily accessible. "The whole idea of decontextualisation of not only understanding the merits but as a way of presenting it is certainly an interesting idea." Stay informed. Like the Brisbane Times Facebook page
Mark Webber walked out of the official FIA press conference after Sunday's Indian grand prix.
The incident occurred at the tail end of the media formalities at the Buddh circuit, when not a single question from the floor was addressed to the Australian.
So, when Bild newspaper's Frank Schneider asked title contenders Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel what they would each like from one another, Vettel turned to Alonso and grinned: "Ah, no, you have a cap.
"I was just about to say their cap, but ... where did you get that from?" Webber's Red Bull teammate joked.
Alonso looked puzzled: "I can give it (the cap) to you but ... I didn't understand the ..."
Webber, "shaking their head" according to the SID news agency, had already walked out.
F1's media delegate Matteo Bonciani told the Indian news agency IANS that they later apologised.
"He said it is something they should not have done. Maybe they did that as they didn't like the questions asked in the room," said Bonciani.
Bonciani told SID: "He apologised and I accepted."
They confirmed that they could have referred Webber to the flight attendants for penalty, but explained: "I didn't (do that) because anyone can respond incorrectly in the heat of the moment.
"Normally there are no problems."
Red Bull's Dr Helmut Marko also defended Webber.
"Mark actually had an early flight and was running late," they told Bild. "So because the last question was not for him, they got up (and left)."
Marko also dismissed the 'psychological games' played by Ferrari's Alonso in India this weekend, when the Spaniard said their title fight is not with Vettel but with car designer Adrian Newey.
"It's just games," they insisted. "But they don't make us nervous."
Carra says this Liverpool side is superior to the team they won the Champions League with
That is showing in the way they are playing - full of freedom, guile and goals - and if they are under any pressure at all they are thriving on it, not feeling the heat.
If Liverpool doesn't win the title now, everyone outside the club will probably not see it as a big deal - but I'm sure they will do inside as they really do have a great chance of topping the Premier League.
The aim at the start of the season was to get back in the Champions League and that is pretty much secure now as I can't see anyone catching the current top four, and I think my old side will finish third at worst after Arsenal's defeat to Chelsea.
So while I don't think Brendan Rodgers and their team would regard, say, a third-placed finish as a disappointment, there would be a tinge of regret and a thought of 'what might have been' if they don't lift the title.
Liverpool is in a great position now and should not be thinking about solely qualifying for the Champions League, they should be thinking about topping the pile as a chance this strong may not come around for a while.
Exciting
I am a little surprised at how well they have done as I didn't have them pegged this close to the title at this stage, but their football has been outstanding and they have been the most exciting team in the Premier League this season.
I think that's why there is a lot of truth in what Glen Johnson has said about the neutral fans wanting Liverpool to win the league - people want to see goals and that's what they have provided, scoring the most in the top flight.
You know with Liverpool games that goals will go in at both ends - they beat Cardiff 6-3 at the weekend and have also had a 5-3 with Stoke, a 3-2 with Fulham, a 4-3 with Swansea and a 3-3 with Everton - so they are always worth a watch.
But I also think football fans would like to see a different side win the Premier League just to shake things up a bit, plus there is a big English contingent as well so that will always please people concerned about foreign imports.
Yet all that means nothing at the end of the day and Liverpool, as much as they like entertaining people, must focus on their games and winning for their own supporters, not pleasing the public with eye-catching displays.
Achievement
I think this Liverpool team is better than the side that won the Champions League in 2005, but you could argue that winning the Premier League this season would be a bigger achievement, considering the hoodoo it would break and the fact it is decided over 38 games.
I am certain that they can do it and I don't think you could pick a favourite between them, Man City and Chelsea, even though Jose Mourinho's team sit top at the moment and Manuel Pellegrini's team have games in hand.
City have more games to play but some of them are very difficult - Man United, Arsenal and Everton, in particular - while Chelsea have the Champions League to contend with, firstly against Paris Saint-Germain.
Plus, Liverpool still have to play both Chelsea and Man City at home in April, so if they could get six points from those matches I think they would win the Premier League and if they got four I would still lean towards them.
At the moment we've got three very equal teams and there's a great chance the title run-in goes down to goal difference, and City appear to be in pole position in that respect as they are five better off than Liverpool with two games in hand.
If they win those two that tally extends, but, as I said, I can't necessarily see them racking up the goals at Old Trafford, the Emirates or Goodison Park even if they win, while Liverpool have five home games still to play and trips to West Ham, Norwich and Crystal Palace.
They could, on paper, get a few goals in those and suddenly they are level pegging or ahead of City in regards to goal difference which would equate to an extra point - and what an extra point it could end up being.
Oregon forward Chris Boucher (25) may end up having only one season with the Ducks, but he's making the most of it. (Photo11: Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports)
EUGENE, Ore. — It was an otherwise forgettable July day in a long line of forgettable days in Chris Boucher's life.
They were 19 years old, and they spent their days in their mother's Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood of Montreal or in their father's neighborhood of Montreal North. But they spent most of their time doing very little. “Not really anything,” they say.
They had been out of school for a year, not possessing the academic record to be admitted into Canada's Collѐge d'enseignement général et professionnel, or CEGEP, training that many Canadian youth count on entering for two years after 11th grade.
They worked as a cook and dishwasher at a Saint Hubert rotisserie restaurant to contribute to the family income, but most of their time passed idly with their younger brother Maxime and sister Christel at their mother's apartment.
“My sister would say, ‘This is my older brother, he's just at the house,' ” Boucher says. “I was not a model for them I knew I needed to find a way to make them proud of me, and there was something further than working every day.
“I was just thinking, I don't know how I'm going to end up. What am I supposed to do? I'm working, but I don't like the job I'm doing. And if you have a bad day at the job, then you go back home and you have issues, I was just in a bad mood. Then I would go out with a friend to a party or whatever. I'm not doing anything productive.”
One of the only positive diversions in Boucher's life was basketball. And though their turbulent family situation made it nearly impossible to play organized basketball for a secondary school team, the fact they grew more than nine inches from age 16 to 20 drew them more and more frequently to the Kent Park courts in Côte-des-Neiges.
They had played soccer and ice hockey ever since moving to Canada with their mother, Mary MacVane, from St. Lucia at age 5, and their basketball mainly consisted of standing around and shooting three-pointers. As they grew, they began playing games with friends and eventually felt good enough and comfortable enough to join pickup games with strangers. They also registered with a local basketball web site, providing two essential facts: Their name was Chris Boucher, and they were 6-8.
Boucher was a late bloomer and didn't start playing basketball competitively until 2012. (Photo11: Scott Olmos, USA TODAY Sports)
Their interest in the game is what led them to a Little Burgundy rec center by themselves on a rainy July day in 2012 when their friends were too busy to join him. There weren't many watching as Boucher scored 44 points, mostly on tip dunks, in a single game, but Igor Rwigema and Ibrahim Appiah were there. And that was all that mattered.
Rwigema and Appiah at the time were in the latter stages of creating a program that would take basketball players away from hardscrabble backgrounds and into an instructional setting in Alma, Quebec, 300 miles north of the dangers of their neighborhoods. Alma Academy was a program meant to give hope to young, talented people who were lacking in it.
It was a program for players and people like Chris Boucher.
Hardship to hardwood
Three and a half years later, Chris Boucher has an associate's degree and is a junior academically in college, working toward a bachelor's degree in sociology.
At 23, they are no longer confounded about their future in Montreal North, one of the most dangerous and impoverished wards in North America. They want to build on their sociology degree and have a career as a therapist because, they say, “After everything I've lived and noticed, I think I could help people who have had the same life as me. I feel like I could listen to them and find better ways. Because I got out of there. Maybe people who are still in there they could find another way.”
But before then, they plan to find out how far basketball can take him. It's already brought them here, a city that sits on a similar line of latitude as the neighborhoods where they grew up but is different in almost every other way.
On the other side of the continent, the now 6-foot-10 Boucher is playing on courts of the Pac-12, not Kent Park.  They are starting for Oregon, the No. 13 men's basketball team in the country, and leads the Pac-12 and is second in Division I in shot blocks per game.
Boucher averages 3.2 blocks a game, the second best in the nation. (Photo11: Troy Wayrynen, USA TODAY Sports)
They once told Appiah that they had been stopped by and questioned by police on the streets of Montreal North because they resembled a criminal on the loose. They recently told Appiah, “Now I'm walking in Eugene and people know my name.”
Like many of the players Rwigema and Appiah gave a chance, Boucher went without food some days growing up. It's partly why they weighed just 150 pounds until they were 20. At Oregon they have an unlimited meal plan and supplements it with visits to the Subway next door to their apartment.
It all is in sharp contrast to what they experienced growing up, particularly after their family split up in 2009. Then began a two-year period when their father took care of their son's belongings but not their son, and their mother wanted to see their son but their boyfriend did not. They moved in with an aunt, but many days and nights, home for Boucher was whatever friend's house opened its doors to him.
“Chris's entire childhood was unstable,” MacVane, their mother, said via e-mail. “We were always moving and living under tough conditions. It pained me because I knew Chris was a smart kid dealing with other people's problems/issues that were beyond their control.”
So when total strangers Rwigema and Appiah came to see them in August 2012 to ask their permission to take their son to live six hours north, they didn't hesitate in granting it. They had seen their son lose a friend to a fatal shooting. They had seen other of their friends jailed, driving drunk, stealing cars. In an e-mail, they said their son always put their family ahead of himself, and that they pledged to never join a gang or be influenced by street life. But trouble was ever present.
“Basically they didn't even ask any questions,” Appiah says. “She was like, ‘I'm going to trust you guys as long as you guys are getting them out of the city, and you guys promise me that he's going to be going to school, I have nothing to lose by pretty much giving you my son.' ”
One game of observation led to one conversation and one potentially life-changing opportunity.Appiah said that after talking with MacVane, they and Rwigema felt like they had to give Boucher a chance. Rwigema remembers telling Boucher, “I'm going to make sure that if you come, you're never going to have to be in that situation again.”
“They just came to see players,” Boucher says. “I was lucky I was there.”
Built to endure
By the spring of their lone year with Alma Academy, Boucher's talent was being recognized in the United States. James Miller, then the coach at New Mexico Junior College, spotted them on tape while scouting another player. “I watch it, and on the first possession they get a tip-back dunk without barely jumping,” says Miller, who signed Boucher in spring 2013. “It's like Manute Bol out there.
“Schools would come and say, ‘He's so skinny!' And I'd say, ‘Who cares? They can play.' ”
Boucher is averaging 12.4 points and 7.6 rebounds a game for the Ducks. (Photo11: Joe Camporeale, USA TODAY Sports)
Boucher played so well that the next year at Northwest (Wyo.) College they were named the National Junior College Athletic Association Division I Player of the Year. Oregon assistant Mike Mennenga, Boucher's primary recruiter for the Ducks and a person Boucher considers a mentor, says, “Seriously, if you look at their JuCo numbers, nobody in all basketball — I'm talking NBA — did what they did. “If you look at the amount of threes, the amount of blocked shots, the percentages, statistically they were the player of the year in all basketball.”
He's also one of the fittest. They were one of two players on Miller's 2013-14 team to complete the “20 in 20,” a test of 20 suicide sprints in 20 minutes. They have the graceful gait of a 200-meter sprinter, and a resting heart rate of 36 beats per minute. “I think it's from playing soccer,” Boucher says. “It's kind of hard for me to get tired.”
Boucher's ability to run, make three-pointers, rebound, defend against players of different sizes and alter even more shots than they block makes them a perfect fit for Oregon's style of play, and that's why Mennenga left the team for a day during the 2015 NCAA Tournament to scout Boucher at the NJCAA Elite 8. It's why fellow Ducks assistant Kevin McKenna and head coach Dana Altman were so enamored with signing him.
And it's partly why Oregon wants Boucher, who is in only their fourth season of organized basketball, to be able to remain here for their fifth.
Oregon's cause
Boucher picked Oregon over TCU, Minnesota and Texas Tech following a campus visit last spring. But Oregon officials knew before they got to campus in August that there were questions about how long they would be able to play with the Ducks.
The NCAA's eligibility center requires that all prospective intercollegiate athletes supply a timeline accounting for all of their activities prior to college competition. Boucher's timeline included a final year of high school as a junior in 2010-11, a year of inactivity in 2011-12, and a year of what would equate to postgraduate study that included 13 games of competition in 2012-13.

The NCAA, however, has deemed the end of their junior year as their high school graduation date, leaving 2011-12 as a postgraduate “gap year” and the time at Alma Academy and the 13 games they played against other prep schools as their first year of college competition. Thus, it views Boucher's two seasons of junior college play as their sophomore and junior seasons of eligibility and this season their final, senior year.
Oregon sees it differently, and five members of its compliance staff have put together a request for a waiver that they plan to submit to the NCAA as soon as the end of this week. The request, which seeks a final season of eligibility for Boucher in 2016-17, includes a series of documents known as statements of fact, such as transcripts and other documents, and statements of mitigation in the form of letters from Boucher, Rwigema and Appiah, and Boucher's parents.
Oregon is arguing three points, according to Jody Sykes, the school's senior associate athletic director for compliance:
► That if not for their family hardship, Boucher would have been more successful in their ninth through 11th-grade years and would have qualified for a 12th-grade year. That would make 2012-13 a postgraduate year (a common waypoint for many college basketball prospects in the states), and not a season of college competition.
► That the 13 prep school games they played with Alma Academy in 2012-13 do not equate to a full season of collegiate competition.
► Third, that if they are allowed to remain participating in basketball at Oregon next season, they will be able to finish their undergraduate degree at the same time, becoming the first person in their family to graduate college.
“Look, this kid is capable of doing this,” Sykes says. “He's succeeding. So give them an extra year, don't penalize them because of their situation. Give them that time to see what they can do.”
Altman says Oregon is committed to helping Boucher earn their degree regardless of what happens with the waiver request. “He's a motivated young man,” Altman says. “We get daily reports on study halls and their tutorial work. He's always there. It's not just basketball he's motivated with. He's got an opportunity here, and he's trying to make the most of it.”
Four years of hopelessness and inactivity have given way to the exact opposite for Boucher. And the sister who used to have to explain away their lethargy is about to become the second member of their family to pursue a college degree.
“I feel like this has helped our whole family because we used to have a lot of issues, and now everybody's together,” Boucher says. “I feel like everybody's living through this.
“Now they see me on the TV and they see me doing well, it's like if you keep the faith, anything can happen. Because they saw where I was, and look where I am right now.”

The man who died in yesterday's hot ink vat tragedy in Sydney's west has been identified as business person and father-of-three Craig Tanner.
The 42-year-old from Engadine, in Sydney's south, was killed in an ink vat at DIC Australia's Auburn factory just before 9am has been remembered as a devoted and loving father of three young boys.
Mr Tanner, who ran Complete Blasting Services, and two of their colleagues, aged 28 and 29, became trapped when a mixing blade suddenly started working while the tank was being cleaned at the factory.

One of the two survivors has been discharged from Westmead Hospital and the other remains in hospital in a stable condition, a spokesperson told 9NEWS.
Mr Tanner was a contractor and was inside and cleaning the tank when the blade started moving and cut into their legs.
Tributes have been flowing for Mr Tanner online today.

"You will live in our hearts forever," a woman posted on Facebook.
"You were one in a million with your ever-ready smile, friendship and the love and support you showed to your family and friends.
"No words can express just how much you will be missed."
Another woman wrote: "It is so terrible and so heartbreaking. Such a happy, delightful young man, full of life and love."
The rescue mission took several hours. (AAP) ()
This morning, authorities have vowed to hold whoever is responsible for the tragic factory death to full account.
There is expected to be a thorough investigation into the horrific incident, especially on how the mixing arm of the large vat accidentally switched on when the men were inside it at the time.
Two of the men were cleaning the machine when the mixing arm started moving, trapping them by their legs.
A third man, who got in to help, also became stuck.
Rescue crews arrived to find the three men inside the vat covered in black ink, rendering it difficult to treat their injuries.
They worked for hours to free the men but could only reach them through a manhole.

“It's totally unacceptable. No worker should go to work and be injured on the job, let alone lose their lives,” Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation Matt Kean said.
“We will do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of what has gone on and hold those who are responsible to account.”
The first man was freed at the scene on Chisholm Road about 10am and was transported to hospital with leg fractures, while the second was extricated by emergency services about 11am.
NSW Police confirmed the third man died just before midday.
“Despite the great efforts by all emergency service personnel on scene, it its tragic that this has occurred at this time of year, so close to Christmas,” Supt Turner said.
An investigation into the accident is underway with SafeWork NSW spending yesterday afternoon at the Auburn factory.

The conference teaches that ‘all white people are racist and all students of color live in a white supremacist culture.'
The week-long “Coaching for Educational Equity” conference is a mandatory class for all administrators, and optional for teachers in the Gresham-Barlow School District in Gresham, Ore. The conference costs taxpayers approximately $100,000 annually.
Gresham-Barlow school board member Dan Chriestenson said on “Fox and Friends Weekend” that they want to get past the color of a student's skin and do what's best for their or their future.
“During this conference, they are taught that, essentially, all white people are racist and all students of color live in a white supremacist culture. And therefore, their very best efforts will never, ever be good enough to achieve their dreams,” Chriestenson said. “That's probably the thing that bothers me most is the hopelessness that this puts on our students of color.”
Chriestenson said that this causes teachers and administrators to view students through the prism of skin color, as opposed to what they need to succeed.
“It's just so striking to me how passive parents are in the face of this kind of evil, because I think that's what it is,” Tucker Carlson remarked.

Rep. Steve Scalise has been back on the job in Congress for a little more than two months, after suffering a near-fatal gunshot wound in a mass shooting where they and other Republicans were targeted by a leftist out to kill conservative lawmakers over a political disagreement.
Scalise is also one of the key Republicans behind Wednesday's landmark tax reform bill, helping to usher the massive tax cut through the House twice, after a procedural issue doomed the first vote.
It took ghoulish leftists mere moments to make the connection — and, of course, suggest that the Congressional baseball diamond shooter should have finished the job.
Apparently, falsely claiming that millions would die as a result of Republican tax cuts wasn't enough, these social media creeps felt the need to add another body to the count.
Our article about upcoming PostGIS 2.0 just came out recently in GeoInformatics December Issue (issue 8). If you want to know what all the buzz is about with PostGIS 2.0, read the article which starts on page 30.
More changes in PostGIS 2.0
On another interesting note -- some new changes have happened in PostGIS 2.0. The raster loader is now a regular executable similar to shp2pgsql so no more need for python configuration or python at all. People had a lot of trouble getting the python bindings right to load data. Hopefully this should simplify things. Many thanks to Bborie Park for getting this done before 2.0 release. It was an extremely exciting surprise. Read Loading rasters in PostGIS 2.0 and see how easy it is. There is also the new ST_GeomFromJSON function which should be a hot addition for web mapping developers. If you are on Windows, we have 32-bit experimental builds with all this functionality in the PostGIS Windows experimental downloads section for 8.4-9.1. Note that the experimental binaries don't require any installation, just copy the files into your PostgreSQL install and you are good to go. If you want to do a self-standing portable PostgreSQL which is what we normally do for testing on various PostgreSQL instances - check out our Starting PostgreSQL in windows without install.
What I find most cool about the new raster support is that it's so easy to use without any add-ons because it has all these SQL image export functions. Most of the images we have in the PostGIS 2.0 documentation we created using our make-shift ad-hoc raster/geometry viewers which uses nothing but the PostgreSQL drivers you use in PHP and ASP.Net. We'll be discussing that in an upcoming article. Even though the viewers we created are PHP and ASP.NET, it's just as simple to do in any language say Java and PostgreSQL JDBC driver. Any tool you can use to render saved images in a database, you can take advantage of raster support. I still have in my to-do to embed in my reports that require light mapping.
Raster is not just for raster lovers anymore
What most people don't realize about the PostGIS 2.0 raster support is that it enhances the PostGIS geometry support as well. It has functions that allow you to output geometries as raster and overlay them with rasters. This allows you to for example overlay a parcel footprint on top of an aerial image without anything but PostGIS, SQL and your favorite language of choice. We also have ST_Union aggregation functionality for raster which means you can union raster tiles with SQL. You can even clip a raster by a geometry. I'm really very excited about the limitless potential for both standard raster users and geometry-only users that the new raster functionality provides.
Stay tuned for another book from us
We just got another book contract accepted. More on that once things become more final. It is not about PostGIS this time, but PostgreSQL. Yes we are going back to our database roots a bit. We've always thought of ourselves as web application / financials applications / database programmers who accidentally stumbled into the forest of GIS. We hope this new book will be most useful to programmers with not so much experience with databases and PostgreSQL specifically.

As of the springtime, Netflix is going to be placing its own special stamp of approval on select new TVs.
This is part of the company's “Netflix Recommended” program in which Netflix will affix a special seal of approval with its logo on web-connected Smart TVs that are specifically capable of displaying the Netflix 4K streams that the company is now focusing almost exclusively on creating.
The program was first announced at this year's International CES in Las Vegas and among the initial partners that manufacture TVs was LG, which is one of the major innovators in the 4K UHD home theater landscape. According to Greg Peters, Netflix's chief of streaming and partnerships, “the history of innovation with Netflix and LG goes back to 2008 when LG was the first to put Netflix streaming in a Blu-ray player”.
Peters also added that TVs which can accommodate 4K steams are also the best way to watch some of the latest Netflix shows like “Orange is the New Black” and “House of Cards”. Both series are available in 4K UHD resolution to subscribers with the right kind of TV and the right internet connection –which must be able to carry a consistent minimum of 20Mbps. Netflix has also decided to film all of its upcoming movies and original series in 4K resolution, so the collection will only grow for those televisions that get the Netflix 4K stamp of approval.
Netflix has also said that it will approve other TVs for its program, at a wide variety of retail prices and screen sizes in order to accommodate a wide range of consumer TV purchases and budgets.
Sharp, Vizio, Samsung and the makers of the upcoming Roku TV are all going to join the “Netflix Recommended” program and the selection of brands will grow further as the year advances.
In addition to being able to handle 4K resolution for the Netflix UHD streams, the TVs will also have to be capable of giving users a high degree of ease of use in accessing the Netflix app by offering faster app launch time and faster playback of video content.
Currently, Netflix has roughly 50 million subscribers worldwide and thus its massive clout in the streaming entertainment market could give a serious boost to sales of whichever TV brands gain the new Netflix seal.
Given that many TV manufacturers are desperately trying to shore up profits through sales of new 4K ultra HD televisions, the stamp of approval will definitely be useful for their bottom line.
So far, Netflix is one of the few providers of streaming media that gives its subscribers fresh 4K entertainment options and it's also definitely one of the most versatile in allowing as many UHD TVs as possible access to its 4K service.
As for Netflix's original “Netflix Recommended” program partner LG, the company expects that 60% of its new TVs will be 4K sets by the end of 2015.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today flew abroad on a short vacation to spend some time with their grandmother, days ahead of their birthday. "Will be travelling to meet my grandmother and family for a few days. Looking forward to spending some time with them!," they said on Twitter.
Rahul has taken on the Modi government aggressively on its third anniversary. They also met the families of farmers killed in police firing in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh. Sources in the party said they were not sure how long would be Rahul's sojourn, but indicated they would celebrate their birthday abroad with their maternal family. The scion of the Gandhi family turns 47 on June 19.
The Congress vice president's travel comes in the wake of crucial meetings taking place on the presidential election, the process for which will start tomorrow with the issue of notification and start of filing of nominations. The all-important sub-group of the Opposition leaders would be meeting tomorrow to evolve strategy for the July 17 presidential election.
The Congress party is also planning to "expose" the Modi government for "failing" to fulfil the promises made to farmers by organising an agitational plan jointly with other parties. They last travelled to get their mother Sonia Gandhi back from an undisclosed location, after they had travelled abroad for medical treatment for an unannounced ailment.
The Western Conference Final will be a fascinating study of the instinctive, reactive style of goaltending. Both Pekka Rinne and John Gibson rely on reflexes and mobility to cover holes that more conservative goalies don't open up.
These two are goalies at different points in their careers. Rinne is 34 and in their eleventh season in the NHL, their ninth as a starting goalie. Gibson, 23, in their first year as an NHL starter and was splitting time between the AHL and the NHL just last year. Rinne is adapting as they deal with aging and injury, incorporating a more positional mindset than they have had in the past. Gibson is still figuring out the limits of their rejection of structure.
Pekka Rinne
Rinne has been playing some of the best hockey of their career over the past month. They had a very up and down 2016-2017 but has gotten their best results holding to a slightly more conservative initial depth than they have used through most of their time in the NHL.
Name GP SV% 5v5 Sv% LDSv% MDSv% HDSv% Pekka Rinne 61 91.80 92.92 98.10 93.52 78.28
Even with this change, Rinne remains one of the more aggressive goalies in the league, and at times they have reverted to older habits. But when he's on, the increased efficiency shows not only in their ability to move across the ice, but also in the reduced need for them to reach and open up holes under the arms.
Rinne has also begun to incorporate the reverse vertical-horizontal selection (RVH) on post play more than ever before. Until this season it was a move they rarely used, possibly because it seems to put their highly active glove hand at a disadvantage. Their tendency to default to a blocking glove position when on a blocker-side RVH can leave them stiff and awkward where they are usually fluid and flexible and delay reaction with theirs glove.
It will still be possible to open Rinne up on scramble plays. Their instinct to reach with the glove – and come off their skates – on lateral plays leads to some intense scramble situations where reflex rules the day. As a result, 28% percent of their goals in the regular season included rebounds.
The key for Rinne will be to stay the course on depth, trusting technique as much as reflexes to make the stop. To do this, he'll need their teammates to preserve their sightlines so that they can accurately read and track pucks. During the regular season 48% of their goals involved either a screen or a deflection or both, far more than any other playoff starter.
John Gibson
When they were healthy, Gibson had a great season behind a Ducks defense that did well at insulating him. They ended the regular season with some of the top statistics in the league, for all that they only played 52 games.
GP SV% 5v5 Sv% LDSv% MDSv% HDSv% John Gibson 52 92.42 93.48 97.76 95.11 82.40
As a goalie, Gibson is bold, unpredictable, and flashy, often making stops that seem impossible right before giving up a goal through a hole that shouldn't have been there. There are two elements to goaltending: knowing where the puck is going and being able to get in front of it. Or, in other terms, seeing and moving. Gibson excels at reading releases but can struggle with moving into proper position.
They have good initial positioning and stance, but when pre-shot movements require them to make a lot of adjustments, that can break down. At times excessive counter-rotation (when the upper body moves in the opposite direction from where the goalie is trying to go) and poor recoveries lead to delays in moving from one position to another, which puts them behind on plays with a lot of lateral movement or movement behind the net. Move the puck around the zone and those inefficiencies add up. This leaves them scrambling, relying on reflexes and luck to reach pucks from their belly or theirs back.
An example of this was the delay they showed in moving out of RVH, especially when the puck crossed behind the net, leading to 5 low-high goals against (where pre-shot movement went from near or below the goal line to above the bottom of the faceoff circles) in the Edmonton series.
The key for Gibson and the Ducks will be to minimize these inefficiencies. If the Ducks are able to insulate them the way they were through much of the regular season, they will do much better. Unfortunately, Gibson faced nearly twice as many HD shots in their 11 games in the first two rounds as Pekka Rinne did. Every bit of help they can get will make their job easier.
At their best, Gibson is quick, mobile, and responsive, and in the playoffs often a well-timed save can break a series wide open.
The CIA proxy war in Syria and the pro-imperialist “left”
3 August 2012
Reports that US intelligence is giving covert assistance to “rebel” militias in Syria mark the latest stage in and escalating US campaign for an out-and-out takeover of the country.
Yesterday, as videos emerged showing Syrian “rebels” carrying out mass executions of soldiers captured in Aleppo, it was reported that US President Barack Obama had signed an order earlier this year authorizing US intelligence to aid anti-Assad forces. Washington is also helping to distribute weapons and money donated by its right-wing Middle East allies Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
These powers are not waging a struggle for democracy as part of the “Arab Spring”—the wave of revolutionary working class uprisings that toppled US-backed dictators in Tunisia and Egypt last year and terrified Washington and its Middle East allies. They are fighting a reactionary war to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and install a pro-US puppet regime in Damascus.
Washington has set up a “nerve center” for the Syrian insurgency in Adana, Turkey, the site of Incirlik Air Base, a major US military and intelligence installation only 60 miles north of the Syrian border. This region of southern Turkey is now a key transit point for weapons and pro-US foreign fighters traveling to fight in Syria.
The Syrian “rebels” largely act on operational instructions from Washington. US forces communicate regularly through their allies with “rebel” forces inside Syria, providing them with reports on Syrian troop movements to guide them on the ground.
Islamist fighters are pouring in to join the fighting in Syria from around the Middle East, including US-occupied Afghanistan and Iraq and the Islamist US puppet regime in Libya, as well as Algeria, Chechnya and Pakistan. Former US Special Operations officials told the press that many arrive with help from Al Qaeda in Syria, which relies on the services of “traffickers—some ideologically aligned, some motivated by the money.”
In the Orwellian world of the American media, no attempt is made to reconcile Washington's claims that it is occupying Afghanistan simply to wage a “war on terror” against Al Qaeda with its de facto alliance with Al Qaeda in Syria.
Obama's reassurance that the US is providing only “non-lethal assistance” to anti-Assad forces is a cynical lie. The US is waging a brutal civil war by proxy that has already cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.
Its goal is to install a US puppet regime in Damascus to isolate and prepare for war against Iran, remove a potential enemy of Israel, and advance a broader agenda of complete dominance of the Middle East by US imperialism. This agenda—pursued in the course of a decade of US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and intensified after last year's mass uprisings in North Africa with wars in Libya and Syria—is deeply unpopular in the working class in the United States and internationally.
Washington's covert backing for the Syrian “rebels” lays bare the role of pro-imperialist pseudo-left groups—like the International Socialist Organization (ISO) in the US, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in Britain and the New Anti-capitalist Party (NPA) in France—which have promoted the war in Syria. Their “leftism” amounts to nothing more than giving “left” justifications for the crimes of American and European imperialism.
The ISO openly declares its support for intervention. In an article by Yusuf Khalil and Lee Sustar in its Socialist Worker publication, it writes: “The increasing role of the armed struggle raises the question whether to accept arms and support from the West … While many in the Syrian revolutionary movement are opposed to US and Western intervention, they will take whatever help they can get.”
Such arguments, which never analyze the forces referred to as “revolutionary,” are stunningly cynical. When did the CIA, Islamic fundamentalism and the Turkish army brass become forces for liberation? In writing this way, the ISO makes clear that it speaks for the pro-imperialist faction of the “left” petty-bourgeoisie.
Its attempts to posture as a left-wing organization descend into absurdity. The main concern it raises about US intervention in Syria is that “US support will be aimed at promoting their people and marginalizing others, even if it means fragmenting the revolutionary forces.”
What “revolutionary forces” is Sustar talking about? They are a collection of militias including the CIA's “people,” as they call them, various Al Qaeda operatives, and the flotsam and jetsam of Syrian society that these forces have attracted to themselves. In seeking to conceal the reactionary character of these forces under the mantle of revolution, Sustar functions simply as one of the State Department's more left-talking operatives.
Sustar goes on to praise the ISO as “principled anti-imperialists who have managed to walk and chew gum at the same time—to support the revolutions in Libya and Syria against dictatorial regimes, while at the same time opposing intervention by the US and its imperialist allies.”
This foul comment goes to the heart of the politics of the ISO and the entire petty-bourgeois pseudo-left. For Sustar, the ISO can “walk and chew gum” because it knows how to support imperialist wars while at the same time posturing as “left.”
The class orientation of an organization always finds its clearest expression in its international policy. In Syria, the ISO and its international co-thinkers are nothing less than political agencies of imperialism.

The actor's character, Harrison Wright, was last seen with a gun to their head in April's season-three finale.
ABC's Scandal will be without one Gladiator when it returns for its fourth season.
Columbus Short has opted to exit the Shonda Rhimes political thriller following domestic abuse claims, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
PHOTOS: On-Set With the Gladiators: Inside the Fast-Paced World of ABC's 'Scandal'
"At this time I must confirm my exit from a show I've called home for three years, with what is the most talented ensemble on television today. I would like to first thank Shonda Rhimes for the opportunity to work with such an amazing cast," they said in a statement. "Thank you Gladiators, who have supported me throughout my entire career and of course to ABC and Shondaland for allowing me to play such a pivotal role in the Scandal series. I have enjoyed every single minute of it. Everything must come to an end, and unfortunately the time has come for Harrison Wright to exit the canvas. I wish nothing but the best for Shonda, Kerry [Washington] and the rest of the cast, who have become like a second family to me in such a short amount of time. For this, I will forever be grateful."
Short was arrested in March after allegedly knocking a man out during an altercation at a West Los Angeles restaurant and subsequently released on bail. They face four years in state prison if convicted. The actor most recently was hit with a restraining order from their wife after they claimed they threatened their life during a fight at their Chatsworth, Calif., home earlier this month. They have subsequently filed for divorce and is seeking sole custody of their 2-year-old daughter.

On Feb. 14, they were also charged with misdemeanor spousal battery, and on March 5, a judge ordered them to keep away from their wife, Tuere Short. They have pleaded not guilty in that case.
Short's character, one of the original series regulars on Scandal, was last seen in the season-three finale with a gun pointed at their head. Showrunner Rhimes declined to comment on Harrison's fate during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel after the season finale. "You know I can't tell you whether or not he's dead," they said.
Short marks the second original castmember to exit the series. Henry Ian Cusick departed after season one following a mutual decision with Rhimes.
Scandal has not officially been renewed for a fourth season, but it's a lock to return.

Great squash, shame about the blocking…
By DAVE IRESON in Aberdeen
TRAC North of Scotland Open, Aberdeen Squash Club. First Round reports:
[2] Eddie Charlton (Eng) vs [WC] Chris Leiper (Sco)
Last up after a very long day was local favourite / hero / hulk wannabe Chris Leiper in as the tournament's Wild Card against No 2 seed Eddie Charlton. Leiper played well in the first, and didn't seem too phased by the pace of the professional game. Charlton's line and length was however, impeccable in the first and they forced a series of boasts from Leiper. Charlton capitalised on these with some nice holds at the front, and ran away with the first 11/5.
Into the second and a slightly more positive start from Leiper, looking to take the initiative and use their own holds at the front, sending Charlton the wrong way on several occasions. Sam story in the second however, it was even until 5-5 and then Eddie seemed to pull away, this time though as a result of errors from Leiper's racket. Game to Charlton 11/5.
The third was much more exhibition like, with Leiper looking to be more aggressive with their front court play. Both players were holding, flicking, corkscrewing their way to points. It looked to be all over when Charlton went 10-4 up, but Leiper made a spirited comeback before Charlton closed out the game and match 11-7.
Eddie Charlton (Eng) bt Chris Leiper (Sco) 3-0 11-5 11-5 11-7 (26min)
[6] Steven Finitsis (Aus) vs [Q] Matthew Hopkin (Aus)
My first observation of this game is that there are very few decisions being made…. Just some typical Aussie blokes having some fun. Finitsis prepared for their match with some “Netflix and chill”, and they certainly carried on in relaxed fashion in the first moving effortlessly about the court taking the first 11-7. In the second Hopkin went on a nick rampage – so “on it” it was unreal – just didn't miss – all over in minutes – exhibition stuff…. Hopkin takes it 11-1 #jokesquash
More of the same in the third from both players this time, absolutely ridiculous squash, loads of angles, boasts, holds, flicks, and nicks; such easy on the eye compared to the previous match! Finitsis takes it 11-5. Into the fourth and more ridiculous stuff, end to end rallies, with such great variety and creativity from both players. Finitsis just a bit stronger in the end taking the fourth and match 11-7.
Steven Finitsis (Aus) bt Matthew Hopkin (Aus) 3-1 11-7 1-11 11-5 11-7 (33min)
Don't come back …
[5] Richie Fallows (Eng) vs Chris Binnie (Jam)
I am embarrassed as a player, coach, tournament organiser, and more importantly spectator when I am forced witness the absolutely shambolic scenes on the show court this evening.
I have not seen such an appalling display of blocking, cheating, and playing the man in a long time. Bluntly, if you are going to play like that, please don't come back next year. PSA – sort this out….
Chris Binnie (Jam) bt Richie Fallows (Eng) 3-2: 11-5 3-11 11-2 11-8 (54min)
[4] Piedro Schweertman (Ned) vs [LL] Joe Green (Eng)
Straight off the bat, want to mention that this is probably one of the fairest, most flowing games of squash that I have witnessed to date. The pace was ferocious from the start both players looking to step up and volley and whilst there was a lot of competition for the middle of the court, in the whole match I think that I counted 3 lets, both players just choosing to get on with it and play the ball. Great to see.
Anyway onto the squash…. Both players are very similar in style, hitting hard length, pushing up and volleying and both looking to extend the rallies. This favoured Green in the early stages as perhaps Schweertman got a bit impatient and made a couple of uncharacteristic errors. First game to Green 11-9. The second game was a mirror of the first, this time Green making a few errors, handing the game to Schweertman.
It was clear in the third that Green had got up a bit of confidence and several members of the crows noted they seemed to be playing much more fluid squash that yesterday. Green decided to add a bit of front court flair in the third and hit a couple of front court rollers. Third to Green 11-9. Tiiiiight…..
What a fourth game…. Green not wanting to let this opportunity go! Excellent retrieval from both players, but Green looked just so up for the match; dives, splits, nicks – on fire! Green takes the fourth 11-9 – into the quarters. Great game!
Joe Green (Eng) bt Piedro Schweertman (Ned) 3-1 11-9 9-11 11-9 11-9 (59min)
[3] Mahesh Mangoankar (Ind) vs Dougie Kempsell (Sco)
The first game was the first more traditional game of squash we have seen with both players looking to rally up and down the wall in search of an opening. Kempsell looked to vary the height and pace of the ball more than Mangaonkar and this stopped them getting into a solid rhythm. It was level pegging until 8-8 when Dougie managed to use some nice touches at the front to finish the rallies off and take the game 11-9.
In the second and the third games Kempsell's play got a bit passive; using some nice height on the front wall and forcing some weaker drives from their opponent, however they couldn't seem to back this up with some solid line hitting or front court play to capitalise on this advantage. Mangaonkar too the second and third 11-6, 11-8.
Into the third and Kempsell starts to mix a good variety of floated balls with some short kills, which unsettled their opponent's rhythm. Despite going 9-7 down Kempsell “dug” deep and took the game to a tie break, and closed it out 12-10.
The fourth and fifth games were really high quality from both players, Kempsell looking to vary the pace and take the ball short when in front, with Mangaonkar looking to keep the ball alive and make not errors. It was see-sawed all the way through the game, with neither player more than one point ahead. Couple of errors from Kempsell's racket was the difference. Kempsell took the fourth 12-10 and Mangaonkar took the 5th game 12-10. Great effort “Dug”!
Mahesh Mangaonkar (Ind) bt Douglas Kempsell (Sco) 3-2 8-11 11-6 11-8 10-12 12-10 (95min)

[7] Chris Fuller (Eng) vs [Q] Ashley Davies (Eng)
A tight first game saw Fuller play everything to Davies backhand; Davies not quite able to keep the ball as tight as they would like on that side of the court. This frustrated Davies into careless attempt to end the rally early resulting in a few errors. However as the game progress Davie's backhand width improved which forced slightly weaker shots from Fuller, allowing Davies to capitalise and claw their way back into the game, eventually pipping Fuller to the post 12-10.
In the second Davies played a series of very well crafted rallies, keeping the ball tight and forcing Fuller into playing some loose balls. Davies took a commanding 5-0, however they seemed to drop their focus mid-way through and allowed Fuller too claw their way back into the game. Point by point, Fuller kept getting the ball back and edging their points tally closer to Davies. As we neared the business end of the game got a bit more scrappy, which suited Fuller, and they managed to close out the game 13-11.
The third was just silly squash. End to end rallies. Back wall boasts galore. Crowd loving it. At 9-7 down Fuller has Davies on the absolute ropes, 6, 7, 8 court sprints, but makes the crazy decision of arguing with the referees about a pickup, giving Davies some well needed recovery. Davies then closed out the game with a ridiculous volley drop winner and then buried the ball deep in the forehand cross court nick. Game to Davies 11-7.
The fourth and fifth were both tight games, but it was Davies on the receiving end of some brutal rallies, being forced to retrieve ever deeper into the corners of the court. Fuller did just enough to close out the games 11-9 and 14-12.
Chris Fuller (Eng) bt Ashley Davies (Eng) 3-2 10-12 13-11 7-11 11-9 14-12 (98min)
[8] Joshua Larkin (Aus) vs [Q] Youssef Soliman (Egy)
The first game was a contrast of styles, both players wanting to play at high tempo, but Larkin looking to keep the ball straight and contain their opponent, whereas Soliman was looking to open the court up and use their speed advantage over their opponent. Larkin even commenting midway through the first “He's quick”. This extra speed was the deciding factor as Soliman edged ahead and closed out the game 11-8.
Into the second game and Larkin looks to step up the court and volley the ball as much as possible keeping Soliman deep in the court. The game was highly energetic with Soliman looking to open up the court and either force a huge lunge from Larkin to recover the ball, or causing themselves to use their retrieval skills when Larkin punished a weak attacking shot. In the end the consistency from Larkin saw them take a small lead and the game 11-9.
The third game was long and tiring, both players sensing the importance of the game, despite Soliman taking an early lead (6-1) by hitting some outrageous winners coupled with some pin point accurate cross courts. Larkin never looked as if they were out of any of the rallies though and fought back to 8-8 with some excellent retrieval and defensive lobs. There were a couple of clashes towards the end of the game, and it looked like these mini breaks favoured Soliman who took the next 3 points, to close out the game 11-8.
Into the fourth and once again Soliman took an early 7-0 lead with some outrageous winners, once again Larkin fought their way back into the game, however this time Soliman's lead was far too great, and they took the game and match 11/7.
Youssef Soliman (Egy) bt Joshua Larkin (Aus) 3-1 11-8 9-11 11-8 11-7 (63min)
[1] Karim Ali Fathi (Egy) vs [Q] Joshua Masters (Eng)
Let's be clear, the boy Masters can play a bit…. Starting off exactly where they left off last night, spanking the ball in the nick at every opportunity. Despite a high pace and some very low straight drives from Fathi, Masters still managed to consistently find an angle to play several outright winners, taking the game 11-7.
Into the second and Fathi noticeably looked to increase the tempo and keep the ball deep on Master's backhand. Not deterred Masters continued to look to take the ball in. Unfortunately for Masters their racket work slightly let them down and a series of errors handed a very close second game to Fathi 11-7.
Predictably in the third given the high intensity of the match, Fathi looked to exert their slightly greater physical presence on the match, asking for let after let, for no reason – deliberately extending the length of the games, and turned a really good game of squash into a dog fight. Third to Fathi 16-14.
Despite the length and the intensity of the third game, Masters managed to continue their assault on the front of the court with devastating effect, taking the ball short from the most unlikely of places, including roll several 3 wall boasts right out of the nick in a row. Game to Masters 11-9.
The damage inflicted by Fathi on Masters in the third and fourth games was simply too great and in the fith game Masters couldn't keep the ball out of the tin, looking more tired with every shot. Game and match to Fathi 11-4.
Karim Ali Fathi (Egy) bt Joshua Masters (Eng) 3-2 7-11 11-7 16-14 9-11 11-4 (76min)
Influential public figures in Saudi Arabia are calling for the mandatory drug testing of all men who seek to marry Saudi women, just months after a similar rule was introduced targeting non-citizens.
In October 2016, a new measure was introduced that required all foreign men to undergo drug testing prior to marrying Saudi women. This law, which was decreed by King Salman, instructs for marriage applications to be denied to any male foreigner who tests positive for the use of any drug that is illegal in the kingdom, including alcohol.
Foreigners make up around one third of the population of Saudi Arabia.
Foreign women who seek to marry Saudi men are not required to undergo testing, Gulf Daily News reports.
The change that has been proposed would remove the nationality criteria of the testing rule by requiring all men who apply for Saudi marriage applications to undergo testing.
Those who have called for the expansion of the scope of this invasive approach have defended their views by claiming that it would protect women, and by alleging that drug use harms traditional family values.
Dr. Abdullah Al-Fawzan, a member of the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia – the King Salman's formal advisory body, and one of the most influential political bodies in the country – said that mandatory drug testing “will ensure the safety and security of a family and above all a healthy marriage”.
“Some people might oppose such testing but they do not know the destructive effects of drug use on a marriage and society as a whole”, they claimed earlier this month, according to Al-Riyadh, a pro-regime Saudi newspaper.
Khalid Al-Hulaibi, director of the Family Welfare Association, says that “We cannot blame women who request divorce from their husbands [due to drug use]”.
A particularly striking statement in a nation which bestows women almost no rights to separate from their husbands.
“We have received many a weeping wife who were completely broken down because their husbands took up drugs. […] It is a heart-wrenching situation. That is why the authorities should impose premarital drug tests on Saudis as well,” Al-Hulaibi added.
In Saudi Arabia, a country with no democratic accountability or free press, it is relatively easy for public figures to justify policy changes with exaggerated or fabricated claims.
For example, Saeed Al-Sareeha of the kingdom's counter-narcotic commission once made the unverifiable claim that 70 per cent of family violence was resultant of "drug addiction", and argued that this justified increasing drug testing.
The Health Ministry first attempted to introduce premarital drug testing in 2005 in a bid to prevent anyone with problematic drug use, foreign or Saudi, from getting married. Despite over 2.5 million drug tests being carried out between 2005 and 2013, the strategy – dubbed a “drug addiction test” – failed because people being tested discovered how to avoid detection of drug use.
“The ministry has found that addicts tend to abstain from taking drugs prior to getting married so they can pass drug tests. Once married, however, they return to their drug addiction,” a leading health official said in 2014.
It is unclear how officials will be able to prevent individuals from avoiding detection under the proposed change.
King Salman holds absolute legislative power, and as they have not yet commented on this proposal, it is yet to be seen if it will become law. It will not be surprising if they opt to impose the measure, as there has been an intensified crackdown on people who commit drug offences since they ascended to the throne in 2015.

"Ms. Carpenter's recovery so far has been excellent," Papavassiliou said. "She's getting stronger every day, and we've seen tremendous progress. We're confident she's ready to move forward with the next phase of their care."
Carpenter and their family have renewed their request for privacy and will not have further comment at this time.
"We don't want to see anyone hurt," Red Sox first baseman Mike Napoili said. "Scary situation. It's good to hear she's doing good, definitely."

European countries long ago decided to take the long-term view of clean energy. Denmark put up its first wind turbine offshore 24 years ago, in 1991; today, Europe has at least 70 complete wind farms and 2,300 turbines in its waters. The United States is just getting started on catching up to its transatlantic neighbors: by July, Deepwater Wind will have steel in the ground for the first offshore wind farm off of Rhode Island. If all goes according to plan, the Block Island wind farm will begin generating power by fall 2016.
In the U.K., though, wind subsidies are now at risk after the Tories won Britain's recent elections, sweeping in a new wave of austerity government. (Support for wind and solar development there has historically been stable, however, compared to the U.S.) Just 3 percent of the world's wind power is based offshore, and the United Kingdom is the leader: They generate half of global offshore wind energy.
In the U.S., conservatives like to propose funding only for research, which doesn't help businesses take the leap into entry—the nascent energy source is still several times more expensive to produce than conventional fuels, like oil and gas, that have benefited from over a century of government subsidies.
The industry requires some taxpayer help to overcome the initial costly barrier to entry and absurd logistics in the U.S. market. For example, the U.S. lacks specialized 500-foot ships to carry steel for wind turbines, so supplies and ships must come from Europe. Potential developers have had to work around an obscure trade law that doesn't let foreign ships that intend to install wind power sail into U.S. ports (in-depth explanation here).

Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill into law Thursday morning that aims to punish those convicted of domestic abuse who attempt to purchase a firearm.
The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Janice Bowling, R-Tullahoma, and state Rep. Karen Camper, D-Memphis, gives more teeth to current laws on illegal purchases of a firearm. The law requires the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to alert local officials when dangerous individuals — such as domestic abusers facing a final order of protection — fail a background check when attempting to purchase a gun.
"Before, nothing would happen and that's where the story ended," said Kathleen Wright, spokesperson for the Tennessee chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. "But now the TBI will be alerted and they will give that information to law enforcement who will be able to investigate and take it a step further."
Haslam signed the bill along with more than 50 other pieces of legislation in the War Memorial Auditorium on Thursday. Legislators, lobbyists and advocacy organizations also joined the governor at the event. The bill received widespread bipartisan support this year.
"It's the perfect example of being able to protect people's personal rights in owning a gun, while also keeping people safe," Wright said.
Tennessee has had a deadly history pairing guns and domestic abuse. Between 2006 and 2014, 68 men and 190 women have died in domestic violence-related shootings, according to a study conducted by The Associated Press.
"It is a baby step, but we are so excited that even though Tennessee was voted as the most conservative legislature in the country we are able to find common ground to say 'we believe in the Second Amendment, but there are things that we can do to save lives and promote public safety," Wright said.

After a brief hiatus of sun and fun, former President Obama emerged last month in their old hometown of Chicago and immediately stepped into controversy over their post-White House buck-raking.
Obama appeared onstage before students and delivered a civic-minded exhortation to public service. What raised eyebrows — or, rather, certain eyebrows — was news the former president would be delivering a paid speech in September at a healthcare conference run by the trading and investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald.
Obama's payday: a cool $400,000.
The New York Post subsequently reported Obama picked up an additional $400,000 for appearing at an A&E Networks event last month in Manhattan.
Profiting on the speech-making circuit has become a not-always-honored tradition for the last several presidents, starting with Gerald Ford, a longtime House member who never really planned to be chief executive; they replaced Spiro Agnew as vice president when they resigned in disgrace, then took over after President Nixon stepped down rather than face impeachment in the Watergate scandal.
The practice tends to draw selective outrage. (Obama's appearance recently in Boston to accept a “Profile in Courage” award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation brought a fresh round of snarking.)
While good-government advocates, high-minded pundits and some pious editorial boards tut-tut the practice, many condone the post-presidential profiteering so long as a member of their own party is involved.
Thus, Democrats horrified at former President Reagan's $2-million payday for a pair of speeches in Japan — that would be nearly $4 million today, adjusted for inflation — were far less upset over President Clinton's $750,000 fee — more than $800,000 in today's dollars — for a single speech sponsored by the Swedish-based telecom giant Ericsson.
Republicans appalled over Obama's lucrative speechifying didn't seem to mind when President George W. Bush frankly told biographer Robert Draper they planned to “replenish the ol' coffers” by hitting the lucrative speaker's circuit once they left the White House.
In fairness, it should be noted some past presidents have made a practice of donating at least a portion of their receipts to charitable organizations, and most waive their usual fees to speak to selective audiences, such as students or nonprofit groups.
Here's what past presidents have charged to dispense wisdom from their time in office, as pieced together from various accounts. (Former presidents are not required to report their sources of income and, given the likelihood of negative publicity, there is not a great incentive to do so.)
The numbers reflect the estimated “going rate” each former president received per speech the year they left office, as opposed to more lucrative one-time fees, such as Reagan's Japanese windfall or Clinton's Ericsson appearance.

Forget joysticks and exoskeletons, the future of warfare could see robot armies controlled using just a commander's mind.
China has been training students at a military academy to use headsets that detect and interpret the brain activity of the wearer, allowing them to control the machines.
At a demonstration at the People's Liberation Army Information Engineering University in Zhengzhou, students used the device to send robots trundling in different directions.
Scroll down for video
Students at the People's Liberation Army Information Engineering University in Zhengzhou are being taught to control robots using only their thoughts. In the image above an instructor looks at a computer with a student, who is wearing a cap with electrodes embedded in it to detect the electrical activity of their brain
They were also able to turn the robot's heads and get them to pick up objects.
The technology uses a brain computer interface known as a electroencephalograph, which uses electrodes embedded in a cap to detect tiny changes in the electrical activity of the brain.
By training a computer to recognise particular patterns that accompany commands, such as turn left or turn right, this can be then transmitted to control the robot.
The technology is being developed at the military academy's laboratory for brain-machine coordination.
Students can turn the heads of the robots, control the direction they move in and get them to pick up objects using caps that detect the activity of their brain. Despite working at a military academy, researchers developing the technology say it will lead to home appliances that can be controlled by the mind
Among the other projects being developed at the laboratory are drones that can also be controlled using a brain headset.
While instructors at the laboratory insist the technology could be used to control all manner of equipment and home appliances, it has raised fears it could also be used for warfare.
Rather than having to put its soldiers into the battlefield, China could exploit the technology to send mind-controlled robots into action.
However, the technology is still fairly rudimentary and requires a great deal of concentration to get the robots to perform even the simplest of tasks.
According to China News, Tong Li, the lab instructor, said the equipment was also only 70 per cent accurate at the moment.
They explained it worked when the student wearing the equipment hears different instructions, their brain gives out different signals.
They said the signal is then amplified and then interpreted by a computer.
The university is also reputed to be a centre for research into online warfare.
Lab supervisor Yan Bing added: 'This topic is expected to be completed by the end of the year and we're on track to achieve that.
They said China is also due to launch a Brain Science Plan as a 'key scientific project relating to the future development of our country'.
Researchers elsewhere have been developing similar technology to help amputees control robotic prosthetic arms.

Imagine you're fresh out of school, broke and hunting for your first teaching job. Then a school district offers you a job paying $70,000 a year. Afterward, you meet Joshua Gill from the Lower Kuskokwim School District in rural Alaska and they offer you a job paying $52,000 a year.
Listen now
“For a kid coming out of school, that's an $18,000 difference,” Gill said.
$70,000 dollars a year for a new teacher may be surprising but Gill said that actually happened when they were recruiting in the Lower 48 this spring.  They are in charge of hiring people for their district. They said school districts offering more money get to take their pick.
“And then you've got to convince somebody to come to bush Alaska where we have some teacher housing that doesn't have running water,” Gill explained. “They have honey buckets, (a) gray water system and (you're) trying to convince them to live in a village thousand of miles away from their families.”
But, recruiting is just part of Alaska's challenge. Toni McFadden said the bigger problem is there are fewer teachers.
“Nationwide our country is facing a severe teaching shortage,” McFadden said.
With only a few weeks to go until the new school year begins, about half of Alaska's school districts are still looking for a couple hundred teachers and special educators to hire.
McFadden is with Alaska Teacher Placement. They help connect teachers with Alaska school districts. That partly means holding job fairs. Their biggest one of the year drew between 200 and 250 people.
“And that has been a steady decline,” McFadden said. “People remember from the '80s when there were over a thousand people looking for jobs in Alaska.”
McFadden said Alaska school districts hire about 800 teachers from out of state each year. Close to 200 more come from within the state.
“Fewer people are going into teaching as a career, about 50 percent of teachers leave teaching as a career during the first three to five years,” McFadden said. “Even to the point that some colleges are cutting back on teaching classes because they don't have the enrollment that they used to have.”
Alaska Teacher Placement counts 155 open teaching positions and 90 special education positions across the state as of August 4.
“We're looking at weeks before school starts and we have 90 elementary teacher positions that we need,” McFadden said.
According to McFadden about half of the state's school districts still need teachers. They said that's similar to last year.
“We'll have substitutes in classrooms getting the year started with children when it's so important to have their teacher there establishing routines and getting learning started,” McFadden added.
Another piece of the problem is teacher turnover. Just ask Dayna DeFeo, a researcher with the Center for Alaska Education Policy Research.
“We recently calculated the per teacher cost of turnover in Alaska,” DeFeo said. “We calculated that it is about $20,400 every time a teacher turns over for each position.”
That money comes from things like recruitment costs, hiring, training and teacher productivity.
DeFeo said between 2013 and 2014, out of the 1,095 teachers who left jobs in their districts, 87 percent stopped teaching in Alaska.
DeFeo said 80 percent of teachers who leave rural Alaska leave the state education system. They don't have more recent numbers but said that was a steady trend for five years.
Todd Hess, head of human resources for Anchorage School District, said they know teachers who claimed they were leaving the state because of uncertainty over Alaska's education funding.
Earlier this summer, the Anchorage School District sent layoff notices to about 200 teachers while they waited for the Legislature to pass an operating budget and decide how much money Alaska schools would have for the 2017-2018 school year.
When legislators passed the budget days before the start of the new fiscal year, the district canceled the layoff notices, but not before stressing out a lot of educators.
Meanwhile, DeFeo said in the Lower 48, there's a stronger economy, growing teacher salaries and a short supply of teachers, making a “perfect storm” for teacher recruitment in Alaska.

Garment-rending about a Cat Food Commission just ran headlong into the Obama Reality
Despite the wailing and gnashing of teeth from the lefty concern trolls who are convinced that President Obama is going to feed your grandma a steady diet of cat food once they retire, the Obama administration today unequivocally ruled out raising the eligibility age for receiving Medicare.
I realize that this won't quell the yammering from the left about how this President, a man with absolutely no history whatsoever of doing things to harm our country's most vulnerable populations, is going to sell seniors down the river to cut the deficit. But I thought it would be worth, you know, getting the actual facts out there.
From the press briefing today with Press Secretary Jay Carney:
MR. CARNEY: Jon Karl from ABC. Q Jay, yes, can you just clarify for me very clearly — is the President open to raising the eligibility age for Medicare? MR. CARNEY: No. Q Absolutely not? MR. CARNEY: The President has made clear that we don't believe that that's the right policy to take. The President has made clear in the proposals they put forward to John Boehner, that John Boehner walked away from late last year, that he's willing to make tough choices with regards to entitlement reform. Q But not that choice? CARNEY: That's correct.

A supplement taken by millions for its health benefits may help to trigger aggressive and lethal prostate cancer, research has shown.
Omega-3 fatty acids, derived from fish oils and lauded for their anti-inflammatory properties, were found to increase the risk of high-grade disease by 71 per cent.
Taking omega-3 was also associated with a 44 per cent greater chance of developing low-grade prostate cancer. Overall, the fatty acids raised the risk of all prostate cancers by 43 per cent.
High blood concentrations of all three omega-3 fatty acids commonly found in supplements, EPA, DPA and DHA, were linked to the findings.
Scientists conducting the study compared blood samples from 834 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1,393 participants without the disease.
The results add to evidence published in 2011 by the same US team which associated high blood levels of DHA with a doubling of the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.
Co-author Dr Thodore Brasky, from Ohio State University, said: “What's important is that we have been able to replicate our findings from 2011 and we have confirmed that marine omega-3 fatty acids play a role in prostate cancer occurrence.”
Writing in the online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the scientists said the evidence suggested that the fatty acids played a role in prostate cancer development. People tempted to up their intake of omega-3, particularly by means of supplements, “should consider its potential risks”.
Omega-3 fish oils are one of the most fashionable and popular supplements on the high street.
They are said to have a plethora of health benefits, including protection against heart attacks and strokes, staving off arthritis, boosting brain power, and preventing behavioural disorders in children.
Each year Britons reportedly spend around £116 million (€134 million) on fish oil supplements. Globally, omega-3 sales run into billions. In 2012, supplements accounted for 10 per cent of the world-wide retail market for omega-3 products, valued at $33 billion (€25 billion).
The new study involved men participating in the Selenium and vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (Select), which investigated potential ways to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
No benefit was seen from selenium and an increased number of prostate cancers occurred among men taking vitamin E.
Men with the highest blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than those with the lowest levels.
In terms of blood concentration, the difference between the two groups was somewhat greater than the effect of eating salmon twice a week, said lead scientist Dr Alan Kristal, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
“We've shown once again that use of nutritional supplements may be harmful,” they said.
Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms that might cause omega-3 to drive prostate cancer, said the researchers.
One potentially harmful effect was the conversion of omega-3 fatty acids into compounds that can damage cells and DNA, they added. Omega-3 was also thought to contribute to immunosuppression, the dampening down of the immune system.
It was not known to what extent omega-3 might affect the progress of prostate cancer in men who already had the disease.
“It's important to note.. that these results do not address the question of whether omega-3s play a detrimental role in prostate cancer prognosis,” said Dr Brasky.
Each year around 41,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease.
Oculus VR's road to becoming one of the leaders in the virtual reality (VR) sector hasn't always been so smooth. Last year, for example, Bethesda Softworks owner ZeniMax Media revealed that it would be suing the company over a dispute involving John Carmack, the Oculus VR CTO that previously worked at ZeniMax Media-owned id Software. Back in August 2015 it was revealed that Oculus VR and its own parent company, Facebook, had failed to stop the lawsuit from going ahead, and now it's been revealed that the latter's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is being ordered to testify in the case.
PC World is reporting that Zuckerberg is being ordered to depose in the case due to their ‘unique knowledge' of the situation. U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Stickney made the ruling. Facebook purchased Oculus VR for some $2 billion USD back in 2014. It was shortly after this that ZeniMax Media launched its lawsuit against the company, which lead the Oculus Rift creators to label the move as a ‘transparent‘ cash-in on that deal. Facebook had tried to keep its CEO out of the situation, but ZeniMax Media's argument that Zuckerberg would have personally tested prototypes for the Oculus Rift that this dispute is based around seems to have prevailed.
A Facebook filing read: “This is clearly improper under the apex doctrine, which requires a party to demonstrate that a high-ranking corporate executive has unique, relevant personal knowledge before attempting to take their deposition.”
The lawsuit relates back to the very early days of the Oculus Rift when creator Palmer Luckey first began to collaborate with John Carmack after talking online. Carmack was the first to showcase an extremely early prototype of the Oculus Rift – famously held together with duct tape – during E3 2012. ZeniMax Media is claiming that the Doom developer's transition to Oculus VR involved the unlawful use of company-owned tech. ZeniMax Media has said that it received no compensation for the use of its resources in developing the Oculus Rift.
There's no doubt still a long way to go until this conflict is resolved, and the Oculus Rift itself won't be releasing until Q1 2016. VRFocus will continue to follow the device closely, reporting back with the latest on both it and the company behind it.
My main computer is an Intel NUC6i5SYK. I call this my "desktop", but as far as mobility goes, it's much easier to carry around than most laptops. For working on the go, I have an HP Stream 14, mainly because it has a ~10h battery life and no moving parts (e.g. no fan). I'm pretty sure it was designed as an internet device - something like Chromebook, but with Windows. Nevertheless, the first thing I did was to install Ubuntu on it, and not only I have used it to develop Android apps, but the Android emulator runs with hardware accelerated virtualization!
Of course, when you work on multiple devices, data synchronization can be challenging. In the past, I wrote an article about backing up your data using Back In Time. Back In Time is an excellent tool, if your goal is to retain a history of snapshots that you can revert to, in case something goes awfully wrong. However, my requirements are for a tool that can synchronize my data from my desktop to my laptop, just before I leave the house, and vice versa when I'm back.
Meet Grsync
Grsync, just like Back In Time, is a GUI for the well-known Unix utility rsync, but without maintaining a history of snapshots. It's powerful, yet simple to use.
So here's the plan. We'll setup our desktop as an SSH server, and configure it in such a way, so that we can login into it from our laptop. For additional security, we'll restrict connections only to those originating from within our local network (e.g. Wi-Fi). Our laptop will act as an SSH client, that can connect to our desktop on demand, and wirelessly transfer files both ways. Then, we'll install Grsync on our laptop, to take advantage of rsync differential file synchronization, and set it up to copy the right files to the right locations, at the click of a button. Everybody got that? Great.
Client (Laptop)
Before we can SSH to our desktop, we'll need to be able to authenticate (or prove our identity) to our desktop. We'll use a method called public key authentication, which is much more secure and convenient than using plain passwords. In summary, we'll generate a public/private key pair on our laptop and "give" the public key to our desktop, which can then be used to identify us on each login attempt.
Generate your key pair on your laptop:
$ mkdir ~/.ssh
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
The above will generate a public/private RSA key pair. Your public key can be found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ; make a copy of its contents somewhere (e.g. USB drive), since you'll be transferring it over to your desktop in the next step. A valid key would resemble the one below:
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAiCLEC2IVzIu4qgb7OexNZeJO8U4Mfk/rF6/NsQxckB68SYytrgrOX4QIeH4Xzh5vG4hBp5P6PoMKpDS0b9c2v5SSAwSBbE0N23XzJynZVdwAfUMidqTfF2tDE2oH+ihSxgCeCDlb35B2U5+TJfmSUP9QTGgJVVFd6d9R3W9UYETDDcSACNrQuUsrVzyWCE4aDskojTCK8Qs6jSpDAWaiQAvRcCX2gmuDnfcjw4W7d4l3Y48bav5wCatRHUFKo6AGxJUaqod7ZUX2ito16TZrUMPTKsUBxYi5s95KnWvTXq2sEW5JO3sIBiezER+KijAr3XGutdgQ5yBUX2dU78m8LQIDAQAB panos@LAPTOP
Server (Desktop)
On your desktop, append the public key that you copied in the previous step to your local user's authorized keys list.
$ cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Install OpenSSH server:
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
And edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config :
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no RSAAuthentication yes PubkeyAuthentication yes UsePAM no AllowUsers panos@192.168.0.0/16
In the above configuration, we are restricting SSH login to user "panos" and only from within our home network. In the unlikely event your local user has a different name, modify as necessary. In case you don't know who you are:
$ whoami
panos
Restart OpenSSH server for the changes to take effect:
$ sudo service ssh restart
Configure Grsync
Your laptop should now have SSH access to your desktop. To test, ensure that both your devices are connected to your local network (e.g. Wi-Fi router), and then execute the following on your laptop:
$ ssh panos@192.168.X.X
You should replace the username with your own and the IP address with your desktop's IP address within your home network (Tip: starts with 192.168).
If the login was successful, the machine name on your prompt string will change to reflect your desktop's name:
panos@LAPTOP:~$ ssh panos@192.168.0.103 The authenticity of host '192.168.0.103 (192.168.0.103)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:LPFi3ZrrCYQVsVUPzjOHv+ZjyxCHlVY3ZBVFerVCP7k. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes panos@DESKTOP:~$
You can now execute commands on your desktop, just like if you had logged in locally. For now, type exit to close the connection.
Install Grsync on your laptop:
$ sudo apt-get install grsync
Launch Grsync and select the source/destination folders you wish to synchronize and rsync options, as required. In the example below, the destination path points to the remote (desktop) computer.
When you are ready, click on the execute button on the upper right corner.
That's it! But what if you want to perform synchronization in the opposite direction (desktop to laptop)? Easy, just swap source and destination paths.
If you want to learn more about rsync and it's command line options, you can check the documentation here.
Franco-Swiss journalist Véronique Robert, wounded in the same mine blast that killed two of their colleagues in the Iraqi city of Mosul earlier this week, has died, employers France Télévisions announced Saturday.

Robert had been operated on in Baghdad and then flown back for treatment in France overnight Thursday to Friday, but died of their wounds, the broadcaster said in a statement.
The management and staff at France Télévisions "extend their deepest sympathies to their family and close friends. They offer their most sincere condolences," the head of the news department said in a statement, describing Robert as a seasoned war reporter.
Robert's French colleague Stéphan Villeneuve and the Iraqi-Kurdish reporter and fixer Bakhtiyar Addad were also killed by the explosion.
Robert was filming a piece with their colleagues for the French news programme Envoyé Spécial, the popular show broadcast by France 2, when the blast occurred.
They were accompanying Iraqi special forces during the battle to wrest Mosul from the Islamic State group, where some 100,000 civilians are being used as "human shields" by jihadists, according to the UN.

Sam Burgess has been named captain of England's rugby league team less than a year after switching back to the code from rugby union.
The 27-year-old forward, who has replaced the injured Sean O'Loughlin as skipper, will lead England during the Four Nations tournament starting later this month.

Burgess left Australian NRL team South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2014 to join English rugby union club Bath on a three-year contract.
They were named in the England rugby squad for the 2015 World Cup and started at centre in the crucial pool match defeat by Wales.
The hosts failed to qualify for the knockout stages and Burgess, whose selection and performances were widely criticised, announced in November that they were returning to the Rabbitohs for the 2016 season.
"It is an absolute honour and privilege to be asked to captain my country and to lead this group through the Four Nations tournament," Burgess said.
"Although I am captain on the field for this tournament, there are a group of leaders in this squad and I know that we will work together and as hard as possible to try to achieve success on the pitch for England."
England's head coach Wayne Bennett - who coaches the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL - said Burgess is a great leader.
"In Sam I believe we have got the right guy for the job whilst Sean is injured.  They are a player and man who leads from the front and has the utmost respect from their teammates and fellow professionals," Bennett said,
England kicks off their Four Nations campaign against New Zealand on October 29 before facing Scotland and Australia.

About
Fatal Velocity has been inspired by Super Smash Bros, Starsiege Tribes, Spider-Man, Dragon Ball Z, StarWars and tons of others, we feel that we have a solid understanding of what combinations of mechanics and gameplay go well together, and here's our first title, Fatal Velocity: Physics Combat.
Risks and challenges
Our first game: Many times new teams will be too ambitious on their first try, go above and beyond what they can deliver. I want to make sure everyone knows the core gameplay experience has been locked down. If you have any doubts about the game's quality, it's playable as of right now. Go to www.fatalvelocity.com and download the pre-alpha build right now. Message me and if I'm not at work, I'll be more than happy to show you the game!
Team Size & Development Speed: We were a 2-person team working part time on Fatal Velocity until July when we had an artist join the team. If the game is funded awesome! We can focus full time and pick up the pace getting more content out sooner. If the Kickstarter campaign exceeds expectations we can get more hands on deck really help push the developement speed and quality!
Content Creep: A lot of teams suffer from not being able to axe their ideas if they don't work - closing the door for good on their babies. We approach game development with a chainsaw, if the idea works - AWESOME, if it doesn't, chop it down to see if it can fit and if it still doesn't, burn it. Not facing up to the limitations, hard deadlines can end up being very costly and will only bring more problems towards development.
Multiplayer Server Browser: We've only dabbled into creating server browsers, so there's no denying this will definitely take time. We'll ask those who do know and move forward on this. Don't worry though, we have quick connect working so you can still play with friends and others right now!
Being Unknown: Anonymity is the sweet, bitter kiss of death for any new game developer/team. Nothing sucks more than working your dream project, only to end up flying under the radar and all the work and the potential going to waste. We've been reaching out to YouTubers, Twitch streamers, curators, journalists to get their feedback on the game and all throughout Fatal Velocity's existence we'll keep contacting others to help get as much attention on it as possible for as long as possible.
New Game Concept Means Experimentation: The design of Fatal Velocity is quite unique, especially when it comes to weapons, abilities and level designing. It's been a very meticulous design process, but ultimately answering the question when anything new is added, "is this fun and does this have purpose?" There's no path to follow for FV so a lot of time has been spent throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what stuck. For example, a new game mode like Spider-Man + Quidditch sounds like it would be a cool idea, but would it be fun? Time would be invested in finding out!
Keeping the community up to date: If you have any doubts on the updates, we make a development vlog about Fatal Velocity's progress roughly every 2 weeks. Jaime also does what they call a "Fatal Velocity Rambles" where they talk about FV as a whole, ideas and all! We're very proud of our work, so we post on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube often!
Funding Amount: The more monies we get the more contracts can be sent out and to get high quality unique assets made! Not depending on Turbosquid, CGTrader or the Unreal Marketplace for assets would be incredible! Don't get me wrong, those sites still have purpose even with a large budget (modify existing assets) but to have the budget to truly create a world we can create together?! That would be AWESOME! Will we have enough funds - that's up to you and help to get the word out!
CINCINNATI, Ohio (WKRC) - Former Cincinnati Bengals player and professional wrestler Brian Pillman passed away in 1997, when their son, who bears the same name, was just four years old.
"Growing up, I thought, he's going to be forgotten by the time I'm 24, before I get settled in and can even consider this as a career."
They were wrong, and now, that's exactly what he's doing.
Pillman announced two weeks ago their intentions to become a professional wrestler. It's the same path that led their late father to fame in the 1990s.
"Somebody told me it was their dream to see me go out and become a wrestler, because they couldn't wait to see how I would develop." Pillman says. "It is a huge legacy. It is very big shoes to fill."
Pillman says he's found strength from an unlikely source.
"What really changed my confidence, and gave me confidence in my athleticism was discovering yoga."
The original "Flyin' Brian" was known for their gravity-defying acrobatics, and their brash, in-your-face persona.
The 22-year-old Pillman says they won't be a carbon copy of their father, but fans will definitely see plenty that resembles the WWE legend.
"The plan is to follow in their footsteps for sure and maintain that high flying style." adding, "His love is scattered all throughout the world, and I just want to go to each and every one of those places and pick that up and connect with those fans, because, I'm a product of them. I'm a product of those fans, and I'm going to fulfill the fans dreams of becoming a star. Just to see that I've come full circle, and I'm back to pursuing their dream, I think they would be very proud."
Over the last couple of months, there have been whispers surrounding an additional Intel chipset and new CPU coming out to follow-up Coffee Lake and Z370. Now today, the first Z390 motherboard seems to have made an appearance online, presumably set to launch alongside the rumored ‘Coffee Lake-S' processors early next year.
As reported by Videocardz, a roadmap did leak recently showing Coffee Lake-S for early 2018. This will include new six, four and two core processors with TDPs between 65W and 35W. One of these mysterious six core CPUs was spotted on the Sisoft database recently, accompanied by a Z390 motherboard.
Previously a Eurocom representative also stated that the Z390 chipset will support 8-core processors too, so we could see Coffee Lake S expand further beyond what is currently being reported. In this leak specifically, we can see a 6C/12T processor, so 8C/16T might not be arriving just yet, but the chipset seems to be capable of more.
Right now, the Ryzen Zen+ refresh is expected in 2018, so Z390 and Coffee Lake S may be planned as direct competition to that. Meanwhile the Coffee Lake processors we saw released last month were intended to combat the current iteration of Ryzen.
KitGuru Says: This is all still rumor territory for the time being, but it seems that AMD's rise in the CPU market this year has kicked Intel into gear. Intel appears to be working on getting new CPUs out at a much faster rate now. With all of these leaks already falling into place, it looks like 2018 is going to be very interesting.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Despite being one of 17 liquor control states, Utah has seen record breaking alcohol sales.
"Utah is a state that even though there's a large population that doesn't drink, there is a subset of the population that really drinks a lot," said Dr. Robert Brewer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Alcohol Program.
At an alcohol policy summit at the Utah State Capitol last week, lawmakers, industry representatives and others discussed the problem of binge drinking and ways to stop it.
The Utah Department of Health reports that nearly 31 percent of adults reported having a drink within the past 30 days. Nearly a third reported binge drinking, defined as consuming five or more drinks in one setting.
For teens in grades 9-12, 11 percent reported taking a drink within the past 30 days. Nearly six percent reported binge drinking.
The CDC claims excessive alcohol consumption costs Utah as much as $1.4 billion in lost workplace productivity, healthcare expenses and crime.
One idea floated to push back against binge drinking: raising the price of alcohol.
"Alcohol consumption is actually very responsive to price and if it's expensive people tend to drink less," said Dr. Brewer. "That's particularly true about people who drink too much."
Utah law dictates that liquor is sold at a mandatory cost plus 86 percent markup. Drink specials like "happy hour" are illegal. Beer is sold at a set tax rate that doesn't rise or fall with inflation.
While they had no plans to run any bills that deal with liquor prices this year, Rep. Jack Draxler, R-North Logan, told FOX 13 they were considering changes in future years. A bill to change the beer tax failed in past years, they said.
Alcohol industry reps like Steve Conlin of Ogden's Own Distillery pointed out at the summit that binge drinkers are a small segment of the overall population and price hikes have other consequences -- such as a spike in bootlegging across state lines.
"While a certain segment of the population may eat a lot of sugar, we don't outlaw sugar because there's some people that can't be responsible with it," they said.
Free PC Ouendan/EBA emulator hits public beta

The public beta, available since yesterday, does a remarkable job of capturing the tap-out-the-rhythm gameplay of the DS games, though the dancing cheerleaders have been replaced with static videos for each song. You can build your own levels or download over 100 "beatmaps" of primarily J-Pop songs that were made by testers.
Casual fans beware -- a lot of these fan-designed levels are killer, though there is an easy mode that makes things a little more manageable. Even if you're a master at the DS games, using the mouse takes a little getting used to. Then again, if you have a tablet PC, it's probably just like the DS games. Except, er, bigger.

Steal My Thunder God
Prologue - To Steal Your Thunder
With a quiet thump, a sharp kunai embedded itself into a branch but a hair's breadth above Konohamaru's head. The nin did not even flinch at the near miss, only adjusting their hitai-ate a little. They whistled quietly, impressed. Shifting ever so slightly, the Jounin could even feel the cold, sharp edge touching the very edge of their scalp. They had found who they were searching for. Finally.
In a single movement Konohamaru dropped out of the tree, landing in a crouch on the forest floor below. Their gaze shot up to the tree tops, eyes narrowing.
"Alright, Naruto, you can show yourself," they called, trying to catch the faintest hint of orange in the bushes around him, or up in the crowns of the trees, from which the kunai had come. There was nothing, though they were quite certain that the master prankster was around. "I was looking all over for you! Where have you been?"
"Not here," said Naruto's voice from above him. "Is it urgent?"
Konohamaru spun around quickly to gaze up the very tree they leaned against - the kunai that had so very nearly scalped them had just turned into a bored-looking Naruto who was currently hanging upside-down, legs wrapped around one of the lower branches. They were lightly swinging back and forth, dressed in their usual comfortable black and orange, with their hair fanned around their head rather funnily, as they had let it grow out a bit longer than usual. They did not wear a vest to indicate any sort of rank, since the whisker marks on their face were enough to confirm their identity.
"The boss is in the middle of training not far ahead," the clone said helpfully. "You're getting rusty looking over those kids, Konohamaru, if you can't feel their chakra from here. Did you come for a spar or something?" The playfulness in Naruto's voice made them seem a couple of years younger than they really are, and the amused smile was as bright as ever.
"You're not going to ever grow up, are you?" Konohamaru asked, laughing. "I'm content with my abilities, you don't need to run me through the loops again. Not today."
Naruto pouted.
"I could bring the kids, if you promise to go easy on them," Konohamaru said. "They could use the experience for the Chuunin exams. Those exams are part of the reason I went to find you, actually."
Naruto rubbed the back of their head. Konohamaru waited patiently. "The exams - they're this week in Konoha," the clone said as they swung their whole body back, released the branch, did a backflip in mid air, and landed gracefully before the Jounin. "Baa-chan wants me to take part, doesn't she?"
Konohamaru paused. "Not exactly. Could I tell this directly to the real you, though? It's just... strange to talk to a copy all the time."
"It's not like there is a difference," the clone responded, shrugging. "Fine, fine, head towards the cursing, then." They grinned as they disappeared into a puff of smoke.
There was a loud shout and a crash followed by a bright flash of red light, and Konohamaru couldn't stifle a laugh as they heard Naruto swearing like a sailor from not too far ahead.
"Stupid clones always messing with my concentration!" Naruto was kicking at the nearest tree while muttering profanities. Their surroundings were burned to the ground, crumbled and withered as if from immense heat. Naruto themselves even had a couple of slight burns that were rapidly fading away, healing themselves in moments.
Konohamaru used the Shunshin no Jutsu to quickly reach their oldest friend, chuckling at Naruto's misfortune. "Sorry for that," they said, though they did not really mean it.
"There's a smartass idiot in every batch," Naruto said in annoyance, turning to him, the last burn marks disappearing from the face. "You've disrupted my whole concentration now, so thanks for nothing. What did baa-chan want from me this time, then?"
"She's thinking of retiring, actually," Konohamaru answered, a smile twitching at the corners of their lips. "After the Chuunin exam ends."
Naruto blinked, nodding. "It was going to happen someday, I suppose. Who's going to be the Hokage, then?"
Konohamaru snickered. "Think about it, Naruto."
"You?" The blond man showed their tongue. "Aren't you a little short to be a Hokage?"
The younger Jounin frowned unhappily. "Guess again."
"Kakashi, then? They already got passed over once, with all the commotion back then. Gai-sensei was inconsolable after it turned out they had arranged a special suit for the occasion and they ever got to wear it..."
"God no!" Konohamaru exclaimed, shuddering. "You're making this entirely too difficult, you know. Who is the son of a Kage again? Who is a hero of the Fourth Shinobi War?"
"Gaara is the Kazekage, silly," Naruto said dryly. "Besides, can you even be a Kage of two different villages? That sounds like cheating to me."
Konohamaru was all but pulling their hair out of frustration. "You!" they shouted at Naruto. "She wants you to be the Hokage!"
"I know," Naruto said calmly.
"What?!"
Naruto smiled thinly. "I talked with them a couple of minutes ago. Well, a clone did, really. Baa-chan and I have been going over this for a while now. They figured I needed to know everything about leading a village before they made it official." They smiled. "You know, back when they first offered me lessons, I thought it was only so they could save them some paperwork by letting me slave away with my clones, but I guess I finally passed their mission, huh?"
Konohamaru crossed their arms. "You had to ruin my good news? I spent the last hour searching you throughout the training grounds!"
"I can play surprised, if you want me to." Naruto grinned, then, their eyes widened suddenly, and they clamped a hand over their mouth. "Me, the Hokage?! Konohamaru, do you understand just what this means?!" They flashed the tongue again. "I won our race! I am going to be the best Hokage in the history of - ever! Believe it!"
"Thank you for that," the Jounin said with a groan, rubbing their forehead. "You are a true friend."
"Rival," Naruto whispered conspiratorially, glancing around and bringing a finger to their mouth, hushing him. "The word you wanted to use was 'rival'."
"Yes, of course, how silly of me," Konohamaru waved them away. "Why don't we go celebrate your new position? I thought you'd like to visit Ichiraku's together, now that you can still go there without getting mobbed. I figured you'd be hungry, too."
"Maybe later," Naruto said, and smirked as Konohamaru widened their eyes at the refusal of ramen. "I'm busy, you see. Today, I'm going to finally use that technique." Naruto said it proudly. "The Hiraishin!"
Konohamaru looked suddenly bored. "You were saying that a year ago."
"No, I swear, this time I really got it," Naruto exclaimed, nodding eagerly. "I managed to decipher everything this time, I know it. It's too simple, really. I was spending so much attention on the space aspect that I forgot about time entirely."
"Mhm..." Konohamaru raised an eyebrow. "Which means...?"
"See, it's like this," Naruto put their hands together, then moved them outwards until there was a small distance between them. "Imagine that this is a road from here to Ichiraku's. Now, if you have to body flicker there..." For show, they made a small puff of smoke appear around their left hand, and they moved it quickly towards their right. "That saves a lot of time, but you still have to move through all the territory in between."
They moved the left hand back where it had been. "Now, if I had to use the Hiraishin, it works differently." Naruto summoned a clone right in front of him, mirroring their pose, so that their opposite hands were nearly touching. "It's more like I have to manipulate the distance, to bring the target closer." The clone wiggled the left hand's fingers and patted the right hand of the true Naruto. "In a sense, I wouldn't have moved more than a single step, but I will have crossed the whole distance anyway."
"I don't see how that helps you." Konohamaru frowned, rubbing their chin. "You mentioned something like this before."
Naruto nodded. "Ah, now here's a funny - and hardest part." They nodded to their clone, who got back in position. "I always kept forgetting time, that's why it didn't work. You see, I have to arrive just before I leave. You can't exist identically in two places at once, I can't even imagine what would happen if you managed it, and the future doesn't exist yet, that's obvious. So that leaves only one option."
The Naruto that was speaking disappeared in a puff of smoke, and the one Konohamaru had pegged as the clone smiled and waved with their left hand. "In essence, it's like using a body switch with a clone before you even begin the technique. The slight time difference between the arrival and the departure is undetectable, since it's so short, but it's necessary."
"And how do you go about doing all that?" Konohamaru asked. "The switching part, I mean?"
Naruto scratched the back of their head awkwardly. "It has to do with the structure of the seal itself. It took years to figure out, you know." They pointed at a tree that was a couple of meters away, where a three-pronged kunai with a seal tied around the handle was embedded into the thick oaken wood. "The seal helps you find a destination you are going to travel to. If it is drawn correctly, it's not actually there at any given moment, even when it may looklike it's there. It's sort of drawn to be forever delayed in time, rather than in the present. That's why I can't just jump there; I need to find the closest point in the past to use. But..."
"But?"
"Every time I try, there's some sort of resistance to it. I am trying to push through with ever increasing amount of chakra, but it's already getting to ridiculous levels. There's no way the Fourth used this much. To top it all off, the jutsu is disorienting, it's like I need to be in two places at once, and I feel like I'm everywhere and nowhere, and it is trying to tear me apart."
"And the burning thing?" Konohamaru pointed around them, to the signed earth. "How did that happen?"
Naruto shrugged. "Oh, that's just Kurama's chakra. I don't have enough concentration to try and search for the connection with the seal and simultaneously keep the chakra at safe levels. I mean, I probably could, but it would make the technique twice as hard, at the very least, and I can work on efficiency when I have the basics down. It is not like it actually does me any lasting harm."
Konohamaru nodded slowly. "Say, Naruto," they said, thinking. "You said that you feel a tearing apart - and the jutsu is supposed to move every single bit of you and everything you are carrying on yourself? Do I have that right?"
"Yeah?" Naruto looked hopeful. "Any brilliant ideas?"
"You said that you can't be in the two places at the same time earlier - but you are trying to? How many clones do you have running around right now, exactly?"
"A bunch. What does that have-" Naruto stopped mid sentence, eyes wide. "Oh - oh, you're a genius!" There was a loud echo of popping sounds all around the training ground, as a multitude of clones dispelled themselves. Naruto winced as they rubbed the side of their head. "Man, half of them decided to slack off on training..."
"It figures that youwould forget you're using a highly draining technique," Konohamaru observed with a smile, shaking their head. "Maybe if you're just you, it won't be such an issue to get this down. If this works, you owe me a lesson with the kids, understood?"
Naruto nodded, smiling. "Well, let's see then. You might want to step back a little, just in case." Naruto closed their eyes, and chakra began exuding from their pores, plainly visible power swirling around him. "This is going to be awesome! Believe it!"
Konohamaru hurried to clear away; when Naruto gave a warning like that, any sane shinobi would duck and cover like their life depended on it, because it probably did. Naruto did not do things by half.
There was a rush of chakra building up, and vicious tendrils of the Kyuubi's chakra lashed out at everything around the jinchuuriki, shredding skin and earth like paper, uncontrolled. To think that was only a slight remnant of the actual chakra being channeled, the true amount had to be gargantuan.
"Hiraishin no Jutsu!" Naruto exclaimed with a hoarse voice, and they vanished in an orange flash.

IN OTHER NEWS I'm doing a raffle in my store for TWO Intuos Pro Mediums for the next month!
Magic seal/halo is designed by God I posted so many drawings with wings in a row LOL OOPSI decided to change their lastname to Edeus instead of Edelez; there are so many things I want to change about my manga since I started it back when I was less skilled and made lots of questionable decisions, but their lastname is actually something I can afford change so I figured I should do it now before it gets mentioned too many times HAHA...Using vibrant colours and decent amounts of contrast have always been really hard for me, so I've been trying to overcome it in my recent drawings. Not to say that high saturation is highway to success (most of the time it is) but I would like to have the ability to do this should I choose to. The latest few drawings have been my testing ground!! But I have a feeling that for future pieces that have a lot of personal importance, they'll still have the sombre tone that I use so much.I've been also spending a lot of time in my recent pieces ever since I started to really try to let go of linework in my finished drawings. I'm pretty happy about what painting without lines enables me to do, and it feels a lot better now than my previous attempts are painting many years ago. I like some of the details on this picture came out, but the summoned birds and spirits are kind of a downer because I couldn't really get them to look the way I would've liked them to look. I meant for the lighting to be very soft in the beginning with the spirits basically blending into the background that was supposed to be light, but clearly things took a drastic turn somewhere because LOL THIS IS PRETTY DRAMATIC FOR ME... and the summoned spirits became a nuisance rather than something that united the foreground with the backgroundKeritzel is a character from my manga, carciphona.com , although he's actually immensely ordinary in the storycheck shilin.storenvy.com/2014raffle for details____________________________________Read Carciphona, my original manga series!Other art by me
In 1965, Bob Dylan polarised audiences after transitioning from traditional folk music to incorporating the use of the electric guitar. Some fans went so far as to label them “a traitor”, and Dylan has maintained their disgust towards such opinions to this day.
In more recent times, American rock band Kings of Leon have endured a similar betrayal by many fans since abandoning their raw, indie garage origins for more polished, conventional and radio-friendly anthems.
Having just released their latest studio album WALLS last week, this list attempts to rank all seven full-length releases in order of overall greatness; an endeavour bound to stir some controversy between fans and critics alike.
7. Come Around Sundown, 2010
The Kings' were clearly at a crossroads at the release of their fifth album, Come Around Sundown, and it was no secret that this could be the end (a lyric repeated persistently in the album's opening track). The band would later cancel the remainder of their world tour the next year, lead singer Caleb Followill citing “vocal issues and exhaustion”, and the latter is reflected in the laid-back album which does at times begins to sound a little tired itself.
That said, the mellowed record is not without some highlights of its own, and singles ‘Radioactive' and ‘Pyro' provide the sun-drenched atmosphere that the album cover's imagery suggests and lingers delightfully throughout, until the heartening closer ‘Pickup Truck'.
Lead Single: ‘Radioactive'
Underrated Gem: ‘Pickup Truck'
6. Mechanical Bull, 2013
After a short hiatus and three years since the release of their previous album, the Followill Four returned boldly to the scene of their crimes with the unashamedly marketable arena anthem ‘Supersoaker'.
However, the single that followed titled ‘Wait for Me', which could easily slip undetected into the tracklist of Come Around Sundown, risks revealing the patchwork collection of songs that is Mechanical Bull. Yet, the album's indisputable highlight comes with the propulsive ‘Temple', which singlehandedly reinvigorated the Kings and breathes a new life back into the album.
After the funky-blues of ‘Family Tree', the album does tend to taper away into some less memorable tracks, and after the relaxed nature of the previous album perhaps should have pulled a few less punches, but nonetheless, it was a step back in the right direction for a band who nearly threw it all away.
Lead Single: ‘Supersoaker'
Underrated Gem: ‘Rock City'
5. Youth & Young Manhood, 2003
Released to generally favourable reviews, Kings of Leon's often overlooked debut was hailed by many as a revival of punk and garage-rock in a musical landscape that had been dominated by pop since the beginning of the new millennium.
The album, which was primarily recorded at Sound City Studios, is wild and uncultivated, much like the band's hairstyles of the time, and the frenzied scramble of frantic rhythms soon earned them the affectionate nickname “The Southern Strokes”.
Incorporating tracks taken from across two previously released EPs from earlier that year, Youth & Young Manhood's downfall is its noticeable lack of diversity, which would have been even more evident if it wasn't for a deliberate attempt to break up the album with the ballads ‘Trani', written by lead guitarist Matthew Followill, and the penultimate track ‘Dusty'.
Lead Single: ‘Molly's Chambers'
Underrated Gem: ‘Red Morning Light'
4. WALLS (We Are Like Love Songs), 2016
When the walls came down on KOL's seventh studio album last week, four of its ten tracks had already been made available as pre-order/singles. Following the formula of their previous album Mechanical Bull, WALLS also opens with a ‘Supersoaker'-esque anthem in ‘Waste a Moment'; the album's first track that also serves as its radio-made lead single.
Although it's certainly not Kings of Leon's greatest album to date, it's by far their most cohesive in years, and evidently reflects the band are finally confident and at peace with their new musical direction, even if some of their listeners are not.
It's far from being lyrically or musically complex, but then, they never really have been. WALLS is easy listening and impossible not to enjoy in some capacity, but if you've hated everything that's come since Only By the Night arrived back in 2008, this one is still unlikely to win you back over.
Lead Single: ‘Waste a Moment'
Underrated Gem: ‘Over'
3. Because of the Times, 2007
The beginning of the end, according to some listeners.
Hints of the band's shift into the dreaded un-exhumable trench of pop-rock were undeniably evident in Because of the Times even before Only By the Night hit just one year later. Songs such as the lead single ‘On Call' and ‘Black Thumbnail' still sound vaguely familiar to the Kings of Leon of old, but by now the band have evolved from their scruffy unbridled origins, shedding their untamed locks and simultaneously developing a more styled and shiny image and sound.
The cinematic opener ‘Knocked Up' sets the stage for an album enveloped by a single narrative that's obviously influenced by the likes of U2, Pearl Jam and Bob Dylan himself, all of whom the band had recently supported on tour. Though ‘Charmer' seems to take more cues from Nirvana, with its explosive shifts in dynamic.
While overall, Because of the Times may be considered one of the band's strongest records, it perhaps lacks a memorable track of its own; something of the calibre of ‘Molly's Chambers', ‘The Bucket' or, heaven forbid ‘Sex on Fire', to cement it as a certified success.
Lead Single: ‘On Call'
Underrated Gem: ‘Ragoo'
2. Only By the Night, 2008
The Judas Kiss. Only By the Night launched Kings of Leon into global mainstream success, thanks largely to its infamous single ‘Sex on Fire', which was followed up by another huge hit in ‘Use Somebody', eventually going on to spawn six singles in total. Scorned by fans who believed the band were selling out, the much maligned album begins as a bold, but promising change in both trend and popularity.
Lesser-known but likely excessive singles ‘Notion', ‘Revelry' and ‘Crawl', are all exceptional contributions, and ‘Be Somebody' dreams of something more for the band who were about to have it all.
Where Because of the Times seemed confused with its new direction, Only By the Night is crafted with assured confidence and maintains its promise of delivering a different take on the much loved four pieces from Tennessee. It's that once unshakable self-assuredness they would lose for almost a decade, but thankfully is finally returning again.
Lead Single: ‘Sex on Fire'
Underrated Gem: ‘Closer'
1. Aha Shake Heartbreak, 2004
What Kings of Leon managed to do so well with their sophomore release was to directly follow on from their strong debut, while also correcting many of its perceived flaws.
What Youth & Young Manhood lacked in diversity, Aha Shake Heartbreak delivers in spades. Riddled with the catchy guitar hooks and infectious choruses the band would soon become known for, the record explores the natural variations in altering tempos and dynamics which had been largely absent from their debut.
Despite these disparities and amongst the added sophisticated flair, the album still managed to retain the youthful, raw tenacity its predecessor had offered, demonstrated in tracks such as ‘Taper Jean Girl' and ‘Velvet Snow'. To this day, the album remains a firm favourite amongst rock and indie fans and typifies the vigorous, carefree essence so many crave the band to return to.
Lead Single: ‘The Bucket'
Underrated Gem: ‘Milk'
A lesbian couple known only by their initials lived together in Hoover, Alabama, from 1995 until 2011. During that time, E.L. had three children through “assisted reproductive technology.” That meant E.L. was the legal parent under Alabama law; V.L. was not. In 2006, they temporarily moved to Georgia, where a state court permitted V.L., with E.L.'s consent, to become an adopted parent to the children. They then returned to Alabama.
By 2011, however, the couple split up. E.L. kept the children, and V.L. filed suit in an Alabama court asking for visitation rights, citing the Georgia adoption. E.L. fought back by arguing a variety of points, including that the Georgia same-sex adoption violated Alabama's “public policy” (a code phrase for its constitutional amendment specifying that any “union replicating marriage of or between persons of the same sex . . . in any other jurisdiction shall be considered and treated in all respects as having no legal force or effect in this state”). Two lower courts rejected that argument; but the state supreme court issued a tricky ruling. It did not address the validity of same-sex families; instead, it held that Alabama courts were not obligated to respect the Georgia adoption.
This is usually a pretty big no-no under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that “[f]ull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.” A divorce, or an adoption, or any other judicial act in State A is almost always binding on State B. It's something that the courts have felt pretty strongly about since roughly 1789. The only real exception would be if the first state court had no “jurisdiction” over the case.
“Jurisdiction” stems from the Latin words for “saying the law.” A court must have the power to “say the law” in any given case—by which is meant that it must have legal power, first, over the parties to the case (“personal jurisdiction”) and, second, over the kind of case (“subject-matter jurisdiction”).
I may want to sue my next-door neighbor in federal court for, let's say, violation of Paraguayan intellectual-property law. The U.S. federal court won't have subject matter jurisdiction, because (1) no statute puts it in charge of matters Paraguayan and (2) the parties are both citizens of the District of Columbia, meaning there's no “diversity.” Fine. I jet off to Asunción and file suit in Paraguayan civil court. That court would have subject-matter jurisdiction, meaning it could hear the case; but it wouldn't have personal jurisdiction over my neighbor; Paraguayan courts have no power to issue a summons to someone in D.C.
In V.L. v. E.L., the Alabama court engaged in some fancy footwork to determine that the Georgia court never could have heard the case. The argument went like this: Under Georgia law, the Georgia court was supposed to obtain a formal surrender of parental rights from E.L. before allowing V.L. to adopt; it didn't (because E.L. was asking it to allow the adoption, and anyway Georgia law is unclear). Because it was supposed to get the surrender first, the adoption was invalid.
Just when the sun was looking especially lethargic, a violent eruption left behind a vast chasm of superheated gas on the solar surface. On September 29–30, a searing filament of charged particles blasted away from the sun at more than 3 million kilometers per hour. The event left behind a scar that marks where the filament escaped into space. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image by combining two different wavelength views. Yellow highlights plasma moving along the sun's magnetic fields, and red-orange helps highlight the sun's plasma at 50,000° Celsius.
The prominent pockmark caught astronomers' attention because, for the most part, the sun has been unexpectedly quiet in the peak year of its 11-year solar cycle. In fact, the sun is on track to have its quietest peak year since the early 1900s (SN: 11/2/13, p. 22). Still, what NASA has dubbed the Canyon
This week marked a turning part in the Black Lives Matter movement. Since bursting onto the national scene after the shooting death of Mike Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, last year, the movement's leaders have called for a systemic overhaul of America's criminal justice system. They have also emphatically encouraged using the phrase Black Lives Matter, and no variations. The rationale: Yes, all lives matter, but black lives are under siege, and specifying their importance doesn't erase that of any others.
This week, however, a twist on that phrase lit up social media, in the form of #BlackTransLivesMatter, with the full support of the movement's organizers and cofounders. On Tuesday, a national day of action took place in more than 20 cities across the country calling for an end to the record number of black transgender women who've been killed in recent years. In the past two years alone, more than 25 trans women of color have been killed, and one of the leading causes of their deaths is intimate partner violence.

For organizers, it was important to put the movement's spotlight on "trans community that's historically been erased," Elle Hearns, a longtime #BlackLivesMatter organizer who is also a transgender black woman, told Mic.
For the black transgender women who have long been a vital part of the movement, this week's call to action was a chance to ask their cisgender allies for examples of true solidarity.
"We wanted to show that it's not just trans women are outraged, and that cisgender people confront the ways that they're complicit in transphobia," Hearns says. "We wanted folks to really commit to what they were gonna do following the action."
This is what that solidarity looks like:

An epidemic of violence. This week, Keyshia Blige, a 33-year-old in Aurora, Illinois, became the 19th reported black transgender woman to be killed so far this year. Though they were killed in March, they were been only identified publicly this week. Them death spurred yet another call to action by black trans women and their allies to interrupt a deadly culture of violence that they say starts with refusing to acknowledge these women's lives.
"The goal really was to see what kind of commitment folks were making," Hearns said of this week's actions. "We need people to commit to something beyond this moment."
This is... interesting. Microsoft has found a great way to get your money for new and old content, and you better pay up if you want to keep playing with the big boys in Gears of War 2. The company is releasing a retail package that includes all the previous map packs for the title, as well as seven new maps and a new campaign mission that features an all new "stealth mode." The package is called the Fronts Collection, will be sold at retail for $20, and is a great deal for people who want to get caught up with all the downloadable content and be up to date with long-time players.
After the jump, we'll describe all the new maps, as well as tell you how MS is going to royally annoy long-time fans of the game.
Here are the new maps:
Allfathers Garden : Honor the sacred grounds of the Coalition founders in this explosive map, where powerful weapons catalyze fast and furious action at this COG landmark.

Memoria l: Set near the Eternal Flame, which pays tribute to the fallen soldiers on the battlefield, a hard-fought battle ensues at the Tomb of Unknowns. Putting their flank formation and evasive skills to the test, players will fight to control the Boomshot.

Putting their flank formation and evasive skills to the test, players will fight to control the Boomshot. Sanctuary : Once a peaceful ground for reflection and remembrance, all that remains of the Sanctuary is the chill of death. Feast your eyes on the arsenal of weapons available as you make your way through the tight paths and blind corners of the Locust-damaged temple corridors.

Highway : Take the fight deep into the Locust Hollow in the complex passages of this underground highway system brimming with enemy vermin. Stick together, separate the enemy and have an exit strategy ready or it'll be a one-way trip.

Stick together, separate the enemy and have an exit strategy ready or it'll be a one-way trip. Way Station : Sitting in limbo between death and “processing” are Locust way stations filled with fallen COG soldiers. Tread lightly and practice patience as it's better to sacrifice firepower for stealth while navigating this minefield of hidden grenades.

Tread lightly and practice patience as it's better to sacrifice firepower for stealth while navigating this minefield of hidden grenades. Nowhere: Set in the middle of what was once a destination for weary desert travellers, the land is now barren and devoid of life. Pick off your enemies with the Longshot sniper rifle and make your way to the stairwell with a well-fortified team during this intense firefight.
So the package will contain those seven maps, plus the “Flashback” Map Pack, “Combustible” Map Pack, and the winter-themed “Snowblind” Map Pack. You also get a poster, strategy guide, an Xbox Live theme, and a new video with Cliffy-B. So your $20 is well spent, looking at everything you get in the retail package.
But what happens if you already own all the previous map packs? The "Dark Corners" map pack with the seven new maps and campaign chapter will be available as a download through Xbox Live. The price? 1600 points, or $20. Yup, no matter how you buy it, you're paying for the old map packs.
I don't know what the thought process behind this pricing could be, but man, that seems greedy. That's $2.85 a map, approximately. No poster for you, either.
The retail package is a find if you're playing catch-up with all the older maps, but everyone else is getting scammed. Both the download and the retail product will be available for purchase on July 28 for $19.99.

PHOENIX (AP) — Police are searching for a 70-year-old man suspected in a Phoenix office shooting that left one dead and two wounded, saying that they are "armed and dangerous."
Police identified the suspect as Arthur D. Harmon. They identified a man who died hours after the Wednesday morning shooting as 48-year-old Steve Singer.
Police say a 43-year-old man was listed in critical condition along with a 32-year-old woman.
Police didn't release the names of the wounded, but a Phoenix law firm, Osborn Maledon, said one of its lawyers, Mark Hummels, was among the wounded.
The firm said they "was representing a client in a mediation" when they were shot.
As police searched for the shooter, SWAT teams and two armored vehicles surrounded their house about 7 miles from the shooting scene. Police served a search warrant to enter the home.
For a time, officers, believing the shooter was inside, used a megaphone to ask them to surrender.
The gunfire at the office complex prompted terrified workers to lock the doors to their offices and hide far from the windows. SWAT officers searched the building.
"Everyone was just scared, honestly, just scared," said Navika Sood, assistant director of nursing at First at Home Health Services who along with their co-workers locked the entrances to their office.
Sood said police evacuated the office about 30 minutes after they first heard the popping noises.
The shooting took place on the same day that hearings on legislation to address gun violence were convened in Washington, with former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords testifying for stricter gun controls.
A gunman shot Giffords in the head during a shooting rampage in Tucson in January 2011.
Around 10:30 a.m., the gunman arrived at the office building and got into a dispute with someone, a conflict that escalated to the point where they drew a gun and shot three people, Thompson said.
Vanessa Brogan, who works in sales support at an insurance business in the three-story complex, said they heard a loud bang that they thought at first was from somebody working in or near the building.
They said others at the business thought they heard multiple loud noises. They said people locked themselves in offices until authorities evacuated the complex that houses insurance, medical and law offices.
Becky Neher, who works for a title company in the building, said the two gunshots they heard sounded like two pieces of metal banging against each other.
Watching from their second-story office, they saw people leaving the building.
"Someone yelled, 'We have a shooter,'" they said. They saw two victims lying on the ground outside the back side of the building. They said health care workers who have offices in the complex came out to help.
Don Jaksa, a software consultant who works in the building, said they were listening to the radio when they suddenly heard "two pops." They said they didn't think they were gunshots.
"My co-worker goes to the range all the time," they said. "He identified it as gunfire."
Their co-worker then locked the door. After five minutes, they left and ran into police and someone carrying a stretcher. The police escorted them back to their office and told them to lock the door again.
They were eventually evacuated, and as they sat on a rock outside the complex, their wife called to make sure they were OK after seeing the shooting on the news.
Workers were later allowed to leave the building. Two hugged each other when they got outside.
"You don't expect this when you come to work," worker Lindsa Rincon said.

About
Hello everyone. My name is John, and I am happy to announce my first-ever Kickstarter project!
Niwa Niwa is a traditional-style board game inspired by Japanese culture and the game of Pai Sho as seen in the popular anime TV series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Gameplay is based on the ancient eastern practice of flower arranging as well as the 4-elements system of fire, water, earth, and wind. In other words, Niwa Niwa is a fun and unique strategy board game that I hope you will enjoy!
The purpose of this Kickstarter project is to raise enough money to get this game produced and ready for sale. Fairly straightforward. The money will be used to pay for things like production costs, shipping costs, processing fees, and artist commission. The company that will be making the game is Panda Game Manufacturing.
Niwa Niwa Game Board
The Story of Niwa Niwa
The story of Niwa Niwa actually started a few years ago when I wanted to buy a Pai Sho set. It looked like a pretty neat game in Avatar, and I figured someone somewhere had surely turned it into a real game. Unfortunately Nickelodeon owned the rights, and had not yet turned it into a product that people could buy. Weird, right? But I did find that some people had gotten together and made their own Pai Sho sets, and even come up with ways you could play it.
Still, you couldn't buy it anywhere (legally). So I got the crazy idea that maybe I could make a game that was similar to Pai Sho, but that people could actually go online and purchase. I took that idea and played around with it for a while, and finally got to where I am now, ready to present Niwa Niwa to the public!
Some of you may be wondering why the game is called "Niwa Niwa." And if not, I'll tell you anyway. In Japanese, "niwa" can mean several things depending on the particular kanji used and the context it is used in. Niwa can mean "garden," it can mean "two of," and it can also mean "inside." So the saying "two birds in a garden" is translated as "庭には二羽鳥が居る" or "niwa niwa niwa tori ga iru." But since when does a board game have such a long title? Therefore, Niwa Niwa!
Game Pieces (converted vector rendering)
So what kind of game is Niwa Niwa, anyway?
Niwa Niwa is a two-player game for human beings who have been alive for at least 13 years. It plays similarly to the classic games of Chess and Go. A standard game takes anywhere from 15-45 minutes to play, depending on how familiar both players are with the game and how careful they are with their tiles. The estimated retail price immediately following the Kickstarter launch is $30 + shipping and handling, and sales are expected to take place online.
Each player begins the game with half of the tiles, which are color-coded (brown and blue) to indicate which player they belong to. Players take turns placing tiles on the board, and earn points by creating flower arrangements with their tiles. Bird and element tiles add an extra level of strategy to the game, allowing players to engage in all manner of shifts, blocks, captures, and other such board game rambunctiousness. Forming a chain of arrangements around the center in Niwa Niwa is a lot like capturing the Golden Snitch in Quidditch, ending the game and giving bonus points to whichever player accomplishes it.
I know, I know, flower arranging can seem kinda lame. But if a bunch of really cool old characters from Avatar can enjoy a board game centered around it, and even create a secret order based on the lotus flower, then surely you can too! Er, enjoy the board game, that is. Secret orders are totally optional.
Each Niwa Niwa set comes with the following:
Niwa Niwa Game Board
Rulebook
1 Reference Card
12 Lotus Tiles
12 Lily Tiles
12 Cherry Blossom Tiles
12 Peony Tiles
12 Rose Tiles
12 Chrysanthemum Tiles
6 Fire Tiles
6 Wind Tiles
6 Water Tiles
6 Earth Tiles
6 Dove Tiles
6 Crow Tiles
All tiles will be 25 x 3 mm wooden cylinders. I wanted to make sure the pieces really had substance to them, and not just made out of cardboard. The board will be 1/4-fold 157gsm art paper with double sided matte pp lamination (approximately 20" x 20").
$30,000 - Yang on a Second
If we reach the stretch goal of $30,000 we will add 4 new tiles to every set of Niwa Niwa! They will be: Yin, Yang, Dragon, and Tiger.
$35,000 - King Kung Fu
If we reach $35,000 we will add yet another 4 tiles to every set of Niwa Niwa: Monkey, Crane, Snake, and Mantis.
Élan School was a private, coeducational, controversial residential behavior modification program and therapeutic boarding school (beginning with 8th grade and extending beyond high school completion) in Poland, Androscoggin County, Maine. It was a full member of the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (NATSAP).
Élan was located on a 33-acre (13 ha) campus[1] that was formerly a hunting lodge.[2]
The school acquired some notoriety during the 1990s and early 2000s when former classmates of Michael Skakel, who had attended Élan in the 1970s, testified against them in their trial for an unsolved murder that had occurred about two years before they enrolled at Élan.[3] The school was also the subject of persistent allegations of abuse in their behavioral modification program.[4][5]
On March 23, 2011, Élan School announced it would be closing its doors on April 1, 2011.[6]
History [ edit ]
Élan School was founded in 1970 by psychiatrist Gerald Davidson, investor David Goldberg, and Joseph Ricci, a college drop-out. Ricci headed the school until their death in 2001, when their widow Sharon Terry took over.[7][8] Maine politician Bill Diamond served as its Director of Governmental Relations.[9]
Program [ edit ]
The school specialized in treating teenagers with behavioral problems. In the program, 'humiliation' was stated clearly as a therapeutic tool, as is following up on such intervention with encouragement and warm support. Students attended year-round.[10] In 2002, a New Jersey educational consultant who had referred students to Élan for 22 years told the New York Times that they would refer only "the most serious cases" to the school, which they said would "take kids who haven't responded to other programs and who are really out of control."[8]
The school's treatment methods were based on the "TC" or therapeutic community modality popularized in the 1960s at facilities such as Synanon, and later at Daytop Village.[11]
In 2002, a New Jersey educational consultant told the New York Times that the school was "certainly not for the faint-hearted." They said "There's lots of confrontation," but added "and yet there are lots of hugs."[8]
Controversy [ edit ]
Throughout its history, the school was faced with numerous allegations of student maltreatment. In 2001, Details Magazine cited Élan as "among the most controversial of the nation's residential therapeutic communities."[12]
In 1975, Illinois state officials pulled out Mark Babitz, one of 11 children removed from the Élan program, alleging mistreatment.[1]
In 2002 during the trial of Michael Skakel, witnesses testified that beatings and public humiliation were parts of life at Élan during the late 1970s.[1] In trial testimony, former students also described the practice of placing a student in a "boxing ring" surrounded by classmates who confronted the student.[13][14] The New York Times has reported that, at the school, "smiling without permission can lead to a session of cleaning urinals with a toothbrush that can last for hours."[15]
The New York State Education Department, which has paid tuition for special education students to attend Élan School, gave the school a favorable review in 2005.[16] In 2007, however, New York education officials raised questions about the school's practices, alleging in a letter to the school and Maine education officials that Élan students were physically restraining their peers and being deprived of sleep. The allegations prompted the state of New York to threaten to withdraw tuition money for taxpayer-funded students. The school's lawyer contested the allegations.[1]
In March 2016, Mark Babitz of Elan Survivors Inc contacted the Maine State Police who announced they had opened a cold case investigation into the death of former Élan resident Phil Williams, who died Dec. 27th, 1982 after participating in Élan's brutal "ring" where students were forced to fight each other as a means of behavior modification.[17][18][19]
Closure [ edit ]
On March 23, 2011, Élan School announced it would be closing its doors on April 1, 2011. The school's owner, Sharon Terry, blamed negative attacks on the school via the Internet. In a letter to the Lewiston Sun-Journal, Terry said: “The school has been the target of harsh and false attacks spread over the Internet with the avowed purpose of forcing the school to close." They added that, despite numerous investigations by the Maine Department of Education that vindicated Élan, “the school has, unfortunately, been unable to survive the damage.”[6]
Film [ edit ]
Élan was featured in Children of Darkness, a critically acclaimed documentary filmed in 1983 that explored the grueling realities of emotionally troubled youth and the various residences and institutions that housed them.
A documentary chronicling the school's history and impact titled "The Last Stop" was released in 2017. The film was directed by an Élan graduate and included interviews from various residents and professionals including Maia Szalavitz.[20][21]
Notable alumni [ edit ]
Michael Skakel Convicted in the murder of Martha Moxley. The case drew media attention largely because Skakel is related to the Kennedys. [3]

When you think about robots and Japan, you're likely to imagine large, incredibly life-like androids that emulate humans in every way, or shiny metallic mechanical butlers that fulfil your every whim.
But what if robots were instead made from plastic, fitted into your pocket or backpack, and were able to take the place of your smartphone or tablet? This is the future that professor Tomotaka Takahashi, the CEO of Robo Garage, dreams about.
Alongside their work as a robotics scientist researching the use of robots in communication at the University of Tokyo, Takahashi has invented almost 40 different types of robots since they began researching them in 1999.
"It started as my fun personal hobby, but now it has become a business. Some of my robots are art, designed to showcase the future possibilities of having robots live with us, but other robots have become products for regular consumers," Takahashi told IBTimes UK at the Hyper Japan event in London.
Robi
One of their robots, Robi, a 34cm-tall gadget that resembles manga/film character Astro Boy, can understand over 200 commands, such as requests for it to dance, sing, do push-ups or even remotely control a TV.
The robot comes with voice recognition technology and has a set vocabulary that enables it to respond to questions posed to it or to reply correctly in social situations, such as "No problem," when someone says, "thank you".
Comprising of 20 motorised parts, Robi is sold to robot enthusiasts as a weekly subscription magazine model kit. Consumers have to purchase all 70 issues in order to slowly put the robot together by themselves.
According to partwork publisher De Agostini UK, the total cost of the robot comes to £895.30. Over 100,000 units of the product been sold so far in Japan and over 30% of the collectors are female.
Takahashi does not think that robot butlers who can do every single task will be feasible, but supports the theory posed by some in the robotics industry that humans will one day have a collection of different robots which each specialise in completing a specific task.
In addition to Robi, last year the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), sent another of Takahashi's creations, Kirobo, to the International Space Station to conduct a communications experiment with Japanese astronauts.
Not machines or humans
"I don't see robots as being machines or human beings, but something in between, something cute and useful. The next generation of robots will be used as an information device like a smartphone. Smartphones already remotely control appliances and interface between humans and information," says Takahashi.
"Smartphones already have voice recognition technology but it is not used much as people are not comfortable talking to a grey black box. If it had a human shape, we would be willing to talk to it.
"In five years, robots will be as small as smartphones, becoming like a Tinker Bell or Jiminy Cricket that you can put in your pocket.
"Smartphone growth is now slowing down and people want to find something to be the next smartphone. I am now designing a robot to be the next communication device. It will be able to talk like a phone. It can move, but it will also have a touch screen and act like a small computer."

Introduction
Nerf blasters have been a favorite toy since their introduction in the late 1980s. Once simple toys, these machines have evolved into manual as well as battery-operated, accessory-laden, belt and clip-fed behemoths. Communities have grown around painting and/or modifying (“modding”) these blasters to shoot further or more accurately, and it is now possible to purchase aftermarket internal parts as well.
The Nerf blaster lineup provides a variety of firing mechanisms, each presenting different characteristics for rate of fire, accuracy, distance, and modding potential. For example, the older Longshot used a “direct” plunger system which provided greater ranges than the “reverse” plunger found on recent blasters. Battery-operated flywheel-based blasters such as the Rayven provide for high rates of fire, but may suffer in accuracy and distance (unless modified by increasing the voltage used).
Presumably in an effort to please the more serious Nerfing community, Nerf has introduced a line of blasters labeled the “N-Strike Elite” series, which returns to the direct-plunger system and includes a new dart type (colored blue, unlike previous orange and white darts), sporting an advertised range of 75 feet. While several have speculated that the new dart design contributes to the increased ranges and anecdotal evidence supports this, it is difficult to find a true difference between the new and old dart types. Further, while many reviews of nerf blasters and modifications test range and accuracy, these tests frequently lack scientific rigor.
This study attempts to address these shortfalls by comparing both dart accuracy and range across modified and unmodified blasters. While the new Elite blasters have not yet been released in stores accessible to the authors of this work, we have secured an accessory pack of Elite darts for comparison to older dart types (orange and white). Further, we compare accuracy and distance for four firing/blaster types in a 3x4 design.
Experimental Design
In order to test both accuracy and distance for blaster/dart combinations in an efficient, controlled, and repeatable manner, we designed a range in which darts could be fired at a sliding glass door marked with a grid annotating the x and y-coordinates of each hit. Before each round of firing, dart tips were marked with liquid eyeliner which reliably marked their hit location on the door. To ensure repeatability and comparability of shots between blasters, a small level was attached to a wall aligned with the door approximately 19 feet away. The level was placed at a height of 64 inches. During firing, each blaster's top rail was held flush against both the wall and the level.
Each of the four blasters was fired 50 times using each of the three dart types. Because the blasters were fired at level from a known height, we can compare firing distance as drop in inches from the 64 inch point on the grid. Comparing accuracy of each shot required some adjustment: because of differences between blasters, we are interested in the repeatability of shots rather than their absolute location. Thus, for each blaster/dart combination, we considered the median x and y-location of the grouping to to be central location of the group, and computed the Euclidean distance from this group center for each individual shot. Thus, each shot was scored with a drop (in inches) and accuracy (in inches), which were to be minimized.
We tested four blasters: the battery-operated flywheel-based Nerf Rayven* modified to accept either 4 AA batteries or a single 9v battery, and the reverse-plunger Nerf Recon* in both stock and modified forms (sans barrel attachments). The modifications on the Recon (aside from painting) included a basic air-restrictor removal and plunger-spring stretch*. It should be noted that all darts were in nearly new or gently used state: blue Elite and older-style orange darts were new from packaging (but cycled through each blaster a few times to wear them in) and white darts were similarly well-cared for (but not purchased for the purposes of this experiment).
Results: Overview
Figure 4 shows the shot groupings organized by dart and blaster type. Red points indicate group centers, and transparent red circles enclose the 50% most accurate shots for each grouping. Immediately we see some interesting patterns: for example, blue darts do indeed seem to be suffering from less drop, particularly for the Recon and modified Recon.
Figure 5 shows these same shots grouped by blaster, with points colored by dart type. The modified Recon appears to shoot the furthest, and is overall quite accurate.
Figures 6 and 7 show distributions of drop and accuracy for dart and blaster types, smoothed with kernel density estimates. Again we see interesting differences between different darts and blasters; the statistical analyses of the next section will bear these out.
Results: Statistical Analysis
We analyzed both the drop and accuracy data using a 2x3 Analysis of Variance approach. For drop, we found significant (p < 0.05) main effects in both blaster and dart type, as well as in the interaction. Tukey's post-hoc test revealed that the modified Recon suffered less drop than all three other blasters, and that the modified Rayven shot higher than the unmodified versions of both the Rayven and Recon; we also found that Elite darts shot higher than both orange and white darts (p < 0.05) though we did not see a difference between orange and white darts at a 0.05 level, possibly due to sample size (p = 0.08). Figure 8 is a traditional line plot showing average drop for each dart and blaster combination.
Figure 9 shows a transitively-reduced graph for which blaster and dart combinations suffered significantly less drop than others in the post-hoc test (an arrow or path from combination A to combination B signifies A dropped less than B, p < 0.05). As we discovered by main effect, blue Elite darts were predominantly better: in no case was a blaster better with orange or white darts than Elite darts. Both the Recon and Rayven showed significant improvements in distance with modification.
Figures 10 and 11 show average accuracies by blaster and dart and a similar comparison of statistically significant combination differences (p < 0.05). Here we see that the modified Recon was easily the most accurate blaster; when shooting Elite darts it bested all other combinations except for itself with white or orange darts (which themselves bested the modified Rayven shooting Elite darts, the least accurate combination). ANOVA for this test revealed significant effects in the main effect of blaster only: accuracy differences between darts were not found.
Discussion
Our experimental design appears to have been more than adequate in revealing differences between dart types, blasters, and the effects of blaster modification on drop and accuracy. Our results indicate that, overall, Elite darts do afford less drop over the distances tested, but not necessarily more accuracy. In fact, the modified Rayven with Elite darts proved to be the most inaccurate combination. On the other hand, the modified Recon (the most accurate blaster overall by far) improved in accuracy with white darts and suffered less drop with Elite darts. Although we do not have an Elite blaster to test with currently, this bodes well for accuracy with that line (which presumably would be most similar to the modified Recon we tested with).
We also saw the greatest distance improvement with the modified and unmodified Recons using Elite darts (8 inches less drop on average, over a level shooting distance of 19 feet), while the Rayven showed modest improvement (3.5 inches). Both blasters showed a significant improvement in distance with modification, and presumably higher voltage modifications would result in continually lower drops but result in perhaps worse accuracy as well.
This study suggests several possibilities for future research. Obviously, it would be very interesting to consider the new Elite blasters themselves, both in stock and modified form. For these longer-range blasters, it may be necessary to increase the distance to the measuring grid to help with discriminating between blasters with minimal drop. Anecdotally, we believe that accuracy issues for the modified Rayven could be alleviated with the use a barrel attachment while suffering minimal loss in distance.
One variable we did not consider in these tests were misfires: firings where the dart would spin out of control or the blaster would jam. We felt that we observed differential rates of misfires for darts and blasters (for example, it appears that the modified Recon is more prone to jamming with Elite darts, and the modified Rayven is more prone to misfires overall), however we did not record these data. Finally, although we constructed an accurate and repeatable measure of distance (as inches in drop on the measurement grid), we do not know how these drop amounts relate to distance-on-the-ground due to the often erratic nature of nerf dart flight. Constructing a predictive model mapping drop inches to distance in feet might prove useful.
Conclusion
When I was a child, I once bought a Nerf blaster that promptly broke. My parents urged me to contact Hasbro and complain. I did so, and the company was nice enough to compensate me with a box containing a half dozen or more Nerf blasters.
Main conclusion: Nerf is Awesome.
Some time after the previous tests were run, we obtained a nerf retaliator, one of the new direct-plunger nerf blasters from the “Elite” line:
While the nerf retaliator is a more powerful blaster designed to work with the blue elite darts, it also features something new to the nerf line: a “rifled” barrel attachment:
While the retaliator barrel is not “rifled” in the traditional sense (where the rifling is in contact with the projectile throughout its journey down the barrel, imparting an unavoidable spin on the projectile), it stands to reason that the engineers at Hasbro would not add such a non-visible feature without reason. Still, it has been debated whether rifling of any kind is beneficial for the flight of nerf darts (see for example Rifling: Helpful, harmful, or ineffective?).
Fortunately, our experimental design can answer this question emprically. We tested a stock Retaliator blaster body with elite darts, using three different barrel configurations: 1) Using the “rifled” retaliator barrel attachment, 2) using the non-rifled Recon barrel attachment, and 3) using no barrel attachment. Here are the raw shot-placements:
hese results are clear visually: the “rifled” Retaliator barrel is more accurate than the unrifled Recon barrel, which is in turn more accurate than the absense of a barrel attachment. Further, both barrel attachments showed less drop than the lack of an attachment, which may be considered a surprising result. These results are also supported statistically: Tukey's post-hoc analysis supports the accuracy differences for all three barrel types as well as the distance differences at a p < 0.01 level:
Fit: aov(formula = drop ~ blaster, data = barreldata) p adj retaliator_barrel-retaliator_reconbarrel 0.997789 retaliator_nobarrel-retaliator_reconbarrel 0.000000 retaliator_nobarrel-retaliator_barrel 0.000000 Fit: aov(formula = accuracy_median ~ blaster, data = barreldata) p adj retaliator_reconbarrel-retaliator_barrel 0.0093151 retaliator_nobarrel-retaliator_barrel 0.0000000 retaliator_nobarrel-retaliator_reconbarrel 0.0005961
So, why might the Retaliator barrel be more accurate than the Recon barrel? Although the manufacture of these barrel attachments appears to be very similar, we cannot rule out factors such as the type of plastic used or manufacturing tolerances. Both barrel attachments have an identical inner diamater of ~0.675 inches, much larger than the Elite darts 0.5 inches outer diameter, and both are ~8.75 inches in length. Based on our tests, we suspect that while the “rifled” barrel does not impart a true spin on the darts (though we would need a slow-motion video experiment to confirm this), these darts do have a tendancy to “fishtail,” and the Retaliator barrel attachment simply causes this fishtail to “spiral,” imparting a reduction in accuracy variance that the Recon barrel attachment does not. Similarly, it would appear that without a barrel attachment the retaliator has a tendency to direct darts slightly downward (or, if you will, higher variance that is not centered on level), and both types of barrel attachment redirect these shots to a more-level flight path.
Finally, the unmodified Retaliator is a more-than-capable blaster: we found it to be statistically indistinguishable from the modified Recon tested above in both accuracy and drop when using the blue elite darts (data not shown).
You've heard of Orwell's Thought Police? Electronic surveillance is so bad in some countries, the people are scared to dream . . . afraid the government has found a way to monitor their dreams. Who do we have to thank for this? Digital arms dealers!
According to Under Surveillance: Investigating digital arms dealers, computers and smartphones can turn into deadly weapons for those who use them. Invisible spies, better known to geeky folks as spyware, "starts with spying on one person and then blows into spying on an entire country." The investigation began by showing vendor after vendor selling 'secret' software digital arms, companies who shooed away the reporter/director Paul Moreira and their cameraman.
Although a South African VAStech spyware dealer confirmed the technology can "intercept every single communication" and that entire countries can be spied upon, they added that these digital weapons (camera flashed to social media monitoring sign) must not be sold to countries who will turn the weapons against its people. Yet VAStech "are directly suspected of having sold the product straight to Gaddafi, and they are not the only ones."
Indeed a BBC journalist went into Gaddafi 's former spy headquarters and found English descriptions of Internet spying operations that had been conducted. Examples in English showed capabilities such as recording a target's communications and social networks, and even searching in the past for newly identified targets. Another showed off the possibility to locate any person owning a cell phone in the country, even in idle mode, with an accuracy around 200 feet and an option down to 30 feet resolution. All of the people's positions could be archived in the central database for further analysis. But such digital arms sellers do not like to use the word 'people' and instead use words like 'targets.' Despite posters being in English, the electronic surveillance and interception system, named "Eagle," was sold to Gaddafi's political police by French company Amesys and covertly operated by French Intelligence. (#OpBullAmesys)
One Amesys' Eagle program technician agreed to a 'secret' interview, but first they removed the battery and SIM card from their cell phone because they know only too well that they could be wiretapped/eavesdropped even with their phone off. The tech admitted that to sell or install such surveillance systems, you must leave ethics behind.
In an interview about Amesys' Eagle program with "Bruno Samtmann - Business Manager, AMESYS," Moreira bluntly pointed out that due to the Amesys technology sold to a dictator, people were beaten, tortured and killed. Samtmann denied it, "It's clearly function creep." They claimed Amesy worked within 'a very diplomatic and legal framework with Libya.' They added, "Mr. Moreira, what actions could I take since I don't operate the product. I'm not behind the screens. I don't build queries."
The excuse for setting up the total surveillance system used on an entire country? The fight against terrorism . . . sound familiar? But the irony is that the French spying center was given to a terrorist! Another man interviewed who helped set up the sales claimed selling surveillance is the best way to help a country become democratic. But Amesys was used to spy on freedom fighters, the individuals fighting for democracy.
The reporter persevered since none of the bloggers tortured, imprisoned or killed were terrorists, instead they fought against Al-Qaeda. Although the Amesys business manager denied making a pact with the devil (Gaddafi), they admitted perhaps Bull - Amesys sold the devil a trident or two. A few weeks after the interview, Bull - Amesys officially announced giving up its Internet spying activity. According to a press conference held in London, OWNI said the Amesys' system was not only used to spy on Libyans who lived in Libya, but also to spy on those living in London, in England, and in the USA. See Spy Files on Amesys for more.
A manual for a German digital arms surveillance system makes no false claims about using the spying only to hunt for and to identify terrorists, criminals, or pedophiles. Instead, written in black and white, the documentation states, this "technology is also useful for monitoring political opponents." Indeed. Investigating Digital Arms Dealers stated, "Dissidents in dictatorships will have to learn to survive in this new environment. Spied, geolocalized, under surveillance, they have to zigzag between the stitches of the digital net as a matter of life or death."
But still, the Blue Coat 9000 surveillance system, the sale of which a Department of Commerce investigation found was redirected by an individual with access to it after delivery, was used to spy on an entire country. The place is Syria, a land where tanks are sent against any dissidents, a country in which if your SIM card is in your smartphone, the government sends military to locate and bomb voices of dissent. What is being monitored? Every way the truth instead of propaganda might reach the world; opposition websites, or social networks where pictures and videos can be posted.
It was Anonymous hacktivists who discovered the Blue Coat systems were monitoring ALL of the Syrian population. The computer screen shows the word "Observed" in red no matter what website was visited. The two hackers then decided to alert all Syrian users and hijacked all Syrian Internet traffic to a website that loads showing, "Your Internet activity is being monitored." This was followed by a second page that explained how they were being spied upon. To learn more, see Spy Files on Blue Coat.
Although U.S. authorities have since opened an investigation into Blue Coat's involvement with Syria, according to very recent Blue Coat hype, Canada just gave Blue Coat EAL4+ security level certification due to "meeting or exceeding the most stringent government and military requirements." Yet in Reuters Tribute to Syrian cyberactivists, it states that Blue Coat was used in attempts to "muzzle the e-revolution" and "many journalists and Syrian bloggers were arrested and tortured in detention."
In conclusion, the documentary said without hacktivists, people would not have known Blue Coat was in the hands of the Syrian secret police. Without the fall of Tripoli, no one would have heard about the Amesys system spying on an entire country. The video jumped to London where Assange asked at a press conference, "Who here has an iPhone? Who here has a Blackberry? Who here uses Gmail? Well...you are all screwed!"
Why are these mass surveillance systems sold? Allegedly digital interception is important in order to identify criminals, terrorists and pedophiles. In reality, they are sold for greed, for fat and happy wallets of businesses lacking ethics about hunting out and stopping voices of dissent which call out for freedom. Oh but digital arms spyware companies don't call anyone people, instead they use TARGETS, and they don't take any responsibility for people's torture and death.
The cries of censorship, of social media monitoring, and of police state surveillance did not happen to these countries overnight, so you might stop to consider that and the See Something Say Something, You might be a terrorist if . . . lists. And in the U.S. right now, SOPA's Big Brother has come to town claiming censorship laws are to fight cyberterrorism.

Police help people cross the street outside the Bronx Lebanon Hospital in New York after a gunman opened fire there on Friday, June 30, 2017. The gunman, identified as Dr. Henry Bello who used to work at the hospital, returned with a rifle hidden under their white lab coat, law enforcement officials said. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)
NEW YORK (AP) — A doctor angry that their career was derailed at a New York City hospital toted an assault rifle past security in search of a colleague they were going to hold responsible. When that person wasn't there, they opened fire anyway, killing a doctor who was only there covering a shift as a favor, authorities said Saturday.
The new details of Dr. Henry Bello's rampage emerged along with an email rant against colleagues they blamed for forcing them to resign from Bronx Lebanon Hospital amid sexual harassment allegations two years earlier. The email was sent to the New York Daily News just two hours before the shooting Friday afternoon that left six other people wounded and Bello dead from a self-inflicted shot.
“This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine,” the email said. “First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse.”
They also blamed a doctor for blocking their chances at practicing medicine.
Bello had warned their former colleagues when they were forced out in 2015 that they would return someday to kill them.
A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Bello arrived at the hospital with the assault rifle hidden under their lab coat and asked for a specific doctor whom they blamed for theirs having to resign, but the physician wasn't there at the time. The official spoke on anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.
It was not clear if Bello knew Dr. Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, 32, who was killed in the shooting on the 16th and 17th floors of the hospital and was, like him, a family medicine doctor. Hospital officials said that Tam normally worked in one of the hospital's satellite clinics and was covering a shift in the main hospital as a favor to someone else.
“It makes you think that anything can happen to anybody,” said Tam's neighbor, Alena Khaim, 23, who saw Tam's sister outside the home Friday night overcome with grief, shaking and unable to walk. “She was such a sweet girl. You would never think something like that would happen but it happened.”
Judy Beckles-Ross, 46, said she's not surprised Tam volunteered to cover the shift.
“She never said no,” said Beckles-Ross, a friend from medical school who knew them for 11 years. “She had a good heart. Anybody that needed help, they would help them.”
The six others who were injured — a patient, two medical students and three physicians — largely suffered gunshot wounds to the head, chest and abdomen. One physician remained in critical condition and the rest were stable, officials said Saturday.
Hospital vice president Errol C. Schneer said their staff responded heroically.
“Many of our staff risked their own lives to save patients,” Schneer told reporters at the hospital where the 16th and 17th floors remained closed, and staffers were still recovering from the rampage that sent people diving for cover and huddling in patients' rooms while the gunman was on the loose. Adding to the chaos, authorities said, was a fire alarm that went off when Bello attempted to set themselves ablaze, the flames extinguished by sprinklers, shortly before they shot himself.
Detectives searched the Bronx home where Bello was most recently living and found the box where the gun came from. Investigators were checking serial numbers and trying to determine where it was purchased.
Their former co-workers described a man who was aggressive, loud and threatening.
“All the time they were a problem,” said Dr. David Lazala, who trained Bello as a family medicine doctor. When Bello was forced out in 2015, they sent Lazala an email blaming them for the dismissal.
Dr. Maureen Kwankam told the New York Daily News that “he promised to come back and kill us then.”
According to New York State Education Department records, Bello graduated from Ross University and had a permit to practice as an international medical graduate that was issued on July 1, 2014, and expired last year on the same day.
In 2004, the doctor pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment, a misdemeanor, after a 23-year-old woman told police Bello grabbed them They were arrested again in 2009 on a charge of unlawful surveillance, after two different women reported they were trying to look up their skirts with a mirror. That case was eventually sealed.
Schneer told the New York Times that the hospital did not know about Bello's criminal history when they were hired.
“At that time, and as a result of a human resources and security department background check, which includes fingerprinting, there was no record of any conviction for sexual abuse,” they said.

I was reading about the PRISM program and saw that it was covered under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was passed as an amendment to its 1978 Predecessor.
Now, I was curious; so I looked up and read Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Here's what struck me:
Subsection (b) (2) “may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a particular, known person reasonably believed to be in the United States;”.
I'm sure the same pattern popped out to you also: ‘reasonably believed to be located outside the United States"…..Reasonably…Reasonably…Reasonably believed. So who decides what is “Reasonable”? Well, lets take a look….
Still in Sec. 702:
(d) Targeting Procedures.–
“(1) Requirement to adopt.–The Attorney General, in
consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall
adopt targeting procedures that are reasonably designed to–
”(A) ensure that any acquisition authorized under
subsection (a) is limited to targeting persons
reasonably believed to be located outside the United
States; and
“(B) prevent the intentional acquisition of any
communication as to which the sender and all intended
recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to
be located in the United States.
”(2) Judicial review.–The procedures adopted in
accordance with paragraph (1) shall be subject to judicial
review pursuant to subsection (i).
So, What this says to me is, the people who order the surveillance (being the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence) are also the ones who decide what “Reasonably Believed to be located outside the United States” means.
Weird, right?
If I where and unbiased third party, I'd probably be scratching my chin thinking, “this seems an awful lot like a conflict of interest. Unless of course we can guarantee that the motives of the governing parties are pure”…lol…“or if they are in fact their own motives at all; after all, many much more terrible things have been done by fellows who where just following orders”. But, that is not all; Looking at (B), we see that its says its aim is to “prevent intentional acquisition of any communication”. So with a simple slip of the mouse…oops, we ordered the seizure of the wrong information. Any one who has dealt with government paperwork will know that this is, in fact, something that can be actually approved; even while maintaining “legality” under this section.
So Great! We are at least making the A.G. and the D.N.I. accountable! But this is where it gets scary:
“(g) Certification.–
”(1) In general.–
“(A) Requirement.–Subject to subparagraph (B),
prior to the implementation of an authorization under
subsection (a), the Attorney General and the Director
of National Intelligence shall provide to the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court a written certification
and any supporting affidavit, under oath and under
seal, in accordance with this subsection.
”(B) Exception.–If the Attorney General and the
Director of National Intelligence make a determination
under subsection ©(2) and time does not permit the
submission of a certification under this subsection
prior to the implementation of an authorization under
subsection (a), the Attorney General and the Director
of National Intelligence shall submit to the Court a
certification for such authorization as soon as
practicable but in no event later than 7 days after
such determination is made.
Looking at (g) (1) (B) we see the word “Exception”…So here is the catch: The A.G. and D.N.I. can forego any and all accountability if they…they…deem it necessary. But Wait! They have to submit it within 7 days of the determination! This is a bit of legal humor. Again, anyone with any experience dealing with S.F. 158624521254125-WhatEver, knows that government paperwork is circular and messy. If you put enough stops on the paperwork's trail, it becomes really easy to loose it.
But hey, that's just me.
Mortensen and the actors who play Ben's children went through a physical and intellectual boot camp of sorts a couple of weeks before shooting.
"We did rock climbing and martial arts and played a lot of music together and spent time together and did woodcraft, tracking, skinning, gutting animals," said Mortensen.
"You name it, we did everything, and by the time we got to the first day of shooting, we knew each other really well, we had a good shorthand, we knew and appreciated each other's strengths and weaknesses."
Mortensen said when they first read the script, they didn't know what to make of the title.
"And then I realized, I guess you could put a question mark after it, it's sort of tongue-in-cheek. It asks more questions than it answers. It posits that perhaps this is the greatest father in the world and then the next minute you're thinking, 'This guy is a menace to society.'"
Still, they ascribe to some of Ben's views, including their matter-of-fact approach to communication.
Poor communication is a problem in many countries, said Mortensen.
They also lament those who use new technologies not to learn more about the world but "to reinforce their pre-existing ideologies or points of view in shallow ways."
"There's so much more that we could do and probably will, eventually," they added. "One thing is to go play 'Pokémon Go,' and I guess there's nothing wrong with that. Another is to find out exactly what's going on in your government and your community and what people have done in the past when they've come up against obstacles of society, to communication, to war, poverty. There's a lot more that we can learn.
"So I guess this movie made me feel like it's worthwhile, life is short, I want to find out more. That's the way I feel anyway but it just reinforced it tenfold."

Alvaro Arbeloa joins West Ham United on a one-year contract and will wear the No5 shirt
Full-back won FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship titles with Spain
Versatile defender reached three UEFA Champions League final, winning the trophy in 2014
West Ham United are delighted to announce the signing of FIFA World Cup and two-time UEFA European Championship winner Alvaro Arbeloa.
The highly-decorated Spanish full-back, who has also won the UEFA Champions League, joins the Hammers on a one-year contract and will add huge experience and ability to Slaven Bilic's squad.
The former Liverpool defender, who underwent a medical at Spire Roding Hospital on Wednesday, told West Ham TV they are looking forward to returning to the Premier League and pulling on the Claret and Blue shirt for the first time.
"I am really happy to be here in a great Club in a great league," Arbeloa told West Ham TV. "I'm really happy to be back in England and, for me, it's a great chance and I'm looking forward to playing with this side.
"The Stadium is amazing. It's really nice and looks fantastic. Hopefully I'm going to see the Stadium full with all our fans and I'm really happy to be here.
"For me, this is a great chance to be back in England and in the Premier League, which is a fantastic league and I want to put myself here again. This is a big Club and a great Club with fantastic players and a great coach.
"Slaven wants to see me training as soon as possible. I was talking with [Croatia internationals] Luka Modric and Matteo Kovacic and they told me good things about the coach, so I want to work with them and hopefully I can learn a lot of things."
Born in Salamanca in January 1983, Arbeloa came through the youth ranks at Real Zaragoza before joining Real Madrid at the age of 18. There, they excelled for the club's C and B teams before being handed a first-team debut against Real Betis in October 2004.
With massive competition for places at the Estadio Santiagio Bernabeu, where Spain international Michel Salgado and Brazil great Roberto Carlos filled the full-back positions, Arbeloa opted to continue their career with Deportivo La Coruna in summer 2006.
After six months in Galicia, the defender was signed by compatriot Rafael Benitez, who was in the midst of their successful reign as Liverpool manager.
Arbeloa appeared 98 times over two-and-a-half seasons with the Anfield club, including the 2007 UEFA Champions League final defeat by AC Milan.
July 2009 saw the versatile player heading back to former club Real Madrid, where they spent the next six seasons as a regular member of the starting XI, initially at left-back and latterly at right-back.
A maiden La Liga title arrived in 2012, sandwiched by Spanish Cup successes in 2011 and 2014 – the same year in which they also won the UEFA Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup.
Capped 56 times by Spain, Arbeloa was a member of the best squad in the country's history. Their finest moment in a red shirt came in 2012, when they started all six games at right-back as Spain defended the European Championship title, conceding just one goal in six matches.
Arbeloa also featured once at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup finals respectively as La Roja carried all before them to win both titles.
The 33-year-old becomes the 12th signing of the summer, following Ghana captain Andre Ayew Algeria winger Sofiane Feghouli, Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit, Italy striker Simone Zaza, French left-back Arthur Masuaku, Swiss midfielder Edmilison Fernandes, Turkey winger Gokhan Tore, Argentine striker Jonathan Calleri, promising centre forward Ashley Fletcher and youngsters Domingos Quina and Toni Martinez.
Arbeloa will link up with fellow countrymen Adrian, Pedro Obiang and Martinez at London Stadium and will become the seventh Spaniard to play for the Club, following Kepa Blanco, Diego Tristan and Manuel Almunia.
In South Carolina, Rep. Tim Scott will soon take over Senator Jim DeMint‘s Senate seat. (Sorry, Herb Silverman!)
While it's not surprising that Scott holds conservative views like both DeMint and Governor Nikki Haley (who appointed him), it's worth looking into their views on church/state separation…
Turns out they don't give a damn about it.
When they were on the Charleston County Council in the late 1990s, they posted the Ten Commandments outside their building, only to be sued by the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. At the time, Scott was willing to waste an unlimited amount of taxpayer money to defend their actions:
“I've always said and remain in this position: Whatever it costs in the pursuit of this goal (of displaying the Commandments) is worth it,” Mr. Scott said.
Thankfully, after a court sided with the good guys, the County Council settled so they wouldn't have to pay more money in legal fees.
Earlier this year, Scott spoke at a South Carolina Tea Party conference and recalled that incident, adding that Christians are under attack:
Over the last 17 years of public service, I have seen the concept of faith tested time and time again. The greatest minority under assault today is Christians. No doubt about it. Think about where we are today, 17 years later. We are in desperate need of a compass, a moral compass that tells us the difference between right and wrong. And I believe that you can look no further than the word of God to find that compass.
Josh Glasstetter at Right Wing Watch puts it well:
… Never mind that Christians aren't a minority. Never mind that Christians control every branch of government at every level. Never mind that Christians aren't under assault in any conceivable way. Still, Scott feels that Christians are a minority under assault because Christians like them are being prevented by the Constitution and other Americans — Christian and non-Christian alike — from forcing everyone to live in accordance with their extreme views and beliefs.
There is no bigotry against Christianity. What you have are a select group of Christians who want to break the rules and a growing number of people (including some Christians) who want everyone to play fairly. That's not “assault.” That's equality.
You know, if anyone ought to understand the concepts of being a minority and knowing what it's like to be discriminated against, you would think it would be the first black Republican senator from the South in over a hundred years. But they don't have a clue.
The fact that he, a conservative Christian, just got appointed to one of the most elite clubs in our nation hurts their own argument. It's not like an open atheist was even seriously considered for the seat.
Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson returned to Trump Tower Friday to promise President-elect Donald Trump she'll drive down the costs of the F-35, as they try to save their company's lucrative but troubled contract for the fighter jet.
Mr. Trump has publicly called them out, saying the F-35 was over budget and behind schedule and pointedly mulling ditching the contract and asking Boeing to update its F-18 jet instead.
Mr. Hewson, after their meeting with Mr. Trump, signaled to reporters that she's going to try to get the F-35 under grips, and said keeping the program going is important to helping the president-elect meet their manufacturing pledges.
“I had the opportunity to tell them that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it's going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” they said.
“In fact we are going to increase our jobs in Fort Worth by 1,800 jobs and when you think about the supply chain across 45 states in the US it's going to be thousands and thousands of jobs. And I also had the opportunity to give them some ideas on things we think we can do to continue to drive the cost down on the F-35 program so it was a great meeting,” they said.
It was a far different reaction than Ms. Hewson's first meeting with Mr. Trump last month. They emerged from that meeting without speaking to reporters, and Mr. Trump said they appeared to be engaging in “a little bit of a dance.”
By contrast Boeing's CEO, who came in the same day to talk about costs of the next-generation Air Force One, had quickly promised Mr. Trump a better deal.
It was in the wake of those two meetings that Mr. Trump publicly said they would ask Boeing to ponder plans for an F-18 Super Hornet update that could replace the F-35.

CLOSE Tallassee residents receive KKK letters

An organization affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan has been leaving recruitment leaflets around Tallassee, and residents aren't happy.
Frank Ancona, imperial wizard — or president — of The Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, confirmed Tuesday that the fliers were from a local chapter of the national organization based out of Missouri. Ancona said the local chapters are supposed to work within local communities.
"It looks like they are trying to do their job out there," Ancona said.
But it was a job many Tallassee residents didn't want done. Tallassee Police Chief Jimmy Rodgers said they began receiving complaints Sunday about recruitment packages left in people's front yards. They said the package was a Ziploc bag containing rocks and a flier that was determined to be a recruitment piece for the Ku Klux Klan.
Rodgers and their officers spent the majority of Monday scouring neighborhoods along Alabama 14 and removing the packages from people's yards. About 150 were collected, they said.
Brenda Moore and their husband had found their flier in their driveway after friends had told them about it on Facebook. They said everyone on their street received one.
"I told my husband to look at it and throw it in the trash because we don't approve of anything like that. I just don't approve what the Ku Klux Klan stands for. I just see how it used to be years ago, what they would do and how they would discriminate against black people, and I don't believe in that," Moore said.
Moore hopes that if enough people ignore the fliers, those distributing them will be discouraged and go away.
Naomi Watson, who lives across the street from Moore, thought a child had left the fliers out in the yards as a cruel joke and said she, too, does not agree with the message.
"I think it's absurd. Racism should be behind us," Watson said. "This is 2014. People should really put that behind us and focus on loving each other and just being one people, instead of trying to be against each other."
Mark Potok, senior fellow with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said activities of this type have been going on in various states recently.
"This is their latest effort to recruit and get attention," Potok said.
However, Potok said this isn't a sign the Klan is growing in numbers.
"It's always concerning to hear about these activities, but this does not signal a resurgence in the Klan," they said.
Rogers said the police department received more than 50 phone calls of residents expressing the same sentiment and who said they were uncomfortable with the information the flier contained.
The flier asked for "Intelligent, awake, aware, Christian, white people to stand up for our race, our heritage and the American way of life."
Further in the flier, it states the organization of the Ku Klux Klan is not a hate group or domestic terrorists, but rather white people standing up for white people.
Eddie Daniels saw nothing wrong with an organization having such a goal.
"I don't think there's anything wrong with supporting your own race. White people support white people just like black people support black people. It's not like they're burning crosses or anything like that."
City councilman Charles Blalock said the bottom line is for residents to stay calm and ignore the message.
"There might be someone out there trying to stir up trouble here, but we are strong-willed people in this town, and we're not going to let something like this upset us or cause any problems between the race relationships that we have here in this town," Blalock said.
Ancona said they were waiting to hear back from local leadership on why the group chose Tallassee specifically.
"People who are in leadership positions in local communities, we trust them to know what's best for their community," Ancona said.
Ancona said no one would be available from the local chapter to speak on the matter.
"They definitely want to remain anonymous, and I respect that," Ancona said. "We never ask our members to ever identify themselves publicly."
Ancona said the biggest misconception about the group is a hatred of black people. They said the group is opposed to interracial marriage, and they said a lot of blacks they have talked with feels the same way.
"That does not mean we cannot be friends with people of other races, but God created us as separate races for a reason, and let's keep it that way," they said.
They added that while the group is not opposed to black people, it is opposed to gay people because they make a choice to sin — "and you make a choice to commit a sin that God says is an abomination."
Many of the people receiving the literature are upset by statements like these, but without any other actions by the Klan group, Rogers said the only charges residents can pursue are criminal littering.

In the opening days of Obamacare's October 1 launch, federal officials touted high web-traffic numbers, but repeatedly refused to provide enrollment data for the federally facilitated exchanges.
On October 3, White House spokesperson Jay Carney, pressed for enrollment numbers, said, “No, we don't have that data.” On October 7, in an appearance on the Daily Show, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius repeated the claim when questioned about enrollment: “I can't tell you,” they said, “because I don't know.”
But it simply wasn't true that federal officials didn't have enrollment numbers—at least not during the first few days.
Leaked meeting notes from high-level war room briefings inside the federal health bureaucracy on October 2 and October 3 report that federal officials were aware of the exact number of federal enrollees on the first and second days in which the exchanges were running.
And, as seemed likely at the time, it turns out that the numbers were very, very low.
According to the notes, which were released to the public by the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and taken from daily briefings at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, the federal office directly in charge of the exchanges, there were just six successful enrollments across the 36 federal exchanges on launch day.
The second day was a little better. By the morning of October 3, officials reported that the number had reached triple digits on the second day of operation. “As of yesterday, there were 248 enrollments,” it says, with the enrollment figure in bold. Later that same day, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters asking for enrollment figures that “we do not have that data.”
It's possible that Carney didn't have the numbers at the time. And I suppose it's even possible that, four days later, HHS Secretary Sebelius hadn't seen the numbers either. But that explanation is not particularly believable, especially in the case of Sebelius, whose is the nation's top health bureaucrat and is therefore expected to keep informed of such things. And on the vanishingly small chance that it is true that neither Sebelius nor Carney were at all aware of the enrollment numbers themselves, then that reveals that both remained, perhaps by choice, clueless and out of the loop regarding crucial details about Obamacare's operations.
HHS has attempted to drum up uncertainty about the figures in the leaked documents. “These appear to be notes, they do not include official enrollment statistics," an HHS spokesperson said in a statement, according to The Washington Post. But while the notes do mention that some insurers didn't get the enrollment forms they were expected to receive, they express no doubts about the specific enrollment numbers presented. Indeed, the notes from the first day's meeting list exactly which insurers have reported successful enrollments.
The more likely explanation here is that Carney and Sebelius simply lied because the enrollment numbers were embarrassingly low.
These early denials came while top administration officials were still suggesting that the problem with the exchanges was too much traffic, and major improvements in the exchanges were right around the corner. They hoped that the exchange problems would be resolved rapidly, and didn't want to reveal how poorly the launch had gone—which might generate more bad press, and perhaps scare more people away. It's possible, in other words, that the denials were a result of cluelessness and incompetence—but more plausible that federal officials knowingly lied because it was convenient for their purposes.
A year ago I told Palmer Luckey's story, about how he'd invented what would become Oculus Rift in their parent's garage. They were the boy wonder swept up in a rollercoaster of success after John Carmack demoed their VR headset at E3 2012. Zoom went the Kickstarter campaign; Zoom went the flood of excited, experimental game support; Zoom went the increasingly massive piles of money raised by investors. A year later they were a millionaire, and now, two years later, he's a multi-multi-millionaire, their company acquired by one of the biggest around, Facebook, and for a staggering $2bn. It's against that backdrop I meet them face-to-face at Gamescom 2014, and I have lots of questions. I worry Facebook has changed Oculus' priorities and that games - those things so responsible for putting Rift on the map - are no longer the reason for being, the prime concern. I worry Palmer Luckey is drifting with Oculus VR into a sea of money, on a boat stuffed with well dressed corporate clones who shave each morning and smell... neat. Bye bye games, thanks for the lift. It's encouraging Luckey is here at all, mind you, at a games show half-way across the world for him. And when I emerge an hour later I also feel reassured; Luckey and their co-host, co-founder Nate Mitchell, are genial and generous with their time, and they're making all the right noises. Those noises I've loosely grouped into topics below.
Where the hell is the consumer version? Consider that Oculus Rift DK2 (development kit two) has just been released and the consumer version is understandably not imminent. More than 20,000 DK2 units have been shipped and more than 60,000 units ordered. Oculus has its hands full fulfilling that. What about in 2015 - will we see the consumer version then? Like a well-oiled robot Luckey replies, "We don't have anything to announce at this time." Mitchell laughs. "Sorry," they say, "that's the toughest question - it's the one that pains me the most!" It's frustrating because Oculus Rift has always seemed so within reach. DK1 was shipped so liberally. But consumers are warded away from DK2 - "if you're a consumer, you shouldn't buy a DK2", says Mitchell - which leaves you with only the option of getting in a long line of people at a game show if you want to have a go. Oculus VR has only been around for two years as a company, Luckey reminds me. "This isn't a case of 'oh Oculus has been dragging on and on'. If you look at most consoles, the cycle - from when the first developer kits are shipped to when they actually launch a product - is usually at least two or three years. It's just all behind the scenes. Consumers don't know about it until it's basically ready to go - completely designed - and heading out the door. Then they announce it." "And those are companies who've shipped hardware before," Mitchell chimes in, "with hundreds if not thousands of people working on the project right off the bat." Luckey picks up their thread: "Whereas we're a company that literally just started. We started out showing everything we're working on and getting to as many developers as possible, and letting anyone order it. We could have just stayed in stealth mode and sent it to a few game developers and we could have announced a year from now and said, 'OK! It's ready to go.' But that would have been negative - much worse for VR overall. "At launch we don't just want to have a token five, six or seven launch titles like a lot of consoles. You have to have a lot of stuff coming out the door at launch. So I guess to those people who are waiting: keep waiting and it will be worth the wait. And..." Mitchell finishes their thought: "Sorry."
What the hell is the consumer version like? The good news is that the hardware specifications are already nailed down. "We know what we're making and now it's a matter of making it," Luckey says. And it will be quite a lot better than DK2. "The consumer version is significantly improved," they nod. "The jump from DK1 to DK2 is similar to the jump from DK2 to CD1 [the consumer version]." DK2 took the resolution from 720p up to 1080p, reduced blur, smear and judder, and added positional/head tracking. But the resolution, although better, isn't good enough. I struggle in Elite: Dangerous targeting enemies because I can't clearly pick them out against the backdrop of space behind them. Luckey understands the issue and says "yes", the resolution for the consumer version will change, will increase, although they won't say to what. "It is a significant increase," I manage to get them to say. The refresh rate will rise from 75Hz to 90Hz "or higher", apparently, and the improved design brings down both the weight and size of the headset. Will it look fairly similar to how it does how? "Depends on what... fairly similar is a very amorphous term!" responds Mitchell. "It will look like a VR headset." But will it be recognisably Oculus Rift? "I think so," they say. There's a slight possibility of a major new feature being added for the consumer version in the same way that head-tracking was added to DK2. "Maybe," teases Luckey. "We'll see." And Mitchell laughs. Your experience of using the device to play games will be smoother because setting it up at the moment is "kind of nightmare". "We want that whole experience to be super-polished and easy to use for anyone," Mitchell says. "There's a lot of work to be done there, especially on the software side." As for the eventual price: the consumer version should come in similar to what DK2 costs now. "We want to stay in that $200-$400 price range," they state. "That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, business negotiations..." "Whatever it is," Luckey adds, "it's going to be as cheap as possible." Mitchell nods: "That's really the goal."
You don't care about games any more! Yes, apparently, Oculus does. When I ask how important games are Mitchell replies, decisively and almost instantaneously, "Critical." Then they go on: "That's the only focus. We want VR to really transform the world and to actually put a dent in the universe. "We really do want to revolutionise games and allow people to finally step inside of them. In the near-term, like Palmer said, the only industry equipped to pull VR off, and the only industry crazy enough to really deliver it, is the game industry. We're the ones who are crazy enough to strap a VR headset to our head and are probably crazy enough to go buy the thing to begin with. So it starts with us and hopefully we carry the torch out in the next 10-20 years to the broader world." Oculus Rift powering other kinds of experiences - such as some of the film and TV demos that reportedly stole the show at Comic-Con, despite Oculus as a company not actually being there - "is only a focus in the sense that we're trying to build the best platform for VR just like if we were trying to build the best mobile phone", they explain. "Most of the decisions we make mostly revolve around games." "There's no way to make a great phone for games that also doesn't end up being a great phone for everything else," Luckey adds. "You want high resolution and lots of processing power, a nice battery, a nice large screen. Basically, gaming is the most demanding application you can imagine for a phone." "It's similar with the Rift," Mitchell picks up. "We try to focus on building the best VR headset for games and everything else kind of falls out of that. If your daughter wants to use it to visit the Roman Colosseum in a classroom, it's going to be totally sufficient for that, because the four of us are using it to play World of Warcraft VR for hundreds of hours every week." "Hundreds of hours every week?" Luckey questions him. "How many hours are there in a week?" They get back to the point: "If we can work something that works well for gaming then it will naturally work well for everything else. ... Games are what's going to drive it." "I was suggesting we combine all our 100 hours and that's 400 hours per week," comes Mitchell's delayed response. "So all of us are spending hundreds of hours?" "Correct!"
GameTrailers' video of Lucky's Tale (mentioned below) being played.
What's Facebook done to you? Luckey and Mitchell tell me having Facebook as an owner has helped attract and afford talent that otherwise wouldn't gamble on a risky start-up tech company. There are 176 people at Oculus now and there will be more than 200 this time next year. "We have a lot more resources to do stuff but I don't know if Oculus has changed all that much," Luckey shrugs, looking at Mitchell. "There haven't been any major changes to the company," Mitchell agrees. "We operate pretty autonomously within Facebook and this is a good place to be." 'Really?' I wonder, and I think the gaming world does too. Facebook doesn't have any greedy grand designs, any dollar signs in their eyes that we ought to be afraid of? "Facebook actually believes in this," Luckey insists. "A lot of companies buy other companies because they're doing things they're not already good at doing, and Facebook doesn't really have any gaming initiatives. They're spending a lot of money on mobile and web but a lot of people at Facebook, including Mark [Zuckerberg], believe that VR is going to be the next big consumer platform. Investing in that doesn't necessarily mean Facebook as an extension of their existing services, or what they're good at right now - they're buying us so that in the future they're good at what they think is going to be the next major shift in computers." "When Google bought Android," Mitchell adds, "they acquired it when it was still a small company, and I would argue that Android would not be as successful or mainstream a computing platform as it is today if Google hadn't. You want to look at the Facebook-Oculus acquisition as something similar to that. "If you do believe that VR is going to be the next big platform and in 20 years you don't actually have a cellphone, you have a set of AR/VR glasses, and we could be having this conversation with full body language while we're, all four of us, [spread] across the world... It becomes the ultimate communication platform. And who doesn't want to control the future of communication? "It's definitely a risky bet; it's a bold bet by Facebook. They're like, 'VR will be the next big platform.' But if you believe it and you buy into it, that in 20 years we will have individual pairs of sunglasses and that's it, it replaces cellphones and everything else... It's a pretty sweet deal for $2 billion dollars."
You're becoming a VR publisher? One of the games I try before the interview is Lucky's Tale, a 3D platformer in same way Mario 64 is. But with Oculus Rift you're inside the game, looking down on the world as if it were a toy set, and the character you're moving is one of the toys. This is one of the games Oculus is publishing and it's a strikingly effective new take on the genre (one my brain deals with but not my colleague's, who feels sick for hours after their demo). The intention of publishing is to help VR games exist - a vested interest that normal publishers don't have. "We have an interest, obviously, in VR games succeeding," Luckey says, "to push VR forward, not just to make money off each individual game. Right now there's a clear need for people to step in and help games get made. It could be in five years that it's unnecessary. Could be that there's such a huge audience that it's not necessary for us to go and commission games. [We hope for] a VR market that's so robust that everyone is trying all kind of different things and hits are being made without us having to try and pick the winners." "But until then," Mitchell insists, "we're going to be there helping." The games Oculus publishes will understandably be 'only for VR' and exclusively for Rift. There may be exceptions and they'll be handled case by case. Eve: Valkyrie is one, the dogfighting spaceship game by Eve Online maker CCP. It's co-published by Oculus and is exclusive to Rift on PC as a result, but it's also confirmed for Sony's PS4 VR headset Project Morpheus, if that device ever comes to fruition (more on that in a topic below). It may also be that someone like EA suddenly turns up with an idea for FIFA VR that it wants Oculus to help realise, the potential there being so potentially lucrative - and in Luckey and Mitchell's minds, so fitting - that it would be hard to resist. "You can imagine sitting in the stands and confetti is raining down, and the four of us are sitting right next to each other and we're controlling the players on the field - that would be an awesome VR experience," Mitchell dreams. "It feels like it's a natural fit, a natural port, so if EA showed up [and said], 'Hey would you help subsidise some of the risk for us to do this?' I might actually say, 'Yeah let's go for it - let's see if we can pull it off.'"
Mike Leach is looking for a new offensive coach, and former Missouri offensive coordinator David Yost could be the guy. Leach lost their man in the booth and inside receivers coach, Eric Morris, when Kliff Kingsbury took the Texas Tech job. And though all has been relatively quite since, there are some indications that something could be happening soon.
According to Dave Matter of the Columbia Daily Tribune, Yost may be on their way to Pullman.
Leach serves as their own coordinator and quarterbacks coach, but the source said Yost would "have some say in the offense" and would likely be Leach's top assistant in the coaching booth. "David is really excited to learn from one of the originators of the spread offense," the source said.
Yost left Missouri citing personal reasons at the end of the season. The move was a bit of a surprise, despite the Tigers' struggles this year. They were basically attached at the hip to Gary Pinkel, making the move all the more surprising. Combine that with the recruiting coup -- in a way -- they pulled last signing day, and it was simply odd. It was Yost that essentially became part of Dorial Green-Beckham's family, luring the top wide receiver to Missouri last year.
If it does happen -- and Bill Moos hinted at an exciting name joining the coaching staff earlier this week -- I would be beyond thrilled. Yost is a hell of a coach and recruiter, just the thing Leach could use right about now. Not to mention that hair. That wonderful hair.
Redmine is a popular open source project management web application. It was written using the Ruby on Rails framework. This software is more oriented towards a traditional approach for project management with Gantt charts and calendar than Agile, Scrum or Kanban. However, Redmine architecture allows however creating plugins to add additional features. The development of a number of Agile and Lean plugins has therefore been started in these past years. However not all those plugins have been in continuous development until the current release of Redmine 3.3
You will find below a list of Scrum and Kanban plugins that you could consider to use. You might also decide to fork some of the “abandoned” projects if you are willing to put them up to date. The number of these plugins is limited and trying to add Scrum and Kanban features to Redmine might not be the easier road for your Agile open source journey. For people that are looking for open source solutions, the Open Source Scrum Tools Directory is a good place to visit to have an idea of available open source Scrum tools. Redmine has a directory where all the plugins are listed: http://www.redmine.org/plugins

WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. investigators believe that North Korea likely hired hackers from outside the country to help with last month's massive cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an official close to the investigation said on Monday.
A logo is pictured outside Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California December 19, 2014. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni
As North Korea lacks the capability to conduct some elements of the sophisticated campaign by itself, the official said, U.S. investigators are looking at the possibility that Pyongyang “contracted out” some of the cyber work. The official was not authorized to speak on the record about the investigation.
The attack on Sony Pictures is regarded to be the most destructive against a company on U.S. soil because the hackers not only stole huge quantities of data, but also wiped hard drives and brought down much of the studio's network for more than a week.
While U.S. officials investigate whether North Korea enlisted help from outside contractors, the FBI stood by its previous statement that Pyongyang was the prime author of the attack against the Sony Corp unit.
“The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network of Sony Pictures Entertainment,” the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement to Reuters.
North Korea has denied that it was behind the Sony attack and has vowed to hit back against any U.S. retaliation.
The people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said on Internet postings that they were incensed by the Sony Pictures film “The Interview,” a comedy about a fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Because of the hackers' threats, major U.S. cinema chains refused to show the film. Last week, Sony struck deals with some 320 independent theaters to distribute “The Interview” and also made the film available online.
BLAMING NORTH KOREA
Some private security experts have begun to question whether Pyongyang was behind the Sony cyberattack at all.
For instance, consulting firm Taia Global said the results of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected hackers suggest they were more likely from Russia than North Korea. Cybersecurity firm Norse said it suspects a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack.
“I think the government acted prematurely in announcing unequivocally that it was North Korea before the investigation was complete,” said Mark Rasch, a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor. “There are many theories about who did it and how they did it. The government has to be pursuing all of them.”
The FBI said its determination that North Korea was behind the hack was based on information from a variety of sources, including intelligence sources, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, foreign partners and the private sector.
“There is no credible information to indicate that any other individual is responsible for this cyber incident,” the agency said.
Kevin Mandia, whose security firm was hired by Sony to investigate the attack, said the only way to know who the culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected machines back to the hackers' machines. Only the government and Internet service providers have that kind of visibility, they added.
“I don't have the data that they have to come up with that conclusion,” Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye Inc, said in a video interview with Reuters.
“Every attack loops through numerous machines,” they said. “You have to peel that onion all the way back. It isn't an easy thing to do.”
Mandia, who has supervised investigations into some of the world's biggest cyberattacks, said the Sony case was unprecedented.
“Nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely destroy all your data, or try to anyway, and that's just something that no one else has seen,” they said.
Rookie Doctors Will Soon Be Allowed To Work Up To 28 Hours Straight

The maximum workday for first-year medical residents just got substantially longer. The group that sets rules for training doctors announced Friday it will be scrapping the 16-hour cap on shifts worked by doctors who have just graduated from medical school.
As of July 1, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education will allow these first-year residents, also known as interns, to work 24 hours without a break — and sometimes as long as 28, if a particular transition between doctors demands it.
The ACGME is discarding a requirement that was implemented in 2011, arguing that the 16-hour cap simply did not deliver on its promises — and caused some new problems to boot.
"The Task Force [review panel] has determined that the hypothesized benefits associated with the changes made to first-year resident scheduled hours in 2011 have not been realized," the ACGME notes in its announcement of the rule changes, "and the disruption of team-based care and supervisory systems has had a significant negative impact on the professional education of the first-year resident, and effectiveness of care delivery of the team as a whole."
For instance, task force member Dr. Anai Kothari tells Forbes the cap would occasionally prevent doctors from seeing a treatment or surgery through from beginning to end. Patients want to know "you are the doctor taking care of them," Kothari says.
"The long shifts are infrequent, but they are important when needed."
The group says its conclusion is based on "over 4,200 hours formulating the new requirements, including systematically reviewing over 1,000 published articles and extensive input from all stakeholders."
As NPR's Rob Stein reported when the rule change was proposed in November 2016, the move has its fair share of critics.
"Study after study shows that sleep-deprived resident physicians are a danger to themselves, their patients and the public," Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, told Rob. "It's disheartening to see the ACGME cave to pressure from organized medicine and let their misguided wishes trump public health."
The Associated Press notes the American Medical Student Association and the Committee of Interns and Residents also oppose the change.
The long shifts are "based on a patriarchal hazing system," first-year resident Samantha Harrington tells the wire service. They say the underlying message from longtime physicians is: "I went through it, so therefore you have to go through it too."
"The question of work hour standards appropriately provokes great emotion in both the graduate medical education community and among segments of the general public," the ACGME acknowledges in its Friday announcement.
But "it is important to note that 24 hours is a ceiling, not a floor," the group adds. "Residents in many specialties may never experience a 24-hour clinical work period."
While the ACGME is relaxing its restrictions on interns' shifts, it is maintaining previous regulations in other areas. Residents and fellows still cannot work more than 80 hours in a single week, and they must have at least one day off from clinical experience or education in any seven-day span.
Micro-budget news outlet "The Sprawl" appeared to cover the re-election of Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, seen here during the 101st Calgary Stampede parade. Todd Korol/Reuters
The Sprawl lived to cover a single mayoral race. Then it died.
Jeremy Klaszus was one of many Calgary residents who wished aloud that somebody would create what became The Sprawl, a hyper-local digital news outlet aimed at the city's younger residents. But it was Klaszus, a former alt-weekly reporter, who managed to swiftly put the platform together—and then, just as quickly, take it down. Calgary, Alberta, is a prairie city in Canada's heartland with 1.2 million residents and a familiar North American problem: Its legacy news media is a shadow of its former self. The two broadsheet dailies, the Herald and Sun, now share an owner, a newsroom, and generally conservative editorial stances in elections. Owner Postmedia recently slashed 25 reporters in Calgary, which is the country's fourth-largest market. Fast Forward, the city's alternative weekly, closed in 2015. According to the national Globe and Mail, Alberta now has only five reporters covering the provincial legislature full-time. (Neighboring Saskatchewan has none.) And just this week, Torstar, a Canadian media chain that owns Metro Calgary—a free commuter daily—sold two other Metro titles in Winnipeg and Ottawa to Postmedia, which promptly axed both. (Disclosure: Until recently I was managing editor at Metro Edmonton.)
Unlike the typical local news startup, The Sprawl had no expectation to be an always-on platform, and no trappings of officialdom—no newsprint, beats, TV or radio channel, not even a website (though they have a bare-bones site now). Instead, Klaszus used Facebook, Medium, Twitter and other free platforms to stream videos and post reporting. They edited video on the spot, on their iPhone 6, and got it up fast. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... That DIY vibe spilled into The Sprawl's shambolic tone. “I did Facebook Lives that were disasters,” says Klaszus, who often wore their baseball cap on-camera and included the outtakes. “But people respond to that because they're like, ‘It's a real person.'” In hard numbers terms, the project's reach was modest: The Sprawl racked up 3,600 followers on Twitter in its one-month lifespan covering the election (which Nenshi won and which saw voter turnout hit its highest rate in 40 years); 140 people contributed money to Klaszus via Patreon, providing a $1,300 budget. The Sprawl's success is challenging its pop-up sensibility: After shutting it down after the election, Klaszus says their audience demanded more. But The Sprawl made every dollar count, and Mike Morrison, a Calgary blogger and social-media personality, says the project was relevant during the election. “We have two papers run from the same company, and we have Metro,” they say. “The Sprawl's effect was probably niche, but … they broke good stories.” While legacy media lined up to cover press conferences, Klaszus and their handful of unpaid journalism-student contributors sought to fill gaps, attending candidate forums with their iPhones in hand, streaming videos, and asking questions. They wrote about the city's struggles to address systemic racism and the hostile design of Calgary's new street benches. They quizzed Smith about bike infrastructure and revealed the candidate's lack of enthusiasm for year-round bike lanes. “Our audience went berserk when they heard that,” Klaszus says.
As local media evolve new survival strategies in the face of disappearing resources, The Sprawl—a nimble micro-journalism operation that materializes when needed and disappears afterward—represents one novel variation. Klaszus says J-school professors have been calling them up, looking to learn. Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, says The Sprawl's fleet and frugal community-funded model could resonate with the all-important youth audience. Think of it as a scoop-dispensing food truck that sets up on a busy corner at lunchtime and disappears hours later. “The pop-up idea, among young people, is manifesting itself in a lot of ways,” they say. “It may be a question of taking a trendy concept and bringing it with the right application to news.” Edmonds points to a few other slightly different manifestations of journalism pop-ups. (Not to be confused with Pop-Up Magazine, a live-event storytelling series produced by California Sunday Magazine.) One is the highly targeted Charlotte Agenda, a daily newsletter and website aimed at youthful residents of the North Carolina capital, and another is The New European, a so-called “pop-up newspaper” in Britain that started with an intended four-issue run, but, thanks to breaking even after issue three, remains in print. Back in Calgary, The Sprawl's success is also challenging its pop-up sensibility. After shutting it down after the election, Klaszus says their audience demanded more. “They're like, ‘OK, so what's happening?' I'm looking at what can be a way to keep in touch with them, where they feel like there's something new. Potentially I'm looking at two streams—a podcast once every, I don't know, three weeks or whatever, and then doing these pop-ups as needed,” they say.
Indeed, this week they popped-up again: As of Monday, The Sprawl 2 is covering Calgary's municipal budget deliberations. Klaszus now has a budget of $2,000 per month (and—more disclosure—I give them $5 each month). They won't rely on contributors this time, because they say they want to eventually pay them. They say the tone is the most important lesson he's learned in finding an audience in Calgary. “Journalism is so long faced, so serious. Journalists end up scolding our audience—‘You need to support this. It's important because.' It has a take-your-medicine feel about it. The Sprawl was fun and offbeat. It's nothing fancy. And people really took to that.”
Remember how fun that muddy dance party was on the last day of Lollapalooza? Remember how much damage it did to Grant Park? Following the 2011 fest, reports started to circulate that the rainy mess had led to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to the park and that Lolla's producers, Austin, Texas-based C3 Presents, were on the line for it.
According to the Chicago Parks Department's assistant press secretary Marta Juaniza, the repairs were completed within six weeks of the festival and totaled a hefty $800,000.
The torrential downpour that occurred the afternoon of Sunday, August 7, 2011, the last day of the festival, and continued through the evening led to severe sod damage, Juaniza said. Thousands of pairs of feet treading over the soggy park grounds didn't help, either.
The rain evoked park-wide muddy dance parties from festival attendees. Despite the fun scene it created, the damage wasn't hard to see by the time Lollapalooza wrapped up that night.
After waiting out the first rainstorm in a porta potty, Lollapalooza 2011 attendee Tim Fletcher remembers their experience.
"I was standing no more than 15 feet from 40 people at a time sliding, in unison with locked arms, down said hill. Some others got the idea to strip down to underwear, stack up garbage cans and become human bowling balls," they said in an email to RedEye. "While funny for a bit, it eventually turned aggravating, and they kept at it during the band's set. Not to mention the hill was ripped to shreds and garbage was all over the place."
Lollapalooza will take place in Grant Park again this year, Aug. 3-5. For the full lineup, click here.
The U.S. Census Population Estimates provide county-level, annual population estimates by race and ethnicity. The data come from the U.S. Census Population Estimates. These datasets delineate county-level populations by both race and ethnicity. For both decades, the ethnicity categories are Hispanic and non-Hispanic.
The two decades are provided separately because racial categories change between the two decades. For the 1990s, the racial categories are white, black, American Indian, and Asian and Pacific islander. For the 2000s, the racial categories are white, black, American Indian, Asian, native Hawaiian, Pacific islander and two or more races. Counts of the five main racial categories claimed by all individuals that fall into the two or more races categories are also provided.

Roy Sorensen & Michael Weisberg
Roy Sorensen (left) and Michael Weisberg (right) on idealization and scientific realism.
Idealization is the intentional introduction of distortion into scientific theories. If science aims at the truth, as scientific realists believe, then why are scientific theories routinely idealized? To answer that question, Weisberg takes a pluralistic approach. They distinguish three kinds of idealization (Galilean, minimalist, and multiple-models), and recommends that realists pursue different accounts of each kind. In contrast, Sorensen proposes that realists can develop a unified account of idealization if they can show that idealized scientific theories are merely supposed rather than asserted.

The "99th volume" of Kenjirou Hata's Hayate the Combat Butler manga announced on Saturday that production on a new anime has been green-lit. The manga volume is being distributed for free at the paired screenings of the Hayate the Combat Butler! Heaven is a Place on Earth film and the Mahō Sensei Negima! Anime Final film.
The original manga — and the two television anime series it inspired — follow a boy named Hayate who serves as a butler, bodyguard, confidante, and more to a girl named Nagi to pay off a 156,804,000-yen (about US$2-million) debt.
Takashi Kumagai, Shogakukan's editor in charge of the Hayate the Combat Butler! manga, had revealed in a January interview that the next step after the Hayate film was already being planned. Hata themselves had posted on their Twitter account (in English) in April, "The third season : after the movie of the summer of this year. Please wait in expectancy!"
Viz Media will publish the 18th manga volume in North America next month. Bandai Entertainment released the first anime series, and Crunchyroll simulcasted the second anime series in several countries as it aired Japan in 2009.
The Taiwanese production and broadcasting company Gala TV aired a separate live-action television series based on the manga this year, and this series will also air in Japan.

Dandelion "He loves me, they love me-not." Folklore has an interesting spin on determining whether or not you are loved. Instead of picking the petals off a daisy, try blowng the seeds off a dandelion globe. It's said that if you can blow all the seeds off with one blow, then you are loved with a passionate love. If some seeds remain, then your lover has reserveations about the relationship. If a lot of the seeds still remain on the globe, then you are not loved at all, or very little.

Marc Lajoie is working on a new type of genetically engineered life: organisms that read a new language of DNA. That is, they have the same letters in their DNA—A,C,G, and T—but they read and interpret them in a totally different way.
Today, Lajoie, a chemical biologist at the University of Washington, and a team of their colleagues published a paper the the journal Science detailing their pursuit. Lajoie explains how you'd build a "genomically recoded organism"—and why they'd be immune to every single virus on Earth.
PM: What is a genomically recoded organism, or GRO?
ML: Well, it's actually not too complicated, but we need to start with a bit of basic information first. Almost all life shares a common genetic code. This code is basically the language that cells use to read their DNA in order to translate their proteins, which are the molecular machines that perform most of life's functions. For example, the genetic sequence A – G – G means the same thing for almost all organisms, from your cells to a plant cell to a yeast cell. In this case, it's the instruction to add a specific molecule called arginine.
"They have the same letters in their DNA—A,C,G, and T—but they read and interpret them in a totally different way."
A genomically recoded organism is an organism that we have re-engineered to use a new language: One that sees the genetic sequence AGG as an entirely different instruction. Right now we're working toward building such a GRO based on bacterial cells.
What's the benefit of changing that genetic language?
We're currently focusing on three major applications. The first is virus resistance. When viruses infect a host cell, they essentially inject their genome and hijack the cell to create more viruses. But this only works if both the virus and the cell are speaking the same genetic language. Since GROs speak a different language, the virus's genetic instructions to replicate itself would be misread, and the virus couldn't complete its life cycle.
The second is to introduce new biochemical capabilities that are not available in natural organisms. Almost all life shares a common genetic code, which explains how to translate genetic information into proteins. These proteins are composed of amino acids, and there are only 20 amino acids that are routinely used to make proteins. But there are plenty of unnatural amino acids that have useful chemical properties distinct from those 20. Thanks to great work done in a several other laboratories, we know of over 150 unnatural amino acids that we could use to expand protein function. People are already using these unnatural amino acids to make better drugs for treating disease.
"There are only 20 amino acids routinely used to make proteins. But there are plenty of *unnatural* amino acids.
Finally, the third application is bio-containment. Since these modified organisms may exhibit broad viral resistance, we want to make sure they can't escape into the world and mix with natural life. In addition to continuing to use our physical firewalls (keeping the organism inside of a laboratory, for example) we can also build genetic firewalls for GROs. To put it simply, we can redesign essential proteins so that the GRO can only survive if it has access to a certain unnatural amino acid that it won't find in the wild.
How do you go about recoding life's genetic language in the first place?
To understand how you'd recode an organism, you have to understand a bit about how life's shared genetic code works. Cells basically transcribe their genetic information in three-letter chunks, called codons. For example, the sequences ATG and TAG are codons. These three-letter codons are recognized by cellular machines called ribosomes, which basically match each codon with an amino acid building block. These codons can also tell a cell when to start or stop building more amino acids.
Now with just three spots and only four different types of nucleotides—which are the genetic letters A, T, G, and C—there are 64 possible codons. That's interesting, because this is far more codons than than the 20 amino acids that they code for. Because of this, many codons will actually code for the exact same amino acids—making them redundant.
To recode an organism, the first thing you have to do is to free up one of these redundant three-letter codons for some new task. Here's an example of how this works from one of our previous project: There are three different codons that tell a ribosome to 'stop' translation and to release the completed protein. They're TAG, TAA, and TGA. In 2013, my colleagues and I went through the DNA of a bacterial cell and identified and replaced every instance of TAG in the genetic code with TAA. When we finished, the TAG codon was no longer used in the bacteria, so we were able to delete the cellular machinery responsible for the TAG stop function. This resulted in an unused TAG codon that was free to be reassigned to a new function.
So how do you convince that old codon to do a new trick?
You need to introduce two pieces of biological machinery that, together, redefine the function of a specific codon. One piece of machinery is tRNA, which tells the ribosome which amino acid to incorporate. The other is a protein that tells the tRNA which amino acid to choose. Other labs have shown that you can borrow these pieces of machinery from distantly related organisms and modify them to incorporate a new, unnatural amino acids.
What steps did you take toward a full GRO in the new research you published today?
Well, we took an E. coli bacterium and chose seven different codons that we wanted to eliminate from the organism's genetic code—essentially leaving them blank. Our strategy was the same as I described earlier. We had to make 321 changes to reassign the TAG codon back in 2013. To reassign all 7 codons for this project will require 62,214 changes in genome, many of them in essential genes, where just a single error in one letter could kill our cell. In total, we had to change about one in every 65 genetic letters, or nucleotides.
Because these changes were so prevalent, it was most efficient to synthesize DNA and to build the entire 4 million base pair genomes from scratch in the lab. We're now in the process of testing it in living bacteria, by swapping it in chunk by chunk and testing whether we've created any unintended problems by getting rid of these seven redundant codons. Out of a total of 87 chunks, we've gone through 55 so far, and we've been encouraged that the majority of them support relatively healthy cells.
Do you expect any major problems before you start teaching your cells new tricks with old codons?
Oh man, there are certainly a bunch of challenges left, and we're sure there are ones lurking out there that we don't even know about yet.
Here's a huge example. Although multiple codons can code for the very same amino acids, that doesn't mean that they are equal. We already know that these codons can have different effects in other (and frankly, not very well understood) ways. For example, two seemingly redundant codons may have different effects on how much of a certain protein is produced, or exactly when it is produced.
We really don't know yet if radically changing the genetic code is going to be deleterious to our cell. There has been plenty of theoretical discussion about whether the normal genetic code is optimal, and whether other genetic codes would impair fitness. We may be able to test that hypothesis.
Expensive on-campus and West Campus housing pushes students struggling with the rising costs of college to look farther off for affordable living. Many of these include African-American students, who make up a meager 5 percent of the student population, and an increasing number of Hispanic students. While our campus encourages diversity, the lack of support for transportation options that would ultimately increase minority affordability seems to contradict this priority. The city should work to make transportation equal for all areas to ensure affordability and accessibility of Austin, with Proposition 1, the local urban rail proposal, being the first step of many that need to be taken.
For those without the option of a car, public transportation is often the only means of transit. Historically, infrastructure segregated white and black Austin between the west and east, respectively, but modern development and rising costs are pushing minorities even further east. In communities that don't have an East to West connection, limited transportation options inhibit commutes to work outside of their community, distant schools and even suitable grocery stores, as many eastern neighborhoods are food deserts with only convenience stores as sustenance options. The lack of adequate public transportation options isolate poorer communities, further distancing them from interaction and representation on a municipal level.
Congestion is usually given as the main concern when defending public transportation. Capital Metro buses assist many as an alternative to car trips that cost the average Austinite 40 additional hours per year in traffic. But this emphasis evades the importance of accessibility. Discontinued bus routes have hurt students in particular. Specifically, the disappearance of the Wickersham and Cameron Road shuttles hurt students looking to lease in an affordable area but rely on the bus as their only way to school. The current urban rail proposal would be especially beneficial for the many students residing at the Riverside student apartments, which are significantly less expensive than their closer West Campus counterparts.
City transportation discussions often revolve around public transportation as a means to address traffic issues and rapid growth, but rarely is equal accessibility even mentioned, much less made a priority. The new District 1 Council member will no doubt give a voice to these communities and bring accessibility to the forefront of the Austin equality conversation, but a “yes” to Proposition 1 would be a step in the right direction to expand public transportation and begin a pattern of prioritizing accessibility for traditionally overlooked and underserved communities. The city needs to be made accessible in all directions, not leaving low-income neighborhoods out of options.

When the basic costs of living move up there is bound to be shocks deep in the economy. As we mull over the humbling Census data, it is clear that many Americans are struggling in this modern day economy that protects the banks at the cost of the majority. Let us call a spade a spade. We are in the epicenter of the biggest financial disaster in history spurred on by the investment banks and their purchased colleagues in Washington D.C. How do we know this? Because no real reform has been enacted on Wall Street and we enter a decade of lost wages. The middle class is disappearing because bankers have used corporate welfare to shield themselves from the brutal corrections of the markets while the rest of Americans need to get by on an average of $25,000 per capita. Oscillating votes from Democrats to Republicans has done absolutely nothing. Many are now taking to the streets and protestors are now marching to Wall Street taking action. If you look at those who are protesting many are young, in their twenties and thirties, protesting what the media has failed to cover for years. If we look at the last decade we realize that our current financial system has captured our political system and things are starting to get volatile, just like the stock markets.
The rising costs of daily goods
You don't need a degree in economics to know the cost of living is getting more expensive. Take a look at the performance of various asset classes for the last year:
Look at all the items related to food in the green:
-Live cattle is up 21 percent over the last year. -Rough rice is up 33 percent over the last year -Lean hogs are up 13.3 percent over the last year -Soybeans are up 12 percent -Crude oil is up 5 percent -Sugar is up 2.7 percent
At the same time, the majority of Americans see a shrinking paycheck or no paycheck with the large number of unemployed. When trends like this persist, economies begin to get unstable. The Federal Reserve continues to devalue the U.S. dollar through its actions and specifically looks to aid the big banks at the expense of the public.
Poverty in the suburbs
One of the oddest symptoms of this crisis is suburb poverty. When we think of poverty we usually think of run down sections of Detroit or other inner cities. Yet poverty in the suburbs is growing with the middle class shrinking:
Source: CNN
“NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Guess where most people in poverty live? Hint: It's not in the inner cities or rural America. It's in the idyllic suburbs. A record 15.4 million suburban residents lived below the poverty line last year, up 11.5% from the year before, according to a Brookings Institution analysis of Census data released Thursday. That's one-third of the nation's poor. And their ranks are swelling fast, as jobs disappear and incomes decline amid the continued weak economy.”
Get ready for more of this as the middle class is ignored by Wall Street, the media, and politicians. Look at the map above, many of the top suburban poverty areas are in California, Texas, and Florida. Some of the wealthiest states also produce some of the poorest suburbs.
Incomes being eaten away
Contrary to the mind numbing waste that comes out from the mainstream media, we are living through some tough economic times. A good portion of this crisis was caused by graft, corruption, and rampant market manipulating greed. One out of three Americans has no savings so it isn't like your average Joe or Jane created the mortgage backed securities or derivatives that are crushing the global economy. What is worse as the price of items like food, education, and healthcare have soared the typical paycheck has contracted severely:
People don't feel like they are doing better because they are not. Household incomes are now back to the late 1990s yet with the cost of many things being more expensive. At the same time, you have banking CEOs making over 800 times that of the average worker for basically ripping you off and turning housing and education into another casino.
Wealth inequality
Wealth inequality in the United States is now at levels last seen in 1929, days before the Great Depression ravaged the country. It would be one thing if overall the country was getting wealthier but what you have is a small group stealing and protecting their hoarded wealth by robbing the middle class. This is the group that is supporting the economy with the bailouts, not the investment bankers that largely caused this mess and continue to finance hand picket politicians that will not disrupt their order. This is how wealth is distributed in the United States:
When the scale gets this tilted you are bound to have unrest. How is it that the financial sector is the largest recipient of bailout funds when they are the reason for this mess?
“Just to show you how twisted this system is you have taxpayer bailouts largely coming from the middle class going to the elite financial sector so they can recruit politicians that will continue to loot the wallets of the middle class.”
The system collapsed in 2007 although as you can see from the above unappealing household income chart, the middle class has been crushed for well over a decade. Many generations are suffering here and many now realize change is needed and people are taking to the streets.
Protestors arrested yet no arrests of the bankers that brought on this financial mess
The movement to Occupy Wall Street started a few days ago. There are many videos online of this movement but what you'll notice is a large and younger crowd. Since the recession began in 2007 there have been no large criminal investigations into Wall Street. Yet in a few short days, we have over 80 protestors arrested for simply speaking the truth. Where is the mainstream media on this? They'll cover a few protestors at a local bar or pet store but don't even bother shedding light on thousands of people protesting against Wall Street? One of the more disturbing videos is a police officer spraying what looks to be mace or pepper spray into a group of female protestors:
Where is the pepper spray for Wall Street bankers that looted our economy? It tells you a lot about where things stand in America today. And support is widespread. A comment made on the site stated the following:
“I love all who are involved. I wish I could be there. I am out of work and have not the money to go from Az. to there. I am 62 and proud of the young folks. Those my age seem dead in the head as a group. I pray this grows over time to make Woodstock look like a family gathering at the park. I have said,for years now, that change will start when the young see the big cats wear no clothes,…..and say so! I love you all. Don't fight or lash out. Be careful.”
Many are realizing that the fix is in. Why keep trading cards between Republicans and Democrats? Nothing has come from this because so much money is used to influence politics. As we have shown with data, only a small number of Americans control the real wealth in the nation so they continue to perpetrate the current system onward, even if it is disastrous for the overall economy.
I saw a startling statistic recently about the younger generation in our country:
“(The Atlantic) New census data released Thursday casts a shadow over the long-term impact of the recession on America's youth. During the last decade, the unemployment rate for young people spiked to the highest levels since World War II–only 55 percent of Americans aged 16 to 29 have jobs, a 12 percent drop from the employment rate in 2000. Faced with a grim outlook, many young people aren't leaving home until their 30s–the number of Americans aged 25 to 34 living with their parents jumped 25 percent during the recession. Last month, The New York Times called the collective youth “Generation Limbo,” but after seeing the new census data, Harvard economist Richard Freeman takes it a stage further. “These people will be scarred, and they will be called the ‘lost generation'–in that their careers would not be the same way if we had avoided this economic disaster,” Freeman told The Associated Press.”
There is little doubt that this is only the first of these kinds of movements. 55 percent of Americans aged 16 to 29 have no jobs, a jump of 12 percent from 2000. Since the recession started, those aged 25 to 34 living with their parents jumped 25 percent. Keep in mind we now live at a time where college education attainment is at record levels. This conjures up vision of oligarchy ran countries where people with Ph.D.s are operating as cab drivers. Is this the vision we want for America? Some clearly do not want this bleak future and are speaking out.

It's as if Matthias Müller, the CEO of German car giant Volkswagen, thought they were talking to one of their own executives when they wrote to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in March to object to the company's treatment over the Dieselgate affair.
Müller complained about one of Juncker's commissioners and asked the boss to have a word with them and tighten the leash. They expressed hope this would bring an end to a story that has caused them considerable headaches.
Since the affair broke in the fall of 2015, the question of whether Volkswagen will compensate millions of affected European customers has been a source of frustration to the commissioners involved — in particular, Vera Jourová, who oversees the justice and consumers portfolio. They don't have the power to force Volkswagen's hand, but that doesn't mean they haven't been trying to put political pressure on the carmaker to offer compensation.
They successfully annoyed Müller, who expressed their irritation at the Commission's efforts in a letter to Juncker dated March 27, obtained by POLITICO. "In our view, it is not within the competence of the Commission to enforce European consumer rights," they wrote.
Müller might be the head of the EU's "biggest industrial corporation," as they wrote in their letter. But they made a major misjudgment about the way Juncker sees their role and how they run their Commission.
Here are three clear lessons from an exchange of strongly worded letters.
1. When on the defensive, don't be aggressive.
In their letter, Müller said Brussels — specifically in the form of Jourová — was overstepping its competencies. They called for the Commission to stop pushing the issue, saying there was no legal basis for compensating consumers — and accused Brussels of being partisan: "I urge you to ensure that the Commission complies with its duty of being impartial," Müller wrote.
Juncker pointedly disagreed. "The Commission always ensures that it acts within its responsibilities," they wrote back in a letter to Müller on Friday, also obtained by POLITICO. They also cited a legal basis for the Commission's action (it's Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004, for those interested) on consumer protection cooperation.
While the Commission may have no executive powers in the matter, it is "facilitating this exchange of information" — as there's a lot at stake for Brussels, "particularly as it concerns a process involving more than 8.5 million consumers in the EU," Juncker wrote. That's the number of cars in Europe that were found to have included defeat devices, able to skirt emissions tests.
Juncker's message was: Do your homework. We're a political Commission and we can only win in this game.
2. Don't think I don't talk to my people.
In a February meeting with Jourová, Müller had rejected their call to compensate customers. Brussels didn't let up, however. In March, national consumer authorities, with the help from Jourová, started preparing a joint enforcement action.
In their letter, Müller wrote that "there is no legal basis for compensation," reiterating VW's commitment to fixing affected cars by fall this year.
"However, I have repeatedly found that the Commission is asking for compensation, although Commissioner Jourová and I agreed that compensation can not be considered," Müller wrote.
That was news to Juncker. "According to their own statement, Ms Jourová has encouraged you to offer a voluntary indemnity as a commercial gesture, while fully respecting the legal framework," they wrote back two weeks later — and after asking for Jourová's view, according to Commission sources.
"Such a step would show that your company is not indifferent to the inconvenience that has been caused for consumers since October 2015," they said. Offering voluntary compensation, as a "commercial gesture" to affected consumers could also "counteract efforts to lodge civil claims for damages in member states."
What Juncker meant: Don't expect me to be disloyal to my people. And don't believe everything you read about my (or my lieutenant's) tough management style. Sure, I'm in charge, but if you attack one of my team, you attack me.
3. Don't bother me again. And don't complain in writing, stupid.
"Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information," Müller wrote.
Juncker won't.
"I would like to encourage you to continue your dialogue with Commissioner Jourová on all the above points, so that in the end a fair treatment of all consumers in the EU can be ensured," they replied.
Letters to the Commission president are archived, as are their answers — and they occasionally get leaked. How could anyone imagine that Juncker would reply in any other way than they did?
Juncker's message, at least implicitly, was: What were you thinking? Stop writing letters and call me if you want to talk.

The transformation of a city striving for connection, unity and a new identity suddenly looks possible.
To put it in a pun, London may finally be on the track it wants.
Friday's announcement that the province will begin the environmental assessment for a high-speed rail line connecting Windsor, London, Kitchener-Waterloo and Toronto means more than a quick ride to Blue Jays, Leafs and Raptors games — although there's nothing wrong with that.
The line would connect this city, which can feel more an island surrounded by farmers' fields, with the rest of the world in countless ways. And it could start soldering connections within the city that's the dream of the London Plan and the thousands of people who support it and who voted in a radically different city council.
“This is a real game changer for London,” London MPP Deb Matthews said after the announcement by Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca. “We'll actually be getting closer to Toronto than further away,” they said of the next step in the plan that could eventually give Londoners a one-hour, 15-minute train ride to the Big Smoke.
In recent years, they said, London seems farther and farther away from the big city because it takes longer to travel there.
“There's no certainty how long it's going to take to get to Toronto or back home again . . . that's a big barrier to companies looking to locate or expand in London.”
The high-speed rail, they said, “opens up our world of opportunity.”
But the tracks won't be on the ground anytime soon. Del Duca said they couldn't even guess as to when construction might begin.
“It's impossible to make that determination today,” they said after announcing the next stage of the project would begin early next year.
The environmental assessment, which could last as many as six years, includes consultations with municipalities, business leaders, First Nations communities and conservation authorities to determine the best route and technology for the rail, Del Duca said.
The high-speed rail line is one part of the Liberals $29-billion, 10-year infrastructure plan to address transit, roads, bridges and highways.
It's been criticized for being too slow, but Del Duca said the process is quicker than it used to be. Before 2008, they said, transit environmental assessments could take more than a decade.
“People have to understand this is a very significant and massive transportational project,” they said. “It's very important that we get this right.”
The London Free Press's multi-year examination of the city's identity, called What's London, explored the concept of the city as a collection of disconnected elements in turn disconnected from the rest of the province.
The city's ReThink London exercise and resulting London Plan, prompted in part by the newspaper series, concluded transit within the city and connections to the rest of the province were key to the city's renewal.
“Exciting, exceptional and connected” is the London Plan's stated vision for the city.
Many of the 11 new council members embrace that vision. Given London's tight finances, that vision won't be easy to accomplish without some kind of game changer from the province or elsewhere.?
So it's no surprise the announcement was greeted warmly Friday by members of the business community, student leaders and several city politicians, including a pleased-looking Mayor Matt Brown.
“It's good news for London. It's good news for our long-term economic development strategy,” said Brown, adding a high-speed rail would complement London's rapid transit program and overall London plan.

WHAT OTHERS SAID
Teresa Armstrong, New Democrat MPP for London-Fanshawe: “Today Londoners got some bad news when they found out unemployment in London is up. But the government seems more interested in burying the news by doubling down on an unfunded high-speed rail promise. This latest study will create work for consultants, not people in the Southwest.”
David Billson, president of rtraction web design company: “This opens up opportunity. We are starving for talent here. We know that London is a great place to raise a family, but we haven't been able to capture the imagination of the young professional who wants a Toronto lifestyle. Having the Toronto lifestyle an hour away by train makes our community more compelling. Someone can (live in London) but get to Toronto for a concert or a Blue Jays game.”
Kapil Lakhotia, head of London Economic Development Corp: “This is really welcome news, as we are looking to develop our knowledge base.”
Mayor Matt Brown: “I want you to picture if you could (that) London could become a transportation hub. If you live in St. Thomas or Woodstock or Strathroy, you could drive to White Oaks Mall, hop onto rapid transit here in London and connect to our high-speed rail and be in Toronto in no time.”
Matt Helfand, Western University Student Union president: “It's a very exciting prospect. There's something to be said about the ability to get back and forth from our hometown to university city in a quick fashion. We like the idea, it's very exciting, we think it will be great for the overall economy, but for students to benefit it has to be affordable.”

CURRENT TRAVEL TIMES
Getting to Toronto now from London:
ViaRail: Most trips take about two hours, 10 minutes.
Private vehicle: About two hours, 15 minutes via Hwy. 401, but traffic conditions can lengthen that significantly.
— — —
THE VISION
The plan: High-speed rail to connect Windsor, London, Kitchener-Waterloo and Pearson International Airport (another high-speed connection will take passengers downtown from Pearson).
Travel time: Undetermined, but train with connections could get Londoners to downtown Toronto in one hour, 15 minutes.
Cost: No estimates, but the high-speed line is one part of the Liberals' $29-billion, 10-year infrastructure plan to address transit, roads, bridges and highways.
For much of the past decade, the United States has begged, pleaded, and threatened China to change its disruptive currency practices, which artificially make Chinese exports cheap and foreign goods sold in China expensive.
Today, in the midst of prolonged economic weakness, with the U.S. trade deficit rising and unemployment persistently high -- and Chinese-owned U.S. debt probably exceeding $2 trillion -- legislative pressure is again growing to raise trade barriers against Chinese goods. Since June 2010, China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to rise nearly five percent against the dollar. But there has been no slowdown in its manipulative purchases of U.S. assets, implying that the renminbi remains deeply undervalued.
The United States clearly needs to ratchet up the pressure on China, and the next installment of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, scheduled for early May in Washington, provides a natural opportunity. But what action can the United States take to persuade China to stop its harmful behavior? Minor trade measures, such as a few more antidumping or countervailing duty cases to levy penalty duties on U.S. imports of Chinese paper or steel, will not make an appreciable dent in the trade deficit or the unemployment rate. And major trade measures, such as a tariff or quota against all Chinese exports, would likely be ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization and would almost certainly provoke Chinese retaliation against U.S. exporters. Moreover, a trade war across the Pacific would quickly create vested interests among protected U.S. and Chinese industries, making the retaliatory measures hard to unwind. For these reasons, it is no surprise that U.S. policymakers have been reluctant to launch a trade war with China; officials in Beijing understand this reluctance well and, accordingly, have viewed U.S. threats as bluffs.
A more productive course would be to tax Chinese currency manipulation rather than Chinese exports. In order to undervalue the renminbi against the dollar, China drives the dollar's value
It is exactly one month since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision that Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes would cease to be legal tender acceptable for payments in settlement of transactions. There was some provision for exchange or deposit of old notes at banks, but with specified limits on sums and time.
The past century has witnessed several demonetisations, when governments have decided that existing national currencies, guaranteed by the sovereign, are no longer legal tender. It has happened in: (a) countries that have experienced hyperinflation—where inflation rates are measured per week or per month rather than per annum—such as Germany in 1923 or Argentina thrice in the 20th century; (b) countries on the verge of economic collapse, such as Zimbabwe in 2015; and (c) countries in deep economic or political crises, such as Ghana in 1982, Nigeria in 1984, Myanmar in 1987, Zaire in 1993 and the USSR in 1991. In most, outcomes were failures, if not disasters.

The situation in India is completely different from what it was in these countries at the time of demonetisation. The economy is characterized by rapid growth and price stability. The polity is a vibrant democracy with an elected government. Hence, past experience elsewhere has little relevance. Yet, history matters.
What, then, is the rationale for demonetisation in India? The stated objective is economic. The government hopes to eradicate black money, as also combat corruption, smuggling, and counterfeit notes. The unstated objective is political. The government, exactly halfway through its five-year term, concerned about perceptions that little had changed, wanted to do something bold. For the Prime Minister, there is also a pro-poor populism, in acting against the rich who evaded laws, and in reaching out to people directly, without any intermediation through their political party. The state elections to come in early 2017 are part of the same political calculus, not only because Modi wishes to be seen as a man of the people, but also because demonetisation will wipe out any hordes of black money held in cash by opposition political parties. Of course, it must be recognized that economics and politics, closely intertwined, are inseparable. Indeed, their interaction is likely to shape future outcomes.

The implementation of the demonetisation decision requires evaluation, even at the end of one month, because it has affected the lives of most people. The logistics of this exercise would have been tough in a perfect world. But it is exceedingly difficult in a situation where 86% of currency notes in circulation have been withdrawn at one stroke in what is essentially a cash economy. Poor implementation has made the situation far worse. The replacement notes, either unseen (Rs500) or of little use (Rs2,000), are scarce. Millions have queued at banks and ATMs, which do not have enough cash. Getting one's own money is an elusive quest.
Frequent changes in rules about what a citizen can or cannot do suggest day-to-day reactions rather than prior planning. The stipulated limit on exchange of old notes for new at banks has been changed thrice and the facility has been simply discontinued five weeks before the announced date. The acceptance of old notes for specified transactions, at petrol pumps, pharmacies or public utilities, has been introduced and withdrawn in a haphazard stop-go manner. The regulations about the deposit of old notes at banks, or the limits on what people can withdraw from their own accounts, have kept changing. The ground was simply not prepared.
ALSO READ | How demonetisation has impacted key sectors
What does demonetisation mean for ordinary people? Some essential facts provide part of the answer. In India, just 53% of adults have bank accounts, but two-fifths of these accounts are dormant. And only 15% of existing bank accounts are used to make or receive payments. Bank penetration would have been far less but for the 250 million accounts that were opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) during 2014-16, of which 60 million accounts have zero balances even now. It is clear that almost half our population has no access to the banking system, and an even larger proportion does not use it.
Thus, an overwhelming proportion of economic transactions—more than 95%— are in cash. This is particularly true of rural India, home to more than two-thirds of our people, where the density of bank branches and ATMs is less than one-fourth that in urban areas. It is just as true of the informal economy in urban India— construction, wholesale retail trade, hotels and restaurants, domestic services, transport, and small-scale manufacturing—where sales and purchases are mostly in cash; so are wages. Given this reality, the quest for a cashless economy could be futile, even if we assume that everyone can buy and use smartphones. It is a noble idea, but its time has not yet come.
It is no surprise that this massive notebandi has disrupted lives. The demonetisation of Rs500 notes, which constituted about 46% of cash in the economy, has been particularly damaging, since these are the medium of exchange in the market and store of value at home for most ordinary people. It would serve little purpose to recount stories of difficulties faced, or tragedies experienced, by people without money in hospitals, pharmacies, and bank queues. There is widespread distress in rural areas and much hardship in towns and cities, particularly for the poor. Even if the object is to penalize the dishonest rich—the idea has popular support—should 99% of people pay this price for punishing the guilty 1%? The irony is that their own money is now being rationed to people by government. The inconvenience is turning into irritation. If cash remains scarce for long, it could turn into resentment and anger.
The economics underlying demonetisation has three flaws. First, all black money is not held in cash, and all cash is not black money. Political parties, corrupt government officials, lawyers, doctors, traders or builders, might keep some black money in cash, but more than 90% is in the form of gold, real estate, foreign accounts and used in consumption or business expenditures. Similarly, less than 10% of cash in the economy would be black money. Second, it is very difficult to separate black money from white money because the distinction is not once-and-for-all. White money used to purchase something becomes black if the shopkeeper does not pay sales tax but could become white again if they then buys something with it for which they are billed with tax. Third, demonetisation would indeed wipe out stocks of black money held in cash if it cannot be laundered. But it could be business-as-usual with new notes as flows of black money resume, unless there are changes in government regulations or behaviour patterns of individuals and institutions that induce such transactions.
The possible macroeconomic consequences of demonetisation are cause for concern. Cash is the lifeblood of the economy, 86% of which is gone, while complete replacement could take months. This shock-therapy is bound to disrupt real economic activity. Consumption expenditure in the economy will drop sharply, for ordinary people starved of cash, and for the rich who cannot spend their black money on eating-out, luxury goods or tourism. Investment simply cannot pick up with this massive liquidity crunch, which means no cash for the informal economy, and erosion of investor confidence. Output will contract. So will employment, as workers are laid off, hurting livelihoods and dampening consumption demand to reduce output further through multiplier effects. Economic growth, already stuttering, is bound to slow down. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth projected for 2016-17 will not materialize. Even when things return to normal, macro-economic effects might linger and dampen growth for longer.
What does this mean for the government? The total value of demonetized notes is about Rs14 trillion, and Rs11.5 trillion has been deposited, while Rs350 billion has been exchanged, in banks. People can continue to deposit old notes in banks until 30 December and with the RBI until 30 March. If the total amount that is exchanged and deposited is less than Rs14 trillion, the difference would accrue to the RBI as a windfall gain since its liabilities would be reduced by that amount. In principle, reduced liabilities on balance sheets are not transferable to the profit-and-loss accounts. But that might be possible as the RBI is not a corporate entity. If this sum is treated as a surplus of income over expenditure, under the RBI Act, its board decides how much of the surplus can be paid to government as dividend, keeping in mind its responsibility for macroeconomic stability.
It is not possible to predict what the reduction in RBI liabilities will be following demonetisation. Much will depend on the ability, or ingenuity, of people to move their cash holdings into bank deposits. The obvious avenues are deposits of less than Rs2.5 lakh, cash-in-hand held by small businesses, and the agricultural sector which is income-tax-exempt. In three weeks, Rs365 billion has been deposited in PMJDY accounts, almost doubling total balances. Laundering old notes at a discount is a new business. The government, worried about such leakages, introduced yet another amnesty scheme on 28 November, which allows cash deposits in banks without limits until 30 December, but 50% is payable as tax-cum-penalty and another 25% is placed as a zero-interest four-year deposits.
Obviously, politics trumped economics in the demonetisation decision. But Modi has taken a big gamble. And the stakes are high. If the negative consequences for people and for the economy persist, or become worse, economics might trump politics. Will it? The actual outcome is uncertain, unpredictable and unknown. Perhaps only the results of the forthcoming state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, will reveal what people really think.

Barcelona-Athletic Live
Victoriano Sánchez Arminio, president of the referee committee (Comité Técnico de Árbitros, CTA), has announced that they have already filed a complaint against FC Barcelona star, Gerard Piqué. According to Sport, the CTA has sent a letter to the Spanish Football Federation filing a double complaint for the words used by the central defender following the conclusion of the Copa del Rey defeat to Athletic Bilbao, and the most recent Liga game against Villarreal.
Cup frustration runneth over
The first complaint has been filed after comments made by the Spanish defender following incidents in the Athletic cup game - a possible penalty foul on Neymar and the aggression shown by Aduriz to Umtiti. In response to this Piqué was heard saying, "we already know how this works".
Gerard Pique wasn't happy after the defeat to Athletic. JUAN FLOR (DIARIO AS)
Drawing the same conclusion
The second comes on the back of their words, and actions, after the game against Villarreal. "Every week the referees show me to be right," said the Blaugrana after the game where their side had two penalty claims waved away.

With the two complaints going down different disciplinary routes within the RFEF, the process for each could last around a month.
But if this blog was that blog, we'd be demanding an investigation over whether swearing in Orange Julius Caesar was a sign of the apocalypse. There were no reports of mass avian suicides when Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi were sworn in. Those things only happened in the movies and television.
And speaking of swearing in, here's another sign of that neutral umpire just calling balls and strikes:
Behind closed doors Chief Justice John Roberts swore in members of speaker designate John A. Boehner's staff this morning during a private ceremony.
…the speaker designee's spokesperson believes it could be the first time staff was sworn in by a Chief Justice.
Of course it was, it occurred about the same time that Antonin Scalia was “teaching” Michele Bachmann's band of maniacs that the latter had no 14th Amendment protections — other than their party affiliation.

With only one top ten seat unconfirmed for the 2012 season - the #10 Lotus - the remaining ‘silly season' points of interest revolve around the midfield and backmarker teams. One team yet to confirm its 2012 drivers is Red Bull's ‘junior' team, Toro Rosso, who has four Red Bull backed drivers competing for two seats. As Jaime Alguersuari, Sébastien Buemi, Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne vie for these seats, what we see is an inevitable problem of Red Bull's young driver programme; a backlog of talent.
When Red Bull first acquired Minardi and renamed it Toro Rosso prior to the 2006 season, it was for the purpose of nurturing the skills of drivers who were a part of Red Bull's young driver programme before they graduated to the ‘senior' team. Yet only one driver has done so, Sebastian Vettel. Having won two world championships and still only 24 they are not looking like leaving Red Bull anytime soon.
Red Bull has backed so many young drivers in the past decade that despite having owned two Formula 1 teams for the past six years, it does not have space to bring all of its drivers into Formula 1, even if they look good enough to be there. In 2005 we saw Tonio Liuzzi and Christian Klien sharing the second seat at Red Bull Racing and in 2011 Ricciardo was parachuted in at HRT mid-season after Alguersuari started producing stronger drives that meant they could not be dropped from Toro Rosso.
Despite having backed many drivers, only one has won a Grand Prix; no prizes for guessing who. A rather cynical view is that Red Bull backs so many drivers so that other teams cannot sign them instead. I do not subscribe to this, but see their backing of so many drivers as rather as buying 100 lottery tickets in the hope that one of them is a winning one. So far they've only hit the jackpot with Vettel. But, if Vettel is the multi-million pound jackpot, Alguersuari and Buemi aren't worth nothing. It would be hard to dispose of them.
The list of drivers previously backed by Red Bull is sizeable. One thing is clear: Red Bull and Helmut Marko are not afraid to withdraw their backing if they do not believe a driver is good enough. Scott Speed, Christian Klien and Tonio Liuzzi did not last long in Red Bull F1 teams. But they are the few who made it to F1, a quick glance at the list of formerly Red Bull backed drivers and you see the many who didn't make it. Some names remain fresh in the mind such as Brendon Hartley or Virgin reserve driver Robert Wickens. But there are others you have to strain your memory to remember; Adrian Zaugg anybody?
At a time when financial backing is as important as ever to move up the motorsport ladder Red Bull's backing can be seen as a blessing. But it also has its problems for those drivers involved and could easily lead to them becoming disappointed or frustrated.
Alguersuari and Buemi both made their debuts in 2009 and despite solid 2011 seasons their positions are under threat. Their performances in 2011 do not warrant their axing, but Helmut Marko was damning with their faint praise of the duo recently stating Red Bull are ‘not looking for a good F1 driver, we are looking for a top F1 driver.' Herein lies the problem, Red Bull have too many drivers worthy (if not ‘top') of an F1 seat and not enough seats to fit them all in. Prior to the Canadian and European Grand Prixs, it looked like it would be easy for Red Bull to give Alguersuari the chop but they have since upped their game. Rather than justifying giving a driver a Toro Rosso drive, it seems harder to justify one of the four not having a drive.
Things move quickly. Alguesuari is 21, Buemi 23, yet there's still the possibility neither will be on the grid next year having competed in F1 for three seasons. The worst case scenario for them is they may not start a Grand Prix again. It's hard to see where they would go outside of the Red Bull stable without the drinks manufacturer's backing.
When Ricciardo was confirmed at HRT before the British Grand Prix, it looked like they were the one next in line for a Toro Rosso drive. Yet already they could be out of favour with Vergne taking a seat instead. Some rumours suggest the Australian will be off to Caterham. With four drivers worthy of an F1 seat we could see a Red Bull driver at Caterham and HRT next year. One rumour suggests a particularly harsh outcome for Alguersuari, a seat alongside de la Rosa at the ‘Spanish national team' HRT.
Marko's ambition is to have another driver who has come through the Red Bull young driver programme partner Vettel at Red Bull Racing. Yet two men mean this scenario, for 2012 and perhaps beyond, will not happen; Christian Horner and Mark Webber. This week Marko has said one of the four drivers competing for the Toro Rosso seats will eventually replace Webber at the senior team. You'd think Buemi or Alguersuari would be favourites given their extra experience, yet Horner has shown no interest in signing either of these two. Ricciardo and Vergne seem to be the better long term prospects, but whether they race for Red Bull Racing depends on Horner and Webber. As much as it might frustrate Marko, they are not the man making decisions at Red Bull Racing. Horner is. Webber will be 36 at the end of the 2012 season, who's to say they won't continue on for one, two or maybe more seasons after 2012? Rubens Barrichello is 39 and refusing to announce their retirement, Pedro de la Rosa has signed for HRT at the age of 40, David Coulthard didn't retire (ending their career at Red Bull) until they were 38 and Michael Schumacher will be racing at 43 next year. With Red Bull Racing having won both championships two years running, Horner has no reason to change their line-up. Webber is a driver capable of winning Grand Prix and has helped Red Bull to two constructors' championships. As long as that is the case why should Horner drop him? They have a winning formula at the moment.
We do not know how much longer Webber will continue, but it's possible that Alguersuari's, Buemi's, Ricciardo's or Vergne's careers could stall as they're stuck in a mid-field team waiting for Webber retire. Even when they do, there's no guarantee that Horner will choose a replacement from the Red Bull driver scheme. We heard the Hamilton to Red Bull rumours back in the summer, what if Red Bull were to dominate again in 2012 and Hamilton lost patience with McLaren for again not giving them a car to win the championship with? If the 2008 World Champion came knocking would Horner really turn them away in favour of Alguersuari, Buemi or any other Red Bull young driver? Marko hasn't always got their own way on drivers in the past. Back in 2001, when Red Bull sponsored Sauber, Marko wanted the team to sign Red Bull backed driver Enrique Bernoldi. Peter Sauber saw Kimi Raikkonen as the better prospect and ignored Red Bull's and Marko's wishes. The rest, as they say, is history…
The fates of Alguersuari, Buemi, Ricciardo and Vergne for 2012 are unknown. Perhaps we'll see all of them on the grid, perhaps only some. Either way, at least two of them are going to be left disappointed with the outcome. Whatever opportunities they do get though they better make the most of them before the next lot of Red Bull young drivers are snapping at their heels…
Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system doesn't officially go on sale until October 26th, but at least one Walmart store has copies ready for customers. The Verge reader Aaron sent us a tip that their local Walmart store has several boxed copies on display, with a price of $69.99 for the Windows 8 Pro upgrade. Aaron didn't purchase a copy, but Walmart employees informed them the copies were available to purchase and that the store just wasn't fully promoting them yet — despite them being on display fully.
Microsoft officially unveiled its final box art for Windows 8 last week, alongside pre-orders for the operating system and associated hardware. It's not clear if anyone has managed to purchase a copy of Windows 8 copy early, but the fact they're on display in stores means it's more than likely that a retailer will break the street date on Microsoft's new operating system.
Thanks, Aaron!
According to the Pew Research Center, about 10,000 baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- have been turning 65 each day for nearly three years now. No doubt many of those are celebrating that milestone by retiring from their jobs, but others are continuing to work -- either through choice or need.
On the face of it, that seems like a heck of a lot of new jobs should be opening up, yet unemployment sits well above the 7% mark. Worse yet, young people have uncomfortably high unemployment rates: 21.4% for those 16 to 19 years old, and 12.9% for those aged 20 to 24. For those aged 55 and over, however, the jobless rate is a mere 5.3%.
This discrepancy looks even more glaring when recent studies report that almost half of recent college graduates are working at jobs for which they are grossly overqualified -- jobs that that don't even require a college degree. Conversely, the middle-aged crowd exhibits a high level of enthusiasm for their work, with nine out of 10 respondents aged 50-plus telling Associated Press pollsters that they are satisfied with their jobs. The AP notes that, overall, older workers typically feel happier in their work than younger workers do.
Are retirement-aged workers staying in the workforce longer, thereby keeping good-paying, satisfying jobs out of the grasp of younger wage earners? It's a complicated question, but even though older people are working longer, that isn't necessarily the reason younger workers are being left high and dry, in terms of employment.
A changing economic landscape is extending work lives
For some, increased human longevity is part of the reason to 're working past their planned retirement date. As the population ages, the Social Security Administration has been steadily increasing the age at which retirees may access full benefits. For example, while people born in 1937 or earlier may retire and collect their full allowance at age 65, those born in 1960 or later will have to wait a full two years more for the same benefit.
More importantly, the financial crisis took its toll on older workers' retirement portfolios, in addition to taking a bite out of home values. A recent survey of employed persons aged 50 and over showed that the average retirement age of 57 prior to the downturn has been pushed up by five years to age 62 following the recession. Over 80% of respondents thought they would have to continue to work, in some capacity, after their retirement.
Another issue concerns the skill level of these experienced workers. In many states -- particularly in the Northeast -- the percentage of skilled workers 45 and older tops 60%. Nationally, nearly 19% of skilled tradespeople are between 55 and 64. This makes them very valuable to employers, who are beginning to institute incentive programs to encourage older employees to stay on beyond retirement age.
Does this trend impact younger workers?
The foregoing would seem to indicate that fewer skilled, decent-paying jobs are becoming vacant as new workers come into the workforce, squeezing out new, younger employees, but that doesn't seem to be the case. A study administered last year by the Pew Charitable Trusts shows that the "lump-of-labor" theory, which posits that delayed retirement by the baby boomer generation would "crowd out" new workers, doesn't hold water.
In actuality, the Pew Study found evidence that every time baby boomers' employment rate increased by 1% during the latest recession, young workers' hourly pay rose 0.28%. Taking the longer view, the study looked at data from 1977 to 2011 and came up with similar findings: The same 1% rise in boomers' employment spurred a 0.10% drop in youth unemployment, a 0.21% increase in younger workers' employment, and a 0.13% boost in their weekly work hours.
So while the young are having trouble lowering their unemployment rate, their troubles can't be linked directly to the baby boomers. A couple of issues are worth noting, however. One is that companies are loath to train workers once they are hired and prefer to either keep workers that are already trained or hire only those that they feel can hit the ground running.
The other is that colleges may not be preparing young workers adequately for the workplace, something that employers have been griping about for some time. Considering the rate of unemployment and underemployment plaguing the young these days, I believe that they would be likely to concur.
In the nine months since Gahanna voters rejected a second attempt to raise the city's income tax, residents have joined Facebook groups with names such as "Take Back Gahanna." They've written screeds denouncing cuts in annual fireworks and plans to close city pools. One grass-roots group even petitioned to rewrite the city charter and replace the full-time mayor with a city manager.
Trying to raise the city�s income tax was no small endeavor. Nobody had attempted it in more than 30 years, but Gahanna put it on the ballot twice in six months last year, hoping that voters might change their minds the second time around.
They didn�t.
What has happened in the nine months since has both agitated and focused the city. Residents have joined Facebook groups with names such as �Take Back Gahanna.� They�ve written screeds denouncing the fallout of those failed ballot issues, including cuts in annual fireworks and plans to close city pools. One grass-roots group even petitioned to rewrite the city charter and replace the full-time mayor with a city manager.
�I love the city, but you know in the last couple of years, we�ve seen some things we�re not so happy with,� said resident Joe Gergley, a former Gahanna City Council candidate who has criticized city decisions on social media.
�In general, I think the city has not been doing the best job for their citizens,� said Jeannie Hoffman, a Gahanna resident for nearly 21 years. �I�d like to see them listen to the people for once.�
Meanwhile, city leaders say they�ve been struggling to curb misinformation, streamline spending and show residents, without question, where local money is going. For the first time, Gahanna published a comprehensive annual financial report, a 164-page document that it put online so that anyone can pick apart its $26 million budget.
�We�re just going to continue on methodically in terms of going over the ways money is spent,� said Councilwoman Karen Angelou.
�The hole at the moment for me,� council President Brian Larick said, �is establishing some sense of direction.�
Critics of the city are growing more active. Council members are considering the future and realizing they need a plan. Becky Stinchcomb, the city�s mayor for the past decade, has announced that they won�t seek re-election when their term is up at the end of 2015, leaving the top job open.
�We�re talking about resources, we�re talking about the direction of the city, we�re talking about leadership and leadership form,� Stinchcomb said. �Yeah, I think it is a critical juncture."
Last year, facing budget gaps and roads in need of repair, the city placed an income-tax increase on the May ballot. Voters were asked to raise the 1.5 percent rate to 2.5 percent. Fifty-two percent voted no.
Dismayed by the low turnout � only 12 percent of the city�s eligible, registered voters � the council put the increase back on the ballot in November. That time, 54 percent shot it down.
�I took a huge risk,� Stinchcomb said about asking for the tax increase, �and I said it�s the right thing to do. I believe it. And I�m paying the price.�
There are no polls measuring the popularity of the mayor in Gahanna, but complaints to Stinchcomb�s office are on the rise. The city cut funding for July Fourth fireworks, and although a local business took over the show -- throwing a party so residents could watch the fireworks from nearby communities -- the mayor's office was flooded with complaints. This year, a plan to close the city pools next year sparked even greater outrage.
�You�re thinking that it�s not for real, they�re not serious,� said Debbie Burchfield, a Gahanna resident who recently joined a growing effort to save the city�s two pools. �Then it�s coming down to, yes, it is serious.�
In the midst of all this, a petition began circulating to put a city manager in charge instead of a mayor. Jennifer Chrysler, a member of the group working to get the charter changes on the November ballot, said the proposal wasn�t a referendum against the current administration but rather a chance to explore something new after Stinchcomb indicated that they won�t seek re-election.
The petition got only about half the signatures it needed, but the idea isn�t dead. Michelle Gusmus, who grew up in Gahanna and returned after college, said they hope to persuade the city to set up a charter-review commission. Gusmus said something needs to change; they and their husband have discussed leaving their hometown if it doesn�t.
�If you travel down the main roads in Gahanna, they look old, they look dilapidated,� they said. � It�s so disheartening because I know we can be better.�
Some council members acknowledge that it�s time to take a sharper look at Gahanna and where it�s headed. In fact, they say, it�s a priority, beyond all discussion of fireworks or swimming pools or city charters.
�I think the biggest challenge that the city faces now is that we lack a vision of where we want to go as a city,� said Councilman Ryan Jolley. �I would liken it to attempting to put together a jigsaw puzzle without knowing what the picture is supposed to be.�

Oh, Luna. You sweet, thoughtful, unintentional douchebag, you.
You know, you and I have a lot in common.
Actually, that's a lie.
For starters, you know how to clean a dishwasher. You like to eat Corn Flakes (Really, who enjoys Corn Flakes?). Also, you're an INTJ. I'm an ISFP, or so I would like to think, had I finished the other 89 questions. The last time I took a quiz, I was supposed to find out what Arthurian character I was most like. Instead, I accidentally took a quiz on what character from Arthur I was most like.
Which explained a lot.
You know what else we don't have in common?
Hope.
Because I'm sure you had that same hopeful feeling I had when you sent my package. The hopeful feeling I had when I signed up for Secret Santa and said to myself, “You're already dubbed ‘that mailroom girl who has frequent seizures and runs.' How can it get any worse?”
You know when you're watching a horror movie and some character's going into the attic? Like, no matter how many times you scream, “No! No! Don't go in there! What are you dooooing?! No!”, the idiot still goes in there?
I'm that idiot.
So, flashback to last week. It's Harry Potter trivia night at a local bar (I'm not even going to discuss the disgusting fact that you haven't finished the movies, much less the books). I know I'm gonna kill it; the only thing I know better than Harry Potter is how to spell my first and last name (The middle's up for debate. You think my parents would know how to spell it — they gave it to me). Anyways, I'm pumped, I'm excited, I know I'm gonna win. Besides, how many 21+ Harry Potter fans are free on a Tuesday night in Seattle?
Answer: A shitload.
Like, if people were Pumpkin Spice Lattes, that bar would have been run into the ground by yoga pants and UGG boots. To put it simply, there were over 400 people in a bar that has a capacity of 100. After doing some quick mental math and realizing that there was no way in hell I would be able to outrun 399 other people in a fire, I left. And boy, was I bitter. So I asked myself, “What's the best way to get back at this bar? Buying out a rival bar and entering my five best workers in a local flip cup competition? No,” I quickly realized, “I'm gonna buy craploads of drinks at another, rival bar.” So I did. I mulled over the idea of putting a damper on everyones night by calling the Fire Marshal to report both my bitterness and a possible fire hazard as I drank. And drank. And drank.
Now, Luna, this may be where you start asking yourself, “How does any of this have to do with me?” Well hold your horses, I'm getting there.
I'm what some call a “lightweight.” Two ciders and I'm gone. Well, that night, a night of bitterness, disappointment, and perturbation (Turns out, some people in Seattle have a borderline-creepy obsession with Harry Potter), I drank more than two drinks. I crashed and ended up missing my class the next morning.
I digress.
Flash forward a couple of days. I get an email from my school telling me I need to pick up a package. At first I was like, “Whatever. They probably just emailed the wrong person.” Then I get another email. And another. And another. On Sunday, I, being the wonderful person that I am, had to show my roommate how to pick up their mail (Don't ask) and I just said, “Screw it. I'm gonna figure out why I keep receiving emails to pick up another person's package.” So I marched down there, taught my roommate how to open their mailbox with a key, and asked the front desk whether or not I really had a package. Well, oh ho ho. Turns out I had not just one package, but two. Now here's the part where I start acting like an idiot.
At this point, I knew four things: One, this package came from Nevada. Two, I didn't know anyone in Nevada. Three, I somehow had two packages from Nevada. And four, I didn't remember buying anything from anyone in Nevada.
So I argued. As fate would have it, the girl working at the desk was the same girl from criminal law that I embarrassed myself in front of last year. The argument went something like this:
Me: These aren't mine.
Her: Well, they have your name on them.
Me: No, these can't be mine.
Her: But they have your name and apartment number on them.
Me: But these are from Nevada. I don't know anyone from Nevada!
Her: Dude, Madison, relax. They're obviously yours.
Me: No, they're not!
Her: Yes, they are!
Me: What if they aren't?! What am I supposed to do?!
Her: Uhh, return them?
Me: And drive to Nevada?!!
Obviously, I lost. And humiliated myself in front of my classmate. Now, I know it's technically not your fault that you live in Nevada and that you didn't tell me you live Nevada, but I'm still gonna blame you ‘cause this all stems from your state.
But I'm not done yet.
No, because as fate would also have it, Sunday was one of the foggiest days all year. Like, can't see three feet in front of you fog. Fate continues to be a bitch though, because guess who decided to make an appearance?! Laundry Boy! Do you know about Laundry Boy? Short version, if you don't: Laundry Boy is the cute guy who lived on the same floor as me last year. Basically, I body slammed into them last year, dirtied up all their laundry and didn't even apologize. Read my last Secret Santa for the low-down. So, foggy day, Laundry Boy and stupid, irrational me. No, I didn't ruin their clean clothes this time, but I was complaining rather loudly to my roommate. I believe the exact phrase I used was, “God, I hope I didn't buy anything when I was drunk. Last time this happened, I bought fake urine, a bowling ball and some underwear with Sophia from the Golden Girls on it.” Not only did laundry boy hear the entire thing, but they walked within my three feet radius and clearly now knows that I own both fake urine and a pair of underwear with Sophia on it.
How, how, hoooow is this possible??!!!! (See photo #1 for my reaction.)
Because the Earth hates me, that's how.
So I got up to my room, literally spent five minutes debating whether or not to open the package and caved.
Photo #2 shows my hatred for said package. Picture #3 is for those of you that have been following my scissor journey. I recently got a sassy new pair from Target for $3. Skip pictures #4-7 unless you just want to see my face. Also my nose ring, which is the bane of my mother's existence.
But duuuuuude… I'm not normally one for stuffed animals, but this Seahawks pillow is the shit. Seriously. My current pillows are flat and this one can only be described as having the softness that I imagine being a cross between Russell Wilson's hair, Marshawn Lynch's personality and the softness of our O-Line. Also, it's finals week and I may need something soft to cry into later when I take my Bio Final. I'll link pictures if that happens.
But wait, there's more! (See photo #10. Or skip it. Looking at it kinda makes me uncomfortable. You know what, don't look at it.)
Picture #11 shows the small package that I probably should have opened first. Aren't you supposed to open the smallest package first? Well, too late now.
You know, I had a lot of difficulty deciding how I should open this envelope. I didn't want to cut anything important. Turns out they provided you with an actual flap to open things! (Picture #13, I think?) Picture #14 captures that wonderful moment where I struggle to tear open said flap of paper and realize I need to start going to the gym.
Awww, you got me an ornament! This will go wonderfully with the rest of my ornaments on my tree… which… I was supposed to decorate yesterday…. (See photo #18, where I realize this.) Number 19 is me reading your note. Yeah, definitely should have opened the smaller one first.
Anyways, Luna, yes, you did get me a bomb-ass Seahawk/sobbing pillow and an ornament for my still-to-be-decorated tree, and I appreciate that.
But, thanks to you, I am now known as ‘That mailroom girl who has frequent seizures and runs, hates the state of Nevada, and owns synthetic piss, a bowling ball and a pair of underwear with Sophia on it.' And for that, you are the sweetest, thoughtful, most unintentional douchebag ever.
Thanks for ruining my reputation even further and damaging any possible chance I would have with Laundry Boy,
Madison
PS: Nothing, I repeat, nothing, is better than Steven Hauschka (See picture #20).

Saudi Arabia's youngish population isn't crazy about local TV, so they've naturally turned to a substitute: YouTube. As a matter of fact, the country features three times the per-capita viewing as the US, to the point that Google reps conducted a roadshow teaching local producers how to make money. But according to the WSJ, authorities there aren't crazy about all that since they have no control over what gets posted on the "broadcast yourself" site. As a result, the kingdom is planning to regulate content produced in the country, with guidelines on alcohol, nudity and of course, wanton "drifting" videos (as shown below). It likely boils down to "security," though, as the nation has previously detained producers critical of the royal family. And that, unfortunately, is a movie we've seen before.
In the aftermath of Derek Morris' departure, the search for Keith Yandle's next defensive partner is in full swing. The favorite heading into training camp may very well be a 21-year-old second-year player.
The Arizona Coyotes drafted Connor Murphy 20th overall in 2011 NHL Entry Level Draft. Like many other Coyotes draft picks, Murphy's father was a NHL hockey player. Gord Murphy played in the NHL from 1988 to 2002 with the Philadelphia Flyers, Boston Bruins, Florida Panthers and Atlanta Thrashers.
Murphy is a product of the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, one of an increasingly large number of players to come from that program, and represented Team USA in 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships as well as the 2013 World Junior Championships, winning gold medals with both teams.
After spending two years in the OHL with the Sarnia Sting, Murphy started last season with the Portland Pirates of the AHL. It wasn't long until they were called up, however, making their NHL debut on Nov. 16 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. They scored their first, and so far only, goal in their first NHL game.
With injuries sidelining a few Coyotes defenseman this past season, Murphy had the opportunity to play big minutes for the team. Over 30 games, their average time on ice was close to 18 minutes, although they played more than 20 minutes in 11 of those games. Their career high for time on ice is currently 26:50 in a 3-1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche this past December.
Although fans will have to wait until the season starts to be sure, many expect Murphy to take Morris' old spot next to Yandle. Morris was not re-signed this offseason and the Boston native seems poised to compete for a spot in the top-4.
On paper, Yandle and Murphy compliment each other very well. Murphy can hopefully be a stabling defensive force while Yandle can continue to rack up the points. Murphy did spend part of last season playing tough minutes with Oliver Ekman-Larsson, so it is fairly safe to assume coach Dave Tippett has faith in their abilities. It seems extremely possible the two Bostonians will be skating together come October.
Last month, Jesse Lee Peterson wrote a column for WND suggesting that if anti-gay Christian business owners are going to be required to serve gay customers, they ought to do so by informing any gay customers “upfront that they would take their money and donate it to a conservative Christian law firm to fight against same-sex marriage.”

Editor's note: Each week throughout the 2015 NFL season, The MMQB will publish an advanced analytics story by Neil Hornsby, the president of football operations at Pro Football Focus.
At PFF we have a lot of ways to accurately assess a quarterback's production, but it really doesn't matter which we one we use in this case; with qualification or without, Matthew Stafford comes out at the bottom of every overall measure so far in 2015.
Below Colin Kaepernick, below Michael Vick, below Jameis Winston. Absolutely, definitely the last on the list.
The fact of their decline really isn't in question at this point—when a player of their caliber is benched it tells you all you need to know—but how did we get to this state of affairs?
The first thing that most people miss, lost in the fact the Lions made the playoffs last year, was that 2014 wasn't a great year for Stafford.
Sure, it was only a slightly below average performance (on our scale, an average player = 0) and in the context of this year hugely superior but it ruined the upward trend he'd been enjoying since their difficult rookie year.
• DEBACLE IN DETROIT: How are the Lions, a 2014 playoff team, the 2015 season's last winless squad? It's simple, writes Andy Benoit: They don't have the players.
So what happened in 2014? A lot of people point to Calvin Johnson's injury problems. It's true that didn't help, but our system significantly diminishes the impact of others on the individual's performance. It grades the throw—not the ultimate result. If Stafford had continued to play at a similar level there is no way that losing a wide receiver (even for the entire season, never mind a few games) would cause this a drop of this magnitude.
Two things happened in 2014 that changed things dramatically. First, Joe Lombardi came in as offensive coordinator and brought with them a different view of how the passing game should operate. Secondly, Stafford started to get close to the NFL average for plays under pressure.
Why are those important?
Lombardi brought with them a scheme that featured much more underneath passing than Stafford was used to and, like most quarterbacks, Stafford has issues with pressure. Between 2011 and 2014 they averaged a QB rating of 94 without pressure and 63 under duress. You can use our grades to take out the influence of their receivers and, for the same period, know they averaged +16.5 when kept clean, and 3.9 with defenders in their face.
I know, the smart ones among you are already preparing to shoot me down. If they were under pressure more often every season and their grade went down under pressure why would their grade go up every season until 2014?
Maybe the next chart will help.
The general NFL pattern in the face of pressure is to throw quicker, shorter passes. Up until 2014 they bucked that trend (and also the general trend within the league for this type of throw) and things had gone well. Some players are just better at longer throws than short throws (relatively speaking that is) and Stafford is one of them. For example, Joe Flacco and Jay Cutler are players who work better when going deep. So is Stafford, but when the pressure and Lombardi's new scheme forced them to dial things back, things started to go less well.
Moving on to 2015, the pressure situation because of the revamped offensive line has become intense. For the first time in their career they were in the top 10 for most pressured QBs. Add to that the failure of the running game—the Lions are on pace for an NFL all-time low of 784 yards at their current pace—and you have a perfect storm of issues for Stafford.
Initially they held it together and managed a QB rating of 102.5 through two weeks when kept clean, but then the other type of pressure took a hold. The pressure of having to throw 73% of the time because of the inept running game and being behind so much, the pressure of losing, the pressure of simply being the quarterback on a 0-3 team in the NFL and even that last vestige of stability disappeared. For the first time in their life they started to play poorly when unmolested and their QB rating dropped to 85—well below the NFL average of 97—in an area they had previously excelled.
In summary, he's a QB who prefers a longer passing game and who's never played well under pressure being put under more pressure than he's ever faced before and being forced into a shorter throwing game than they like.
Something was always likely to give, and at the moment that's the player himself. While it may already be too late to save this season, salvaging Stafford is the real goal now.

Ben Affleck has started doing promotional interviews for Gone Girl, which means that reporters will be asking them dozens of questions about the film just so they can sneak in a question about Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice. No disrespect to Gone Girl, which actually looks pretty good, but you know, the film doesn't appear to have a single superhero in it.
As part of pretending to be interested in Gone Girl, the New York Times was able to finagle a couple brief comments about Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice out of Mr. Affleck.
In regards to Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which they probably won't win an Oscar for but everyone will go see, Affleck professed, "I'm having a blast." Affleck also praised the script, which is written by Argo screenwriter Chris Terrio. Affleck described the script as being "really unique to the genre and really smart."
MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Khris Davis recently received a death threat on Twitter serious enough for Major League Baseball to investigate.
Davis took a screengrab of the tweet, which was posted May 18 and included a racial slur and a threat to kill their family. Brewers general manager Doug Melvin said the team turned the matter over to Major League Baseball's department of investigations.
"All we do is turn it over to MLB security," Melvin said. "It is serious when that happens. We were just told it was handled. We don't get involved with it. We don't get details of it. Anything that is deemed serious, we all have MLB security at every city we go to. We have a card with a number (to call).
"You can't (take it as a joke) today if you look at the stuff every day on the news. We were told it's been taken care of.
"I'm sure it was (distracting). All this social media stuff, people think that it's good. A small percentage of it is good, to me."
Shortly after the tweet was posted, Brewers manager Ron Roenicke called Davis into their office to talk. The conversation eventually turned into the skipper reassuring the struggling outfielder they belonged in the big leagues.
"It was just the frustration of other distractions, really," Davis, who is in their first full season in the majors, said when asked if they had lost confidence. "It was never like, ‘Oh, can I play here?' It was more of the things around me.
"He just reminded me a few things about hitting and told me I should be here. I believe him. I believe in myself."
Davis went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts on May 18 in a 4-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field to lower their batting average to .215 at the time.
Davis has been swinging well since meeting with Roenicke, hitting .407 with three home runs and five RBIs in their last seven games.
"We'll see how my play plays out," Davis said when asked if clearing their mind of outside distractions has helped them at the plate. "I just let it speak for myself. I don't really have any comment on it. I can't say that's the reason why."
When Davis is on, the left fielder is driving the ball to right field with power. They hadn't been doing that early in the season but has multiple extra-base hits to the opposite field over the course of Milwaukee's past few games.
Davis was pulling the ball so much earlier in the season that teams began to shift on him.
"It was just where I was making contact," Davis said. "I never work on pulling the ball, honestly. That's not my thought process. It just happens.
"I'm just up there trying to get a good pitch and put a good swing on it. I work so much the other way that is just where it falls right now."
With a big distraction hopefully behind him, Davis was happy to hear the words of encouragement from Roenicke.
"They see me work every day, so I know they have confidence in me and in my work," Davis said. "It was good that we are on the same page basically. We are here to win ballgames. That's what I'm here to do."

Any questions regarding the squat for weightlifting (or just any questions about life) should be cleared up here…
The squat is not a competitive movement in weightlifting, so despite how important it is, its purpose is to drive the development of the competitive lifts, so perform them in a manner that will achieve this.
The low bar squat, causing a forward leaning torso angle, is not for weightlifters to use. This will reinforce bad habits and bad angles for your catch position. Do not do them.
I'm not a weightlifting coach and I don't profess to be, but I am smart enough to look at sporting movements – and I have enough high-level weightlifting coaches as friends – to confidently tell you that the only squatting variations the Olympic weightlifter needs to concern theirs or themselves with are high bar Olympic squats and front squats.
Here are 6 of the world's strongest squatters, and while this is obviously a very small sample size, there are clearly a lot of similarities in the positions these athletes are in during their squats. All of these athletes are using a lower bar position and a medium or wider stance, though I wouldn't call anyone of them a wide stance, especially relative to what you see among multi-ply lifters. The styles that these lifters use is what they have found to be best for them – you aren't built the same as any of them so you need to find what is best for you. Whatever you find, you will need to practice that technique and develop strength in that specific movement pattern. While your specific technique should be at the forefront of your training, other variations including high bar, front squat, close stance, wide stance, etc. all have their place in your training and will all be good variations to include.
The goal of the squat in powerlifting is simple: lift the most weight. With that in mind, whichever technique allows you to do this is the one you should use. There will be coaches and lifters that argue until they are blue in the face that the low bar squat is king or a certain stance width is best and so on and so on, but the reality of the matter is that the answer is unique to the individual and their own strength and leverages. With that being said, lets take a look at the compilation of lifters below…
I'll throw in my $.02 and let you know which squatting types I prefer for different sports/goals.
Which kind of squat is best? That kind of question is where heated internet arguments are born.
Success in strongman requires massive strength in many different angles and leverages, and your squat training should reflect that. The squat is rarely a competitive event in strongman, and even when it is, there is almost always something unique to it (squat til weight touches blocks, squat/front squat with axle, squat on a fixed apparatus) so specificity is less important here.
There is merit to training a variety of stances and bar positions to develop your ability in strongman. Keep your strongest technique as the foundation of your squat training for strongman, as this will give you the strongest stimulus by allowing you to handle the most weight, and use a rotation of exercise variations to complement it. High bar, low bar, front squat, wide stance, close stance, specialty bars, box squats, pause squats and dead squats can all be useful variations to develop your squatting strength for strongman. Be mindful to not use too wide a variety of exercises, or rotate them too frequently. You want to make sure you're actually able to gauge improvement and be able to tell what's having carryover to strongman performance.
CrossFit
CrossFit shares many more similarities with weightlifting than it does with powerlifting, so with that in mind, competitive CrossFit athletes should heed my earlier advice and keep their squat training exclusive to the high bar back squat and front squat.
Another thing to consider with the training of competitive CrossFit athletes and the squat, is that due to the extremely high volume and variety of skills and movements they need to be proficient in, and the fact that max squats are rarely contested, it wouldn't make much sense devote excessive energy to pure squat development. You need to squat well to build your Olympic lifts and bolster your lower-body-dominant skills but that can be achieved with only those two previously-mentioned variations, and you do not need anything exotic to drive your squat to the necessary levels.
Sports Performance
What's more functional, the back squat or front squat? How deep should athletes squat? What kind of stance is the best for athletic performance? Do these questions keep you up at night? Well stop it because it doesn't really matter.
Sports (non-strength sports) aren't played with barbells and because of that barbell movements are general exercises and general exercise selection isn't worth agonizing over.
Are there exercise choices that are better than others – of course but that will depend on factors that go beyond the scope of this article, like which sport you're competing in, where you are in the annual plan, the athlete's preparedness, athlete's position and more.
Those factors aside, there are 3 main principals that should guide your exercise selection for athletes.
1) Can the athlete execute the movement safely and properly?\
2) Can the athlete create significant stimulus training effect with the exercise?
3) Does the exercise fit well within the context of the athlete's entire training plan?
Some athletes just aren't well-suited for certain movements and can't perform them effectively. Since there aren't any weightroom movements that are prerequisites for sporting success, they don't have to do that movement and can find a suitable replacement or alternative.
If an athlete can't move some weight in an exercise, especially a foundational movement like the squat, then it probably isn't a good choice for their training plan, at least not in a primary role. So you may love front squats for athletes but if you have an athlete who is terrible at them but good at box squats or front box squats, then you should choose the option they can get more stimulus from.
The final consideration when choosing a squat variation for the athlete is how it fits into the entire training plan. In-season, the primary objective of the athlete is to practice and play well, so choosing an overloaded squat option (like squats with chains/bands or pin squats) that is very demanding on the CNS wouldn't be a good idea because it would detract from the athlete's ability to practice. In-season using an option like front squats (which are inherently lighter than back squat variations) or box squats (which are less stressful) are good options to allow for more energy to devote towards skill development.
The squat is a valuable exercise to strength athletes and team sport athletes alike but it serves different roles in different sports. Hopefully these ideas have given you a good jump on properly selecting squatting styles for you and your athletes.

An Indigenous tribe in Canada on Wednesday declared a state of emergency after six people committed suicide in the community since December 2015, and 140 other suicide attempts were made in the past two weeks.
An official from the Cross Lake First Nation — who belong to the Indigenous, self-governing Pimicikamak group — told CTV News that health workers on the reserve could “no longer cope.” The overnight shift at the nursing center has only been staffed with two people at a time.
“My people have been traumatized by this sequence of events,” Cross Lake Nation executive council member David Lee Roy Muswaggon told BuzzFeed News. “The Crown has failed to live up to its responsibilities.”
They added that this is not the first time the Indigenous group has issued a state of emergency related to suicide or mental health. Similar calls were made in the 1980s and again in 1999, they said.
The Cross Lake reservation, which houses 5,385 people, is located about 310 miles north of Winnipeg. The unemployment rate hovers around 80%, Cross Lake Nation acting chief Shirley Robinson said.
Robinson's 33-year-old cousin, a mother of three, was the sixth person in the recent cluster to commit suicide, according to CTV.
5 Whys is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.[1] The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "5" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.
Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.
The method provides no hard and fast rules about what lines of questions to explore, or how long to continue the search for additional root causes. Thus, even when the method is closely followed, the outcome still depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved.
Example [ edit ]
The vehicle will not start. (the problem)
Why? - The battery is dead. (First why) Why? - The alternator is not functioning. (Second why) Why? - The alternator belt has broken. (Third why) Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why) Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)[2]
The questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause.[3] The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect through any layers of abstraction to a root cause that still has some connection to the original problem. Note that, in this example, the fifth "why" suggests a broken process or an alterable behaviour, which is indicative of reaching the root-cause level.
The last answer points to a process. This is one of the most important aspects in the 5 Why approach - the real root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist.[4] Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower. These answers may be true, but they are out of our control. Therefore, instead of asking the question why?, ask why did the process fail?
A key phrase to keep in mind in any 5 Why exercise is "people do not fail, processes do".[citation needed]
History [ edit ]
The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and was used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies. It is a critical component of problem-solving training, delivered as part of the induction into the Toyota Production System. The architect of the Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, described the 5 Whys method as "the basis of Toyota's scientific approach by repeating why five times[5] the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear."[6] The tool has seen widespread use beyond Toyota, and is now used within Kaizen, lean manufacturing and Six Sigma. In other companies, it appears in other forms. Under Ricardo Semler, Semco practices "three whys" and broadens the practice to cover goal setting and decision making.[7]
Techniques [ edit ]
Two primary techniques are used to perform a 5 Whys analysis:[8]
the fishbone (or Ishikawa) diagram
a tabular format
These tools allow for analysis to be branched in order to provide multiple root causes.[9]
Rules of performing 5 Whys [ edit ]
In order to carry out the 5 Whys analysis properly, the following advice should be followed:[citation needed]
It is necessary to engage the management in the 5 Whys process in the company. For the analysis itself, consider what is the right working group. Also consider bringing in a facilitator for more difficult topics. Use paper or whiteboard instead of computers. Write down the problem and make sure that all people understand it. Distinguish causes from symptoms. Pay attention to the logic of cause-and-effect relationship. Make sure that root causes certainly lead to the mistake by reversing the sentences created as a result of the analysis with the use of the expression "and therefore". Try to make our answers more precise. Look for the cause step by step. Don't jump to conclusions. Base our statements on facts and knowledge. Assess the process, not people. Never leave "human error", "worker's inattention", "blame John", etc. as the root cause. Foster an atmosphere of trust and sincerity. Ask the question "Why?" until the root cause is determined, i.e. the cause the elimination of which will prevent the error from occurring again.[10] When you form the answer to the question "Why?" it should be from the customer's point of view.
Criticism [ edit ]
While the 5 Whys is a powerful tool for engineers or technically savvy individuals to help get to the true causes of problems, it has been criticized by Teruyuki Minoura, former managing director of global purchasing for Toyota, as being too basic a tool to analyze root causes to the depth that is needed to ensure that they are fixed.[11] Reasons for this criticism include:
Tendency for investigators to stop at symptoms rather than going on to lower-level root causes.
Inability to go beyond the investigator's current knowledge - the investigator cannot find causes that they do not already know.
Lack of support to help the investigator ask the right "why" questions.
Results are not repeatable - different people using 5 Whys come up with different causes for the same problem.
Tendency to isolate a single root cause, whereas each question could elicit many different root causes.
These can be significant problems when the method is applied through deduction only. To avoid these issues, it is recommended that the answer to the current "why" question is verified before proceeding to the next question. In addition, performing logical tests for necessity and sufficiency at each level can help avoid the selection of spurious causes and promote the consideration of multiple root causes.[12]

The New York Yankees are believed to be willing to offer top starter C.C. Sabathia a five or six-year contract extension, according to the New York Post.
Leading up to the 2011 offseason there has been great speculation that the former Cy Young award winner will exercise the opt-out clause of the seven-year $161 million dollar deal they signed with the Yankees in 2009. Their current contract promises the veteran lefty $23 million per year until 2015, however there are many who believe if Sabathia opts out now, they could land a longer contract and earn more money annually.
According to the Post, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman is willing to give Sabathia a raise on their annual salary and extend their contract by two or three years. The Post indicates however that New York may be hesitant to sign them to a deal longer than six years due to their age (31), and their ever-growing weight.
In 2011 the left-hander led the first place Yankees in wins (19), ERA (3.00), and strikeouts (230). A five-time All-Star, Sabathia has led the league in wins twice since becoming a Yankee, and has supplied them with over 705 innings pitched in three seasons.
This is Part 8 of my "VB Win10 Apps" series. (Everything applies to C# as well, of course).
It's time for some fun graphics! Here are three small apps I wrote using the win2d accelerated-graphics library.
Getting Started Circles Explosions
Transcript of key points in the screencast:
[0:40] To get started, References > Managed Nuget References > add a reference to "Win2d"
[1:10] Inside your MainPage.xaml, add these two lines. Unfortunately in VS2015 RC the XAML designer just shows an error instead of the CanvasControl. This will be fixed in VS2015 RTM.
xmlns:canvas="using:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml"
<canvas:CanvasControl x:Name="canvas1" ClearColor="Black"/>
[2:05] Win2d naturally works with System.Numerics.Vector and Matrix types, and also with single-width floating points ("Single" in VB, "float" in C#). This can get a bit awkward because most of the .NET framework is more at home with "Double". You'll have to figure out the cleanest dividing line between the two. In the app we're writing, the cleanest point was the random number generator.
[4:05] There's a neat trick to do animation. We override the Draw method, and at the end of it call "canvas1.Invalidate". This causes our Canvas_Draw method to be invoked once a frame, 60 frames a second. This makes it a handy place to update the animation as well as draw stuff.
Sub Draw(sender As CanvasControl, e As CanvasDrawEventArgs) Handles canvas1.Draw
Update()
e.DrawingSession.DrawLine(pos(1), pos(2), Colors.Azure)
canvas1.Invalidate()
End Sub
Pro tip: the CanvasAnimatedControl is specifically designed for animations such as these. It specifically has an Update event which it fires on a background thread so as not to hinder responsiveness of the UI thread.
Pro tip: if you want all your drawing commands to be transformed by a view matrix - for scaling, rotation, offsets or others - use the CanvasDrawingSession.Transform property.
[6:15] There's a useful feature in VB called "Static Dim". It's similar to "static" in C++, but unrelated to "static" in C#. You can declare a local variable to be a "Static Dim". Its initializer is run only once, the first time the method is invoked. All subsequent invocations re-use the existing variable. (Under the hood, the compiler basically promotes it to be a field of the containing type, with appropriate thread-safe initialization).
Function Rnd(min As Double, max As Double) As Single
Static Dim r As New Random
Return CSng(min + (max - min) * r.NextDouble())
End Function
[8:15] How to do to bitmaps? The win2d type is called Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap. You have to load it (along with all your other win2d resource initialization) in response to CanvasControl.CreateResources event. The deal is that the graphics accelerator might be reset (such as remote desktop, screen sharing, mirrorcast), and all your resources lost, so you have to cope with the possibility that Win2d will call your CreateResources handler off its own accord to re-establish those resources: your handler has to be idempotent, a fancy word for "no harm if it's called subsequent times".
Pro tip: in the video I set the ball's velocities inside CreateResources. That's not the best place, since things like screen sharing will make the ball's velocities get reset. It would have been better to leave them set in OnNavigatedTo.
[11:30] There's a particular technique that Win2d uses if your CreateResources handler is asynchronous (e.g. for loading bitmaps): the asynchronous work you do has to be wrapped up in a call to CanvasCreateResourcesEventArgs.TrackAsyncAction. Here's an example...
Sub CreateResources(sender As CanvasControl, e As CanvasCreateResourcesEventArgs) Handles canvas1.CreateResources
Dim loadTask =
Async Function()
bitmap = Await CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync(canvas1, "explosion.png")
End Function
e.TrackAsyncAction(loadTask().AsAsyncAction)
End Sub
[14:30] Please remember to check that your app works on Mobile emulator and also in Release build.
[14:50] When your UWP app runs on mobile, the size of its MainPage (and other pages) doesn't normally include the "Status Bar" area at the top (with wifi strength indicator, battery indicator and clock). For these graphics apps, what we'll do is extend our MainPage to include the full size of the mobile screen including that Status-Bar area, and we'll leave the indicators to be superimposed on top of our graphics. Here's the magic code to do that, as the first line of your App.OnLaunched event handler:
ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView().SetDesiredBoundsMode(ApplicationViewBoundsMode.UseCoreWindow)

MIT's Technology Review Selects 2008 “Young Innovators Under 35”
M.I.T.'s Technology Review has just announced the selection of its TR35, the annual listing of leading young innovators. The editors of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology magazine have created this list every year since 1999 to honor young innovators whose inventions and research the editors find to be the “most exciting” in fields such as medicine, electronics and nanotechnology, among others. The selection of the 35 men and women this year, all under the age of 35, was made from a pool of more than 300 young persons who were nominated on the basis of the remarkable technologies they've invented and the discoveries that they've made so early in their careers. The selection of this year's TR35 was made on the basis of their accomplishments as researchers, inventors or entrepreneurs.
This year's group of young innovators is transforming everything from the cars we drive to the way we use computers, treat heart attacks, and manage e-mail. Several of them are working on ways to conserve and more efficiently produce energy, others to help us collaborate and connect; still others are taking advantage of the body's capacity to heal itself. As they fight disease, global warming, and the complexity of life in the 21st century, the TR35 innovators aspire to truly improve the world.

The state attorneys general investigating abuses in the mortgage servicing industry said Monday that as they hammer out details of a massive settlement with banks, their main objective remains fixing a system that has subjected consumers to confusion and financial strife.
"What we're really trying to do is change a dysfunctional system," said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the point man for a 50-state effort. "We really want to try and change all that."
The extensive foreclosure problems - from flawed or fraudulent paperwork to questions about improper or incomplete loan transfers - surfaced in September, when firms such as Bank of America and Ally Financial abruptly halted foreclosures. And others followed suit.
A core group of attorneys general has been working on the issue since October, Miller said, communicating regularly with the banks accused of the shoddy practices and nearly a dozen federal agencies that have been conducting their own inquiries.
Last week, state attorneys general, joined by a handful of federal agencies that included the Justice Department and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, submitted a 27-page term sheet obtained by The Washington Post of proposed changes to five of the nation's largest banks as its opening bid in what is expected to be a series of intense negotiations beginning in coming days.
The proposals attempt to address wide-ranging complaints about the servicing process. One would require the servicers to provide a single point of contact for borrowers looking to modify their loans. Another would require them to develop a portal that would allow borrowers to submit and track documents electronically in real time.
The document also spells out the conditions under which servicers should consider principal reductions for certain borrowers. It also suggests that servicers partner with retailers such as Wal-Mart and FedEx Kinko's, so borrowers can go there to copy, fax, scan, mail or e-mail documents to servicers free of charge.
A common complaint from borrowers is that they often receive foreclosure notices even as they are negotiating in good faith with servicers to modify their loans. The attorneys general want to ban this dual-track process. As for borrowers enrolled in modification programs, their modifications should convert to permanent status if they have made three payments on time.
Several attorneys general acknowledged that differences of opinion remain among various stakeholders on two key issues - how to structure a feasible modification program and the precise amount of penalties that should be levied on the banks, some of which could go toward principal reductions for borrowers.
"We've struggled with that," Miller said. "We have to recognize that whatever the proposal is, it's going to have some limitations; it's going to leave some people out. . . . At some point, we and the federal agencies will agree on the modification program."
Miller also played down the prospect for a speedy settlement with banks, saying that many legal issues remain unresolved.
"I'm hoping we can wrap it up in a couple of months," Miller said. "That's a hope, but we're going to move as fast as we can."

Russian hackers may have sabotaged a water pump in what's being described as the first foreign cyberattack on US utility infrastructure, damaging both hardware and confidence in critical systems. The attack targeted a Springfield, Illinois water utility station on November 8, Reuters reports, using network credentials stolen from an industrial software developer; the pump was apparently remotely activated and burnt out, though redundant systems meant no impact was felt by residents of the town.
Nonetheless, the event is being taken seriously by the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center, with the US Department of Homeland Security and the FBI both involved in the investigation. Although still early, the teams involved insist there is no cause for ongoing concern, with DHS spokesperson Peter Boogaard arguing that “there is no credible corroborated data that indicates a risk to critical infrastructure entities or a threat to public safety.”
Despite those reassurances, online security specialists are already drawing parallels between the Illinois attack and the Stuxnet virus that impacted Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010. Although never acknowledged by either government, many believe that particular viral strike – which sabotaged a centrifuge used in uranium enrichment – was controlled by the US and Israel.
“Over a period of two to three months, minor glitches had been observed in remote access to the water district's SCADA [Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition] system” security expert Joe Weiss told The Register, having acquired a copy of the Illinois report detailing the water pump hack. The “glitches” escalated to the point where the pump was power-cycled until it burnt out; since multiple pumps are used at the facility, no interruption to the water supply was observed.
Evidence of further hacking has not been observed, though it's unclear how many remote access credentials have been stolen by those responsible. It is reportedly usual for usernames and passwords to be hard-coded to SCADA hardware, which could make a broad security refresh more difficult than with traditional enterprise systems.
TENSIONS between the superpowers are high and the race is on to dominate.
But if you think the next major military battle for dominance will be over land or sea, or any other piece of the Earth, then think again.
Experts predict the world's global powers will soon be taking their battles into space.
Not only is the space race becoming more competitive but global powers are continuing to militarise what has long been considered to be the final frontier.
Writing for global intelligence agency Statfor, senior military analyst Omar Lamrani warned while the race for dominance in space began some time ago the race toward its weaponisation is accelerating faster than ever before.
According to him, global powers are working to develop and deploy anti-satellite weapons known as ASATs.
“The technology, which began to be developed during the Cold War, has become an area of intense competition for the world's most capable militaries over the past decade,” they write.
However, the more pressing concern is the possibility of US technology being attacked in orbit.
“For the United States, being the leader in military space technologies provides immense advantages,” Mr Lamrani writes, adding, “At the same time, its out-size reliance on those technologies entails risks.”
The fact the US dominates and depends on space could give rivals the incentive to attack its infrastructure.
The US “relies heavily on its orbital assets for navigation, intelligence collection, precision targeting, communication, early warning and several other crucial activities.”
The crucial point is China and Russia don't rely on space technology as much as the US with Beijing able to rely on ground-based radars and sensors in a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
“The United States, on the other hand, would have to lean on its satellites to support a response in the same area,” Mr Lamrani writes.
However they warn such a war will be one that no country will want to fight and if it did occur would be “devastating to all”.
RENEWED FEARS
Mr Lamrani's warnings over the militarisation of space are not new.
Last year, the Scientific American reported a war in space may be closer than ever before with China, Russia and the US all developing and testing new technologies to fight such a war outside Earth.
All countries have denied this is the case.
Calling it “an arms race in all but name”, the magazine also predicted the next major military flashpoint won't be in the South China Sea, the Middle East or even Ukraine, instead it will take place in orbit.
Some 1300 satellites currently orbit the Earth, providing vital communication, GPS, weather and surveillance.
The world's militaries rely on that information for modern warfare and while the US clearly dominates, “China and Russia aggressively seek to challenge US superiority in space with ambitious military space programs of their own”.
It predicts a power struggle could “risk sparking a conflict that could cripple the entire planet's space-based infrastructure”.
AIR BATTLE
Space isn't the only bone of contention between the world's superpowers.
Reports of the ongoing battle for military dominance in space comes just days after Beijing angrily rejected Pentagon accusations that a Chinese aircraft made an “unsafe” intercept of a spy plane in international airspace.
China and the US have been at increasing logger heads amid rising tensions in the strategically vital South China Sea.
Rivalry between the superpowers has been mounting in the disputed waterway, an important shipping route thought to be home to vast energy deposits, and which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.
The US Department of Defence last Wednesday said that two Chinese tactical aircraft intercepted an American reconnaissance plane in an “unsafe” manner, without giving details.
China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei hit back the following day saying such claims were “untrue”.
Two Chinese aircraft tailed a US EP-3 reconnaissance plan as it “flew close” to the island province of Hainan, they said, but kept “a safe distance” and did not make “dangerous moves”.
Such US flights were a “severe threat” to Chinese security, they added, calling for Washington to stop them immediately.
The incident comes more than a decade after a collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a US Navy EP-3 which killed the Chinese pilot and forced the US aircraft to make an emergency landing on Hainan.
A 11-day standoff ensued as Beijing interrogated the 24 US crew, seriously straining relations between the countries, and China went on to hold the plane for several months.
The two have traded accusations and warnings over such surveillance flights in subsequent years.
ANC1B asked DDOT to explore ways to fill a gap in the 11th Street NW bike lane between Florida and Vermont avenues and held a meeting Thursday to talk about it. Many neighbors along 11th Street are strongly opposed to the bike lanes, primarily because it would require removing about 30 parking spaces.
Alternative 1. Image from DDOT.
DDOT also provided information about crashes along the section of 11th Street. Officials reported that there were more crashes on that section of 11th than on similar sections of 10th and 12th streets. When asked who was to blame, DDOT representatives noted that some of the crashes were due to cyclists running stop signs, but many more were from right hooks or doorings.
DDOT presented 4 alternatives. In Alternative 1, parking would be taken out on the east side and replaced with a one-way buffered bike lane going north. Alternative 3 was much the same, except the parking was replaced with larger lanes in each direction, each with sharrows down the middle.
Alternative 2 did not remove parking, but it did change 11th to a one-way, one-lane street with bike lanes in each direction. This would require rerouting buses and much more analysis. Alternative 4 replaced the east side parking with a two-way cycletrack down the center. This would require cyclists to move to the left to get into the cycletrack on one end and to the right to get out of it at the other.
Alternative 4. Image from DDOT.
Opposition mostly centered around removing the parking. “I am opposed to removing any parking at all. Period,” said one woman. “11th Street is too narrow for two-way traffic and bikes” another added. Many of these same critics sought other, less intrusive, options.
One suggestion was to reroute cyclists instead of buses. “You could remove the bike lanes from where they are now and move them to another street,” said a speaker. “There's room on 13th.”
DDOT transportation planner Jim Sebastian replied that bikes have a right to the street. “There are bikes on every street and, where ever we can, we put bike lanes in,” they said. “It would be almost impossible to reroute bikes because they're legal on every street and they use every street. They're going to go where they're going to go. There isn't room on 13th and if there were, we would put bike lanes there also because we have bikes on every street in this area.”
Audience suggestions included signs, enforcement, education, rumble strips, bicycle priority lights, and lower speed limits. Some audience members suggested a two-way cycletrack like on 15th Street, and center bike lanes like on Pennsylvania Ave NW. Others suggested continuous green shared lanes, which are shown to have limited effectiveness, though a study in California finds they reduce bicycle crashes.
Sebastian agreed that there were many options, but pointed out that the best success is found when engineering, education and enforcement were all used. DDOT did shoot down one suggestion for reversible, rush-hour traffic lanes because, as a matter of policy, the agency is moving away from that kind of design.
In addition to complaining about the loss of parking, many complained about scofflaw cycling behavior. One person criticized DC for allowing sidewalk cycling, which is legal on this stretch, and told stories about the one time they saw a tourist on a bike cut off a bus. Sebastian noted that adding bike lanes has been found to discourage sidewalk cycling. The committee chair tried to direct the conversation away from this issue, since DDOT was the wrong agency to deal with it.
The committee chair wanted to have a vote on a preference among one of the existing proposals, but ANC 1B02 representative Jeremy Leffler argued that any vote on the issue needed to be postponed. “We have too many issues with parking, so taking 30-40 spaces away is just a non-starter,” said Leffler. “Any option is going to have to not effect parking.”
Leffler complained that cyclists coming down 11th Street don't stop at the stop signs, but motorists do and so this committee needs to talk with the Public Safety Committee and the MPD before proceeding.
When asked to give a show of hands, 13 out of 25 people opposed removing parking. Leffler suggested that only people who live on 11th Street should vote. Had that actually happened, it might have showed that the only people who wanted to retain their parking were those who live on 11th.
In the end, the ANC decided to send DDOT back to the drawing board and to discuss it again at the end of September. Leffler also wanted to invite abutting ANCs and more ANC 1B representatives to the next meeting.
“The problem is not ANC 1B people, it's the people coming out of Columbia Heights, going 40mph, joyriding into our community and not stopping,” they said.

Baltimore Ravens fans flooded the team's Facebook page with angry comments following a lopsided loss in London on Sunday.
But the object of their scorn wasn't the Ravens' dismal performance in a 44-7 defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Thousands of fans were incensed that nearly all of the Ravens players knelt during the national anthem, displaying what they called a “gut-wrenching” lack of respect for the country and the flag.
Many fans said they would no longer support the team because of the protests.
“Introducing politics into today's was the lowest behavior of any team. I'm no longer a Ravens fan after today,” one man wrote on the team's Facebook page. “I will be notifying M&T Bank of my decision to pull out as well. If you don't support my country, you & M&T Bank don't deserve my support or my money either. Shame on you Baltimore Ravens!”
Others saw the demonstrations as a lack of respect for the team's fans and the city of Baltimore.
“You all forget who you represent. Not just yourselves,” a woman posted. “You represent the ravens, Baltimore, and America. And you embarrassed yourselves and us today. You not only broke the unity of us as Americans today, I think you broke the unity between Ravens players and Ravens fans.”
"We are going to learn from this. We are a united front. We're still the Baltimore Ravens. We're just 2-1.” Posted by Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, September 24, 2017
Before Sunday's games kicked off, President Donald Trump criticized the NFL for allowing players such as former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the anthem in protest of police brutality against minorities. In an early morning tweet, Trump called on team owners to punish players who refuse to stand for anthem.
“If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!” they wrote.
The Ravens and the Jaguars were the first teams to respond to Trump, kneeling on the sidelines while the national anthem played at London's Wembley stadium. Teams across the NFL followed suit in later games, with hundreds of players engaging in some form of protest during the anthem. Some teams locked arms, others knelt, and some, including Pittsburgh Steelers, remained in the locker room during the pre-game anthem.
The Steelers protest was received with outright hostility from thousands of the team's fans, who are known as some of the most loyal and passionate in the league.
“I have been a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan for 60 years and Not so much anymore. I'm done,” Joyce Maletto wrote on the team's Facebook page. “How dare you dis-respect our country like that. You only have one player that is a true American!”
Maletto was referring to Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva, a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan. Villanueva was the lone Steelers player to emerge from the locker room and stand on the field during the anthem. (RELATED: Former Army Ranger Is Only Steelers Player To Stand For National Anthem [VIDEO])
Even teams that notched impressive wins on Sunday weren't immune to criticism from fans outraged by the anthem protests. After the Jaguars touted their wipeout of the Ravens in a Facebook post on Sunday night, the vast majority of replies didn't celebrate the victory but instead blasted the team's protest.
“You disrespected our Flag, our Veterans who fought for it and our Country and you did it on foreign soil,” David Ruth wrote back. “Not one more dime of my money! Not one more minute of my time!”

John Greenwood, editor of the CCProject, adds this great comment:
Hey Scott, Great summary and review as always. I've seen a worrisome trend of people citing FLORALI to justify HFNC as a reasonable strategy for pts with hypoxic RF rather than (in my opinion) what should probably be a tool used as bridge during intubation planning. Consider adding this study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed/25691263) to your pack. Just out of curiosity, are there any specific patients you are maintaining on HFNC? If I may, here's my own little rant about the FLORALI study (STRANGE subtleties in protocol) 1. HFNC was not used as a treatment option for all-comers w/ hypoxic respiratory failure. There were significant exclusion criteria & none of the enrolled patients had chronic lung disease (including COPD) and had no other organ dysfunction. These were only pts with PURE, single organ failure (hypoxic RF) and nothing else… 2. The authors targeted 7-10 cc/kg TV with their NIPPV which may have resulted in additional lung injury as the editorial noted, but I suspect the authors may have chosen this to avoid causing any hypercapnea associated with LTVV. Unfortunately this arm was doomed from the get go I think – especially since almost 25% had unilateral lung disease on presentation. 3. Not only was there a significant amount of therapy crossover between the NIPPV and HFNC arms, but the therapies weren't even independent of each other! 2/3 arms were actually HFNC arms, one of them just had intermittent/scheduled NIPPV sessions!! Anyways, appreciate all the hard work. Keep it up. Happy Independence Day.

The Sinai Peninsula desert (Picture: Google Maps)
A trek into the middle of the desert may not sound very appealing when you could be relaxing by a swimming pool in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
But Estonian photographer Kaupo Kikkas was rewarded for their efforts, capturing some amazing snaps of an unusual sight, hidden just a few miles away from the popular tourist resort.
Here's what Egypt's vast Sinai Peninsula looks like from space.
The International Space Station above Sinai (Picture: AP)
The triangular area is 60,000km2 and links the continents of Asia and Africa.
More than ten years ago a French visitor decided it would be the perfect location for their bizarre project, according to Kikkas.
You can see the outline of what they created at the bottom of a desert mountain range below on Google Maps.
They decided to build a cinema in the middle of the desert, Kikkas explains on their blog, and went to Cairo to buy everything they needed from an old theatre.

However things didn't exactly go according to plan.

‘At the premiere evening everything went wrong,' adds Kikkas. ‘Their electricity generator was sabotaged and no movies were ever screened.'
The cinema was built over ten years ago (Picture: HotSpot Media / Kaupo Kikkas)
There is speculation local authorities were unhappy with the project and may have sabotaged it.
The abandoned and weathered 150 wooden seats are still in place and are now referred to as the End of the World Cinema.

Host and producer of This American Life on Orange is the New Black, why they don't tweet and how their dog Piney is doing
You might not know their face, but if you're one of the 2.1million listeners who tune into their weekly radio show, you definitely know their voice. Ira Glass is the host and producer of This American Life, a weekly radio show broadcast on 587 local radio stations in the US, the CBC in Canada, ABC in Australia, and as of Sunday, BBC Radio 4 Extra in the UK. As Glass prepares to take their show to another non-American audience, they discuss their feelings about becoming "the face of radio" in the US, and which stories have affected them the most.
This year, you had a cameo in the Veronica Mars movie and a shout-out on The Simpsons, but why didn't you play yourself on Orange is the New Black?
Well, I haven't seen it. It's no bearing on the quality of the show or my desire to see it – but just my utter lack of leisure time. Let's say I'm a little over-committed. I don't mean to sound super important, I'm not meeting with the secretary of state or anything. I do the show, I give talks, I walk my dog. Jenji [Kohan] wrote me to make the pitch, and I graciously declined and wished them the best.
Why did you graciously decline?
I thought it was well-written. I thought it was fine. I felt uncomfortable playing myself. It's flattering to be asked and included in such a great show, but it just made me feel strange. I did do a cameo in the Veronica Mars movie, but that just seemed so small and easy and fun, and the whole staff of This American Life was on that, not just me.
You've done 523 episodes now, over 19 years [the show began in 1995]. Of all those stories, which have meant the most to you personally?
There are stories that change the way I see stuff, like the Harper High School story. I didn't really understand what it was like to live in a neighborhood like that, or be a kid like that. One of the things we learned is that every kid in the school is in a gang. The nerd kids are in a gang. The drama kids are in a gang. Before I read that series, and this is kind of ugly to say, but I would think, ‘Well, if they got shot they're a gang kid ... that's a bad kid.' I don't feel that any more at all. Those of us who don't live in neighborhoods like that, we're so dumb.
And then occasionally there will be this moment in a show where I get to talk about my personal life. In this week's show, there's a moment in an interview that I do with Marc Maron. They were an addict, and he's talking about not regretting it. And then I told them a story about taking ecstasy. I really hope it stays in the show.
I am mostly a pretty worried person. In conversations, I am always worried about what to say. The first time I took ecstasy, all of that lifted away. All the anxiety, which is the baseline of my life in some way, and I had this moment of like, wait a second! Are there people who feel this way all the time? This is like a whole way to be, where you don't feel anxious? Oh my god! It was so amazing. In the months after that, it was a really helpful thing to have experienced. It remains to this day a feeling that is helpful to know about. If we could get that on the air it would mean a lot to me.
Do you feel like the face of not only This American Life, but of public radio as a whole?
I only think I am representing This American Life. We are different enough from what is on public radio. Most people who discover it somehow feel like it's their secret. People have a relationship with it that's like 'it's just us'.
So you see This American Life as separate from public radio?
We are both very different and also quintessentially linked to public radio in the US. In terms of tone, we're different, and in terms of the conversational style of it and the subject matter we tackle, we're very different. But then something in the mission of the show is so quintessentially public radio. It's like we took the principles that everyone is working with, pushed them a little further, and morphed into something completely new.
What are those principles?
I mean there are a lot of super idealistic things that people try to do in public broadcasting that, when you say them out loud, sound so well-meaning, like something noone would ever want to listen to. Those things are to provide a perspective on the world you can't hear elsewhere, to bring you voices you would never hear anywhere else, to provide an analysis of the world you wouldn't get anywhere else.
When I started in public broadcasting, the way we reported on “real people” would be with these quaint little stories about someone with a quaint little hobby like making hammered dulcimers or carving wooden ducks. Figuring out a way to do report on real people, in totally compelling and super fun ways, seemed like an interesting challenge. I figured out if you use plot -- and to get the person to tell a story -- it becomes less precious and way more enjoyable.
This American Life is about to start airing on British radio for the first time, on Radio 4 Extra. Will it translate?
The name is definitely a marketing problem. I think you can tell we had no intention of being an international show. And there's no one in Britain who's like, ‘You know what I don't get enough of? American culture.'
The shows that the BBC chose are really traditional, documentary with a capital D, 'we-are-serious-journalist' stories. The first one includes a story about the Holocaust, because everybody knows that that's a classy story to put on the radio. They are feeling protective of us, [worrying] that their audience will notice that the tone is different and jauntier and more conversational, and not understand the seriousness of intent underneath it. I appreciate that whoever is programming for the BBC is trying to protect us.
I do worry that people will not understand why I'm talking the way I talk as the presenter of the show, and truthfully, when we went on the air in the United States, we would hear from program directors who would say, 'Ira was a great reporter when they were on NPR, but when are you going to get a real host? When is the adult gonna show up?'.
When you see shows like 99% Invisible and Welcome to Night Vale becoming successful, do you worry about TAL getting old? Does it need to evolve to stay relevant?
Maybe I'd be a more canny producer if I did think that way. I don't need other shows to worry about that. For me, the only thing that makes the show interesting is if we're doing something new, and so that's a lot of what I'm thinking about all the time. What else should we do? What else should we do? It's constantly running through my brain.

Reader questions: Ira responds
Why don't you tweet?
I don't tweet because I don't need another creative venue. I don't need another form for self-expression. I don't need another way to get my thoughts out to people. I have one. I'm good. But I totally think it's wonderful for anyone who doesn't have their own national radio show. I think it's a fine alternative.
If This American Life were to go off the air, what show would you want it to take its place?
I love Radiolab and I feel like a lot of our audience is already listening to Radiolab but if we went off the air, I would love to give our audience to Radiolab. I think it's a really different, and beautiful, and inspiring show.
How many times does it take you to nail your opening?
We rewrite it usually three or four times. And then in the studio I will probably run through it, parts of it, twice and at the most three times.
How do you take care of your voice?
I don't take care of my voice at all, which is one reason that I sound as bad as I do.
How is your dog, Piney?
He's doing so well. Thanks for asking. We just reran the story that we did about them and I was so excited that we got excited by Cesar Millan's people. So apparently the Dog Whisperer would be willing to fix our whole situation but we graciously declined. For a while they were eating kangaroo and ostrich. And now we've cycled back and he's eating pork, which is amazing because you can buy it at the grocery store.
When do you listen to the radio?
In the morning, when I shave. And really, not for very long. I don't hear the radio that much. I don't own a radio. I listen to everything through apps, or on my iPhone. And then I download the shows I like. Shows like Fresh Air, Radiolab, Snap Judgement, all those shows.
The leading Brexit campaigner Michael Geoghegan is not resident in the UK for tax purposes, the Guardian can reveal.
According to documents, the former chief executive of HSBC held their £8m Kensington townhouse through an offshore company – and planned to avoid tax by effectively renting the property to himself.
The details came to light as part of a Guardian investigation prompted by the Panama Papers leak.
Geoghegan said they took on temporary residency in the UK on three occasions while they were working for the bank. Explaining their decision to use offshore companies to hold British property, they said: “I am an international investor who has in the past invested in the UK as well as other countries.”

The banker was one of 250 business leaders to sign a recent letter saying they support Britain leaving the EU.  They are one of several signatories of the letter, which was coordinated by the Vote Leave campaign group, to use offshore companies to manage their wealth.
Geoghegan's strategy to rent the Kensington house from their own trust was only disrupted by “very aggressive taxation rules”, introduced by the government in 2012.
The banking executive ended up selling the house for £8m in 2014 after warning that “very disadvantageous” rules to limit the offshore ownership of UK property would lead to the “winding [up] of a very large number of trusts and companies before next year”.
In an email to the law firm Mossack Fonseca in March 2012, Geoghegan set out the ownership structure of the Kensington house while asking for a quote for their services. The banker, who was born in Windsor, explained that they were the beneficiary of a trust called the Michael Geoghegan Settlement Trust.
“Currently the Michael Geoghegan Settlement Trust is a trust established in Jersey in 2004 with the assistance of Deloitte's with the trustees being HSBC Trustees Jersey CI Ltd,” Geoghegan wrote. The trust owned a British Virgin Islands company called Shireburn Ltd, which in turn owned the Kensington house.
The house was bought in 1997 for £957,695. It was then rented out to a footballer playing for Chelsea. The London football club paid £3,250 a week in rent. Geoghegan contacted Mossack Fonseca to ask whether the law firm would be able to handle the management of the trust and the renovation of the property.

“In the short term what is required is for the directors to sign off on a renovation contract and thereafter ensure that stage payments are processed, following recommendation of the same by architects already retained by Shireburn,” they wrote in an email. After the work had been done, Geoghegan proposed to rent the property back off the trust. “Once the renovation is completed the house would be rented to me and used by me as a London home,” they said.
Geoghegan appeared dissatisfied with HSBC's management of the trust, although they had run the bank for several years. “The reason I am considering a change is that I have found HSBC trustees not to have the necessary experience in managing property,” they wrote.
However, just days after the email was sent, significant changes to the taxation of offshore-owned property were announced by George Osborne in the budget. The new rules meant that properties owned through offshore companies would be subject to an annual tax, as well as a 15% stamp duty rate when they were sold. Properties owned offshore could previously avoid stamp duty, because the shares of the company were transferred rather than the house.
“You may or may not be aware that at around the time you quoted the British government, in its budget, announced very aggressive taxation rules [effect from April 2013] which if imposed will be very disadvantageous to holders of UK property in companies and/or trusts,” wrote Geoghegan in April. They added that they were waiting for further advice on the implications. “The proposals are subject to further consultation with the taxation industry but if imposed will most likely lead to the winding [up] of a very large number of trusts and companies before next year.”
Geoghegan had worked at HSBC since 1973, often overseas. They spent eight years in Asia, seven years in the Middle East and 12 years in both North and South America. They were grouped chief executive from 2006-2010. In 2009, they moved the chief executive's office to Hong Kong but said they would be “analysed for tax in the UK”.
In an email to the Guardian, Geoghegan said that they were not domiciled in the UK and not a UK resident. They pointed out that successive British governments had encouraged the use of these structures by foreign investors, even if this created an “unlevel playing field”.
Geoghegan said: “Since the early 60s the UK government [along with many others in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean] have encouraged foreign investment in residential and commercial real estate. The structure recommended for such types of investment has mostly been corporate structures – in some cases governments give tax advantages to foreign investors for using such structures.

“In the case of [the] UK, up until 2015, all chancellors of the exchequer for the past 50 years or more provided exemption from [capital gains tax] on the property itself or on the sale of the shares in the offshore corporation if owned by non-residents. Additionally all foreign investors received an exemption from the potential of [inheritance tax], if the underlying UK assets were held through a company.
“I appreciate for many this appears to be an ‘unlevel playing field' compared to domestic investors' obligations, but for most countries inward foreign currency investment is a major part of each country's approach to attracting legitimate foreign currency.”
According to the Panama Papers, Midland Bank – part of HSBC – set up three companies for Geoghegan in 1997, the year they moved to Brazil. “All of these three companies have been acquired by Midland Bank plc for one of their senior executives – Michael Francis Geoghegan – who will appear as a signatory on the companies' bank accounts,” noted an assistant at the bank. Besides Shireburn, the other two companies were Eastville Ltd and Berridge Ltd.
According to a tax return for Shireburn, the house was rented out while Geoghegan was living overseas. In 2000, the company received £72,375 in rent in one year. However, because the company paid out £71,676 in expenses (including mortgage interest), the declared income for the company was £699. When the 10% wear-and-tear tax allowance was added, the company declared a £6,539 loss.
Eastville Ltd owned a house in Chelsea. It declared rental income of £77,780 but also declared an overall loss after repairs and mortgage interest were factored in. The house, which has now been sold, is currently valued at £5.2m, according to the property website Zoopla.
Offsetting costs against tax in this way is completely legal.
After standing down in a bruising boardroom battle in 2010, Geoghegan was replaced by Stuart Gulliver, who has faced criticism for their own financial planning. Last year, the Guardian revealed that Gulliver had sheltered millions of pounds in a Swiss account through a Panamanian company, while remaining domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes. Gulliver said the structure was for reasons of privacy rather than tax advantage.

← Ask the Senate to vote on an amendment to audit the Federal Reserve
Sign our letter to the Senate:
"It's time to end the secrecy surrounding the Federal Reserve and bring greater accountability to our financial system. I join the bipartisan group of Senators Bernie Sanders, Russ Feingold, Ron Wyden, Chuck Grassley, Jim DeMint and Sam Brownback, as well as Reps. Alan Grayson and Ron Paul, in calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve to make public the recipients of over $2 trillion in bailouts during the financial crisis."
The Federal Reserve, the central bank for the United States, spent more than $2 trillion in secret bailouts for big banks during the financial crisis.
Problem is, it's refusing to give any details about how it spent that huge sum of money.
If we can audit the Fed, we can find out how it propped up which big banks, bringing accountability to our financial system.
Auditing the Fed could restore the public's trust in our financial system, and help us avoid another mismanaged disaster from occurring. With your help, we can end the historic secrecy surrounding the Fed.
How corruption affects climate change
Climate change, like corruption, is a matter of life or death.
The evidence is hard and clear. 2016 was the hottest year ever on record, extreme “once in a generation” weather events are becoming more regular, and fragile ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are dying. Climate change is no longer a future threat; it is here.
As part of the negotiations leading to the Paris Agreement, world leaders agreed to mobilise US $100 billion in climate finance by 2020, and the same amount each year thereafter. How these funds are spent could save the lives of millions now, and ensure billions in the future are set on a safe path.
The Paris Agreement has come too late to stop the early impact of climate change. Even now the world's ability to meet the Agreement's targets depend on a real surge of political will, which is shockingly absent from the current US Administration.
Transparency International's role in this to help ensure that the billions of dollars already pledged go where they're needed. This requires transparency.
Climate change and corruption share many symptoms. They hit the poorest first and worst. They are caused by powerful individuals or entities seeking short term gain. In the long term, they put livelihoods at risk and threaten entire economies. They thrive on the flaws of national governments: you need strong global cooperation to stop them.” – Vania Montalvo, Transparencia Mexicana
Unfortunately, governance structures managing the response to climate change are under threat. Some of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world fare the worst on our Corruption Perceptions Index. The money intended to improve and save lives could be lost through corruption.
If this happens it could derail the world's efforts to deploy the billions of dollars needed to stop and mitigate climate change.
What is Climate Finance? Climate finance is money invested to help countries prevent climate change and adapt to its worst effects. This money is pledged by rich, carbon-emitting countries (who have the greater share of responsibility in causing climate change) to poorer, climate-vulnerable countries. This money falls into two categories: Mitigation finance: that's money to stop climate change getting worse overall (for example, renewable energy, clean transport, carbon markets or reforestation projects)
Adaptation finance: that's money to help countries and communities already suffering (for example, build flood defenses, irrigation systems or emergency shelters)
Around the world, journalists and civil society have a huge part to play in sounding the alarm. This is where we come in. There's a lot we can do and are doing to protect the money and make sure communities on the front line of climate change have their say in the process and the money is used wisely.
Transparency International chapters around the world are monitoring climate finance as it enters and is distributed throughout their countries.
Transparency International Bangladesh visited a cyclone shelter site and discovered homes built without walls.
In the Maldives, the lowest-lying nation in the world, millions of dollars have vanished from a tsunami relief fund. People are now trying to find out where it went.
Where we detect a risk that mismanagement or corruption might occur, we're calling for reforms.
We've also created a Handbook for communicators and journalists on climate change and corruption. This guide provides a thorough background on all things climate finance and helps turn complex, technical narratives into compelling stories.
Remember:
1. Climate finance is a matter of life and death
2. There is a lot CSOs and governments are doing already - and can still do - to prevent corruption
3. That's why it's so important to call out corruption and close down loopholes
Tackling climate change and corruption means taking on two of the greatest threats to people and the planet. But if corruption siphons off the money meant to tackle climate change, we threaten the lives of today's most vulnerable people and of all future generations.

The highly anticipated Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has finally opened in theaters, bringing in an estimated $75 million worldwide over the weekend alone. This early success means that the five sequels reportedly planned by Warner Bros. will likely be produced, showing no signs of the Harry Potter movie franchise slowing down anytime soon, even without its hero at the center of these spinoff movies.
I've seen the movie, and while I wasn't quite enamored with it, I still profess to be a fan of the other movies and books based around the wizarding world. But like many other Christians my age, I wasn't allowed to read any of the books growing up. Some might not remember this, but Harry Potter was a bit of a taboo subject in many Christian circles in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In my own home, this was a complicated topic.
When I asked my parents to purchase the first book in the series, half-expecting an “Of course! We love encouraging your reading habit,” I was met with a stern “No.” Our local church condemned the Harry Potter series as harmful fiction for children due to its embrace of magic and spells, which as an 8-year-old, I couldn't comprehend.
I missed the hype and fandom, settling for being a casual observer of the excitement sweeping over grade-school classrooms all over the world. I watched the movies over the years until its final installment in 2011, but didn't read any of the books until earlier this year.
Although I wasn't allowed to read them growing up, a few details have shaped my impression of the Harry Potter franchise and why I'm now a fan for life.
The books glorify character, not magic.
Though magic is obviously a major aspect of the Harry Potter universe, it is not a worshipped concept. It's so major that it's just woven into the background of the story, evidenced by how the books rarely spend time in the classroom or with Harry as they learn various powers. Instead, the story is usually focused on Harry's life as a boy entrusted with massive responsibilities they sometimes can't handle, as well as an intriguing caste system that spurs much of the drama between varying groups of wizards inside and outside the school.
Put more simply, Harry themselves places more value in their friendships and heroism than they do magic itself, similar to how superhero stories are more about actions and selflessness, not the complexities of how radioactive spiders somehow grant amazing powers. And it's telling that the books and movies frame “dark magic” as something to be avoided and shunned, similar to how the Bible instructs us to avoid black magic and witchcraft.
This isn't a pure equivalency, but the result of using dark magic in Harry Potter reminds me quite a bit of how sin works. Just a little of it poisons the characters of Harry Potter, who sometimes use this dark magic as a means to an end, it also distorts and twists their intentions and results in outright evil that the heroes of the story have to confront.
These books are beloved for complex, sometimes surprising reasons.
When first reading Harry Potter, it became quickly apparent to me that the style and machinations of Rowling's writing have little to do with the elevated praise these books receive, though the writing steadily and naturally improved as the story unfolded.
It was the story's imaginative concepts and lovable characters that made it truly adored. The focus on the character development above the magical elements is similar to how The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia use unexplainable magic to add spectacle to more serious-minded themes and ideas.
The main difference in Harry Potter's case, however, is that the characters happen to be more intriguing than the subtext or grander narrative of the story, which doesn't become all that compelling or complicated until the later books. The basics are all there, of course, in that Harry learns to treat others fairly, lets go of torment received by bullies and sticks up for their friends.
The morality of the books takes a while to come together.
A common criticism of the books, aside from the magical component, has to do with some of the more troubling examples of rebellion enacted by the characters. Harry and their best friends, Ron and Hermione, routinely get into trouble with authority, often disobeying direct rules. What troubles many parents, in this case, is that in the first few books, Harry is usually rewarded for this behavior, a clear example of “the ends justify the means.”
Later in the Harry Potter series, the main characters learn a harsh lesson about how mischief has unintended, even deadly consequences. And the handful of authority figures who enabled the kids also take fault, understanding that their long leash on Harry Potter was wrong and unfair to the other students.
One good aspect of all this is that the lesson is clear and powerful. It's important to note that the majority of bad behavior throughout all of the books is far from rewarded, justified or rationalized. Each moral event is a stepping stone to a fully realized lesson about how kids in school realistically navigate their problems. And most kids are definitely smart enough to perceive this story as entertainment to be observed, not a credo for how to live their lives.
There's a teaching opportunity here.
As the books progress, they become darker and more ethically complex, making them unsuitable for younger children who are easily frightened.
But in today's world of instant media, it's easier than ever for a child to get their hands on these books and movies, anyway, especially as they're exposed to advertising for the next Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie that many of their peers are watching. If they want to find these books, they just might, with or without permission.
It can be easy and sometimes tempting to deconstruct a story or piece of entertainment. We can find all manner of reasons to morally reject just about anything we want to dislike, even movies and shows sponsored by faith leaders. But for me and many others, creativity in just about any form is something to be celebrated and nurtured, while also criticized when necessary.
With Harry Potter, the positives far outweigh any possible concerns towards the series. I was fortunate enough to have parents who explained this to me without using the authoritarian approach. They explained their concerns with Harry Potter so that I could understand where they were coming from, and as a result, I eventually approached these stories (and many others) with a cautious, skeptical mind. The fondness I grew towards the series is all my own.

The Wall Street Journal responds to reports of a successful ICBM test by North Korea with predictable calls for regime change:
The best option is a comprehensive strategy to change the Kim regime, as former Undersecretary of State Robert Joseph has argued. Washington must strengthen deterrence and build out missile defenses, revive the Bush Administration's antiproliferation dragnet, convince countries in the region to cut their ties with North Korea, consider shooting down future Korean test missiles, and spread news about the regime's crimes to people in the North.
Threatening North Korea with regime change would do nothing to reduce or eliminate threats from North Korea, but it would confirm the regime's leadership in its conviction that it needs its nuclear weapons and missile programs to fend off an attack. Nothing makes a regime obsessed with its own survival less likely to compromise or negotiate than vowing to overthrow it, and besides attacking North Korea there is nothing that makes a North Korean attack more likely than making their government believe they have nothing left to lose. The less secure the regime feels, the less likely it is to be deterred, so making a concerted effort to undermine them is one of the stupidest things the U.S. could do. If their government didn't think that the U.S. and its allies were determined to get rid of them, they might be willing to make some concessions, but to reach that point the U.S. would at a minimum have to eschew all talk of regime change and reject the possibility of waging preventive war on the DPRK.
Seeking regime change in North Korea would be extremely dangerous and foolish. It would put millions of lives in jeopardy by risking war with the current regime. In the very unlikely event that this policy somehow “worked” as intended, it would still create massive upheaval that would swamp South Korea with an unmanageable refugee crisis. The preparations that would need to be made to cope with the fall of North Korea's regime are frankly beyond the competence of the current administration, and might well be beyond the competence of any government, and we already know that the U.S. is remarkably bad at preparing for what follows regime change. We should assume that China would be strongly opposed to a U.S. push for regime change on their doorstep, and by pushing for regime change the U.S. would risk sparking a war with a nuclear-armed major power. In the worst-case scenario, the North Korean leadership might also choose to use their nuclear weapons once they conclude that they aren't going to survive anyway.
The WSJ editors assert that “three U.S. administrations have tried diplomacy and failed,” but that misrepresents the consistency of the U.S. effort and it misleads their audience about how things have turned out this way. Diplomacy with North Korea did have some success in limiting their nuclear program over twenty years ago, but the Bush administration's attempt to force even bigger concessions through increased pressure backfired spectacularly and led to North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and their first nuclear weapons test. Since then, the U.S. has been trying to contain the fallout from that bit of short-sighted hard-line posturing. Pursuing an even more aggressive policy now isn't going to succeed, and it might very well plunge the Koreas and the U.S. into a major war that would be a disaster for all involved.
Tax dodging in Greece is so rampant that the Bank of Greece estimates the country could be losing as much as five billion euros a year. While that's a far cry from the €54 billion needed for 2010, it could result in much harsher cuts as the country tries to get out from under its crushing debts.
That lost tax money would have nullified the need for Greece's planned 10-year bond issue, which is expected to raise up to €5 billion, or a set of new austerity measures to cut €2.5 billion, which the government will discuss this week with European Union and International Monetary Fund officials.
Despite decent annual economic growth, Greece was receiving less in tax revenue than its EU peers. As Bloomberg reported last week:
Greece's revenue from income tax was 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007, compared with an EU average of 8 percent, EU statistics show. Tax revenue fell by 2.5 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2007 to a euro region-low of 32 percent even as economic growth averaged 4.1 percent a year.
Greece's tax collectors seem unperturbed by their underperformance: They went on strike last week to protest the government's austerity measures.
Anecdotes suggest that the evasion may be even worse. An anonymous Greek banker wrote in a blogged-about note:
On the official statistics alone, we are comfortably in the world's top 40 for per capita GDP. But that's peanuts. Lest we forget, that's our declared income. Don't quote me on this apocryphal statistic, but I'm reliably informed that exactly six Greeks declared more than a million EUR in income last time anybody counted. And exactly 85 declared more than half a million. So we're probably a bit better than top 40.
Either that, or this trading floor alone has more rich people than Greece. Hell, our new recruits for this season alone could probably do it. If you have any doubts about Greek wealth, check out on Bloomberg the balance sheet of the National Bank of Greece, Eurobank, Alphabank and Piraeus bank, the top four. The four of them alone command EUR 164 billion in deposits! Slightly misleading, since they all have operations in the Balkans, but that's almost one GDP, lying in deposits!!! More to the point, how many Greeks do you know who keep their money in Greece? That's merely our spending money, it's a small fraction of our savings and assets.
The anonymous banker also notes that since much of Greece's debt is in foreign hands, a default could be more painful for the world at large -- especially EU counterparts like Italy who are also facing massive deficits -- than for Greeks who have untaxed funds stashed away in foreign denominations.
In a dramatic turn of events over the weekend, the OKC/Ver situation that had “gone nuclear” on Friday, appears to be more of a long lasting Fukushima type incident than an atoll test. Read our overview of part 1 and part 2 if you aren't all caught up.
We thought the story couldn't get any more ridiculous, but thanks to the public actions of “the leading global bitcoin exchange”, we are in full blown unicorn territory. In what appears to be a move of desperation, the OKC CEO (Star) took to Reddit in an attempt to clear the air. Pastebin is here, in case that post is removed. Ironically, but not surprisingly, this posting only inflamed the situation further.
In what appears to be the only attempt at negotiation OKC is capable of, they are now offering $20,000 USD to anyone who can prove they are right, and Roger is wrong.
OKCoin will reward $20,000 USD to anyone with authentication skills confirming that the digital and hardcopy of v8 are genuine and signed from December of 2014 by our former employee.
Ok, so at first glance that might not seem too insane… but if you take about .5 seconds to think about the situation, is it ludicrous. In summary, OKC is taking on the NSA in their attempt to break cryptography. If you were one of the individuals who failed the Cicada 3301 challenge, here is your next opportunity.
For those of you that are just joining us, the last few days have been a smorgasbord of deliciousness in the drama that makes up bitcoin.
OKCoin, we at shitcoin, would like to ask you the following:
1. Can you show us your cold storage wallet and proof of BTC(XBT) reserves?
This should be trivial, at best. Stop hunts aside, the community wants answers.
2. Do you have an English speaking lawyer that is interfacing with US authorities, to ensure that OKC is in compliance with US regulations?
3. Can you please outline your corporate structure for the community. Mark Karpeles (of all people – and we thank you Mark, in a non satirical way) posted the attached research paper.
We could go on, and on… and on. Let's just leave it here for now though.
Although short, this post took a considerable amount of time to complete because we kept deleting quality shit in order to keep the butt hurt level down. It probably would have been much more humorous had we left some of the original content, but we don't want to rock to boat too hard. We are hardcore bitcoin believers, that's why this shit is so hilarious. Yajun Li, we want to ask you: Have you reviewed the investment contracts that Tim Draper sent over via Googe Translate? How does a term sheet look after you run it through Google Translate? Does Lawsky use Google Translate as well to communicate with OKC? How do you say business suicide in mandarin?

Related The evil of Aries: Could astrology help point to future jail time? National Post
One Canadian city would like to caution you to beware of loved ones who claim Aries as their zodiac sign—they might be more likely to break the law.
Canada's National Post reports that according to police in Chatham-Kent, Ontario, 203 of 1,986 people arrested last year were Aries, while Sagittarius came in as the least-arrested sign at 139.
It sounds like it was a rather slow day for the city's police force, who compiled this ranking for the first time. The Chatham-Kent Police Service explained their method in a news release: “To provide an interesting astrological perspective, an algorithm was applied to all the arrestees' dates of birth.”
Yet even the police themselves aren't taking the list seriously. “You can't really read too much into it,” police spokesperson Const. Michael Pearce told the National Post.
However, if one wanted to believe that sun signs do give some indication of personalities more prone to breaking the rules, Aries would seem fitting. The National Post's horoscope writer Georgia Nichols told the paper, “Aries is the sign of the warrior. Aries rules the military. Aries jumps in head first, and love adventure.” A fire sign, Aries are known to be bold, impulsive, hot-headed, and quick to temper—traits that those landing in jail might seem to share.
Then again, the individual bad decisions of a few people (like noted Aries Adolf Hitler) who happen to share the same sign shouldn't speak to the character of an entire zodiac sign population (like sweetheart Aries actor Matthew Broderick!). But people really do love to make grand generalizations at times, don't they?

The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday declared Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE is not qualified to serve as president, writing in an editorial that the GOP nominee does not represent Republican ideals.
The newspaper has endorsed the Republican Party's nominee for president every year since 1964. It said that for generations, it had been clear what it meant to be a Republican: "A belief in individual liberty. Free markets. Strong national defense."

"But what does it mean to be a Republican today? With Donald Trump as the party's new standard-bearer, it's impossible to say."
Trump "thumbed their nose at conservative orthodoxy altogether," the Morning News wrote, adding that the GOP nominee has been "at odds with nearly every GOP ideal this newspaper holds dear."
"Donald Trump is no Republican and is certainly no conservative."
It slammed Trump's stance on immigration and their proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country. It also criticized Trump's plans for trade and called out the GOP nominee for some of their positions regarding military.
"It's not easy to offer a shorthand list of such tenets, since Trump flips from one side to the other, issue after issue, sometimes within a single news cycle. Regardless, their ideas are so far from Republicanism that they have spawned a new description: Trumpism," the editorial said.
"We have no interest in a Republican nominee for whom all principles are negotiable, nor in a Republican Party that is willing to trade away principle for pursuit of electoral victory."
The publication said Trump should not reflect the "GOP of the future."
"Donald Trump is not qualified to serve as president and does not deserve your vote," the editorial said.
An exploration of the art you almost never notice.
Long before computer generated effects dominated science fiction, matte paintings were the go-to aesthetic tool in creating evocative outer space environments. A long used technique in classic Hollywood for films that couldn't afford on-location shoots or in situations that defied the production limits of the pre-digital world, matte painting was often deployed in conjunction with live-action shots. The aim was to create a seamless blend between the real and imagined world being created for the cameras. Of all the techniques that brought together the magic of the original Star Wars trilogy, it is likely that matte paintings rank among the least heralded – though without the contribution of artists like Chris Evans, Mike Pangrazio, Frank Ordaz, Harrison Ellenshaw, and Ralph McQuarrie, it's hard to imagine how Star Wars could have so thoroughly captured our imaginations.
While there are a number of techniques used in the making of matte paintings, for the original trilogy, the oil paints on glass technique was used. Glass was preferred largely for its ability to be illuminated, whereas oil paints have long been the preferred medium for lifelike and fluid images. Unlike other paints, like acrylics or watercolors (discounting that these two other mediums would also be less effective on glass), oil paints are able to hold the most pigment, creating more vivid colours. Also, unlike acrylics that darken as they dry or the more translucent watercolor, oils appear as applied – though they require more time to dry and often a more in-depth chemical intuition on the part of the artist.
Matte painting has a texture of heightened reality, a little more precise and clear than the world we can see and experience with our own eyes. Elements worth noting are more defined, whereas those that are not important fade towards the background. Also, in the case of Star Wars, they are filled with incredible and seemingly unnecessary detail – leading to an incredibly rich and lived in environment. More often than not, the effect is so lifelike that the transition between painting and live-action is unnoticeable to even the trained eye.
One of the best examples in the entire trilogy of the realism and effectiveness of matte painting comes in Return of the Jedi, when Darth Vader awaits the arrival of Emperor Darth Sidious. In two sequential shots, two matte paintings are used. First, an exterior of the Death Star with the Emperor and their approaching entourage followed by the meeting between Sidious and Vader. If you take a moment to pause at the exterior, you can see in astonishing detail the different metallic shades, glowing lights and added grime go into creating the illusion of a created object. In motion, in particular, as your attention is focused in the arriving ships rather than the backdrop, it is nearly impossible to tell that what you are looking at was painted by hand.
The interior is even more impressive since it tricks the eye into believing a crowd of motionless stormtroopers are in fact, living, breathing, and sentient. In this behind the scenes featurette, the true scope of what was created through painting is revealed, showing how smooth the transition was. Through the added magic of matte printing, in which the still and live-action image are combined, just a handful of extras is used while the painting rather seamlessly hints at thousands on hand for the emperor's arrival. The clip gives an interesting perspective on how, up close and personal, the illusion remains strangely hypnotic and effective.
The Matte Paintings of The Original Star Wars Trilogy
These sequences used throughout the original trilogy lent Star Wars an impossibly larger scope than what would have been impossible to achieve through mere production design. It would be decades before computer effects would be able to achieve any semblance of the same reality or richness of vision, as evidenced by Lucas' rather primitive attempt to use computer generated backdrops and environments in their prequels. While in some cases the effects are pretty dated, they are still undeniably well ahead of their time. The problem with the prequels' attempt to computerize the effect of matte painting was foregoing depth of field: more often than not, Lucas rarely had any characters moving or even existing on anything but a horizontal axis.
While, as with the example from Return of the Jedi, characters move through space dynamically. This not only serves to distract from the stillness of a painted image but, more integrally, creates an image that is more appealing and exciting to the eye. Without the thankless work of matte painters, the original trilogy would never have felt so expansive. Though these craftsmen are increasingly rare and under-appreciated, Star Wars owes much of its heart to their dedicated efforts.
Last week, we indulged our curiosity by checking in with some of our favorite '90s Nickelodeon stars. Turns out we weren't the only ones who were wondering what happened to Sam from Clarissa. The response was huge. So we've decided to another round. You see, if SNICK was our Saturday night standby as kids, it was ABC's TGIF lineup that we looked forward to on Fridays. Obviously, you know where the Full House gang is now: Stephanie's an ex-meth addict, Joey is an Alanis Morissette song, Michelle is a pair of alien mini-moguls, Danny has a dirty mouth, and The Gibbler is married with two kids. But if you're wondering what happened to Family Matters‘ Waldo Geraldo Faldo, Rider Strong from Boy Meets World, and the entire cast of Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, we've got the answers.
Family Matters, 1989-1997
No series is synonymous with TGIF like this long-running '90s staple that was itself a Perfect Strangers spinoff. When we were kids, most people simply called it “the Urkel show.” So, of course, we're going to have to start by checking in with Steve Urkel himself. Since hanging up their glasses, Jaleel White has been more Stefan Urquelle, if you know what we mean. In 1999, they starred in the short-lived UPN sitcom Grown Ups. Since then, he's mostly been taking roles in smallish films and guesting on TV shows. But you may remember them from a small part in 2006's Dreamgirls. Off the screen, White earned a BA from UCLA Film School in 2001. You can follow them on Twitter and watch their most recent project, 2009's Road to the Altar, a web series about a black man marrying a younger Jewish woman, here.
So, what about Urkel's lady love, Laura Winslow? Kellie Shanygne Williams has been on and off TV since the series wrapped, popping up as a recurring character on Eve, The Parkers, and Moesha. Like White, who was a close friend of Williams' on set, they attended UCLA, where they studied psychology. Since then, she's done a great deal of charity work and gotten married to a lucky man named Hannibal Jackson. Last year, they appeared in Steppin': The Movie alongside their former TV dad, Reginald VelJohnson. Carl Winslow is still a fixture, if not quite a star, on the big and small screen, where they have basically made a career out of playing a cop. But it seems their true love is the theater, where he's done most of their post-Family Matters work. VelJohnson's on-screen wife, JoMarie Payton, spent the first half of the '00s as the voice of Suga Mama on The Proud Family. She's also played recurring characters on Moesha and Will & Grace. And did you know that in 1999, they release the jazz album Southern Shadows?
The Winslows' other notable offspring (let's be honest, no one cares about the youngest two), Darius McCrary, has had a busy and diverse career. These days, you can watch them as Malcolm Winters on The Young and the Restless. If, however, you're more of a torture porn fan, you may have spotted McCrary in last year's Saw VI. Like their TV mama, the erstwhile Eddie Winslow is a musician, and he's currently readying an album for an August 3rd release. Listen to their music here. You can also find them on Facebook and Twitter. Of course, any update on the Family Matters crew would be remiss to exclude Eddie's daft buddy, Waldo Geraldo Faldo. Shawn Harrison spent 2002-2007 playing the flamboyant, gay Peaches on the series Girlfriends. And a few years ago, they voiced Timber Wolf on the Kids' WB show Legion of Superheroes. The last we heard from Harrison, they were sitting down for an interview this April with their friend Judith, a proud 37-year-old virgin. It seems he's single and not ready to marry and was also a psychology major at UCLA.
