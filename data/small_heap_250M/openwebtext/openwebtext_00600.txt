Mr. Bush's responsibility for the disaster now unfolding is twofold: He failed to target Iran a decade ago, and created a climate that made it very difficult to target Iran today. The Bush administration didn't initiate a political-economic siege on Iran when it was weak, and Mr. Bush weakened America by exhausting its economic power and military might in a futile war. By the time American resolve was needed to fend off a genuine global threat, the necessary determination was no longer there. It had been wasted on the wrong cause.
The correct way to confront the Iranian threat would have been to establish a broad coalition including Russia, the European Union, Sunni Arab countries, Israel and the United States. This would have placed Iran's leaders in a real stranglehold and forced them to abandon their nuclear project — just as Libya did in 2003.
The Republican Party could have done that in 2003 or 2005 or 2007. But Republican leaders squandered the opportunity. Worse still, the United States got bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan and that sucked all the oxygen out of America's lungs. Mr. Bush passed on to Mr. Obama a nation that had lost much of the resolve it had possessed. When faced with a real threat to world peace, America's will was spent. It had evaporated in the violent streets of Basra and Baghdad.
Sure, Mr. Obama has made mistakes, too. After coming to office, he wasted time on a futile policy of engagement and then on ineffective sanctions. He ignored the British, French, Israelis, Egyptians and Saudis who warned him that he was being naïve and turned his back on the freedom-seeking Iranian masses in June 2009. When Mr. Obama finally endorsed assertive diplomacy and punitive sanctions in 2011 and 2012, it was too little, too late.
But Mr. Obama was operating within the smoky ruins of the strategic disaster he had inherited.
After Iraq, America is a traumatized nation, with a limited attention span for problems in the Middle East. The empire is weary. It has lost the ardor and wisdom needed to deal with the cruelest of the world's regions and with the most dangerous of the world's evil powers.
The Geneva agreement being negotiated is an illusion. The so-called moderate president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, is an illusion, too. So is the hope that Iran's supreme leader can be appeased. Because America missed the opportunity for assertive diplomacy, all the options now left on the table are dire ones.
Rather than pursuing a dangerous interim agreement, the West must insist that all the centrifuges in Iran stop spinning while a final agreement is negotiated. President Obama was right to demand a settlement freeze in the West Bank in 2009. Now he must demand a total centrifuge freeze in Iran.
I'm writing this blog on the anniversary of Juan Mari Brás' death on Sept 10 of 2010. Mari Brás was a prominent socialist and independentista from Puerto Rico. He had also been a wealthy business owner, and was reputed to have treated his workers very well.
Puerto Rico had been annexed to the U.S. in 1898 and everyone born there made an American citizen in 1917, exactly 100 years ago. By the time the Nationality Act of 1940 was passed, the territory was, for all legal intents and purposes, part of the United States and not different from a State of the Union for citizenship and nationality purposes. Section 302 of the Act states:
… All persons born in Puerto Rico … are citizens of the United States at birth.
Today, less than 3% of the island's population votes in favor of independence. In previous decades, there was a vibrant independence movement and activists tried by various means–sometimes even by violence–to advance their cause. But Mari Brás stood out among the rest and gained international fame by attempting to prove his theory that there was a Puerto Rican nationality and citizenship that was distinct and separate from American nationality and citizenship.
This he argued by various methods: first, he cited the fuzzy legal framework from before 1917, which is the year when Puerto Rico residents became American citizens. Prior to that, Puerto Rico had been occupied by the United States since 1898, and its residents were considered “Puerto Rican citizens”, argued Mari Brás. They were no longer subjects of the Spanish crown, and not yet American citizens. Therefore, this stage in history proves the existence of Puerto Rican “citizenship”.
Another way to argue this is within the U.S. constitutional framework, which states that residents are citizens of both the United States and the state of their residence. But this did not appeal too much to Mari Brás, who wanted to argue nationalist ideas into his claim to Puerto Rican citizenship.
So one day (I believe this was in the 1990's), he went to Venezuela, and once there he visited the US Consulate and gave up his American citizenship. He was hoping to build a movement of nationalists giving up American citizenship in order to start gaining recognition for his citizenship by other nations, and in fact hundreds after him gave up their citizenship, although nothing came with it. Puerto Rican citizenship, for all purposes, is a kind of American citizenship. There is no PR visa or passport, so no one can travel with this citizenship. No country recognizes it. It is only a symbol.
But the whole world was watching. Consider the Pandora's Box that this would have opened, had it been allowed to go on. Not only did hundreds of people in the island territory give up their citizenship as protest against colonialism: if some form of recognition of their PR citizenship took place, perhaps other states or territories might begin to use the same tactic and attempt to build in the public imagination the idea of a “Texan citizenship” for instance, and perhaps even prop it up with benefits or incentives.
So within a few weeks of what went down in history as no more than a media stunt, Mari Brás received a letter from the federal government which restored his American citizenship, and so did all the other activists who followed in his footsteps. It turned out that, in order to give up American citizenship, one had to become a citizen of another nation, and since Mari Brás had not become a citizen of Venezuela, or Spain, or any other nation, he was still an American citizen.
The weeks when he thought he was only a Puerto Rico citizen seem to have been among the happiest in his life. He was constantly cheerful. When asked if he feared what would happen, should he be unable to return to the island from Venezuela, he laughed and said: “Where are they going to deport me to? Mayagüez?”, referring to the city of his birth.

The image of Cat Zingano, moments after losing to Ronda Rousey in just 14 seconds at UFC 184, is a haunting one. Zingano, who had been through so much recently in her personal life, saw the biggest fight of her career play out in diabolical super-speed — a nightmare come to life that was being processed on the fly as Joe Rogan asked her what had happened.
“I want to do it again,” Zingano said, shaking her head like she couldn't come to grips. “She had my arm, and I saw my leg right there, and I thought to grab it and hold it, and all of a sudden I'm tapping. It was in, but it wasn't in, ahh, f*ck. I want to do it again. It was in. She did it, she f*cking won, she did good. That was a good armbar, she did it.”
Asked what was going through her mind, it was like denial — the trauma of replaying a runaway truck that went over the ledge at 60 MPH.
“I just want to do it again,” she said, eyes on the canvas. “I just want to do it again. I want to do it again.”
Cut forward over two years later, and Zingano has gotten on with life after that lingering sequence of events…the flying knee, the throw, the scramble, the reversal, and the armbar. She has moved from her home of Broomfield, Colorado to her new environs at Alliance in Southern California. The tragic events that led up to that fight, namely the death of her husband Mauricio, have been stored in a place that can no longer be communicated in proportion to the profundity of its impact.
She has internalized the most important parts of herself, so that she can regain a sense of normalcy in resuming her career. Even through her fight with Julianna Pena at UFC 200, Zingano has been very guarded in talking about her personal life and the after effects of becoming just another one of Rousey's victims. Particularly with media and those that don't know her.
Yet a weird thing happened at the UFC Athlete Retreat, which took place in Las Vegas from May 19-21. Amid the festivities that were planned for some 300 fighters from the UFC roster in attendance, Zingano had a moment with a total stranger, yet a familiar one who was there for the same reasons. That stranger was UFC strawweight Kailin Curran, who randomly encountered Zingano, and told her — out of the blue — that she still believed in her.
Life has gone on. Life has been paused. Fragments of life had been put away on some high shelf that Curran got to in a single bound.
“One night we all ended up in one of my [Alliance] teammate's rooms and everybody was getting ready, and I don't remember who Kailin was with or why she was in the room, but I saw her,” Zingano told MMA Fighting. “We walked in and she was sitting on the bed. I had never met her, but I'd seen her and her mom online. Her mom had told me she was proud of me at one point, and this even makes me teary-eyed right now thinking about it.
“Kailin said to me, ‘Cat, I believe in you — I still believe in you.' She said, ‘I saw your fight with Ronda, and after everything you've been through, all I can feel is what you felt.'”
At a retreat that many felt was a little tone deaf to its athletes in the end, and missed the mark in terms of generating camaraderie with the new ownership group WME-IMG, it still managed to produce a few personal moments of bonding. In Zingano's case, it was this “girl from Hawaii,” who caught her off guard by empathizing with the most harrowing moment of her career, completely unprompted.
Curran busted through two years of emotional barrier by just being human.
“At that moment it was like, why? Why haven't I had enough?” Zingano said. “Why more? Why do I not only lose, but I'm embarrassed? Why is it I make history? And, it hit me. I haven't had a fighter that I don't know talk to me like that, and to feel that for me. I started to tear up, and she stood up and blocked me from everyone, so no one had to see me. And that meant something to me.
“After that night, I didn't see her again. I was looking for her. I was asking everyone where she was, because, it was awkward, you know? All of a sudden I was crying on this chick's shoulder, I don't know her. I've never known her, but she touched something in me that isn't touchable. I don't let people go there. That's my pain. I don't show it.”
Curran, who trains in Orange County with Cristiane “Cyborg” Justino — somebody that Zingano may fight some day soon — didn't mean to tap into that space. She only meant to tell Zingano something that has long been on her mind, and to communicate that one loss — whether it happens in a record-breaking 14 seconds or not — doesn't define her.
“I'm a fighter too,” Curran said. “I've been through a lot too. Not personally, but in the fight game. I got to the UFC and my record isn't the best, and I definitely struggle with things like, do I belong here? Do I belong in the UFC? Because I just keep losing. But also, I have a lot of potential, and I see that. I know what my capabilities are, I just come up short.
“I told her I was there, I was at your [Rousey] fight with my parents, and I got to watch. I told her, ‘I was super-excited for your fight against Ronda, and I honestly you had a good chance of putting on a good fight and potentially beating her.'”
Curran said she felt for Zingano in that moment, and let her know.
“It just happened so quick for her,” she said. “And that's what fighting is sometimes. You train, you put in so much time and so much effort, and you're going through a lot in your personal life. Nobody really knows. They think you just get in there and fight. It's like, man, we go through so much personally, and internally. It's hard for us to speak about those things, and I think that's what makes us stronger fighters, and so passionate about fighting. It's like our outlet to the things we don't know how to talk about.
“I'm a complete stranger, she'd never met me before, ever. It was a pretty cool experience. It just naturally happened. I didn't go there intending to speak to her about that type of stuff. That was something that will I'm sure stick with her, and with me for a long time.”
Zingano, who trains at Alliance in the San Diego area, south of Curran's stomping grounds in Orange County, spent much of the remaining time at the retreat looking for Curran. She wanted to thank her for providing her that uplift. To let her know that their chance encounter had an effect on her, a think she herself didn't expect nor think was possible.
“She got me. She made me cry,” Zingano says. “I asked around for her, and I finally saw that girl [Curran's friend] Katlyn [Chookagian], and I asked her if she would please text her and thank her for doing that last night. Thank you for giving me that moment. That I'll remember it, and I have her back. And if she wants to come train, I got her.
“And then eventually she came down to where we were, and I got to say that to her that. It was like, that would have never happened if the retreat hadn't happened.”
“We're all fighters you know, and they brought us all together, and it's awkward at first because you know people, but you don't really know people,” Curran says. “Cat's like one of those women that, I forget how I knew her story, but I knew it.
“That's just what I felt at the time. Those are my real feelings. I didn't expect for her to get emotional like that. She's a strong woman. Actually I was just shocked, because I wasn't trying to pull out that kind of response. I guess I said something to her and it clicked with her, and it really touched her.”
Zingano would eventually find Curran again before the retreat ended, and Zingano hugged her for saying what she did. Though they come from gyms with potential conflicts of interest — strawweights such as Angela Hill and Jessica Penne train at Alliance, while “Cyborg” trains with Curran — they made a friendship on the spot. It was an unexpected twist to a weekend with so much disenchantment in play, so much disillusion, and so much awkwardness between fighters.
What Curran said was essentially this: In and out of the cage, win or lose, after a triumphant moment or through two years of dark, fighters are rarely alone. There are always others sharing silently in the emotional tolls.
“There was so many other negative things that happened through this athlete retreat,” Curran says. “And for something good like that to come out of it, that's really great.”
Two Eritrean migrant workers were injured overnight as a result of a fire that erupted in their central Jerusalem apartment. An investigation raised suspicions of arson.
Three firefighting units arrived at the apartment, located on Jaffa Street in central Jerusalem slightly after 3 A.M. Ten Eritrean migrant workers were trapped inside the apartment, two of whom sustained injuries due to smoke inhalation and burns. The firefighters quickly put out the fire and opened an investigation into the incident.
Firefighters say that an initial investigation revealed that the fire was a result of arson, pointing at graffiti found at the scene which read “leave the neighborhood.”
According to a Magen David Adom medic who arrived on the scene, the residents of the apartment attempted to put out the fire themselves. They were later taken to Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem.
Jerusalem Police District Chief Niso Shaham instructed a special team to investigate the incident.
Jerusalem arson
Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat condemned the alleged arson, and along with Shaham discussed plans to fight violence in the city.
The incident came hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his ministers to accelerate efforts to deport citizens of South Sudan, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Ethiopia who are living in Israel illegally.

The price of oil has fallen precipitously in recent years and is currently trading below $40 per barrel, but it still accounts for the bulk of Saudi revenue. Despite the price decrease, Saudi Arabia has until now held off on decreasing its oil output, which is nearly at capacity. Such a move would send a strong message to oil markets, and possibly cause a rise in oil futures. Many analysts believe the current Saudi strategy is to squeeze out other oil producers, including the shale industry in the US, and not give ground on its market share.
"Our economy, with the help of God, has what it takes to overcome the challenges," said Salman, who ascended to the throne in January after the death of his predecessor, King Abdullah.
In a speech carried on state television, Saudi King Salman said the budget "comes in light of lower oil prices and economic and financial challenges on regional and international levels."
The Saudi state press agency said total expenditures were expected to reach 975 billion riyals ($260 billion) during the current year, a rise of 13 percent over expectations. The country's Finance Ministry said that total would fall to 840 billion riyals in 2016, a decrease of 14 percent. But revenue forecasts for 2016 were further downgraded by the government, to only 514 billion riyals, meaning a similar gap in the kingdom's balance sheet could carry through at least through next year.
Projecting a record budget deficit of $98 billion in 2015, Saudi Arabia announced a decrease in fuel subsidies on Monday and said it could sell off state assets in the future as the kingdom struggles with plunging oil prices and the cost of its war in Yemen.

For decades, Saudi oil sales have afforded the country's citizens cash handouts and a rich social welfare net. Energy use in the Kingdom has long been heavily subsidized, but on Tuesday the Ministry of Finance said that would begin to change.
According to figures posted by the Saudi press agency, prices for 95 octane gasoline will immediately rise by 40 percent to 0.90 riyals — roughly 24 cents — from .60 riyal per liter. That price level is still less than half of average gas prices in the US this December, and significantly below what a liter costs in much of Europe.
"Instead of paying pennies they will be paying dimes," said Simon Henderson, director of the Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute.
Henderson said the small increase still sends a significant message to Saudi citizens. Though the kingdom has some of the largest foreign reserves, valued at more than $600 billion, earlier this year the IMF estimated that "large fiscal deficits" amid continued stagnation in oil prices could leave the country cashless in five years. Though most analysts don't foresee Riyadh going broke, it was clear on Monday that the kingdom recognizes the potential damage of an extended period of budget shortfalls.
Watch the VICE News documentary Inside War-Torn Yemen: Sanaa Under Attack:
Henderson added that the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, entering its tenth month, was adding extra strain on the country's coffers. In its 2016 budget, Saudi Arabia allocated 213 billion riyals (around $57 billion) to defense and security.
"The Yemen war is certainly costing them a lot in terms of bombs and munitions being dropped, but the greatest concern is that Saudi Arabia is pursuing a policy in Yemen which doesn't appear to have an endgame to it other than a military victory," said Henderson.
The intervention is closely associated with King Salman's son, Mohammad bin Salman, who was appointed as Defense Minister by his father earlier this year. Despite scoring some victories against Houthi rebels and their allies in Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition has failed to regain all the territory seized by the predominantly Zaydi Shia militia since 2014. After peace talks this month ended with few substantive results, fighting has resumed with great intensity in many parts of the country. All sides, including the US-supported Saudi coalition, have been implicated in war crimes.

"It is a very expensive war, and of course no one knows where it's going in 2016," said Anthony Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "Looking at the figures that have been released, it's uncertain that the defense budget includes all the costs of foreign arms purchases that are scheduled. The Saudis may be forced to choose between the war and the arms imports — you only have so much money."
To cover the deficit, the Saudi government is expected to dip into its reserves and tap domestic and international bond markets, where — at least for now — the country enjoys high credit ratings and can borrow at low interest rates.
"It's easy enough for them to raise money — this is okay for a year or so," said Henderson. "But the big overarching question is where is the price of oil going?
'The Saudis may be forced to choose between the war and the arms imports — you only have so much money.'
"To the extent that the Saudis have been predicting this, they previously anticipated that it would begin to recover later in 2016," he added. "Indeed there has been some Wall Street analysis along similar lines, but how much it will recover by is a big question. My own view is that oil prices will continue to remain weak."
Cordesman said that the Saudis are in some ways better equipped to weather the downturn than other Sunni Gulf countries due to the billions the kingdom has saved over the years. But it also plays an outsized role in the region, where it views the conflict in Yemen as part of a larger rivalry with Iran, who it accuses of supporting the Houthis. Any further retrenchment in oil prices, he added, could threaten recent efforts by the Saudis to support the job market and diversify their economy away from the petroleum industry.
"The problem the Saudis face is not this year," Cordesman said. "But you can't possibly save enough when you are arming to deal with Iran and when you have major domestic pressures, and you are trying to create jobs and housing, and are now dealing with the war in Yemen."

A lawyer for the former spy agency contractor has pointed out that Edward Snowden was told to flee Hong Kong by a middleman claiming to represent the Chinese controlled territory – which evidently could mean the advice was Beijing-backed.
Lawyer Albert Ho, who is also a Hong Kong legislator critical of China, indicated that he was approached by Snowden several days ago, according to Reuters.
The American asked the Hong Kong government if he could leave the city freely if he chose to do so, and tried to find out the Hong Kong government's position on his situation.
After that, Ho met a senior Hong Kong official, who did not offer any comment.
However, Ho claims Snowden later told him an individual supposedly representing the Hong Kong authorities had contacted him and indicated he should leave the city, and wouldn't be stopped by the authorities.
Ho said he believed the middleman was acting on Beijing's orders. However, he had no solid evidence to prove it.
"They (Beijing) used someone behind the scenes to get Snowden to leave. And the Hong Kong government didn't have much of a role. Its role was to receive instructions to not stop him at the airport," Ho told Reuters.
Ho stressed that in his opinion the case was clearly monitored and controlled by Beijing.
"From seeing the nervousness with which the Hong Kong government didn't even give me any details at all <...>I have grounds to believe that the Hong Kong government had no authority over this case. That's to say the whole case was decided by Beijing."
Hong Kong is a former British colony which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 and although it retains an independent legal system and its own extradition laws, China is believed to have control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs.
The Hong Kong government didn't immediately comment on Ho's claims.
The Chinese government has expressed “grave concern” about the revelations of the US government's cyberattacks on Beijing.
“This once again proves that China is a victim of cyberattacks," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
On Sunday, the NSA leaker fled from Hong Kong to Russia, and was supposed to board a plane for Havana, Cuba.
However, he wasn't seen during the boarding which took place at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Monday.
The White House expressed objections to authorities in Hong Kong and China that the countries let the whistleblower flee, and to Russia, urging Moscow to extradite Snowden to the US as soon as possible.
"We expect the Russian government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the US to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged."
Snowden has been charged by the US authorities with theft of federal government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The last two charges fall under the US Espionage Act.
Image caption Experts say the development of "biorefineries" will revolutionise the role of the green chemicals sector
A facility designed to make the UK a world leader in green chemistry has opened at the University of York.
The Biorenewables Development Centre (BDC) aims to bridge the current gap between laboratories and the chemicals industry, say researchers.
The centre, which received £2.5m funding from the government, was opened by Business Secretary Vince Cable.
Chemicals derived from plants are expected to play an important role in the future as oil supplies decline.
"This new centre will strengthen the UK's position as a leader in the exploitation of high-value chemicals from renewable sources," Mr Cable said.
"It will also help UK companies to access and capitalise on the global growth potential from these new technologies and products."
The centre's director, Joe Ross, said the facility aimed to help industry make the transition from petroleum-based chemicals to renewable feedstocks.
"At the University of York, we have had two centres - one based in biological sciences, the other in chemistry - that are doing a lot of R&D within what we call biorenewables, so using plants or microbes to make useful stuff," Dr Ross told BBC News.
"Over recent years, we have realised that we need to have a centre that allows us to scale up that process. And the result is the BDC."
Peel session
Dr Ross explained that the new hub would also help overcome a number of hurdles that could be preventing the wider uptake of green chemicals.
"We need to be able to demonstrate that you can take things that people may still consider to be unreliable or unpredictable feedstocks and use them within supply chains in a way that is going to be acceptable to industry," he said.
Image caption After being lauded as a green saviour, the "fuel verses food" debate saw the idea fall out of favour
"As well as a technological barrier to get over, there is also - to some extent - a psychological one too.
"I think what this centre does is that it effectively removes the risks from that process - for both large and small companies."
One example of the centre's projects involves working with orange juice producers to extract a compound called limonene from orange peel.
The compound in the skins, which are currently going to landfill, can be used by confectionary manufacturers to modify the taste and texture of chocolate.
"What we are trying to do is see if there are valuable chemicals within that orange peel that can be utilised and make the whole process more viable," Dr Ross observed.
"This is a good example of where you can take a large-volume waste product and start to identify chemicals that you can draw out from it.
"Many companies are interested in looking for and identifying alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals."
Chinese officials said Friday the country is watching the U.S. military closely, after two U.S. bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea.
Two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancers assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron flew a 10-hour mission from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam through the South China Sea Thursday, according to U.S. Pacific Command.
The B-1B is a long-range, multi-mission conventional bomber that has served the U.S. Air Force since the 1980s. Originally designed for nuclear strikes, the bomber is now used exclusively for conventional operations. The aircraft carries the “largest conventional payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory, according to the Air Force.
During Thursday's training exercise, part of U.S. efforts to maintain a “continuous bomber presence” in the region, the bombers were accompanied by U.S. Navy's USS Sterett guided-missile destroyer.
“China always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country's military activities in the South China Sea,” the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to the overflight, “China's military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability.”
China is sensitive to American military activities in the South China Sea, especially after the Pentagon ordered the first freedom-of-navigation operation under the Trump administration in late May, sending the USS Dewey within 12 nautical miles of territory claimed by China in the Spratly Islands.
China claims the vast majority of the South China Sea, demarcating its territorial claims with a nine-dashed line. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, and Taiwan also have claims to the region.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague discredited China's claims to the South China Sea, but Beijing rejected the authority of the court, as well as the ruling.

Continental collisions gave rise to the Urals between 250 and 300 million years ago, making them among the oldest mountains on Earth. (For comparison, the very old Appalachians started to form about 480 million years ago, while the younger Himalayas started to form about 40 to 50 million years ago). For such an ancient range, it reaches some relatively high elevations.
The highest elevations are found in the Nether-Polar Urals, the second-northernmost section of the range's five segments. On July 13, 2011, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA's Terra satellite acquired this view of the northern part of the Nether-Polar Urals. The scene extends from the northern boundary and ends just short of Mount Narodnaya—1,895 meters (6,217 feet)—the highest point in the entire range.
The Nether-Polar Urals are an alpine environment. At the higher elevations, glaciers sit amid the rocky ridges. At elevations below 500 meters, snow and ice give way to green forests. The forests become denser heading south toward the Northern Urals. Yugyd Va National Park, for example, contains the Virgin Komi Forests, one of the most extensive areas of virgin boreal forest remaining in Europe.
As a whole, the Urals are extremely rich in minerals. More than 1,000 types of minerals can be found here, and many of them are commercially useful.

ANN ARBOR, MI - Three individuals remain in federal custody after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained a group of men at Sava's Restaurant in Ann Arbor on Wednesday, May 24, the agency confirmed.
Restaurant owner Sava Lelcaj told The Ann Arbor News that ICE agents ate at the restaurant, 216 S. State Street, around 11:30 a.m. before entering the kitchen area to look for an employee who was not on duty.
The agents detained multiple people, but released one, she said.
Man detained by ICE at Ann Arbor restaurant 'terrified' Rivera-Ochoa's wife, Nicki Sanchez, translated for her husband of three years, who speaks Spanish and a little English, as he talked about the experience. It took all of 5 minutes before he was back at work, shaken from what had just happened.
ICE confirmed Wednesday evening that three men accused of being in the U.S. illegally were arrested and remain in custody.
"While conducting a targeted enforcement action at Sava's restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers encountered and arrested three individuals on immigration violations," said ICE public affairs officer Rachael Yong Yow.
"Sergio Cardenas Rubio and Jesus Ortiz Hernandez unlawfully entered the United States without inspection at an unknown date and location. Mohamed Souman lawfully entered the country, but did not depart in accordance with the terms of his status. All three are currently in ICE custody."
The agency did not respond to requests for further comment.
Lelcaj said Wednesday afternoon that her company, Savco Hospitality, puts potential employees through a vetting process to determine employment eligibility, and that she believes the arrested employees were legally in the U.S.
She could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday evening.
Ann Arbor Police Chief Jim Baird was made aware by ICE of a targeted enforcement detail at an Ann Arbor restaurant on Wednesday morning within an hour of the ICE presence there, Ann Arbor police Detective Lt. Matthew Lige said.
The department was not asked to participate in the enforcement, did not take part in it and was not involved in any prior investigation related to immigration at the restaurant, he said.
A Salaryman (サラリーマン,, Sararīman) is a salaried worker and, more specifically, a Japanese white-collar worker who shows overriding loyalty to the corporation where he works.
Japan's society prepares its people to work primarily for the good of the whole society rather than just the individual,[original research?] and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours,[1] additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking, singing karaoke and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating from college and stays with that corporation his whole career.
Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.
History [ edit ]
The word "salaryman" saw widespread use in Japan by 1930, "although the white-collar class remained relatively small until the rapid expansion of government bureaucracies and war-related industry before and during World War II."[2]
The term does not include all workers who receive a set salary, but only "white-collar workers in the large bureaucracy of a business firm or government office." The term includes those who work for government (e.g. bureaucrats) and major companies (e.g. those listed in Nikkei 225). Workers in the mizu shōbai (nightlife) and entertainment industries (including actors and singers) are not included even though their income may be salary based. Similarly, doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, musicians, artists, politicians, the self-employed, and corporate executives are also excluded.[2]
A typical description of the salaryman is a male white-collar employee who typically earns his salary "based on individual abilities rather than on seniority."[3] Salarymen are known for working many hours, sometimes up to sixty hours per week. Oftentimes, because of his busy work schedule, the salaryman does not have time to raise a family and his work becomes a lifelong commitment. Companies typically hire the salarymen straight after high school, and they are expected to stay with the company until retirement, around the time they reach the age between 55 and 60. As a reward for the demonstration of their loyalty, companies rarely fire the salarymen unless it is under special "dire" circumstances.[3] There is also a belief that the "amount of time spent at the workplace correlates to the perceived efficiency of the employee." As a result of this intense work-driven lifestyle, salarymen may be more likely to suffer from mental or physical health problems, including heart failure or suicide.[3]
The media often portray the salaryman in negative fashion for lack of initiative and originality. Because of this portrayal, communities may be less willing to help the salaryman with his emotional problems, which often leads to clinical depression or even suicide. Corporations are often more willing to fire salarymen to lower costs, and many Japanese students are attempting to veer off the typical path of graduating from college to enter a corporation and become a salaryman. The act of escaping from the corporate lifestyle is known as datsusara. A vivid portrait of this can be found in the 2002 Takeshi Kitano film, Dolls.

The prevalence of salarymen in Japanese society has given birth to many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include Mr. Salaryman, Japanese Salaryman NEO (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled History of a Salaryman. There is a certain expectation among the middle and upper classes for Japanese men to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men, accepting anything less than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him, but of his parents.[4]
The life of a salaryman revolves around work. The activities that he does outside of work typically involve his coworkers, which lessens the distance between him and work. Due to this expectation, there have been a variety of derogatory names given to salarymen: shachiku (社畜) meaning corporate livestock, kaisha no inu (会社の犬) dog of the company, and kigyou senshi (企業戦士) corporate soldier, to ridicule salarymen.
Entertainment [ edit ]
Changing social circumstances have greatly diversified the life of the salaryman outside of work. Though the importance of social drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home after the collapse of the economy during the 1990s. Mahjong was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common to not show any interest at all. Some current salarymen do not partake in the game.
Golf became widely popular during the economic bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for currying favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf to participate in golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and the ritual of playing golf with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and golf is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.[5]
Karōshi [ edit ]

Extreme pressure on salarymen can lead to death by overwork, or karōshi.[6][7] Salarymen feel intense pressure to fulfill their duty to support their family because of the gendered expectations placed on men. According to a Washington Post article, the Japanese government attempted for years to set a limit to the number of hours one can work, and the issue has been prevalent since the 1970s. In 2014, after 30 years of activism, Japan's parliament (the Japanese Diet) passed a law "promoting countermeasures against karōshi."[7]
However, many Japanese still criticize the government and believe there should be laws and penalties for companies that violate work hour laws. Approximately 2000 applications are filed by the families of salarymen that die of karōshi.[when?] However, the death toll may be much higher, and "as many as 8000 of the 30,000 annual suicides each year are thought to be work-related," with "as many as 10,000 non-suicide karōshi deaths per year."[6]
Karōshi, literally "overwork death," was first diagnosed as a "circulatory disease brought on by stress" in the late 1970s after the 1973 oil crisis, which took a toll on the post-war reconstruction of Japanese industry.[7] Since then, the number of deaths from overwork has increased, especially at larger and more prestigious companies. In 2002, Kenichi Uchino, a 30-year-old quality-control manager at Toyota, collapsed and died after working over 80 hours unpaid overtime for six months. After this incident, Toyota announced it would begin monitoring their workers' health and pay for all of their overtime hours.[7]

With quitting smoking on top of many a list of new year's resolutions, the broker has considered what a decline in smoking means for the tobacco industry.
The habit has been on the wane since the 1960s, when just over half of adults in Britain smoked. With people becoming more conscious of the health risks associated with smoking and the introduction of the smoking ban in 2007, that figure had dropped to a fifth by 2008.
“The percentage of smokers is declining across the developed world, and the declines are more or less in a straight line in most markets,” said analysts.
“If these trends continue, then by 2050, many important tobacco markets will have gone to zero smoking.”
But Citigroup stressed that these were “extremely long-term” trends and did not justify any action as yet, adding that pricing increases will continue to drive profit growth for tobacco companies until about 2020.
However, they did point to other more imminent challenges, including the advent of plain packaging.
Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, said late last year that the government was considering plans to sell cigarettes in plain packaging in an attempt to deter children from taking up the habit.
Citigroup analysts said they believed generic packaging was likely in Australia, but unlikely in Europe. They added that in their view, it would make "surprisingly little difference to smoking rates or profits".
"We don't believe smokers are attracted to smoking by the packs because graphic health warnings already make them look revolting. Furthermore plenty of drugs are bought without branded packaging," said the broker.
Citigroup downgraded their rating on Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International to "hold" from "buy". But stressed they were not turning "ultra-bearish" on the sector.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Romanians have paid tributes to King Michael, who died at the age of 96
Georgeta Untaru lays a white chrysanthemum - "for his sincerity" - and lights a candle on the steps of the royal palace.
A geologist by profession, she was born in March 1944, five months before the 23-year-old King Michael succeeded in switching Romania from the Nazi to the Allied side in World War Two.
"Throughout the communist years, they taught us only bad things about him. It was only when he came back for the first time, in 1992, that I realised I'd been indoctrinated. Then I started to find out more about who he really was," she says.
Next to pay a tribute was an older lady, Ileana, who was glad to speak but unwilling to disclose her age. Her father fought in the Royal Romanian army in both world wars, she said, and was decorated by the king for his bravery, fighting the Soviets on the Eastern Front.
"After the war the communists could never forgive him for that. He was thrown out of the army, and died of sadness soon afterwards."
Above the palace, nowadays the National Art Museum, the Romanian flag flies at half mast. The pavement and railings are strewn with candles, flowers, and portraits of the king.

Just down the road at a large, rather elegant bookshop, Ciprian Ciocan has made a pile of all the books on the king and the royal family, and is just starting to put them on display.
The king's coffin will lie in state at the palace for two days before his funeral. He remembers the king visiting his home town of Galati, on the River Danube in eastern Romania in the 1990s, and his grandparents' excitement.
"Romania would certainly be on a better path today, if the monarchy had been restored," he said.
At least a dozen books on him and the royal family have been published in recent years, he said, as Romanians rediscovered their royal family.
There are conversations with the king, a selection of his favourite music on CDs, and even a book of photographs of him with his favourite cars.
He was a keen mechanic, happiest when tinkering with the engine of one of the two jeeps the communists allowed him to take out of the country when he was forced to abdicate 70 years ago.

In the Herastrau Park at the Elisabeta Palace, a book of condolences lies beneath a portrait of the king as the wintry sun shines in through the hallway of his former residence. An officer in full dress uniform shows me inside. A lady in deep mourning hands me a pen to sign the book.
Among the many tributes to him, perhaps the most surprising was from Ion Iliescu, Romania's Socialist president in the years after the 1989 revolution and the man who did the most to prevent a restoration of the monarchy in the early 1990s. Mr Iliescu posted a photograph of himself handing a huge bunch of yellow roses to a stony-faced King Michael.
"Our relationship was not easy, in the troubling times of the birth of the transition… Together we managed to convey to our partners a strong message on adopting the values of the European community," he wrote. "May God rest his soul."
Image caption Tributes have been paid in a book of condolences at the Elisabeta Palace
Republican Romania is deeply polarised today, between the governing Socialists and liberals who accuse them of trying to weaken the powerful anti-corruption agency. Ironically the king's death, at this moment, may help the current government to survive.
Anti-government protests have been postponed out of respect for the period of mourning.
A military plane will bring his body back to Romania from Switzerland - where the royal family settled after leaving the country - next Wednesday. His coffin will be taken first to Peles Castle at Sinaia in the high Carpathians, before being brought back to Bucharest.

He will be buried on 16 December with full state honours at Curtea de Arges, north of the capital, beside his wife Queen Anne, who died last year. Margareta, 68, the eldest of their five daughters, is next in line to the throne the family lost.
Might the monarchy yet be restored? At the palace gates, Cristian Soimoru, a 44-year-old jurist, shakes his head. "Romania missed so many opportunities," he says sadly. "Michael was our last king."

BOSTON - NBA players have been known to play with a torn thumb ligament.
Devin Harris did it late in the season and during the playoffs in 2016.
Nerlens Noel's situation is different. Unlike Harris, who was under a long-term contract, Noel is heading into free agency. He also has fallen out of the playing rotation.
For those reasons - plus the fact that Noel has trouble just catching a basketball because of the torn ligament near his left thumb - the veteran center will have surgery to correct the problem.
Noel will fly from Boston to Cleveland on Thursday to meet with a hand specialist and will have surgery Friday, the Mavericks said. He will likely miss about four to six weeks, but the hope is that Noel will be back on the court before the trade deadline.
The timing, of course, doesn't look great.
Noel has become an afterthought in coach Rick Carlisle's rotation and while he has handled the situation diplomatically, it's fair to say the season has been a colossal disappointment so far from both Noel's and the Mavericks' perspective.
Owner Mark Cuban said this is not a case of Noel having the procedure done so that he can be "put out to pasture" for the season.
Noel injured the thumb early in the season, although he could not remember precisely which game. He played with it for a while, but the situation has not improved and, with him set to become a free agent this summer, it makes sense from his standpoint to have the procedure so that he can return in the second half of the season and try to rebuild some of his market value with a healthy hand.
For the Mavericks, he can't help the team in his current state, so it makes sense.
"It's not anything crazy," Noel said. "It's a pretty common injury for a basketball player. I'm just going to get it taken care of. I showed it to the trainers and they said, that it's not right. They said I should probably get some surgery and get it fixed up now.
"I can play basketball with it. A couple guys in here have had it."
One of those was Harris, who had a similar surgery done after the season ended in 2016. But he also was under a long-term contract at the time, which does get factored into the situation. Noel wants to make sure all teams, the Mavericks included, know he's not damaged goods going into the summer.
Assuming things go well, Noel could be back on the court by mid-January, which would give him time to try to get back into the playing rotation. The injury certainly played a part in his lack of playing time the past month.
"He's got a torn ligament that's affecting his ability to catch the ball and things like that," Carlisle. "As for all the other stuff. He's a part of this team and he's been very professional. Our No. 1 thing as a franchise is to get him 100-percent healthy and go from there."
Noel said he'll come back with the same outlook that he's tried to keep during the time when he's essentially been the last man on the bench.
"I'm not really too worried," he said. "I'm in a great place. I know I can step on the court at any time and change the game. I'm just going to keep working."

Android tablets are all the rage these days. Just scanning through the front page at Phandroid and you will see post, after post of the Asus Transformers selling out minutes after they're available. They've been harder to snag than a 1996 Tickle Me Elmo!
But there's always those who don't feel like waiting around for their taste of Honeycomb and have moved onto Acer's line of Iconia A500 tablets. According to Acer, you wouldn't be alone. Acer is projecting that will have shipped nearly 1 million tablets during the spring which would make the Iconia tab the most successful Android tablet to date. As a refresher, Motorola only shipped 250,000 Xooms during their first quarter.
As a fair warning, Acer has also said that they're finding it hard to keep up with demand so if you were on the fence about picking up one of these Iconia tablets, you might want to make a choice quick. Lest we have another Asus Transformer fiasco on our hands. Any Phandroids out there who are currently Iconia users? Have anything good or bad to say about the tablet?

California medical marijuana grower, spiritualist, and activist Eddy Lepp was sentenced Monday to a mandatory minimum 10-year prison sentence on federal marijuana cultivation charges in a case where he grew more than 20,000 pot plants in plain view of a state highway in Northern California's Lake County. US District Court Judge Marilyn Patel also sentenced him to five years probation. He must report to federal authorities by July 6.
Eddy Lepp (courtesy cannabisculture.com)
Lepp contended that the plants were a medical marijuana grow for members of the Multi Denominational Ministry of Cannabis and Rastafari and legal under California law. But during his trial, he was not allowed to introduce medical marijuana or religious defenses. He was found guilty of conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute more than 1,000 pot plants and of cultivating more than 1,000 plants, which carries a maximum life sentence.
According to California NORML (CANORML) and the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, there were gasps and sobs from Lepp supporters in the courtroom as Patel passed sentence. The sentence was "extreme," Patel conceded, but said her hands were tied by federal law.
In a nod toward the current turmoil over the status of federal prosecutions of medical marijuana providers, Judge Patel said Lepp could apply for a rehearing if the laws changed. Lepp and his attorneys plan to appeal the verdict and the sentence.
Lepp attorney Michael Hall told Patel the sentence was "incredible."
"Incredible is what the law requires," Patel responded, adding that legalizing marijuana appeared to be Lepp's driving passion. "Maybe you want to be a martyr for the cause," she said.
Sentencing Lepp, a 56-year-old veteran in ill health, to prison is a travesty and a waste, said supporters. "This case sadly illustrates the senselessness of federal marijuana laws," said CANORML's Dale Geiringer. "The last thing this country needs is more medical marijuana prisoners. Hopefully, we can change the law and get Eddy out of jail before he completes his sentence."
"Locking up Eddy Lepp serves no purpose and is a huge waste of life and scarce prison space," said Aaron Smith, California policy director of the Marijuana Policy Project. "The community would be a lot better served if we taxed and regulated California's $14 billion marijuana industry rather than continuing to incarcerate nonviolent people like Eddy, who are clearly of no danger to society."

A team of researchers announced in the journal Science that they've determined the structure of the Zika virus and found regions where it differs from similar viruses such as West Nile and dengue.
via GIPHY
Those differences could potentially explain how the virus is transmitted and how it causes disease, according to Richard Kuhn, who co-led the team and directs the Purdue Institute for Inflammation, Immunology, and Infectious Diseases.
“The structure of the virus provides a map that shows potential regions of the virus that could be targeted by a therapeutic treatment, used to create an effective vaccine or to improve our ability to diagnose and distinguish Zika infection from that of other related viruses,” says Kuhn. “Determining the structure greatly advances our understanding of Zika—a virus about which little is known. It illuminates the most promising areas for further testing and research to combat infection.”
The Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease, has recently been associated with a birth defect called microcephaly that causes brain damage and an abnormally small head in babies born to mothers infected during pregnancy. It also has been associated with the autoimmune disease Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can lead to temporary paralysis.
In the majority of infected individuals symptoms are mild and include fever, skin rashes and flulike illness, according to the World Health Organization.
Zika virus transmission has been reported in 33 countries. Of the countries where Zika virus is circulating, 12 have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Brazil and French Polynesia have reported an increase in microcephaly, according to WHO. In February WHO declared the Zika virus to be “a public health emergency of international concern.”
New technology made it possible
“We were able to determine through cryo-electron microscopy the virus structure at a resolution that previously would only have been possible through X-ray crystallography,” says Michael Rossmann, who co-led the team and is a professor of biological sciences at Purdue University. “Since the 1950s X-ray crystallography has been the standard method for determining the structure of viruses, but it requires a relatively large amount of virus, which isn't always available; it can be very difficult to do, especially for viruses like Zika that have a lipid membrane and don't organize accurately in a crystal; and it takes a long time.
“Now, we can do it through electron microscopy and view the virus in a more native state. This was unthinkable only a few years ago.”
The team studied a strain of Zika virus isolated from a patient infected during the French Polynesia epidemic and determined the structure to 3.8Å. At this near-atomic resolution key features of the virus structure can be seen and groups of atoms that form specific chemical entities, such as those that represent one of 20 naturally occurring amino acids, can be recognized, Rossmann says.
‘These unique areas may be crucial'
The team found the structure to be very similar to that of other flaviviruses with an RNA genome surrounded by a lipid, or fatty, membrane inside an icosahedral protein shell.
The strong similarity with other flaviviruses was not surprising and is perhaps reassuring in terms of vaccine development already underway, but the subtle structural differences are possibly key, says graduate student Devika Sirohi.
“Most viruses don't invade the nervous system or the developing fetus due to blood-brain and placental barriers, but the association with improper brain development in fetuses suggest Zika does,” Sirohi adds. “It is not clear how Zika gains access to these cells and infects them, but these areas of structural difference may be involved. These unique areas may be crucial and warrant further investigation.”
The team found that all of the known flavivirus structures differ in the amino acids that surround a glycosylation site in the virus shell. The shell is made up of 180 copies of two different proteins. These, like all proteins, are long chains of amino acids folded into particular structures to create a protein molecule, Rossmann says.
Like candy for human cells
The glycosylation site where Zika virus differs from other flaviviruses protrudes from the surface of the virus. A carbohydrate molecule consisting of various sugars is attached to the viral protein surface at this site.
In many other viruses it has been shown that as the virus projects a glycosylation site outward, an attachment receptor molecule on the surface of a human cell recognizes the sugars and binds to them, Kuhn says.
The virus is like a menacing stranger luring an unsuspecting victim with the offer of sweet candy. The human cell gladly reaches out for the treat and then is caught by the virus, which, once attached, may initiate infection of that cell.
The glycosylation site and surrounding residues on Zika virus may also be involved in attachment to human cells, and the differences in the amino acids between different flaviviruses could signify differences in the kinds of molecules to which the virus can attach and the different human cells it can infect, Rossmann says.
“If this site functions as it does in dengue and is involved in attachment to human cells, it could be a good spot to target an antiviral compound,” Rossmann adds. “If this is the case, perhaps an inhibitor could be designed to block this function and keep the virus from attaching to and infecting human cells.”
The team plans to pursue further testing to evaluate the different regions as targets for treatment and to develop potential therapeutic molecules, Kuhn says.
The National Institutes of Health funded the research.

Chris Roberson and Dennis Culver's Edison Rex will go first, with a collection published by IDW in June. Then, in July, Image Comics's Shadowline imprint will release Masks & Mobsters by Joshua Williamson and Mike Henderson.
“Print collections have been a main goal from the beginning and it's really exciting to see such a major piece of the plan fall into place,” Monkeybrain's Allison Baker said, “especially since it means even more people get to discover the amazing work of our creators!”
IDW's slate will continue on with Amelia Cole and the Unknown World by writers Adam P. Knave and D.J. Kirkbride and artist Nick Brokenshire premiering in August and titles like Dan Goldman's Red Light Properties, Kevin Church and Grace Allison's Wander, and many more to follow. “Monkeybrain was founded because we love comics,” Chris Roberson said in a release. “And thanks to IDW, we'll have even more comics to love.”
It was incredibly frustrating that Real Madrid's fixture at Celta Vigo was called off on Sunday, though nobody could help the damage caused by extreme weather.
It offered the chance for Real to maintain the momentum they had garnered since their defeat at the hands of Sevilla, and also a chance to “set the record straight”, after Celta eliminated Los Merengues from the Copa del Rey towards the end of January.
Real had brushed that aforementioned defeat at the Ramon Sanchez Pijuain by defeating Malaga 2-1, and then brushing Real Sociedad aside 3-0, consecutively.
And now they have a stacked schedule before the end of February, starting with Osasuna away this Saturday. Without wanting to jinx it, Real are unbeaten in nine matches against the Navarrans, and should extend that record to 10.
With a number of injuries to players still, Zinedine Zidane needs to carefully consider the usage of his players. As Gerry mentioned “Match postponements can be blessings in disguise”. And allowing Luka Modric a week's extra rest is invaluable. Modric was close to returning on Sunday, but it would have been a big gamble by Zidane.
This, in particular, is troubling as the Champions League also resumes on Wednesday 15 February. But Real Madrid benefit from the first tie being at home, before then hosting Espanyol at Santiago Bernabeu three days later.
Real then play twice further on 22 and 26 February, both away to Valencia and Villarreal, respectively, meaning they will have played five times in 15 days.
Villarreal will undoubtedly be a tough way to bookend this run. Although Valencia is really struggling, I still anticipate a tough encounter.
There is good news for Real, too. Dani Carvajal returned to the group training session today, and Gareth Bale continued his recovery program with a combination of indoor work and some exercises out on the pitch.
Marcelo was expected to be out for around a month (from approximately 23 January), but was caught on film scoring this peach with his right foot in training today.
Though Nacho has been a great auxiliary wing back, and Danilo has even deputized well in the Brazilian and Spaniard's absences, the return of Marcelo and Carvajal will be a big boost to the Whites.
I wrote a while back on whether Karim Benzema or Alvaro Morata should be starting up front, and there have been more calls in recent weeks for Morata to get the opportunity now. I'm a big fan of both, but would like to see Morata given that chance in the next few weeks.
Rumours of his growing discontent are hopefully just that, because he has a big part to play now, and in the future of Real Madrid.
Real Madrid are in a commanding position in La Liga at present, but the next two weeks will tell us all we need to know about Zidane's men.
Judge Finds Maricopa County Jails Fail to Provide Adequate Medical and Mental Health Care
September 30, 2014
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: 212-549-2666, media@aclu.org
PHOENIX – More than four years after a federal judge put the Maricopa County jails operated by Sheriff Joseph Arpaio under court order for neglect of detainees, that same judge, Neil Wake, has ruled that the jails remain under the order. Judge Wake found that the jails continue to provide detainees with inadequate medical and mental health care. The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Arizona – which have represented the detainees for close to 20 years – showed during an evidentiary hearing that concluded in March that the scarcity and poor quality of the jails' medical and mental health care caused unnecessary suffering.
"Those in charge of Maricopa County's jails can no longer skirt their constitutional responsibility for detainees' health," said Eric Balaban, staff attorney for the ACLU's National Prison Project. "Judge Wake found severe problems with the jails' medical care, from intake to treatment. Detainees have had serious illnesses that the jails' staff missed or ignored, causing permanent injuries and even deaths. With today's decision, every detainee at Maricopa County should have access to adequate medical and mental health care. At last."
In August 2013, Maricopa County commissioners and the Sheriff asked the court to lift the order placed on it in 2008 – an order which itself resulted from the jails' failure to provide constitutionally adequate health care and abide by the terms of a 1995 federal court order requiring improvements in health services.
As Balaban explained, "Last year, the Maricopa County jails requested an end to the 2008 court order, claiming that they'd done what was necessary for the detainees' mental and physical health. We said, 'Not so fast.' We investigated, bringing medical and mental health experts to the jail, and what we found showed Judge Wake that the jails have a long way to go before his order can be lifted."
In addition to the ACLU and the ACLU of Arizona, Osborn Maledon, P.A., has assisted on the case.

Baghdad: The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) reportedly blew up a booby-trapped infant during training being given to the militants on use of explosives.
The orphan infant was killed using a remote controlled detonator while teaching trainee terrorists how to assemble improvised explosive devices, according to the Daily Mail news report.
The incident is believed to have taken place near ash-Sharqat in the northern Iraqi province of Salahuddin.
Sadiq al-Husseini, head of the security committee in Diyala, reportedly told Iraqi News that the infant's father was executed by ISIS while the fate of the mother is not known.
He added that the infant's father was kidnapped and later executed by the ISIS after claims that he had killed its militants.
The barbaric reportedly act took place as a form of punishment for the father's act.
There is no doubt that the Moon must be explored and closely examined due to the probability of alien activity on the Moon.The following video and images show alien Moon facility captured by China's second Moon orbiter the Chang'e-2.This report states:"I was sent some pictures by a source who claims China will be releasing Hi Res images taken by the Chang'e-2 moon orbiter, which clearly show buildings and structures on the moons surface.He also claims NASA has deliberately bombed important areas of the Moon in an effort to destroy ancient artefacts and facility's.Pictures yet to be released clearly show nuclear impact craters and building debris caused by explosions in an effort by NASA to destroy the truth.China is moving toward full disclosure of the Extraterrestrial reality, if these images and future ones are verified genuine then NASA should be investigated for fraud and treason.China will be releasing all the data and images from the Chang'e-2 in the coming weeks and months, lets hope this is the beginning of a new era."
US 380 remains congested as a 20-mile construction project to widen the roadway from Loop 288 in Denton to Custer Road continues. But officials say the end result will support the growing development along the corridor and provide better access to the major north/south roadways in Frisco.
According to the Texas Department of Transportation, most commuters travel eastbound US 380 from Denton and westbound from McKinney, then turn southbound on the Dallas North Tollway or Preston Road.
Officials say the expanded roadway will speed the commute for the employees driving south to jobs in rapidly developing Frisco and north Plano.
Frisco Chamber of Commerce President Tony Felker said the completion of the roadway will have a positive impact for the Frisco workforce.
“Frisco will be able to connect to Denton and McKinney easily and those cities will be able to connect to major corridors like the Dallas North Tollway and Preston Road,” Felker said. “This will be a plus for each of the cities in terms of workforce and will improve the overall market.”
Access for the workforce
Felker said transportation is integral to businesses from a logistical perspective because of the necessity of linking a company to its suppliers, customers and workforce.
“For the business climate to be strong, you want to have a good workforce; you want to have access to business, homes and education,” Felker said. “It all ties together, so that's why transportation is such a big focus for the chamber of commerce as we're looking out for the greater business community.”
Felker said once US 380 construction is complete, he expects more workers from the east and west to flock to the Frisco area, especially people in the service industry who might work at restaurants or hotels.
“Many of those service workers may not be able to afford to live in Frisco but [US 380] will provide access to jobs in Frisco for those living in other cities such as Denton,” Felker said.
The next ‘major artery'
Dallas Regional Mobility Coalition Executive Director Drew Campbell said US 380 will be the next “major artery” in Collin and Denton counties as growth continues at a rapid pace in the area.
The transportation advocacy group is made up of cities, counties and transportation agencies in a five-county region, including Dallas, Denton, Collin, Rockwall and Ellis counties.
Campbell compared the US 380 growing pains with the process that the LBJ Express went through from 2009-15 to relieve congestion on I-635.
“Once transportation projects grew and became available throughout Collin County, [the county] quickly grew,” Campbell said. “Just like with any transportation project, there's always going to be growing pains but I think everyone will agree when [LBJ Express] was being built there were growing pains, but now that it's built, I don't know how we ever lived without it.”
Campbell said when US 380 is complete he expects more people and businesses to move into the area.
“Obviously we are doing everything we can to [examine]potential problems with businesses and congestion, but it's just the reflection of a fast-growing area,” Campbell said.
Campbell said as road construction is completed more growth will take place, property values will increase and more schools will be built.
“The better the infrastructure, the more attractive a place becomes to live, work and play,” he said.
Construction Timeline
TxDOT started US 380 construction in March 2016 at a cost of more than $50 million.
Frisco's portion of the US 380 construction includes a 2 1/2-mile stretch from FM 423 to Custer Road. The roadway through Frisco is being widened to a six-lane freeway with eastbound and westbound access roads. Overpasses will be constructed at the DNT, BNSF Railroad and Preston Road intersections.
The first phase of the project, which stretches from Custer Road to Lovers Lane, was completed last fall. The second phase, from Lovers Lane to CR 26, is under construction, and the third phase, CR 26 to Loop 288, is still in the design phase.
The entire project is expected to be complete by winter 2018.
TxDOT spokesperson Michelle Releford said US 380 will remain congested until more lanes and signals become available.
“We work with the cities with the timing of traffic signals to move traffic the best way that it can coming from all directions through an intersection,” Releford said.
According to the city of Frisco, this month eastbound traffic will relocate from existing lanes to the new eastbound frontage road lanes. At the same time westbound traffic will shift onto the existing eastbound lanes. This traffic pattern will remain in place for several months while new westbound frontage roads are constructed.
Developments underway
Aside from road construction, there is also construction on developments along US 380, mainly on the Prosper side. Some of the developments under construction in Prosper include retail centers and medical facilities.
Frisco has planned developments as well, but only residential neighborhoods, including Hollyhock and Prestwick, are under construction. Other planned developments include mixed-used developments, retail centers and a movie theater on the southwest corner of the DNT and US 380.
There are some pieces of land along the southern portions of US 380 that have not yet been sold to developers.
“The reason some of that land is not developed is because property owners are not in the selling mode right now,” said commercial real estate broker Buddy Minett, who works at Herrin Real Estate in Celina and has clients in north Frisco and surrounding cities.
However, Minett said he believes the finished road project will serve to attract developers to the empty tracts and commercial development will be heavy on both sides of US 380.
“Frisco can do more with its [economic development corporation]than anybody else if the right opportunity is there,” Minett said. “It makes it a lot easier for Frisco to attract some really [solid]development because they have a bigger pocketbook.”
For 10 years, a goat named Mr. G and a donkey named Jellybean lived together in neglect "on the property of a woman who could barely care for herself, let alone the dozens of dogs she hoarded and three barnyard animals," Animal Place stated.
After the creatures were rescued, the Grass Valley, Calif., organization took in Mr. G, but sent Jellybean off to another sanctuary.
That didn't sit well with the goat.
"Mr. G refused to eat," the rescue center stated. "He spent his days lying in a corner of his stall, barely lifting his head. Staff tried every treat -– molasses, sweet grain, apples, wetting down food…nothing worked."
Nothing, that is, until a volunteer offered to make the 14-hour roundtrip journey to bring the burro to Animal Place and reunite Mr. G with his best friend.
Watch the video above to see what happened next. Just be sure to have a couple of tissues handy.
"Never doubt the depth of emotions other animals possess," Animal Place wrote. "Mr. G's grief was as deep and mysterious as a human's. His joy at reuniting with Jellybean was as beautiful and inspiring as a human's."
The Django development server is great: it comes in the box, serves Django, auto-restarts on source code changes, and now even color-codes the log lines based on the status returns.
But it isn't multi-threaded, which normally wouldn't be a problem for a development server, unless you're writing Ajax interactions, and these days, who isn't?
The Django team has declared that they will not offer a multi-threaded development server, for good or bad, so we are left to our own devices. James Aylett wrote django_concurrent_test_server which offers multi-threading and forking, though I haven't tried it. David Cramer offers django-devserver which seems to offer a number of interesting new logging options also. Many developers simply use other “real” web servers, like Apache or gunicorn, but those don't detect code changes, and often don't provide stdout for debugging with.
I wanted multi-threading on a project but I didn't want to use a big real web server, and didn't want to install a new Django app and modify settings.py, so I adapted the patch from the closed Django bug ticket to create threadedmanage.py:
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# A clone of manage.py, with multi-threadedness monkeypatched in.
import os , sys
from django.core.management import execute_manager
try :
import settings # Assumed to be in the same directory.
except ImportError :
sys . stderr . write (
"Error: Can't find the file 'settings.py' in the directory containing %r . "
"It appears you've customized things.
"
"You'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.
"
"(If the file settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)
"
% __file__
)
sys . exit ( 1 )
def monkey_patch_for_multi_threaded ():
# This monkey-patches BaseHTTPServer to create a base HTTPServer class that
# supports multithreading
import BaseHTTPServer , SocketServer
OriginalHTTPServer = BaseHTTPServer . HTTPServer
class ThreadedHTTPServer ( SocketServer . ThreadingMixIn , OriginalHTTPServer ):
def __init__ ( self , server_address , RequestHandlerClass = None ):
OriginalHTTPServer . __init__ ( self , server_address , RequestHandlerClass )
BaseHTTPServer . HTTPServer = ThreadedHTTPServer
if __name__ == "__main__" :
monkey_patch_for_multi_threaded ()
execute_manager ( settings )
Now I can run “./threadedmanage.py runserver ..” and get the standard development server, but with multiple threads.
The usual caveats apply: This isn't a real web server, don't use it in production. Your code likely has threading issues, please fix them. I'm pretty sure there are good reasons not to use this code, but it's working well for me.
Two thousand is the number of Democratic House and Senate staffers invited to a screening of the undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissues and organs.
Sixteen is the number of congressional aides who responded to the invitation, sent out by the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. Seven is the number of staffers who actually checked in at the event's registration desk on Capitol Hill Thursday morning.
Two is the number who stayed through to the end of the 90-minute program.
SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said she wasn't surprised.
"Horror is hard to look at," she said to a room mostly filled with reporters and representatives from her organization, plus one staff member from the office of Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who reserved the conference room at the group's request.
From graphic images of dismembered fetuses to blunt descriptions of abortion procedures, Dannenfelser said, "there are a lot of people who really have to look in the face of this horror."
But it turns out a lot of people already have -- even Democrats, who have been accused by Republicans of blindly sticking to abortion rights talking points without watching the footage that's become a catalyst for congressional hearings and a movement to defund Planned Parenthood.
One staffer who stayed for the duration of the screening — Randy Abreu, a law clerk for House Judiciary ranking member John Conyers Jr. of Michigan — said this was his third time watching the series of videos (another Conyers aide arrived late and left early, but wouldn't comment on why he'd attended).
Two aides for Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., walked out partway through because, a Blumenthal spokesman later told CQ Roll Call, they discovered they had already seen what was being screened and didn't need to sit through a rerun.
There are nearly 40 hours of purportedly unedited footage from the hidden cameras during the lengthy sting operation of Planned Parenthood by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, but the videos that have gone "viral" over the past few months are heavily edited.
Supporters say the edits were done merely for length, while critics argue it is a manipulation of the facts. They say Planned Parenthood donates fetal parts for research with the consent of mothers and only requires payment for transport.
Amy Kelbick, a senior policy adviser to Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., walked out before the screening began. Schakowsky's spokesman later said it was because Kelbick had also already watched the edited films and didn't have anything to gain from watching them again.
Meanwhile, the progressive lawmaker's office is among those urging a Justice Department criminal investigation into whether the Center for Medical Progress obtained the Planned Parenthood footage illegally.
But Kelbick did not slip out of the room quietly as others had.
Just as Dannenfelser was just beginning to speak, Kelbick raised her hand and said she wanted to know whether the unedited videos would be shown. Dannenfelser said she wouldn't indulge the interruptions and said Kelbick would be asked to leave if she didn't quiet down.
When Kelbick was finally told the edited videos were queued up, she stood up and left, followed by aides for California Reps. Judy Chu and Grace Napolitano. Dannenfelser chided Kelbick for creating a scene that took attention away from the subject at hand as reporters followed the staffers out of the room for interviews and photographs.
Dannenfelser said it would take far too long to show all the unedited videos, and reiterated what she said in her invitation: Anyone who wanted to watch the full footage on their own would be empowered to do so.
Staffers and reporters were offered the chance to have a personal screening at SBA List headquarters, and representatives from the group also, as promised, passed out bundles of DVD copies of the full footage to take home after the event.
However, some confusion led to the disks being assembled incorrectly, with CQ Roll Call for instance walking away with 10 copies of "PP Video # 4."
Kelbick, incidentally, took 10 copies of "PP Video # 3."

Gallente Militia,
Currently we are in a state of Civil War against Rapid Withdrawal (RDRAW) and their ally Schneckt (SCHNK) only because they became a feeder corp for Snuff, a local pirate group, with whom this militia has had one of the most complicated relationships. However, this was simply the final straw in a history of problems that I believe originated with two events:
RDRAW segregated themselves from the rest of us. By not making friends and by not building camaraderie with their fellow militia mates, a history of bad relations and broken promises of support sloped into complete alienation. Two years ago we began pushing Ishtar doctrines, which ultimately lead the local pirate groups to push themselves to stay ahead of us. Now, the local arena is dominated by groups flying slaved faction battleships, T3 cruisers and capital support in order to stay competitive. Because of our need to keep fighting someone after the Caldari atrophied, we pushed most recruits who couldn't fly our doctrines to RDRAW, believing they would be an excellent training corp. At the time RDRAW was small enough and had good enough FC's to get good fights against most of the remaining squids. Since new and inexperienced pilots need to get lots of fights in order to learn and grow, it seemed to be a win-win situation. However, over the course of a couple years, the gulf of understanding between RDRAW and the rest of Galmil widened immeasurably.
As with many systemic problems, both can be traced to a root cause, which I blame heavily on the RDRAW leadership. The mechanics of FW are open to anyone. In keeping with that theme (and a bit of RP), there exists a democratic style leadership within the Gallente. That famous “old guard cabal” has historically proven itself capable of compromise and politics. Unfortunately, RDRAW CEO Tek Stalker has repeatedly proven himself incapable of compromise to the point that he seemed bent on causing discord within leadership channels. Of course, not everyone in leadership likes everyone else, nor are we required to, but we do respect each other. We all know that we must work together for the greater good, and every corp currently among our ranks has made compromises for the sake of others. This happens on regular basis, when we drop everything we are doing to assist in a campaign, or to take or defend assets belonging to others.
I call on the entire militia to seek to rectify all the problems which keep us apart. We can accomplish this in steps:
First, we must drop our war declarations against Rapid Withdrawal as a show of good faith. Our war decs against them are a matter of principle and a statement of symbolic outrage against their permanent relationship with forces outside the militia. For this to resolve anything, RDRAW must either leave the militia or end their permanent blue status with Snuffed Out. Traditionally, Galmil has been friendly with various pirate groups throughout the war zone, but we continue to fight them occasionally, and our only true blues are other members of the militia. We are who we are because we look out for only each other, and we always fight, no matter the enemy or in this case, frenemy. RDRAW's relationship with Snuff flies in the face of everything we as a group have stood for over the years, and it must be ended to bring peace to the militia.
To be effective as a militia, we must also unify on comms and in fleets. We need to establish the bonds of trust and cooperation that are only possible when we work and live together on TS and in space. Furthermore, when we call for assistance, showing up in your own segregated fleet and comms and then warping out in the middle of a fight simply leads to more losses for every GalMil fleet involved. We call on all of you to join Slack as well, with your leadership having the appropriate admin rights to maintain private channels for you own usage. Working together, we are one of the strongest forces in the War Zone as demonstrated by defense of your home system Sujarento, where we held the field against almost every pirate and squid group in the area.
Lastly, we know that you are no longer a noob corp. We are sorry that we treated you in that regard for so long. Yet, we must continue the work of bringing new players into the fold. We must teach them how to participate in any fleet at their individual SP levels, as they progress towards mainline doctrines. We also seek to assist every corp in attaining the fiscal means to fully SRP all support ships, so that all our newer members can build their earnings towards mainline doctrines.
We know this will not be an easy thing as a lot of hard feelings have built up over the years. It will be hard for both sides, but it is vitally important that we open up the dialogue and then fully integrate, or we will only permanently distrust each other. I know that the rest of GalMil doesn't want that, and I would hope that you don't want that either. Together we are strong. The squids are weak, and the local pirates feeding off the content we create are ripe for the picking.

He was the transport minister's new Mr Fix-It, the man sent to revive South Africa's embattled passenger rail authority.
And when he arrived at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa as acting CEO, Collins Letsoalo talked tough and detailed how the agency had bled R13.9-billion because of irregular contracts under former boss Lucky Montana.
Yet since assuming the hot seat at the ailing agency in July, Letsoalo has spent considerable energy securing himself a pay cheque four times his agreed salary.
Just a month after his arrival, Letsoalo demanded the same R5.9-million package Montana had got.
When Prasa's acting head of human resources resisted Letsoalo's demand for the massive increase, the interim CEO accused him of "insubordination" and had him replaced.
Montana was fired after findings by the public protector implicating him in alleged corruption and maladministration related to tenders.
Letsoalo was seconded to Prasa by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters on July 7 last year. In her secondment letter, sent to Letsoalo and Prasa chair Popo Molefe, she makes it clear that the acting CEO's pay package of R1.3-million would not change. He would, however, receive a 12% "acting allowance".
But Letsoalo pushed for a R5.9-million pay package. This translates to an acting allowance of about R390,000 a month. He also demanded a chauffeur-driven car and a company cellphone with unlimited calls.
In pursuit of the increase of almost 350%, Letsoalo pressur ed acting group executive for human capital Bhekani Khumalo in e-mails and phone calls. When Khumalo declined to meet his demands, Letsoalo simply fired him and replaced him with another employee.
Letsoalo is not new to controversy. During his stint as CEO of the Road Traffic Management Corporation, he was accused of lacking law-enforcement skills and dividing staff. A senior executive wrote to stakeholders at the corporation claiming Letsoalo was targeting staff appointed by his predecessor. Letsoalo left the agency in 2013 after claims of receiving death threats for acting against corrupt individuals. He surfaced at the Department of Transport as chief financial officer.
Soon after his secondment to Prasa, Letsoalo and Khumalo clashed over his salary demands in acrimonious e-mail exchanges.
"Your telephone call of around 12h15 yesterday where you asked me to 'give you what Montana was earning and if the board has a problem with it, they will discuss with me ... ' has prompted me to once again confirm that I had indicated to you that I was tirelessly working hard with the chairperson of the HC [human capital] & Remco [remuneration committee] of the board to finalise this matter as there were certain things that needed to be decided upon," Khumalo wrote to Letsoalo on August 4.
Letsoalo replied: "My instructions to you are clear and lawful. You are once more implored to adhere to this lawful instruction. Failure to do so will be viewed in serious light, as it is insubordination. I am also not aware that you report to the board, kindly give me such instruction and from whom this instruction comes.
"I repeat that, if the BOC has an issue, they can raise same with me, yours is to give what the GCEO's benefits are, the salary, the allowances and all other benefits entitled to the post," said Letsoalo.
He further told Khumalo that if he continued to resist the increase, all benefits of other senior managers should be withdrawn.
"Stop all benefits of almost all senior management in Prasa as I am sure there are allegations of irregularities on how they got those packages and whether they are entitled to them, let alone being employed."
Letsoalo also approached the general manager responsible for employee benefits, Bongani Nkomo, demanding to know what Montana had earned. He told Nkomo to give him all the details regarding the former CEO's package as it was now an urgent matter.
"I also enquired about the car and driver, which I am informed by security colleagues is for the use of the GCEO. How is it accounted for in the package?" Letsoalo asked.

Letsoalo subsequently wrote to Khumalo, terminating his appointment in August.
Khumalo's replacement as human resources head, Pearl Munthali, then drafted a letter to the Transport Department's acting director-general, Mathabatha Mokonyama, claiming that the department and Prasa board had agreed to pay Letsoalo what Montana was earning.
But in a letter to Letsoalo written in July, Peters had made it clear that his salary would not change because of his new role, writing: "Please note that your rank, salary and seniority date remains unchanged. Your service benefits will also remain unchanged. The salary paid by the department will be claimed from Prasa."
The transport minister's spokesman, Ishmail Mnisi, referred further queries to Mokonyama.
Mokonyama reiterated that Letsoalo was seconded to the agency, had not been promoted and was still considered a full-time employee of the department.
He said it was up to the Prasa board to decide on what remuneration he deserved.
"Mr Letsoalo's rank, salary and seniority including service benefits remains unchanged. Circumstantially, the issue of salary increment does not arise. Although Mr Letsoalo remains an employee of the Department of Transport for the period of his secondment, his all-inclusive human resources costs are claimed from Prasa."
Prasa spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said Letsoalo's increment was approved by the board, but could not say when. "Mr Letsoalo's appointment and remuneration got all the approval necessary from the board, as highlighted in the letter signed by the Chairman of the Board. Mr Letsoalo is entitled to the same perks applicable as per his appointment letter."
But a board member who sits on the remuneration committee denied that it had approved the adjustment : "Go to the officials and ask them to show you the resolution if they claim there is one. It does not exist."
The DA's transport spokesman, Manny de Freitas, said it was outrageous that Letsoalo had demanded to earn millions while he was failing to turn around theagency. He would raise the matter when the Prasa board and Letsoalo appear before the parliamentary transport portfolio committee on March 7.
"This is another example of how a deployed cadre takes advantage of the situation, milks the system. On top of it, we've not seen major changes at Prasa, we've not seen anything. It's another example of how the ANC does not get the right people to do the job, it's very sad."
Lawson Naidoo, of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, said this was a matter for the Prasa board to deal with. "This should have been approved by the board and not by someone who reports to him [Letsoalo]. He should be held to account by the board and if they fail to do that the minister has every right to intervene. The legislation is set and he acted outside of his powers."

Quite the tumult over my Sony MDR-Z1R review. The forums churned. I reckon a little re-cap is in order:
On June 5th, I Published a review of the Z1R and found it to have incredible build quality, styling, and comfort. I also found it intolerably uneven and stated I'd prefer to listen to the ATH-M50X. This is a statement of preference not absolute performance and price is factored into this comparison. I was heartily rebuffed and, in some cases, reviled and insulted as a result starting about here in the Head-Fi thread. On June 10th, Jude published measurements contradicting the InnerFidelity measurements showing a significant peak at around 10kHz. Evidencing listening experiences, and frequency response and distortion measurements, Jude concluded:
Based on what we've heard here (and also on hearing other MDR-Z1R's)--and based on many reviews/impressions that predated the publishing of Tyll's measurements--we'll also assume for the moment that our impressions and measurements are more representative of the MDR-Z1R's that are out in the wild. This poured fuel on the firestorm of posts in the Head-Fi thread, and spurred a critical SuperBestAudioFriends.org thread. I found the counter-viewpoints of the two threads interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. On June 16th, I published my response to his findings, in which I show numerous other enthusiast measurements showing a similar 10kHz elevated feature. More gasoline.
While the ensuing mayhem was fun, I walked away concerned: There is a pervasive idea among, what I'll call, the hard-core subjectivists that any peculiar "sound signature" is not flawed if you like it. I have no problem with people liking what they like, but I do have a problem with abandoning a reasonable middle ground from which to evaluate headphones. As I said at SBAF:
Other Enthusiast: The thing is, if we are evaluating the merits of audio gear, as compared to each other, different signatures are fundamental. Tyll:Every time you say "different sound signatures" I hear "the astonishingly wide array of ways things can go wrong." Other Enthusiast: Headphones that exist outside of standard models are not necessarily wrong, but admitedly are also probably not going to be well received by the majority of people. Tyll: "Not well received by the majority of people" sounds like a pretty good definition of "wrong" considering the subjective nature of audio evaluation. It's my job to get it right for "the majority of people." I can't possibly be right for everyone, so I try to give good advice for most. *snip* I can tell you in the world of speakers that Sean Olive often sums up the tens of millions of dollars he's spent on researching subjective opinion by saying, "With measurements we can tell with 87% accuracy how people will feel about the sound of a pair of speakers." These aren't just your average Joe listener either, it's a well rounded sampling of all demographic groups. He's even said there's not much difference when you compare things group to group. With trained listeners, he says his prediction accuracy is much higher. Now I think Sean tends significantly more to the objective side than I, and I sometimes cringe when he says some things, but he's done the no shit-research to prove the things he says. And what he says is that listeners will basically prefer speakers (in a properly treated room) that: measure flat in an anechoic chamber; are even in their response (no big bumps and wiggles in frequency response); and have well controlled dispersion. For example, I don't like his headphone target curve in some ways (overemphasizes 600-2.5kHz and 4-8kHz by a few dB) but I do understand why it's drawn the way it is. I'll also note that that target curve is just a preliminary curve they developed to put in the mix of curves to test. That I'm aware of, he hasn't done testing to finesse it. At any rate, I've got no problem with folks wearing rose colored granny glasses, or high tech, multi-layered, micro-coated, prescription motorcycling glasses (I have some and love them), strokes for folks. The problem arises when the hippy chick in the sun dress looks at you dead serious over her little spectacles and says, "You really need to do some ear candleing now while the moon is in Virgo."
There is a Neutral
Sean's experiments correlating objective measurements and subjective listening satisfaction work for a simple reason: well designed speakers that measure well and do a good job of reproducing audio are what people generally like. As speakers or headphones become neutral and transparent you can better hear the music in its most natural way. The original artist/producer/engineer are driving after something...it often sounds "right." Anytime you add, subtract, or otherwise deviate too far from neutral you run the risk of producing coloration that taints the original musical expression.
I like the word neutral because it doesn't say it's good. But it does say something. Neutral means: Most like real listening. Now we could write a book defining that, but let's just agree it means the reproduced version sounds quite like the cello sounds in front of you. High-fidelity = highly truthful to the original thing. I would generally claim that this is the basis of high-end, reference quality audio equipment, and that some/many aspects of this is measurable.
Let me stipulate, at this point, that there is a good few dB margin for deviation from "perfectly neutral" within which a manufacturer can create an aurally pleasurable experience. Things like second harmonic distortion in singe ended tube amps and simple device circuits a-la Nelson Pass. These things are basically unmeasurable in their gestalt producing effect, as I know it. I'll add that I'm not sure we're able to, or know what to, measure relative to that far more complex interior experience of music listening. So, I reckon there's a good margin for slopping around technical measures and still remain pleasurable.
However!
There are measurable performance errors that clearly indicate deviations from the norm that are known to disturb the listening experience for most. These would include: rough, uneven frequency response; significant increases in bass distortion as level increases; significantly noisy impulse response blurring leading edge transients; and inordinate level deviations from known standards (free-field; diffuse field; Harman taget curves).
Now, I have no problem with people liking what they like. I like anchovies on pizza...but I rarely order it if I'm sharing with others. I get it, salty fish on pizza is weird. Similarly, I don't have a problem with people enjoying a "V" shaped response and will even recommend then if tastefully done. (Shure SRH1540) What I do have a problem with is a headphone response that is so far away from neutral that I have no way of enjoying them or figure out how to recommend them to someone with out-of-the-ordinary tastes. If I try to please everyone, I'll please no one as a result.
As a reviewer I feel I have to speak to the norm. It's important that people know where I'm coming from so that I can be used as a benchmark of sorts. People know I tend to like things a tad on the warm side and I try to remain consistant so folks can interpret what I'm saying and put it into their own context. (I'll note here as we evolve toward something like a Harman Target Curve with a bit extra bass and a slight warm tilt I find myself fitting in quite nicely to that norm.) Also, I try not to over-evaluate a headphone to noodle out small, subtle details because I know that people may hear those small things differently than I have given variations in taste and physiology. I try to keep it simple, relevant, and, most importantly, straight down the middle.
When I find myself listening to something like the Sony MDR-Z1R with significant deviations from neutral in excessive upper-bass/low-mid emphasis and lack of tight time domain control with large resonances at 3kHz and 10kHz, I'm going to call it flawed regardless of whether or not it was Sony's intention to tune the headphone in that way. It's simply not going to please most listeners in the long run.
So, I promise:
I'll keep reviewing headphones the same way I always have. The bar may move sometimes as headphones get better, but my tastes and evaluative criteria will remain consistant.
I'll keep measuring headphones the same way so that InnerFidelity's database of measurements will remain self-referentially consistant.
The more expensive a headphone is, the more critical I will be. The same modest departure from neutral may be acceptable on a $200 headphones but unacceptable on a $2000 headphone.
Thanks for following along. I'll keep working at it.

If animal proteins are bad because they boost our blood levels of the cancer promoter IGF-1, what about the few plant proteins that just coincidently happen to have amino acid ratios similar to animal proteins—like soy?
One of soy's selling points is that it has “high quality” protein. But now, we know that from a cancer perspective, higher quality may mean a higher quantity of cancer risk, thanks to IGF-1.
Let's go back to this study. Those who ate a lot of animal protein had significantly higher levels of IGF-1. And those who ate a lot of non-soy plant protein had significantly lower levels, presumably because it substituted for some of the animal protein in their diets. The same thing might have happened a little with soy—hey, at least you're not eating animal protein, but this was not a significant decrease.
Meaning if all we do is just swap out animal protein and swap in soy protein, we may not see that beautiful drop in IGF-1 enjoyed by those replacing animal protein instead with a variety of different plant proteins.
Indeed, the more soy milk, for example, that vegan women drank, the higher their IGF levels tended to be. But the trend was only of borderline statistical significance—meaning it could have just been due to chance. To test this once and for all would require the combined might of both the Ornish and Pritikin research teams—a study we'll cover tomorrow.

George Mitchell's legacy: a shale revolution, a 'revolutionary' city and a revitalized Galveston Mitchell was passionate about restoring Galveston, supporting Texas A&M
George Mitchell's interests and successes were varied. He wanted to be an astrophysicist before deciding it didn't pay enough. George Mitchell's interests and successes were varied.

In the early 1980s, Texas oil giant George Mitchell read an academic article arguing that economically extracting natural gas from shale rock just might be possible. But the revolution didn't arrive quickly.
"It took a decade and a half of conviction, investment and dogged determination," energy historian Daniel Yergin wrote in 2013. "But before Mitchell was done, he launched what has proved to be the most important innovation in energy so far this century."
Mitchell is often called the "father of fracking," but fracking had actually been common for decades before Mitchell's innovation paid off in 1997. Energy industry veteran Stephen A. Holditch says it's more accurate to say that Mitchell succeeded in "combining long horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing," which made shale gas economically viable and laid the groundwork for later growth in the domestic natural gas industry. The same techniques would also be used for oil.
"He's the father of the shale revolution," said Holditch, a retired Texas A&M petroleum engineering professor who consulted for Mitchell's company and knew him personally.
A real estate developer as well, Mitchell is best-known in the Houston area for creating The Woodlands as a forested enclave in sync with nature. The performing arts center there bears the name of his wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell.
After selling his oil and gas company in 2002 for $3.5 billion, Mitchell focused on philanthropic efforts. He became the largest donor to his alma mater, Texas A&M, according to state Sen. Tommy Williams. He gave more than $30 million to help build the Magellan telescope in Chile.
Holditch said Mitchell's gifts to support the study of space grew out of his long-term interest; he had wanted to become an astrophysicist, but he didn't think he could make a living in the field after graduating first in Texas A&M's class of 1940.
Mitchell's funding and vision also boosted his hometown of Galveston. Starting in the 1970s, he rehabilitated historic buildings on the Strand. He would buy dilapidated properties, restore them and resell them with covenants ensuring their preservation.
While Mitchell's long and colorful career made him a billionaire, friends and colleagues said he always stayed grounded. The billionaire was often seen casually strolling through the downtown tunnels at lunchtime, and known to meet friends at a Galveston grocery store for coffee and conversation in the deli.
"His story was quintessentially American," his family said in a statement after he died at age 94 on July 26, 2013. He left behind 10 children, 23 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
His parents came to Galveston from Greece, where his father had herded goats. Mitchell's Greek legacy included the middle name his parents gave him: Phydias.
In the New World, his father opened small cleaning and shoeshine businesses but also was a lifelong gambler.
His mother, who encouraged him to focus on education as the best way to improve his conditions, died when Mitchell was 13.
The idea for The Woodlands came after Mitchell saw the destruction of Los Angeles' Watts neighborhood following race-fueled riots in 1965, said his granddaughter, Katherine Lorenz.
"He knew he could do better. So he went to work creating a sustainable community," Lorenz told the Chronicle in 2014.
The township had its grand opening less than a decade after the riots, in 1974.
The settlement was part of a federally funded urban-planning initiative that supported about a dozen "new towns" around the country. The concept arose in England in the 1940s and hopped the pond in the 1960s.
The idea was a bit of a stretch, said Kyle Shelton, a program manager at Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research. "It was an attempt to create a different kind of city, and one that is tied to a longer history of utopian ideals: If only we could design the right type of community … then everything would work perfectly."
By 1976, The Woodlands was the only such community not entering or approaching bankruptcy, East Carolina University historian Roger Briles wrote in 1998 in the academic journal Planning Perspectives. "Only The Woodlands had established economic viability."
"The biggest difference" among the towns, Shelton said, "is that The Woodlands had George Mitchell."
The township's main backer contributed land, capital and vision.
The commitment to integrate nature - the master plan left a third of the acreage as green space - was "revolutionary" at the time, Shelton said.
Mitchell brought in landscape architect Ian McHarg, who emphasized the need to preserve the natural watershed. That meant nearly half of the township's land would be protected from development.
Today, the area boasts 130 forested parks and 200 miles of trails. Mitchell's verdant vision has also been tested as the community grew from 30,000 residents in 1990 to 103,000 in 2014, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. And since The Woodlands Corp. was purchased in 1997 by new owners, clear-cutting was carried out in the area for the first time.
His original ideal of homes that would be affordable for a range of incomes also faces challenges today. Median house prices doubled in just a decade, from $195,880 to $412,482.
Mitchell's hometown of Galveston also benefited from his efforts and investment. "The Strand had other investors, but Mr. Mitchell was the most significant one, and he certainly brought the most vision," said Dwayne Jones, executive director of the Galveston Historical Foundation. "His presence, his efforts, his investment and his vision really began to transform the island into a higher-quality, greater-visibility tourist entity."
As with his business efforts, Mitchell was involved in the details. Former Galveston Mayor Jan Coggeshall told the Chronicle in 2013, "On Saturday morning he would be checking out things like the light switches."
He also gave 135 acres on Pelican Island to establish Texas A&M University at Galveston.
Mitchell's commitment to Galveston's revitalization helped the city recover from Hurricane Ike. After the 2008 storm, he spent $24 million to renovate three of his hotels on the island.
Just a year or two before Mitchell died, Jones said, he bought buildings on Hendley Row at the end of the Strand.
"He took a declining, slow area of the Strand and he has made it into a really top-notch property," Jones said. "And it's a really beautiful building."
Mitchell Historic Properties will finish that rehabilitation in the next few weeks, meaning that George Mitchell's legacy keeps growing years after his death.
Five Pillars of Islam ‎ > ‎ Fasting Fasting From WikiAhmadiyya, the free encyclopedia on Islam and Ahmadiyyat Practices
Kalima Shahadah : Declaration of Faith Salat: Prayer Zakat: Tax for good Quranic causes Sawm: Fasting Hajj: Pilgrimage
Fasting is abstinence from food and drink during daytime for the sake of God. The practice is most common for Muslims during the 'Sawm' fasts of the holy month of Ramadan . Muslims are also expected to increase their prayer, give generously to charity and inculcate the highest moral standards during the month.
Children, pregnant women, those suffering illness and those on journeys are exempt from fasting in Islam.
Health affects
Studies have found that any adverse affects of fasting are largely limited to those who are forbidden from fasting in Islam anyway - pregnant women, new mothers, children and those with preexisting medical conditions.
There are potential benefits to fasting. Regular fasting helps reduce the risk of addiction and instills discipline. Scientists have discovered how occasional periods of reduced calorie intake can reduce the risk of certain illnesses and extend life expectancy:
Dietary restriction (DR; either caloric restriction or intermittent fasting, with maintained vitamin and mineral intake) can extend lifespan and can increase disease resistance. Recent studies have shown that DR can have profound effects on brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease. DR can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and stroke. Moreover, DR...may increase the ability of the brain to resist aging and restore function following injury. Interestingly, increasing the time interval between meals can have beneficial effects on the brain and overall health of mice. - Professor Mark P. Mattson, Journal of Neurochemistry in January 2003
Reducing your calorie intake could help your brain, but doing so by cutting your intake of food is not likely to be the best method of triggering this protection. It is likely to be better to go on intermittent bouts of fasting, in which you eat hardly anything at all, and then have periods when you eat as much as you want. - Professor Mark P. Mattson, 2012

United Nations (CNN) -- North Korea on Tuesday rejected international findings that it sank a South Korean ship, warning at the United Nations the dispute could lead to war.
"A war may break out any time," Ambassador Sin Son Ho said, accusing South Korea of "fabricating" the results of the investigation into the sinking of the Cheonan.
The loss of the ship and 46 sailors in March raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
North and South Korea presented their cases to the United Nations on Monday, and South Korea then urged the Security Council to take "timely and appropriate measures."
North Korea's envoy responded harshly Tuesday.
"If the Security Council releases any documents against us, condemning or pressuring us ... then myself as diplomat, I can do nothing. ... The follow-up measures will be carried out by our military forces," he said.
Why are the two Koreas so hostile?
U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said Monday that the U.N. body is "gravely concerned" about the latest tensions.
Heller said the council is concerned over the potential "impact on peace and stability on the Korean peninsula" as a result of the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan in disputed waters.
"We presented and explained to [the council] the evidence that the Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo, which was made in North Korea, and launching was also done by a North Korean ... submarine," said Yoon Duk-yong, a science and physics professor serving as a civilian expert on the South Korean panel.
Yoon said the findings were based on evidence recovered after the sinking, including an intact piece of the torpedo with propellers, steering plates and a motor.
"We hope that on the basis of these findings," he said, "the Security Council will take timely and appropriate measures against the provocation of North Korea against the naval ship of the Republic of Korea."
But North Korea's ambassador disputed the international findings, comparing them to "some kind of fiction in Aesop's Fables."
"The 'investigation result' is a complete fabrication from A to Z," he said.
The council is calling on both sides "to refrain from any act that could escalate tensions in the region," Heller said.
The two-hour meeting was held behind closed doors Monday afternoon and was also attended by U.S., Australian, British, Swedish and Canadian scientific experts who had participated in the investigation.
The Japanese ambassador to the United Nations made brief remarks following the two nations' presentations, saying "there is no other explanation" than that the South Korean ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo.
"I think the council should react in a decisive manner, but at the same time try to avoid any act which may provoke" a retaliatory attack, Ambassador Yukio Takasu said.
North Korea repeatedly has denied any responsibility in the sinking.
Heller said a decision has not yet been made on how to respond to the incident.
"The Security Council will continue its consultations," he said.
Several hundred community members came together at Berkeley High School on Saturday evening to remember 17-year-old Efejon Ustenci, who drowned Wednesday in Placer County less than a week after he graduated from BHS.
The theme of the vigil, said photographer Ted Friedman, who attended the event on behalf of Berkeleyside, “was to ‘live Efe's legacy.'”
One friend told Friedman that Efejon, known to many as Efe, would be remembered as someone who was nurturing, humorous and fair-minded. Others have described him as a natural leader looked up to by many, a talented athlete, and a kind and loving young man.
A fundraiser to help collect money for burial costs has raised more than $16,000 since it was created Friday evening.
Wrote Chris Young on the memorial page, “In my work with BIHS [Berkeley International High School] I see students names a lot and meet most of them as seniors. After visiting me once, I noted that Efe carried himself with maturity and kindness. At graduation he thanked me, though I hadn't done much to directly serve him. Efejon Ustenci! His name jumps off my list of graduates. Yes, Efejon Ustenci. That's that humble young man who stands out as a beautiful example of strong character for his peers and teachers. Surely, he will inspire us into the future.”
Several photographs from the memorial appear below.

Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich launched his campaign for governor by lashing out at the man who he says is a symbol of the “rampant corruption” in the state Capitol -- wealthy financier Rex Sinquefield.
Schweich said that Sinquefield, the state's top political donor, has been engaging in “corrosive tactics'' with “an army of mercenaries.'' Their aim, he said, is to advance proposals – such as the elimination of Missouri's income tax and replacing it with a huge sales tax -- that he says would help the wealthy but hurt small business and middle-class Missourians.
Sinquefield now is actively seeking to “buy a governor,'' the auditor said.
“No one wants this machine to take over the state,” Schweich said. He said that Sinquefield has employed 1,000 people and set up over 100 political committees to advance his agenda.
“If they run our state, we won't have a debate over whether it's Missour-AH or Missour-EE,'' he said. “It will be Missour-REX.”
Challenges ethics of Hanaway and Koster
Schweich laid out his accusations, and his campaign promises, in a half-hour speech to supporters in a ballroom of the student center at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
Schweich said that his GOP rival – former state House Speaker Catherine Hanaway – is “bought and paid for'' because she has collected at least $1 million from Sinquefield and groups that he bankrolls. That amounts to about 70 percent of the money she has raised.
The auditor then said that some Republicans suspect that Hanaway may be Sinquefield's bogus candidate “propped up” to aid in the election of the only announced Democrat for governor, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster.
Although Koster hasn't received any recent donations from Sinquefield, Schweich said Koster had received close to $500,000 from the financier and his campaign committees in earlier statewide campaigns.
Schweich cited Sinquefield's pro-Koster comments. “The Sinquefield people may be chess players, but they're not very good at poker because I think they've tipped their hand,” the auditor said.
The upshot of his attacks was that voters will see little difference between Hanaway or Koster, who Schweich said “is clearly for sale.”
Schweich cited the New York Times story last fall that accused Koster of giving preferential treatment to companies and lobbyists that were campaign donors.
“The issue of ethics and accountability…may be the key issue in the campaign,” Schweich said.
“You have my word that as governor, I will clean up Jefferson City with a level of intensity, tenacity, transparency and rigor that this state has never seen before,” he said.
Rivals challenge Schweich's own fundraising
A spokesman for Sinquefield declined comment. But some of Schweich's critics said that the auditor's fundraising also relied on prominent donors, just not Sinquefield.
For example, Records show that Schweich has collected close to $600,000 since 2009 from wealthy businessman Sam Fox and his relatives and another $326,000 from major GOP donor David Humphreys.
Schweich said the key issue isn't generous donors but how much a candidate relies on them. He announced a voluntary plan in which he will accept no more than 25 percent of his annual campaign contributions from a single donor.
He called on his rivals to adopt a similar restriction, but said he would comply with his plan regardless of their actions.
A spokesman for Hanaway ignored the jabs about Sinquefield and instead accused Schweich of being divisive and intent on delivering the governor's mansion to yet another Democrat.
“Conservative activists throughout Missouri believe primaries have repeatedly cost the Republican Party statewide elections,” said Hanaway's spokesman Nick Maddux. He noted that Schweich had just been sworn in to another term as auditor.
“Schweich's electoral record is marked by relentless pursuits of the next office and tearing apart the Republican Party,” Maddux said, asserting that Hanaway's record in contrast had been to aid other Republicans.
State Democratic party chairman Roy Temple did bring up Sinquefield.
“It appears that Rex Sinquefield's slate for Republican nominations in 2016 will receive some challenge,” Temple said. “However, most Republicans in Jefferson City continue to remain silent instead of fighting back against Rex, Inc's friendly takeover of their party. Democrats have a strong, consensus candidate in Attorney General Chris Koster, who will fight for working families as governor.”
Schweich's objectives as governor
Schweich is a lawyer who was first elected auditor in 2010. His political mentor has been retired Sen. John C. Danforth, who plans to join him on the campaign trail, he said.
If he's elected, Schweich said, he'll seek to form the Missouri Accountability Commission to advance proper conduct in government and to investigate improper actions.
“I've been in Jefferson City for four years and I don't like what I see,” he said.
But Schweich also detailed other objectives:
Earlier this week, Manchester City announced the signing of Ederson from Benfica.
The Brazilian goalkeeper will officially join when the transfer window opens on July 1 - but he was unveiled on Tuesday at the CFA.
"Manchester City is a club that has grown a lot under Guardiola," he said. "They are investing in youth.
"So these were the factors that helped me take the decision to join this club."
Ederson can't wait for adventure to start
Ederson: Signing gallery
Ederson will become the Blues' fourth Brazilian alongside Fernandinho, Fernando and Gabriel Jesus and is one of the brightest young goalkeeper prospects in world football.
Born Ederson Santana de Moraes, he began his career as a youth with São Paulo FC, spending two years before joining second tier Portuguese outfit Ribeirão in 2011.

LANCASTER, Pa. (RNS) For more than a year, Prudhomme's Lost Cajun Kitchen in Lancaster County, Pa., has offered a Sunday special: Diners who bring in a current church bulletin receive 10 percent off the purchase of their dinners.
But the promotion rubs some people the wrong way, including John Wolff an atheist and member of the Freedom From Religion Foundation.
Wolff, a Lancaster resident who said he's never been to Prudhomme's, recently filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission claiming the 22-year-old restaurant should not give discounts based on religion. "I bear them no ill will," he said, "but they shouldn't be pushing religion."
Shannon Powers, spokeswoman for the Human Relations Commission, confirmed the complaint had been filed. Prudhomme's has 30 days to submit a written answer to the complaint.
The restaurant's co-owner Sharon Prudhomme said she's not about ready to pull the plug on the deal, which was designed to drum up business.
She said many in the community, including pastors and ministers, are regular customers at Prudhomme's, known for its Louisiana cuisine such as catfish po' boys, alligator platters and crawfish.
"I thought, 'How can I boost our Sunday sales for dinner?' And, I thought, 'Well you know what? We have a lot of folks who go to church who come in throughout the week,'" Prudhomme said.
Over the past couple of months, Prudhomme said, she received two letters and a phone call from the Freedom from Religion Foundation demanding the restaurant end the promotion.
The Madison, Wis.-based group primarily works on issues concerning separation of church and state. It filed suit over the Pennsylvania legislature's naming 2012 the Year of the Bible.
"I just kind of blew it off. Gosh, I have more things to concentrate on," Prudhomme said of the letters.
Prudhomme, who does not attend church due to her work schedule, said she told the group she operates an independent restaurant and suggested nonchurchgoers can pick up bulletins from any church and bring them to the restaurant to cash in on the discount.
"We're the most unprejudiced of all. I don't care if you are purple or polka dot. The only requirement we have is men must wear sleeves," she said.
Prudhomme said she questions how the promotion differs from senior citizen discounts or free meals for kids under 12 years of age.
"A senior discount isn't so bad. We'll all get there eventually. But we won't all become churchgoers," said Wolff, who is 80.
He said he came across Prudhomme's bulletin promotion while doing an Internet search of the restaurant, which he had heard good things about. But, he said the restaurant's discount for churchgoers annoyed him. "My interest is in social justice and tolerance, and I get a little annoyed at all the religiosity," he said.
Wolff said he was born a German Jew and was a devout Catholic from age 10 to 16. He said he became an atheist about 15 years ago when he became dismayed at the religious right.
He said the complaint against Prudhomme's isn't as much about the actual discount as it is the bigger picture of what is happening in this country. "I'd just be happy to bring this out in the open and get people to reflect a little bit," Wolff said.
THE next Socceroos coach, whether it's next month or after next year's World Cup, should be an Australian.
Certainly that's the way I would be going.
If this year's brilliant A-League competition proved anything, it's that our home-grown coaches are the future of the code and we must fight to keep them.
Graham Arnold, Ange Postecoglou and Tony Popovic have served apprenticeships and are crucial to where we go as a football nation.
And we don't want our best and brightest minds developing the game at Asian clubs because there is so much work to be done here first.
Whether the Socceroos qualify for Brazil or not, the alarm bells are ringing at national level.
Whoever gets the job after Holger Osieck has a massive job to do. He has to overhaul our entire system, from youth teams right up to the senior outfit. It has to be someone who knows how to build a club from the ground up.
If you look at Guus Hiddink, Pim Verbeek and now Osieck, you have to ask what legacy have they left for Australian football. They were employed to coach a football team - Australia- not build a sustainable future for our code. Unlike Arnie, Ange, Poppa and Frank Farina, they don't have a vested interest in Australia's long-term success.
Hiddink took charge before the Uruguay game in 2005 and got us to the World Cup, but he was only here for a relatively short space of time.
Verbeek and Osieck have done nothing for the future. They have taken the same players from 2006 in a bid to qualify for World Cups knowing they can then say job done and goodbye.
The Socceroos have been hurtling towards the football cliff for some time and it's scary to think what might happen after the World Cup, if we make it.
It's a problem compounded by the fact we have the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia and some of our older players are saying they would like to use that tournament as a swansong.
Because we have neglected development for instant gratification for so long, there is now a desperate need to bring through a new generation of players. But where are they?
We need our best coaches here to find them and develop them, because the process starts at junior level and runs through to the A-League.
If players leave, that's natural. If there are no coaches, who develops the next wave? That's the vicious cycle Aussie football finds itself in at present.
I would love to see someone stay and build a dynasty here like Alex Ferguson has done at Manchester United. Old Trafford has become a production line of talent, with Fergie setting a culture and philosophy that carries through generations.
Imagine if Arnold did that at the Mariners or Popovic did that at the Wanderers.
It would mean our young players coming through get taught to play football the right way - get brought into a team ethos - and when they leave for the bigger leagues, the new generation is developed in the same way. That's what builds consistency and strong grass roots.
That's also where we have fallen down since 2006.
Financial pressures will make keeping coaches in Australia more difficult, but that has to be our goal. Arnie and I were at the forefront of a revolution here, opening the door for other Aussies to head to leagues in Europe. The signs are there now that Aussie coaches are starting to attract interest from overseas.
To counter that, there needs to be an incentive for them to stay and a pathway to the Socceroos job. Once the national team falls off the football cliff, we need strong men with a love for Australian football to rebuild it.

Major Nevada casinos lose $1.2 billion in 2012
CARSON CITY — For the fourth consecutive year, Nevada's major casinos posted a net loss — $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012 — but business is looking up, state gaming officials said. The state Gaming Control Board issued its annual “Gaming Abstract” today showing the 2012 loss down from $3.9 billion in fiscal 2011. The loss was $3.4 billion in 2010 and $6.7 billion in 2009.
“It's getting better,” said Michael Lawton, senior research analyst for the board.
Total revenue collected by the 265 Nevada casinos that grossed $1 million or more reached $22.9 billion, up from $22 billion in 2011. A total of 44 percent of revenue came from gaming, down from 46 percent in 2011, Lawton said.
Lawton noted that many states have casinos, and many people come to Nevada for other attractions. “The customer's wallet has been divided in different ways and spread in other ways,” he said.
Revenue from rooms was up 8.7 percent; food increased 6.3 percent; and beverages grew 8.7 percent. The average daily room rate on the Las Vegas Strip was $131, compared to $128 in 2011, with an occupancy rate of 90.4 percent.
On the Las Vegas Strip, The net loss in 2012 for casinos on the Las Vegas Strip was $1.7 billion, down from $2.2 billion in fiscal 2011. It was the fourth year of losses.
Downtown Las Vegas casinos had a net loss of $46.1 million, down from a $56.1 million loss he is previous year.

If you're reading this and thinking, “Who the hell is Tom Hiddleston?” you need to seriously reconsider your ability to internet. If you don't know that the man who played Loki and F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth all of your love and admiration, I'm surprised you can even tie your shoes. Tom is just a magic, magic man who is — aside from being beautiful in that dapper, perfect British way — an utter gentleman and spends most of his time being humble around his fans, smiling respectfully for the cameras, and (I would imagine) helping old ladies cross the street. It is for these and many other reasons that he is the Husband Material we should all be sending flowers to across the pond.
Name: Tom Hiddleston
Age: 31
Occupation: Thespian, Big-budget film star who will never lose an ounce of artistic credibility, owner of a bone structure that would make supermodels weep, reader of audiobooks that makes you weep at the beauty of his velvety accent.
Description: Having studied at/performed at more-or-less all of the most prestigious British institutions (Oxford, Cambridge, The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), TomTom set himself up to represent all that was good about being a modern-day theater dandy. He wears adorable smoking jackets, is the epitome of cultured politesse, and always makes sure to say please and thank you. And after his years of good breeding and working on becoming The Sexual Icon of British Charm (ripping the title mercilessly from Hugh Grant's cold, gnarled fingers), he was rewarded by a Hollywood that was ready to have someone with legitimate acting chops play a blockbuster role or two. Every time he speaks, it's as though a golden river of class and dignity is just pouring forth from his mouth, and he brings that much-needed touch of dignity to every project he participates in.
Benefits to Marriage: Have you ever listened to one of those aforementioned audiobooks? Yeah, do it. That mellifluous voice will be doing everything from asking if he needs to pick up anything from the store on the way home, to telling you you look beautiful in your pajamas with your hair all mussed. That could be yours. Also, you can sharpen your kitchen knives on his cheekbones.
Drawbacks: All of Tumblr will be mercilessly out for your blood.
You Must Be: Classy as f-ck, willing to attend events with the most elegant person in the room and not feel inadequate, down for frequent trips to England to visit his undoubtedly beautiful family, probably okay with hanging out with Chris Hemsworth from time to time.
The Dowry Tom Brings: An old farmhouse that is somehow designed in impeccable Victorian architecture, a flock of the most articulate sheep in the village, 7 plush fields ready for tilling, all of the thrilling conversation you can ever have over glasses of brandy.
Like many others I wasn't expecting much from the Western Force in 2014. I know a number of the Force players through involvement with them in Brisbane club rugby, so was still keen to see them do well.
After their first two Super Rugbies matches against the Waratahs and Brumbies, I was convinced they'd struggle to win more than a couple of matches this season. But I don't like writing negative articles, so I ignored them to a certain extent.
On an episode of The Roar Rugby Show I even asked my guests whether they thought Michael Foley would make it to the end of the season as coach.
Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share
The way they played against the Rebels made me sit up and take notice, but I thought the performance was probably a one off and that the Rebels' poor performance had a lot to do with the result.
I expected they'd go down to Dunedin and compete against the Highlanders but not quite get the result. Imagine my surprise when they held on for a gutsy win after two late yellow cards. I was impressed, but still doubtful.
Despite two wins in a row, I couldn't believe the Force could roll the undefeated defending champions last week. Like many Australian rugby fans I sat on my couch last weekend as the match against the Chiefs drew to a conclusion, cheering on the Force in the hope they could finish the job.
It was a great victory, their third in a row – the first time they've achieved that feat since 2007. The beauty of those three matches is that the Force have played really well, rather than limping home against teams playing really poorly.
Today, I'm happy to be writing a positive article about the Force. So what's been the difference over the past three matches compared to the first two of the season?
The first match against the Waratahs was an afternoon match in Sydney and the Tahs were in very good form. The Force started slowly and were always on the back foot, conceding six tries to the two they scored.

I wonder whether the Force's pre-season trial match program left them under-prepared for this first match. They played Samoa A and the Pampas XV from Argentina and romped in both matches, which doesn't sound like the best preparation for the intensity of Super Rugby.
In their second match they took on the Brumbies at home. By half-time they were down 24-0 and with just 10 minutes remaining still trailed 27-0. Two late tries made the score look respectable, and in hindsight that second half performance was when we started seeing some real fight from the Force – they at least stopped the Brumbies from running away with the match.
Has it been a change of tactics, players or attitude since half-time in the match against the Brumbies that has made the difference? Or were those first three halves of rugby in 2014 the aberration?
The only significant change in personnel has been Sias Ebersohn taking over at fly-half at half-time against the Brumbies after Zack Holmes had started the first two matches. I don't think Ebersohn has played that well this season, so I don't think he's the answer.
I haven't seen any real change in tactics or noticed the Force doing anything so well that I can point to an area of their game that has improved dramatically.
There is one factor that has been noticeable, however, and that's the form and leadership of the Force captain Matt Hodgson. At nearly 33 years of age and having just passed 100 matches for the Force, his experience and leadership are vital for the team.
As a leader he often seems to be dragging his teammates forward through sheer willpower. As a player, he's in great form at the moment.
With Hodgson providing the inspiration for his team, the most noticeable difference I've seen from the Force has been their spirit. They obviously believe and they are playing as a cohesive unit, making commentators – including me – think again.

While all the talk before the season started was about Kyle Godwin being on the Wallabies radar, I've not seen much mention of him lately and I don't think his performances so far this season have been anything special.
Is Hodgson forcing his way into Wallabies contention? His age shouldn't count against him, but coach Ewen McKenzie may want to keep focusing on the younger options at open-side flanker who will be a big part of plans for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
The Force currently sit in seventh place on the competition table with 14 points. They're currently third in the Australian conference, just two points behind the Waratahs and three behind the Brumbies but four points clear of the Reds.
How far can they go this season? I have no idea. Despite what I've seen over the last month I'm still not sure what to make of them. However, there is no doubt that they are not the easy beats that many of us believed them to be early in the season.
It's a great turnaround and it's good for Australian rugby. Let's hope they can keep going and that the Rebels start fulfilling their promise, too.

Introducing ASP.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2
Jeffrey
At Build 2017, we released an initial preview version of ASP.NET Core 2.0. Over the last two months we have incorporated your feedback and added a number of new features. We now have a Preview 2 version of the ASP.NET Core 2.0 framework and Visual Studio tools for you to try. In this post, we will review some of the new features in this preview release.
Update Visual Studio and install ASP.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2
If you don't already have the latest Visual Studio 2017 Preview version installed on your Windows system, download the latest from https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/
You can update an existing Visual Studio 2017 Preview installation using the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer application available on your start menu. Choose to update Visual Studio 2017 Preview and the latest Visual Studio 2017 Preview 3 patch (15.3 Preview 3) will be downloaded and applied to your installation. For Mac users, you should install the Visual Studio for Mac and update to the latest preview from the Beta channel.
Next, download the latest .NET Core 2.0 SDK and install it. This will give you an updated version of the .NET Core command-line tools and runtime. You can verify that you have the correct version installed by executing the following at the command-line:
dotnet –-version 1 dotnet – - version
You should see the version “2.0.0-preview2-006497” reported, the current version of the 2.0 Preview 2 SDK.
SPA Templates for Everyone!
When you start the updated Visual Studio 2017 Preview and create a new ASP.NET Core website with .NET Core, you will notice that the ASP.NET template chooser for ASP.NET Core 2.0 shows some extra templates:
The ASP.NET Core SPA templates for Angular and React are now available from Visual Studio. They're also available on the command-line as part of the standard installation of the .NET Core SDK. Of particular note, the Angular template has been updated to Angular 4. For more information about how to get started using the contents of the ASP.NET Core SPA templates, check the article from Steve Sanderson when the templates were initially made available.
ASP.NET Core 2 and .NET Framework
You can now choose to build your ASP.NET Core 2.0 applications with the .NET Framework by choosing the ASP.NET Core with .NET Framework template option in Visual Studio 2017.
Kestrel Improvements
We've added a number of server constraint configuration options to the Kestrel server through the KestrelServerOptions class's new Limits property. You can now add limits for the following:
Maximum Client Connections
Maximum Request Body Size
Maximum Request Body Data Rate
Maximum client connections
The maximum number of concurrent open HTTP/S connections can be set for the entire application with the following code:
.UseKestrel(options => { options.Limits.MaxConcurrentConnections = 100; options.Limits.MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections = 100; 1 2 3 4 . UseKestrel ( options =& gt ; { options . Limits . MaxConcurrentConnections = 100 ; options . Limits . MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections = 100 ;
Note how there are two limits. Once a connection is upgraded from HTTP to another protocol (e.g. on a WebSockets request), it's not counted against the limit anymore since upgraded connections have their own limit.
Maximum request body size
To configure the default constraint for the entire application:
.UseKestrel(options => { options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = 10 * 1024; 1 2 3 . UseKestrel ( options =& gt ; { options . Limits . MaxRequestBodySize = 10 * 1024 ;
This will affect every request, unless it's overridden on a specific request:
app.Run(async context => { context.Features.Get<IHttpMaxRequestBodySizeFeature>().MaxRequestBodySize = 10 * 1024; 1 2 3 app . Run ( async context =& gt ; { context . Features . Get & lt ; IHttpMaxRequestBodySizeFeature & gt ; ( ) . MaxRequestBodySize = 10 * 1024 ;
You can only configure the limit on a request if the application hasn't started reading yet, otherwise an exception is thrown. There's an IsReadOnly property in the feature that tells you if the request body is in read-only state, meaning it's too late to configure the limit.
Minimum request body data rate
To configure a default minimum request rate:
.UseKestrel(options => { options.Limits.RequestBodyMinimumDataRate = new MinimumDataRate(rate: 100, gracePeriod: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); 1 2 3 4 . UseKestrel ( options =& gt ; { options . Limits . RequestBodyMinimumDataRate = new MinimumDataRate ( rate : 100 , gracePeriod : TimeSpan . FromSeconds ( 10 ) ) ;
To configure per-request:
app.Run(async context => { context.Features.Get<IHttpRequestBodyMinimumDataRateFeature>().MinimumDataRate = new MinimumDataRate(rate: 100, gracePeriod: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); 1 2 3 4 app . Run ( async context =& gt ; { context . Features . Get & lt ; IHttpRequestBodyMinimumDataRateFeature & gt ; ( ) . MinimumDataRate = new MinimumDataRate ( rate : 100 , gracePeriod : TimeSpan . FromSeconds ( 10 ) ) ;
The way the rate works is as follows: Kestrel will check every second if data is coming in at the specified rate in bytes/second. If the rate drops below the minimum, the connection is timed out. The grace period is the amount of time that Kestrel will give the client to get it's send rate up to the minimum, so the rate is not checked during that time. This is to avoid dropping connections that are initially sending data at a slow rate due to TCP slow start.
Razor Support for C# 7.1
The Razor engine has been updated to work with the new Roslyn compiler and that includes support for C# 7.1 features like Default Expressions, Inferred Tuple Names, and Pattern-Matching with Generics. To use C #7.1 features in your project add the following property in your project file and then reload the solution:
<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion> 1 & lt ; LangVersion & gt ; latest & lt ; / LangVersion & gt ;
C# 7.1 is itself in a preview state, and you can review the language specification for these features on their GitHub repository.
Enhanced HTTP Header Support for Range, ETags, and LastUpdate
When using MVC to transmit a FileStreamResult or a FileContentResult, you now have the option to set an ETag or a LastModified date on the content you wish to transmit. You can set these values on the returned content with code similar to the following:
var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("This is a sample text from a binary array"); var entityTag = new EntityTagHeaderValue(""MyCalculatedEtagValue""); return File(data, "text/plain", "downloadName.txt", lastModified: DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(-5), entityTag: entityTag); 1 2 3 var data = Encoding . UTF8 . GetBytes ( "This is a sample text from a binary array" ) ; var entityTag = new EntityTagHeaderValue ( "" MyCalculatedEtagValue "" ) ; return File ( data , "text/plain" , "downloadName.txt" , lastModified : DateTime . UtcNow . AddSeconds ( - 5 ) , entityTag : entityTag ) ;
The file returned to your visitors will be decorated with the appropriate HTTP headers for the ETag and Last Modified values.
If an application visitor requests content with a Range Request header, ASP.NET will recognize that and handle that header. If the requested content can be partially delivered, ASP.NET will appropriately skip and return just the requested set of bytes. You do not need to write any special handlers into your methods to adapt or handle this feature, it is handled by the framework for you.
New Page Filters for Razor Pages
Page filters (IPageFilter, IAsyncPageFilter) allow you to run code before and after a page handler is executed, much in the same way that action filters let your run code before and after an action method is executed. Page filters can also influence which page handler gets executed or to run initialization code before model binding occurs. In Preview 2 you can add a page filter globally or using an app model convention. For preview 2 you can't apply filters using attributes, but we expect this support to come later.
Azure App Service Support
The Preview 2 version of ASP.NET Core 2.0 can be deployed to Azure App Service with no changes needed. Azure Data Centers are being rolled out today with completion scheduled for June 30th. You can track progress of the roll out on this Azure App Service Announcements issue.
Postponed features
Some features available in Preview 1 have been pulled out of the ASP.NET Core 2.0 release to give them more time to bake. We still plan to do these features, but for now they have been removed from Preview 2. These features are:
NET Core Identity as a Service, including the support for issue identity and access tokens using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0
Default configuration schema for configuring HTTPS, certificates and authentication (you can still configure logging by default).
Summary
This preview release delivers some of the promised features of the ASP.NET Core 2.0 framework, and we hope that you try them out. You can find a complete set of release notes in the Home repository on GitHub with links to the feature issues and pull-requests that completed those features. What do you think of the update to ASP.NET Core 2.0? Let us know in the comments below.

1. Broncos (6-0; last week No. 1): The Colts likely will have fireworks for the Peyton Manning homecoming — and they'll be aimed right at him.
2. Chiefs (6-0; No. 5): They finally have as many wins as they had Pro Bowlers in 2012.
3. Seahawks (5-1; No. 4): When Percy Harvin returns, a great team could become unstoppable.
4. Patriots (5-1; No. 6): Who would have dreamed that an undrafted rookie from Cincinnati would do so much better in No. 85 than the veteran player from Cincinnati?
5. Saints (5-1; No. 2): Rob Ryan didn't do much better than his twin brother has done in Foxborough.
6. Colts (4-2; No. 3): The bad news? They dropped four passes. The good news? They only dropped three spots.
7. 49ers (4-2; No. 8): When Raiders fans are the best behaved Bay Area fans, that's a problem.
8. Packers (3-2; No. 9): So why did all those teams pass on Eddie Lacy again?
9. Lions (4-2; No. 10): After all those first-round selections squandered on pass-catchers, it's fitting that the Lions landed Joseph Fauria without having to use a draft pick.
10. Bears (4-2; No. 11): Based on the way he played, Brandon Marshall should wear those green shoes every week.
11. Ravens (3-3; No. 7): They may need to fire a coordinator in December again.
12. Dolphins (3-2; No. 12): For a change, the bye week meant something other than a guaranteed respite from losing.
13. Bengals (4-2; No. 14): They continue to play up and down to the level of the competition.
14. Eagles (3-3; No. 20): Three years after Mike Vick supplanted Kevin Kolb while he was injured, Nick Foles could be doing it to Vick.
15. Cowboys (3-3; No. 21): The best way to avoid Tony Romo blowing a game late? Make sure the game isn't in doubt late.
16. Chargers (3-3; No. 19): They're still too inconsistent to contend for a playoff berth, especially with a pair of undefeated teams in the division they used to dominate.
17. Browns (3-3; No. 13): The Factory already has run out of Gladness.
18. Rams (3-3; No. 22): At least one of the team's first-round picks is making a major impact.
19. Titans (3-3; No. 15): If moral victories were real, the Titans would have three of them.
20. Jets (3-3; No. 16): With the Patriots returning to New Jersey, it's Buttfumble Week at MetLife Stadium.
21. Cardinals (3-3; No. 17): Bruce Arians didn't necessarily “see the dominance” of the 49ers, but he saw enough to beat his team.
22. Raiders (2-4; No. 18): Now that the Raiders have found their quarterback, they'd better do a better job of protecting him.
23. Panthers (2-3; No. 25): The Panthers don't win often, but when they win, they win big.
24. Bills (2-4; No. 24): There are bad quarterback situations, and then there are quarterback situations so bad that Matt Flynn gets a spot on the depth chart.
25. Texans (2-4; No. 23): And now we know why Gary Kubiak didn't bench Matt Schaub for T.J. Yates.
26. Falcons (1-4; No. 27): Some thought the Week Seven game between Atlanta and Tampa would be a battle for first place in the division. Instead, it'll be a battle for last place.
27. Redskins (1-4; No. 28): The controversy regarding the team's name could become a useful distraction for the team's disappointing performances.
28. Vikings (1-4; No. 26): Josh Freeman possibly wants a Mulligan.
29. Steelers (1-4; No. 29): Beat the Ravens on Sunday, and things could get interesting in the AFC North.
30. Buccaneers (0-5; No. 30): How can a team with so many good players be so bad?
31. Giants (0-6; No. 31): How can a team with so many good players be so bad?
32. Jaguars (0-6; No. 32): How can a team with so many bad players lose to the Broncos by only 16?
From the blockchain technology underpinning the controversial cryptocurrency bitcoin to the artificially intelligent machines trying to become the next Warren Buffet, the financial services sector is eagerly trying to harness the innovation powering the “fintech” movement.
The nascent space has triggered immense interest among those educating the world's future financial leaders. Harvard Business School and Stanford's Graduate School of Business are both sizing up the potential of digital currencies and AI to disrupt Wall Street, to name two poignant examples.
Could disruptive technologies reshape the wider financial landscape? Some of the world's top business schools are betting on it.
“The role of technology in banking is changing the landscape and our education much change as well,” says Adair Morse, assistant professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
Haas School is one of many bringing fintech into the MBA classroom. The finance department has broadened its roots in investment banking to consider innovations in crowdfunding, payments and currencies.
Among the hottest topics being explored by schools is blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits, which has the financial services sector rushing to discover its potential.
“Blockchain-enabled technologies are poised to bring huge benefits,” says Owen Jelf, managing director of Accenture's global capital markets practice, which estimates the blockchain could cut $20 billion of costs in the finance industry annually by 2021.
“The potential appears to be enormous,” says Professor David Yermack, chair of the finance department at NYU's Stern School of Business, which is putting together a new series of fintech courses, and which ran modules for MBA and executive students focused on the blockchain.
“The fintech curriculum will have to be taught at every business school, because students and employers will demand it,” David says.
The next frontiers in finance have the world's leading banks, money managers, traders, payments providers and all manner of tech pioneers pouring billions into digital — $200 billion by banks alone in 2015, according to estimates from research firm Celent.
The frenzy has broadened career opportunities for business school graduates at fintech firms, but anyone working in finance will need to be aware of the technology that is reshaping their organizations.
“Traditionally most business school finance courses focus on the tools required to be successful in true banking jobs” such as valuations and M&A, says Marc Hamud, senior vice president at GE Capital, who co-teaches a new fintech class at USC's Marshall School of Business.
But now, USC's course is focusing on tech-enabled business models with the potential to disrupt the status quo — alternative lending and digital wealth management, for instance.
Antoinette Schoar, professor of entrepreneurial finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management, says her fintech students are designing these new ventures, from peer-to-peer lenders to “roboadvisors” using algorithms to beat financial markets.
MIT's high-profile “FinTech Ventures” program gave student teams seven weeks to develop business plans in the fintech space, in areas including consumer finance, payments, trading and cryptocurrencies.
The start-ups are nascent, but many of the world's top fintech firms trace their roots to business schools — Lending Club, which IPO'ed in 2014, to HEC Paris; Betterment, valued at $500 million, to Columbia Business School; and SoFi, which raised $1 billion in 2015, to Stanford.
At Duke's Fuqua School of Business, entrepreneurship is the favoured route among the 76 students taking its blockchain-focused fintech course.
“Blockchain is a really innovative idea that has the potential to change many businesses. My students realize that,” says finance professor Campbell Harvey, whose course has seen a six-fold increase in enrolments.
He gives the example of one student venture using a blockchain to improve the efficiency and safety of acquiring medical prescriptions. “The low-hanging fruit is in finance, but they recognize that this tech can touch many different things,” he says.
Enthusiasm among students has seen fintech clubs flourish. Wharton School's was one of the first. It coordinates study programs with firms such as P2P lender Prosper, mobile banking app Moven, and blockchain web services start-up BlockCypher.
“Students receive credit for helping fintech companies solve their most challenging business problems,” says Matthew Applegate, MBA and VP at Wharton FinTech.
Optimism that tech can improve financial services, for example by making transactions faster and more secure, or how it can disintermediate existing players, is stirring interest.
“Think of somebody working for a bank — the big worry for you is that you have a bunch of legacy IT systems, and there are five people in a loft somewhere who are picking away at one of your core profitability measures,” says Raghu Rau, professor of finance at Cambridge Judge Business School, which will launch a series of fintech courses for MBA, master and executive students.
“We're seeing a lot of interest from mainstream financial institutions and from students who want to work at fintech companies,” he says.
Banks and other fintech leaders are partnering business schools to form research, events, and educational programs. Warwick Business School this month teamed up with MasterCard to explore innovations in payments. IE Business School works with Spanish bank Santander to help fintech ventures access venture capital.
“MBA programs are a model developed in the 40's and 50's for a different purpose,” says Andrei Kirilenko, director of the Centre for Global Finance and Technology at Imperial College, which worked with Citigroup and is developing fintech modules.
But now, he says, schools are re-tooling themselves to satisfy a need for new finance content: “The landscape is evolving.”
Image caption Damian Green says a £100,000 inheritance is "reasonable"
Damian Green has said the Conservatives will not "look again" at plans to fund social care in England, despite fears they will be unpopular with voters.
The Tory manifesto says elderly people needing care at home would have to meet the costs but could keep £100,000 after the bill is deducted from their estate.
The work and pensions secretary told the BBC it would still be "a reasonable inheritance" to pass on to dependants.
Labour said the plan would leave people "on their own" and should be pulled.
The policy scraps a planned £72,000 cap on care costs paid by the individual. The Tories argue that allowing people to keep a "floor" of £100,000 of assets which cannot be touched is fairer.
Live updates: Sunday political interviews
Reality check: Who could social care changes affect?
Tory opposition to social care plans
Labour steps up push for pensioner vote
Conservative ministers have been defending the policy, arguing PM Theresa May is showing "bravery" by tackling the issue, and that a balance has to be struck between costs funded by the individual and those funded by the taxpayer.
But Conservative think tank the Bow Group has warned it could be the "biggest stealth tax in history", and Labour has accused the Tories of "attacks on older people", citing the social care plan as well as curbs on winter fuel payments and the downgrading of the "triple lock" on the state pension.
Four opinion polls for Sunday newspapers suggest that, while the Conservatives retain a big lead, support for Labour has increased.
Analysis by the BBC's Susana Mendonca
Elderly voters who own their own homes tend to be fertile ground for Tory support. But a social care plan that would see those people's homes sold off to pay for their care after death - meaning their children couldn't inherit those properties - was always going to be a difficult one to sell to this crucial group of voters.
Today Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green defended it saying that £100,000 was a "reasonable amount of inheritance". That's the amount up to which the government would fund a person's care under the plans.
But with a lot of properties worth a lot more than that, it has drawn criticism.
Labour has taken the opportunity to make its pitch for the grey vote, promising more social care spending and a cap of £72,000 on how much anyone would need to pay, while the Lib Dems have accused the government of introducing a "dementia tax".
With speculation over whether the cabinet is fully signed up to the Tories' new social care plan, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been batting off suggestions that the cabinet didn't have a say in a policy that is likely to prove uncomfortable for Tories to sell on the doorstep.
On plans to means-test the winter fuel payment - a sum of between £100 and £300 for those who reach the state pension age - in England and Wales, Mr Green told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show those "in genuine need" would continue to get it and the money saved would go into social care.
The exact threshold for cut-off would be subject to consultation, he added.
Mr Green said the social care cap system that had been due to come in in 2020 would have unfairly benefited those with the most expensive estates to pass on.
"It's got to work for everyone, not just in Ashford and Twickenham, but also in Hartlepool," he said.
"Allowing everyone to know that there is this flat figure of £100,000 is fair to everyone."
He stressed a £100,000 inheritance was still "four times as good" as being left with £23,250 - the current threshold over which residential care costs must be funded.
"Everyone knows there will be a decent inheritance for them, nobody will have to lose their home during their lifetime or the lifetime of their surviving spouse."
Asked if the Tories might reconsider the plans given the criticism, Mr Green said: "No... we have set out this policy, which we're not going to look at again."
He said there would be a green paper covering both social care and health "coming out in the summer".
How would the Tory social care plans work?
Image copyright ForMed Films
Under the Conservative plans nobody with assets of less than £100,000 would have to pay for social care. Currently anyone with assets of over £23,250 is expected to pay the full cost of their residential care and the value of their home can be taken into account.
But that is not the case if you receive care in your own home. Under the Tory plans the value of your home may in future be factored in, although the money would not be taken from your estate until after your death.
This means some people fear they will not be able to pass their homes down to their children.
Why many will pay more for care
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said a cap on privately funded costs - rather than a "floor" - was a better system.
"What we want to make sure, just like the NHS, is there is pooled risk so everybody is certain.
"That's why we supported Dilnot but we also supported a cross-party approach because we have got to have something that is sustainable over generations."
But the policy was defended by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on ITV's Peston's Politics as a "sensible, grown-up Conservative approach" to dealing with the "massive problem" of the long-term cost of social care.
Asked about the disparity between costs faced by someone with dementia, as compared with a who had suffered a stroke, for example, he said: "I do understand people's reservations and the questions that people are asking about some of the detail of this.
"But the broad thrust is right, as the prime minister as said, there will be a consultation on getting it right."
'Dementia tax'
And the Conservative former cabinet minister Ken Clarke told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend the policy was "free market economics with a social conscience" and the alternative was for younger taxpayers to pick up the bill.
He said: "The idea that instead of somebody living in a half a million, a million pound house, contributing to their own care, younger people of working age who can't afford to buy a house should actually pay more tax - because that's what will happen to actually provide the quantity of social care that we need - is grossly unfair," he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: "What we are seeing this weekend is the Conservatives under growing pressure because they have chosen a dementia tax."
"If you or your loved one has or will get dementia, they are coming for you".

PHILADELPHIA - Many hockey players talk about the road being a sort of Fortress of Solitude, a place to avoid the distractions of home and bond as a team, putting them in the most concentrated position to focus on nothing but hockey.
The Flyers are in the midst of a stretch that, according to Jake Voracek, “is going to define if we make the playoffs or not,” and they couldn't be happier to be at home, sweet home.
There's just something about sleeping in your own bed, having the home crowd behind you and playing at the rink you know best that tells the Flyers they might have a shot at a playoff spot.
“We're confident playing at home,” Wayne Simmonds said. “We've played some really good hockey here. We don't really have a choice. We've got to put a streak together if we want to make the playoff still. We're going to be coming down the stretch with a big push.”
Just how big will that push have to be in the Flyers' six-game home stand that began Thursday against the Minnesota Wild?
“When I look at the big picture, which I don't like very often to do,” Voracek said after Thursday's morning skate, “when I look at it we've got to make at least 10 points out of the next six games.”
The Flyers began the day five points out of a playoff spot, unchanged after Wednesday night's action because the Boston Bruins topped the Pittsburgh Penguins. If they were a little closer in the race, the Flyers may have been watching intently but Simmonds was not.
“I try to stay away from watching it and just focus on what we have at hand,” he said.
Among the biggest questions surrounding the team, as the trade deadline approaches Monday, is whether captain Claude Giroux will soon return from the “upper-body injury” that is believed to be a concussion.
Giroux hasn't skated since the Flyers' shootout loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Friday in which he took a hit up high from P.K. Subban, but stayed in the game.
“G is our best player and has been for a long time,” Simmonds said. “We're just trying to fill the void. Obviously there's no one individual that can stand in and take all the responsibilities that he has. I think as a group, as a whole, we can definitely plug in there and have success. We've played a couple good games without him.”
Jimmy Watson impressed by ‘Ghost'
Monday the Flyers will welcome back Jimmy Watson as the team puts him in their Hall of Fame. The former defenseman, now 63, runs a rink in Delaware County, Pa. and has remained in the area.
As he's watched this season he's been particularly impressed with the Flyers' most exciting young player, Shayne Gostisbehere, who he thinks would have fit in during the 10 seasons he played from 1973 to 1982.
“He would have fit in definitely, my goodness,” Watson said of Gostisbehere. “He's been outstanding, what can you say. Honestly, I felt that he could have come up a couple years ago and played for the Flyers. That's how strongly I felt about him. I just love what he's done for the game of hockey. He's a smaller-type defenseman, and he's proving those smaller type defenseman can definitely play in the NHL.”
Watson played 613 games in his NHL career, all with the Flyers. His career was cut short by a back injury, but not before he amassed 38 goals and 186 points, was a five-time All-Star, won two Stanley Cups and as he's stayed around the game, Gostisbehere reminds him of a former teammate.
“I think today with the modern era with a guy like Gostisbehere, I'm sure his teammates have supported him, but I can see he's also becoming a leader on that team,” Watson said. “I would say that he's in that vein of a Bobby Clarke without putting a bunch of pressure on him. He's a leader you can see that. That's what the team needs, or any team needs.”
Loose Pucks
For the second straight game, R.J. Umberger and Evgeny Medvedev were healthy scratches. … After taking over during Saturday's game, goalie Michal Neuvirth got the start for his third straight appearance. The Flyers list goalie Steve Mason as healthy.

Find a Geospatial File's SRID Using Scala and GDAL
On occasion, you might find yourself working with a new spatial data set where it would be really handy to figure out what the current SRID is. Luckily, the smart people at GDAL.org have done the hard work for you. Here's how you do it in Scala using the GDAL Java Bindings.
Note If you'd like to see the full working example ahead of time, see: If you'd like to see the full working example ahead of time, see: https://github.com/Brideau/findsrid
GDAL Setup
First, you have to set up GDAL with the Java bindings on your machine. It's not as simple as just having GDAL installed. There are instructions to do this here for various systems, and here for mac, but in my experience these aren't very up to date and you may have a date with StackOverflow to get through this part. The following worked for me on macOS High Sierra:
First, disable System Integrity Protection. The rest of this won't work if you don't do that.
Run:
Follow the instructions that show in your terminal in the output of the previous command to update your .zshrc or .bashrc or whatever file it is your terminal uses.
Add the following to the same file as in the previous step:
Restart any terminals you have open or run source [the file from above] in your terminal
Project Setup
Add the following to your project's build.sbt file to get the Boundless Geo resolver and to load the GDAL library (I'm running Scala 2.12.4 and SBT 1.0.3 for the record):
Download this sample file and save it in your project under the /src/main/resources folder, creating it if it doesn't already exist.
Blocking Approach
The simplest way to do this is to write it without caring about whether your code blocks. To do this, add the contents of the Main class below to whichever class you're working with, following along with the comments:
That's it! Build, run, and enjoy. If it's possible to identify your SRID from the file you have, there's a good chance the AutoIdentifyEPSG method will do it.
Non-Blocking Approach
To achieve the same thing without blocking, wrap everything in a function that returns a Future when it is called. Then, call the function, and use pattern matching to choose what to do with the function returns successfully or not. Make sure you import the global ExecutionContext at the top and that you block the main thread at the end to prevent the JVM from terminating, as shown below.
This approach has benefit of being able to complete other work while the file is being loaded, which is handy when you're dealing with large geospatial files.

Sly Sludge I keep seeing people spraying Round-Up on the weeds in their sidewalk cracks, their hands on the spray nozzle mere inches away from the weed. I just want to scream at them, "Don't you know you're creating superweeds? Don't you know you're poisoning the earth? Don't you know Monsanto is poisoning you for monetary gain?" Ugh. It's especially on my mind lately because recently (following King Corn), I made my best friend watch Deborah Koons Garcia's The Future of Food. If you haven't seen it or can't find it, I made a children's book sort of thing about it, which boils down the message. You can read that here. Basically, it's about how Monsanto exploited the US Seed Bank and patent system and has been screwing over small family farmers in an attempt to control the production of (and therefor the profits from) food.
I made a video about weeds, and how they're not so bad after all. Watch it if you'd like.

Three of the UK's four big mobile phone networks have made customers' call records available at the click of a mouse to police forces through automated systems, a Guardian investigation has revealed.
EE, Vodafone and Three operate automated systems that hand over customer data “like a cash machine”, as one phone company employee described it.
Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, a transparency watchdog, said: “If companies are providing communications data to law enforcement on automatic pilot, it's as good as giving police direct access [to individual phone bills].”
O2, by contrast, is the only major phone network requiring staff to review all police information requests, the company said.
Mobile operators must by law store a year of call records of all of their customers, which police forces and other agencies can then access without a warrant using the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).
Ripa is the interception law giving authority to much of GCHQ's mass surveillance. The law was again under the spotlight recently after it was used to identify sources of journalists from at least two national newspapers, the Sun and the Mail on Sunday.
Documents from software providers and conversations with mobile companies staff reveal how automatic this system has become, with the “vast majority” of records demanded by police delivered through automated systems, without the involvement of any phone company staff.
The Home Office argues communications data is “a critical tool” and its use of Ripa was “necessary and proportionate”.
Despite politicians' assurances that the UK laws requiring phone companies to keep records would not create a state database of private communications, critics argue that the practice comes very close to doing so. King warned that “widespread, automatic access of this nature” meant the UK telecoms industry “essentially already provides law enforcement with the joined-up databases they claimed they didn't have when pushing for the ‘snooper's charter'.”
In the automated systems used by the phone companies, police officers seeking phone records must gain permission from another officer on the same force, who then enters the details into an online form. That mirrors the US Prism programme, revealed by Edward Snowden, which in effect created a backdoor into the products of US tech corporations. In the vast majority of cases, the information is then delivered without any further human role.
One document prepared by Charter Systems, which sells the type of software used by police forces to connect with mobile phone companies, explains the automated process saves “32 minutes” of human time per application.
“Charter Systems have worked in partnership with the Home Office and Detica [a firm providing data interception for security services and the police, now called BAE Systems Applied Intelligence] to develop a solution that links directly to all CSPs [communication service providers, a term covering phone companies],” it states. The document explains the system produces “an automated solution for gathering electronic data information. The new solution saves time and effort for the authority in requesting and receiving ever increasing amounts of data.”
The systems were so interconnected, a separate sales document produced by Charter reveals, that “[d]ata can be retrieved from multiple CSPs in one request”.
Privacy groups reacted angrily to the details of how little day-to-day scrutiny records requests receive, warning that the automation of the system removes even the limited oversight ability – the right to refer requests to oversight agencies – phone networks have over Ripa requests.
“We urgently need clarity on just how unquestioning the relationship between telecommunications companies and law enforcement has become,” said King. “It's crucial that each individual warrant for communications data is independently reviewed by the companies who receive them and challenged where appropriate to ensure the privacy of their customers is not being inappropriately invaded.”
Privacy advocates are also concerned that the staff within phone companies who deal with Ripa and other requests are often in effect paid by the Home Office – a fact confirmed by several networks – and so may, in turn, be less willing to challenge use of surveillance powers.
Several mobile phone networks confirmed the bulk of their queries were handled without human intervention. “We do have an automated system,” said a spokesman for EE, the UK's largest network, which also operates Orange and T-Mobile. “[T]he vast majority of Ripa requests are handled through the automated system.” The spokesman added the system was subject to oversight, with monthly reports being sent to the law enforcement agency requesting the data, and annual reports going to the interception commissioner and the Home Office.
A spokesman for Vodafone said the company processed requests in a similar way. “The overwhelming majority of the Ripa notices we receive are processed automatically in accordance with the strict framework set out by Ripa and underpinned by the code of practice,” he said. “Even with a manual process, we cannot look behind the demand to determine whether it is properly authorised.”
A spokesman for Three, which is also understood to use a largely automated system, said the company was simply complying with legal requirements. “We take both our legal obligations and customer privacy seriously,” he said. “Three works with the government and does no more or less than is required or allowed under the established legal framework.”
Unlike the other networks, O2 said it did manually review all of its Ripa requests. “We have a request management system with which the law enforcement agencies can make their requests to us,” said the O2 spokeswoman. “All O2 responses are validated by the disclosure team to ensure that each request is lawful and the data provided is commensurate with the request.
Mike Harris, director of the Don't Spy On Us campaign, said the automated systems posed a serious threat to UK freedom of expression. “How do we know that the police through new Home Office systems aren't making automated requests that reveal journalist's sources or even the private contacts of politicians?” he said.
“Edward Snowden showed that both the NSA and GCHQ had backdoor access to our private information stored on servers. Now potentially the police have access too, when will Parliament stand up and protect our fundamental civil liberties?”
A spokesman for the Home Office declined to respond to specific queries about the use of automatic systems to retrieve call records, but defended police forces' use of Ripa. “Communications data is an absolutely critical tool used by police and other agencies to investigate crime, preserve national security and protect the public,” he said in a statement.
“This data is stored by communications service providers themselves and can only be acquired by public authorities under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 on a case by case basis, and where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.
“The acquisition of communications data under RIPA is subject to stringent safeguards in existing legislation and is independently overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner.”
Police at Georgia's third largest university are looking for four men accused of sexually assaulting a student in a unit at an on-campus apartment complex.
Kennesaw State University police learned of the sexual assault Monday night from a Marietta police officer, officials said Tuesday afternoon in an emailed statement. The student reported the incident to the officer, who was stationed at WellStar Kennestone Hospital.
The student told police the sexual assault occurred between 11:15 p.m. June 21 and 1:20 a.m. June 22 at the Austin Residence Complex, where one of the suspects lives.
At least one of the four men is believed to be a Kennesaw State student, according to an alert from university police.
“It can be assumed that conditions continue to exist that may pose a threat to members and guests of the University community,” police said in the alert. “It is the duty of the institution to warn of possible ‘dangerous conditions' on or near the campus.”
Kennesaw State president Daniel S. Papp said: “There is no place in our campus community for sexual assault. We take this issue very seriously, and all of our law enforcement resources are being brought to bear to ensure that we get to the bottom of this situation swiftly and accurately.”
Descriptions of the suspects and other details were not immediately available.
Omaha police say a tiger bit an apparently intoxicated woman who broke into a Nebraska zoo to pet a big cat.
Officer James Shade says the 33-year-old woman suffered a severe hand injury in the incident at the Omaha Zoo early Sunday.
Shade say officers were called to the Creighton University Medical Center around 7:20 a.m. after the injured woman showed up. He says she was acting aggressively and appeared to be intoxicated.
Police determined that she had sneaked into the zoo and was bitten when she reached into the tiger exhibit.
The zoo said in a statement that it was likely an 18-year-old Malayan tiger called Mai bit the woman, and asserted that safety and security are priorities at the facility.

The woman has been cited for criminal trespass.
In the fall of 2012, Michael J. Watkins broke into the Idaho zoo. after a bout of drinking, and tried to steal a monkey. He failed and beat the monkey to death. He was convicted of grand theft larceny and animal cruelty and sentenced to 7 years in prison, reported The Associated Press. The judge also recommended substance abuse and grief treatment.

The largest climate march in history is coming to New York City.
This event takes place on Sunday, September 21 to coincide with the United Nations' Climate Summit happening later that week. The summit, at which recently designated UN Messenger of Peace Leonardo DiCaprio will address the UN, will gather global leaders from government, business, finance and civil society “to promote climate action for a healthy planet, sustainable economic growth and better standards of living for all.” Because these leaders are coming to UN Headquarters in New York, organizers of the People's Climate March think it's the perfect time to take to the streets.
“With our future on the line and the whole world watching, we'll take a stand to bend the course of history,” explains the march's website. “We'll take to the streets to demand the world we know is within our reach: a world with an economy that works for people and the planet; a world safe from the ravages of climate change; a world with good jobs, clean air and water, and healthy communities.”
This mass effort to “peacefully flood the streets in historic numbers” to communicate the urgency for bringing about environmental change is being organized by more than 1,000 different environmental groups, businesses, religious organizations and concerned citizens.
The People's Climate March begins at 11:30 a.m. at Columbus Circle, and finishes at West 34th Street and 11th Avenue. The approximately two-mile march will conclude with a moment of silence, followed by a moment of alarm during which participants are asked to “make as much noise as you can when you hear 32 marching bands blowing their horns and church bells ring from around the city . . . sounding the climate alarm that has gone ignored for too long.”
The event's full schedule of events can be found at Peoplesclimate.org.

Munir said that she and some of her friends, who are Muslim, wish stereotyping would end.
She's among several Muslin teens voicing concerns over anti-Muslim sentiments they believe are rising as controversies surrounding Islam capture national attention.
Unsa Shafi, 16, a junior at GPS, said that misconceptions about her faith began with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"It's like people have taken the extreme Muslims as a representation of all Muslims in America," she said. "Yet Muslims in America wouldn't even consider the terrorists true Muslims because of what they did.
"You can't judge a whole religion because of a few people."
Almost a decade after Sept. 11, a Pew Research Center poll released in August found that 30 percent of Americans hold a favorable view toward Islam, while 35 percent believe the religion promotes violence.
While most of the Chattanooga teens interviewed said they felt insulated from the overt bias demonstrated in other parts of the country, life here is not without incident.
Even when derogatory comments are made in jest, they still sting, Shafi said.
"Once a girl was going around saying, 'Hey, terrorist,' like she was joking, but I was like, 'Wait ... that's not funny,'" she said. "I don't want to be dubbed a terrorist just because I am a Muslim."
Rania Zeinedlin, 17, a senior at Soddy-Daisy High School, said that others are shocked when they find out she's not Christian and try to convert her.
"They're like 'Oh, you're going to hell,'" Zeinedlin said. "Most people don't realize we believe in the same God as Christians."
University of Tennessee at Chattanooga freshman Yasmeen Abdulazeez, 17, was told by a professor that he would lower her grade when she asked to miss class for a religious holiday. She dropped the class instead.
Donning the hijab, the traditional headscarf worn by some Muslim women, is a visible, recognizable sign of the faith, but some teens said wearing one can attract unwanted scrutiny.
Shafi said that after her mother was hassled by a group of teens at a local gas station for wearing the hijab, it became her responsibility to fill up the gas tank for a while.
"That scares me a little bit because I've already been called a terrorist and I'm not even wearing a headscarf yet," said Shafi, who plans to wear the headscarf in college.
Abdulazeez, who has worn the head covering since she was a child, said she has experienced many problems as a result. A referee during a volleyball tournament refused to allow her to play because of her headscarf.
Misconceptions about Islam aren't limited to the classroom.
During a campaign stop in Chattanooga in July, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey made national headlines by suggesting that Islam might be a cult instead of a religion. Ramsey did not respond to repeated requests for comments for this report.
Ramsey's statements helped perpetuate negative perception of Muslims, Munir said.
"He definitely sent the wrong message out," Munir said. "It's because of people like him that there is so much misinterpretation."
Chattanooga's Muslim teens said they feel a responsibility to help dispel the negative stereotypes of their faith.
Before graduating from Red Bank High School, Abdulazeez said some of the students would harass her. She said she saw that as an opportunity to dispel misconceptions about her faith.
"I'm not afraid to go straight toward them and ask them, 'Do you really know what Islam is?' " Abdulazeez said. "There's this misconception that Islam is a violent religion. Muslims are actually peaceful."
Amin Gharad, president of Muslim Youth of North America, said the biggest misconception American Muslim teens deal with is the perception of an "us vs. them" mentality.
Local Muslim teens said they wish people would focus on what makes them the same rather as what sets them apart.
"Really, all we want is to be your friends and be treated like everyone else," Shafi said. "We have morals like you have morals. Just because we find them in a different book doesn't make us any different."

Americans believe in the power of markets. It's one reason the nation has chosen not to follow the examples of Great Britain, Canada and other “socialist” models when it comes to health care. But there are open markets, and then there's United States health care.
In open markets, competition is supposed to drive prices down and quality up. Yet Americans shell out nearly three times more per person on health care than other developed countries. With no real price and quality data available to the public, it's almost impossible to shop around for medical treatment.
Ever-rising health care costs to both consumers and businesses have sparked a movement around health care “transparency” in recent years. In January, the movement reached Olympia. A rare coalition of business groups, hospitals, consumer advocates, doctors, native tribes and politicians aligned in support of an all-payer claims database in Washington. Sixteen states already have such databases in place or are in the process of creating them (see map on next page), and others are moving in that direction.
The primary goal of the database is to reveal how insurance companies pay for treatments at specific health care providers, thus exposing price and quality variations for consumers. Such a system encourages health care providers to lower their prices to be more competitive. The databases have been created without controversy in other states, and it seemed Washington was on a similar track with its own proposal earlier this year. Only one politician and one company publicly opposed the state Senate's bill to build one: State Senator Randi Becker, R–Eatonville, and health insurance giant Premera Blue Cross.
By March, the effort was dead. In a move not subject to wider statehouse debate, Becker used her position as chair of the Senate Health Care Committee to block creation of a health care database. The compromises passed in its place are called “useless,” even by legislators whom Becker describes as allies on the issue.
“This is one of those cases where something is done and they barely even try to defend it,” says Senator Karen Keiser, D–Kent, a committee member who pushed for the database. “Unfortunately, it's the easiest thing in the world to maintain the status quo. Especially when there's a powerful interest group like Premera trying to keep the window closed.”
Simply put, the lack of a public database in Washington makes it harder for businesses and individuals to control their health care costs. So what was behind its failure in Olympia? Seattle Business magazine interviewed more than a dozen people in insurance, politics and health care in Washington and other states to understand the debate's stakes.
There are two areas everyone seems to agree on. One is that health care cost transparency is a great concept. The other is that it's a complex concept. Considering that two national advocacy groups — Catalyst for Payment Reform (CPR) and the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute (HCI3) — awarded Washington an “F” grade in cost transparency this year, in this state complexity seems to be winning.
In navigating the subject, it's helpful to identify the information that's not very useful. For instance, there is a tool on the Washington State Hospital Association's website (wsha.org) called WSHA Hospital Pricing. It allows anyone to look up common medical procedures and compare the prices hospitals in this state charge for them.
On the face, it sounds beneficial. Leo Greenawalt, who served for 30 years as WSHA's president, says the organization is “very frustrated that consumers seldom use this service.” When pressed, however, both he and other health care executives admit the tool doesn't offer relevant information to most people.
“Charge information isn't overly useful,” says Claudia Sanders, senior vice president of policy development at WSHA. “There are tremendous differences between the ‘charge' offered [on the site] and the payment amount for insurance companies, or for Medicare and Medicaid patients. … Plans negotiate different discounts for different treatments.”
Compare that tool with HealthSparq, a service that insurance company Regence BlueShield provides its customers. Featuring a slick, easy-to-use web interface, HealthSparq offers detailed comparisons of cost and quality among providers. Taking into account Regence's price negotiations and a user's specific plan, it estimates out-of-pocket expenses for hundreds of procedures.
“For transparency to make any movement, it has to be easy for consumers to understand,” says Don Antonucci, president of Regence BlueShield in Washington. “If a tool's not simple to use, you get nowhere. … Right now, the pressure is on both the commercial and public sector to move forward on this.”
Every insurance company is now required to offer a HealthSparq-like tool by 2016, thanks to legislation passed in Olympia this year. Becker and Premera spokesman Eric Earling say this will do the job of a state claims database but with the efficiency of the private sector.
Critics are skeptical. For one, these tools are available only to current customers of the insurance companies. For businesses and individuals seeking insurance plans that meet their exact needs, the approach doesn't work.
“If there's a medical treatment your child needs, and you're looking for the plan with the best negotiated rates on that, you're out of luck right now,” says Greenawalt.
Patrick Connor, state director for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), says the government requires businesses to buy plans but doesn't give them tools to compare benefits. Given the importance of health care costs to a company's bottom line, he says this is a problem Olympia isn't fixing.
Furthermore, private sector tools don't expose cost and quality variations in the overall system. An all-payer claims database works by pooling data from multiple insurance carriers into one place, exposing outliers, abnormalities and trends in the market. A recent study of New Hampshire's claims database shows that it has reduced price variations among providers and allowed the market to exert downward pressure on costs.
The Washington Legislature passed a compromise around this issue as well. A database will be created in the state but will contain only limited amounts of information centering on public employees and Medicaid patients, as well as whatever data insurance companies offer voluntarily.
“We did some data gathering, but we limited it,” says Becker. “I'm most happy that we limited that. We can gather some data and see what it actually does.”
According to Mary McWilliams, director of the Seattle-based nonprofit Washington Health Alliance, the compromise database is a red herring. Collecting data on public employees might've been useful, but the plans of public teachers are exempt from this measure, she notes. Those happen to be the plans handled by Premera.
“If you have three major [insurance] companies and one doesn't contribute data to the pool, you can't make an actual report,” McWilliams asserts. “It completely undermines the credibility of any result. … Premera was successful not only in precluding the release of their insured data [through a state claims database], but in precluding their contribution to this very limited database.”
Becker, whom the Washington Public Interest Research Group has dubbed “the senator from Premera,” confirms that Premera is exempt from contributing to the database. “Do I believe they should maybe contribute in the future?” she asked. “Yes. Do I think that needs to be mandated by the government? No. … I'm frustrated when I'm associated with being in Premera's pocket. I'm not. I try not to do that with any single entity.”
In an editorial, The Seattle Times criticized Becker's action and said, “Premera Blue Cross cooed its approval of ... action that denies consumers access to information to make better choices and help bring down healt care costs.”
Asked to name another politician or organization supportive of this approach besides Premera, Becker names State Senator Linda Evans Parlette, R–Wenatchee, who also serves on the Senate Health Care Committee. “She understood it more than others,” Becker says.
Parlette defended the compromise until she was informed Premera won't be contributing. “I didn't even know that,” she says. “Well, then, I guess this data will be useless after all.”
Why is Premera the only state organization publicly opposed to an all-payer claims database? Earling, who is vice president for corporate communications at Premera, tosses out plenty of reasons. There's general “big government” trepidation and his concern that hackers will access medical data. But his main point is one repeated by Becker: By pulling back the curtain on what insurance companies pay, a complete state claims database may give providers the upper hand in price negotiations, possibly raising health care prices.
“Market intelligence on allowed amounts [for procedures] tends to be used by providers to drive the costs up, not down,” says Earling. “They use that information to negotiate from a position of strength. … There is no evidence that [claims databases] bring costs down.”
A senior hospital official who asked not to be identified says this argument “sounds like a lot of horseshit.” Most others expressed a similar, albeit less descriptive, sentiment.
“In the states that have these databases, we haven't seen these Chicken Little predictions come true,” says NFIB's Connor. “The jury is still out on their full advantages, but successful transparency efforts are showing that costs go down as individuals gain more control over their dollars.”
Edie Sonn is acting CEO of the Center for Improving Value in Health Care, the organization administering Colorado's new claims database. She points to the study on New Hampshire's claims database and a study by the University of Chicago, both of which provide evidence that transparency empowers the market to drive down costs.
Sonn admits that claims databases are difficult to create, are big administrative burdens for insurance companies and the public sector, and are still in need of sufficient study on their overall effectiveness. But these are not valid reasons for inaction, she declares.
“My first thought on Premera's argument is that we live in an age of transparency,” Sonn says. “Show me another company that says showing their price tags puts them at a competitive disadvantage.”
Andréa Caballero, program director for business-backed nonprofit Catalyst for Payment Reform (CPR) in San Francisco, says the more likely motive for Premera's opposition is to protect its market position. If you're number one, the thinking goes, why welcome change?
“If Premera thinks they get the deepest discounts [from health care providers], they don't want others to see [that]because they might not keep their advantages against other plans,” Caballero explains. “There's so much talk about unintended consequences, consumers don't get a public resource.” She adds that Washington will likely receive another “F” in cost transparency next year.
As many other states create these databases, Caballero argues Washington legislators must revisit the issue to keep the state competitive on the issue of cost transparency. But Keiser sees little hope for a real all-payer claims database surviving Olympia's current political dynamic. Becker and Premera, which is one of the largest corporate contributors to legislative candidates, are both firm that it shouldn't.
“The private sector is the best equipped to offer meaningful transparency,” says Earling. “Lost on some of the advocates
of the database is that this is something the private sector's already doing. … The analogy I use to explain this to novices is it's like when you go to a car dealership. There's a [price] sticker on the car, but that's not what you're going to pay. You're going to negotiate down the cost of a car, and you're going to have a trade-in.”
It's an interesting analogy, considering the car business's history. Until 1958, there were no price stickers on cars. Customers negotiated in the dark and costs varied widely from dealership to dealership. It took federal legislation to require that pricing stickers be attached to the car windows, in what is considered a major consumer-rights landmark.
Though the “sticker prices” on cars are indeed flexible, they provide a real measure of transparency around price and quality, and they help breed competition. One wonders what it'll take to bring more of these factors to health care.
BANGALORE: Troubled tycoon Vijay Mallya is defying a boardroom decision to remove him as chairman of United Spirits Ltd, as India's largest distiller said it has lost faith in him after a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) inquiry into the company's books found "improprieties and violations".USL, now controlled by drinks giant Diageo, will report the matter to relevant government authorities as applicable under law which could embroil Mallya and some of his key executives in regulatory investigations.TOI online broke the story in the morning that Diageo and Mallya are engaged in an endgame as the nine-member board began meeting on Saturday morning.Mallya, 59, reeling under the setbacks of the grounded Kingfisher Airlines agreed to sell majority shares and management control to Diageo more little over two years ago. Diageo, which paid $3 billion, has faced huge write offs and corporate governance issues post the expensive takeover."I have refused to step down. The so-called PwC investigation is full of half-truths and twisted facts. I have asked for a hearing to robustly reject whatever the investigation report says," Mallya told this newspaper emerging from the nearly 7-hour boarding meeting in Mumbai.At the heart of the dispute are loans extended by USL to Mallya group companies and outstanding receivables totaling around Rs 2000 crore, allegedly used to fund the debt laden Kingfisher Airlines."What can be amicably resolved will be amicably resolved. What cannot be amicably resolved will have other recourse," Mallya added when asked if he was readying to move the court to stall his removal. A media statement issued by Mallya's office later said he would pursue his contractual obligations with Diageo Plc PwC inquiry suggests that the manner in which certain transactions were conducled indicates various improprieties and legal violation, USL informed stock exchanges in the evening. "ln light of the above, and without making any determination as to fault or culpability, the board of directors noted that they had lost confidence in Vijay Mallya continuing in his role as a director and as chairman and called upon him to resign immediately," the company statement added.If Mallya refuses to step down, the board has resolved that it would recommend his removal to the shareholders of the company. Mallya said he cannot be ousted unless the shareholders vote on it. "As things stand today, Diageo has a contractual obligation to vote for me when shareholders meet," Mallya explained. The USL board said it would ask Diageo to review its contractual obligations in the context of the PwC report.Mallya said the present USL board has no continuity and little understanding of what happened in the past. "The books of the company were duly audited and passed by the shareholders in the past. Diageo conducted 16 weeks of intense due diligence before agreeing to the deal with me. PwC made no effort to contact the then USL board members or auditors to seek clarity," he added.PwC said it stood by the work done and believe it to be of the highest professional standards.Mallya and Diageo have had testy ties ever since he agreed to sell USL two years ago. He owns less than 5% stake and is seen isolated in a 9 member boardroom with five independent directors, TOI had reported last year. Diageo controls 54% stake in the Bangalore headquartered company, which has about 40% market share in the branded liquor market.USL said the board has directed MD and CEO Anand Kripalu to initiate necessary action against other employees of the company who appear to have been involved in certain transactions covered by the inquiry. On Thursday, the company's CFO and executive director, PA Murali, resigned suddenly triggering speculation about bigger troubles brewing within.Mallya said Murali was one of the finest finance officers who had to resign without been given a proper hearing.USL was Mallya's crown jewel and cash spewing engine which he surrendered in the wake of his sinking fortunes after Kingfisher Airlines was grounded under massive debt and lenders initiated action against him and his UB Holdings Ltd.Vijay Mallya agrees to sell his flagship company USL to Diageo. He's left with 11% but lenders of grounded Kingfisher sells pledged shares bringing his stake to just under 5%USL says it is delaying audited financial results as it has no clarity on loans advanced to Mallya companies. Ties with Mallya turns sour.Diageo pays a hefty premium to get majority shares after an initial offer to buy shares from public failed. It now owns 54% and ready to take on MallyaUSL board appoints PwC to investigate the company's loans and other receivables based on the remarks of auditor KPMGPwC reports indicate legal violations and improprieties. PA Murali, CFO, resigns suddenly; two days later, board meets to ask Mallya to step down"What can be amicably resolved will be amicably resolved. What cannot be amicably resolved will have other recourse. USL board cannot remove me under Diageo's current contractual obligations.""Without determining any culpability, the board noted that it has lost confidence in Vijay Mallya continuing as a director and chairman of the company"
Trailer Park Boys actress Sarah Dunsworth has been identified as the final Crown witness at Jian Ghomeshi's sexual assault trial.
Dunsworth is a friend of Lucy DeCoutere, another Trailer Park Boys actress and one of three women who have accused the disgraced broadcaster of sexual assault.
Crown lawyer Michael Callaghan told court on Tuesday that a statement Dunsworth made to police would corroborate DeCoutere's allegations that Ghomeshi choked her and repeatedly slapped her while they were kissing in his bedroom in the summer of 2003.
Story continues below advertisement
He also said that Dunsworth's police statement would put to rest allegations that DeCoutere fabricated the story to win notoriety and fame.
The transcript of her police statement was introduced as an exhibit in court today along with the transcript of Facebook messages the two actresses exchanged before Dunsworth went to police.
Ghomeshi will not take the stand in his trial and closing arguments are set to begin on Thursday when court resumes.
Ghomeshi has pleaded not guilty to four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking.
The 48-year-old former host of CBC Radio's Q acknowledged in 2014 that he engaged in rough sex acts, but said it was consensual.
By now you've probably seen the latest GOP-sponsored thuggery in lowkell's diary. A Democrat mistakenly understood Eric Cantor's invitation to voters to come with their "family, friends & neighbors" to meet Rep. Eric Cantor to include Democratic voters, too. It didn't.
That's John Taylor, a member of the Louisa County Democratic Committee and a backer of Cantor's opponent, Rick Waugh, being manhandled by local law enforcement for "trespassing, resisting arrest and creating a public disturbance."
Taylor said Cantor had promoted the event on his website, so he assumed it was a public event. "We RSVP'd," he said. He and three other Democrats went inside the coffeehouse with the intent of asking questions of Cantor, who has declined to debate Waugh. Taylor said the Democrats were asked to leave by the coffee shop's owner. When they refused, authorities escorted them outside.
Ah, he was just being "escorted" outside. Good to know. I guess that's the advantage of being an elected Republican. Joe Miller had to hire private militia thugs to intimidate people at his supposedly private events. At least Taylor didn't get his head stomped, so in that he should be grateful that it was cops doing the escorting, rather than Rand Paul style "volunteers." Cantor, who "has a tendency to surround himself with layers of defense," apparently hasn't commented on this, yet.
It's becoming increasingly clear that there's no room for opposition, or for difficult questions. Cantor refuses to debate. Miller and Angle won't answer any questions from the media. Paul has to be "protected" from 23-year-old women carrying satirical signs. There's no room for opposing points of view, or even for questions, in the Republican world.
OTTAWA -- Malala Yousafzai delivered a powerful speech to Canadian parliamentarians Wednesday, in which she called on them to follow through on government promises to fund girls' education.
More than 130 million girls around the world aren't in school, according to UNESCO figures, and Canada has committed to ensuring education around the world through the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
"Our nations promised every girl she would go to school for 12 years," Yousafzai said in the House of Commons.
"I know that politicians cannot keep every promise they make, but this is the one you must honour."
Yousafzai praised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his work on gender equity and with refugees, but made it clear she expects more from the feminist prime minister when it comes to helping women and girls.
Canadian aid funding has gone down since the Liberals took office in 2015, according to new OECD figures released Tuesday, hitting its second-lowest point in the last decade, at 0.26 per cent of gross national income.
Canada is one of the countries that committed in 1970 to spend 0.7 per cent of its GNI on aid. The closest it came was in 1975, at 0.54 per cent, according to OECD figures.
NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière says pressure to increase funding hasn't just been coming from Yousafzai, but from multilateral groups, civil society and the NDP.
"Nothing is moving. What we've seen really in real terms is a decrease since the Liberals took power," she said following Yousafzai's speech.
"We should be up to this challenge. Up to this challenge also includes investing money in girls' education… beyond words, we need actual money and that starts with increasing our international assistance money."
International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said the government will increase funding for girls' education, but suggested the overall aid budget isn't going up. The last federal budget had no additional funding for international development.
"We will focus our investment in international development towards women and girls, and we will invest more in education because this is the basis for women's empowerment," Bibeau said outside the House.
But asked whether she would increase funding, Bibeau said, "I don't have a budget announcement today."
Yousafzai called on Canada to do for education what it did for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, by hosting a funding replenishment conference at which countries renew or increase their pledges. She also called on Canada to prioritize schooling for refugees, with only a quarter of refugee children getting secondary education right now.
But her other wish request may be most resonant: to make girls' education a central theme of the country's G7 presidency next year. The presidency rotates among its members, and it was during Canada's last presidency in 2010 that then-prime minister Stephen Harper used his chairmanship to leverage billions of dollars in funding for maternal, newborn and child health. The program was hugely successful and set Canada's aid focus for the ensuing seven years (second-round funding was announced in 2015 and wraps up in 2020).
"We have a responsibility to improve the world. When future generations read about us... I don't want them to be shocked that 130 million girls could not go to school and we did nothing," Yousafzai said.
"I don't want them to be shocked that we did not stand up for child refugees, as millions of families fled their homes. I don't want us to be known for failing them. Let the future generations say we were the ones who stood up. Let them say we were the first ones - we were the first to live in a world where all girls could learn and lead without fear. Let us be the ones who bring the change we want to see."
The New England Revolution may have exercised its purchase option on Jose Goncalves' loan agreement in November, but a recent interview with the Portuguese center back suggests he could be seeking a return to Europe.
According to an interview posted to the blog A Minute in Sports!, Goncalves spoke of his intent to continue his career in Europe in the not so distant future.
“For any player in the world to play in Europe is very interesting,” Goncalves told the blog on Jan. 19. “It is the highest league and that's why I am thinking to be back in Europe very soon.”
Goncalves was born in Lisbon, Portugal before moving to Switzerland at young age. He spent the entirety of his career on the continent before he was loaned to the Revolution last year.
The 2013 MLS Defender of the Year also cited family reasons and a potential opportunity with the Portuguese National Team behind his desire to return to Europe.
“My family is in Europe and I need a plan for my future life, definitely,” Goncalves told the blog. “I am also fighting for a spot in the [Portuguese] national team and that has always been my goal.”
Additionally, Goncalves expressed disappointment with the negotiations he had with the front office concerning the purchase option.
“After the MLS season ended last year, there have been a lot of discussions and meetings with the Revs,” Goncalves told the blog. “A lot of promises have been made, but nothing came at the end and the club also gave me the feeling that I am easy to replace, so for me it is a very simple answer and that's it.”
Goncalves declined to advise whether his desire to go back to Europe, or his dissatisfaction with the front office, would open the door to a hasty departure.
“I can't tell you more about that right now,” Goncalves told the blog. “I am still under contract but the future will tell you more.”
On Friday, Revolution general manager Michael Burns issued the following statement to New England Soccer Today in response to the interview.
“We're aware of the interview Jose conducted, and want to stress that he's a valuable member of the Revolution,” Burns said in an e-mail. “Jose is under contract with MLS and New England for multiple years, but having said that, we'll continue to have dialogue with his representative regarding his contract.”
Goncalves isn't the first player to express frustration with the Revolution front office. In 2010, former Revolution midfielder Jeff Larentowicz told the Boston Globe that fellow teammates had been soured by the front office's approach to personnel decisions.
“Teams have decisions to make on players and players have decisions to make for themselves they have to feel comfortable with,” Larentowicz told the Globe in 2010. “Over time, [the Revolution] weren't doing right by their players. I watched a lot of talented players and friends go and a lot seemed unhappy who were still there.”
Larentowicz was traded to the Colorado Rapids prior to the 2010 season.
Gary Kubiak is returning to his second home. Joe DeCamillis is coming back home, period.
The Broncos reached agreement Tuesday with DeCamillis, a former all-state quarterback and wrestler at Arvada High School, to become their special-teams coordinator.
“It's awesome, a dream come true,” DeCamillis said Tuesday night from his parents' Arvada home. “They've got some really good, young talent. They've got a good, young kicker (Brandon McManus) and a very accurate kicker (Connor Barth), and a very effective punter (Britton Colquitt). All the tools are there. Looking forward to coming back and having a go at it and getting these guys playing great.”
DeCamillis, 49, got his first NFL job with the Broncos in 1989, when he was hired by Dan Reeves.
“I was a secretary, really,” DeCamillis said modestly. “I was just trying to break in.”
WATCH: Football is about camaraderie; John Elway and Gary Kubiak have that
He started working with special teams in 1991, then moved with Reeves to coach the special-teams units with the New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons. After Reeves' last season in 2003, DeCamillis carried on in Atlanta, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dallas Cowboys and most recently the Chicago Bears.
“I'd like to get some stability,” DeCamillis said. “I'd like to be here for a while and try to help Gary win championships.”
Before Kubiak was introduced at his noon news conference Tuesday, he had finished setting the offensive side of his coaching staff. It helped that he already had quality coaches in place. The Broncos will retain receivers coach Tyke Tolbert, running backs coach Eric Studesville, strength and conditioning coach Luke Richesson and quarterbacks coach Greg Knapp, according to an NFL source.
WATCH: How likely is Peyton Manning to return with Gary Kubiak?
Tight ends coach Clancy Barone will shift to offensive line coach. Kubiak also is bringing two assistants with him from the Baltimore Ravens — Rick Dennison and Brian Pariani. Dennison will become the Broncos' offensive coordinator and Pariani the tights end coach.
Former Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase had interviewed Monday with the Ravens for their offensive coordinator position, but that job went to Marc Trestman, former Bears coach. Gase also interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with the Jaguars, but that job went to Greg Olson on Tuesday, according to an NFL source. Olson was the Raiders' offensive coordinator the past two years.
Gase now will interview for that job with John Fox in Chicago.
Kubiak will look mostly externally to fill his defensive coach positions. According to a source, the Bengals have denied the Broncos' request to interview defensive backs coach Vance Joseph, who would be a top candidate to become their defensive coordinator.
WASHINGTON — President Obama called Bernie Sanders on Sunday to talk about the future of the senator's presidential bid, according to a Democratic official.
Sanders is campaigning in California, where he is battling against Hillary Clinton in the last major contest of the Democratic primary.
The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official would not reveal details of the conversation.

The White House would not confirm the call or say whether Obama also reached out to Clinton.
The White House has been in regular touch with both campaigns throughout the primary, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told reporters that the senator has spoken with Obama ‘‘on a number of occasions,” but declined to say if they spoke Sunday.
One of the surprise breakout hits of 2013, BBC America's Orphan Black developed a small but passionate fan base of viewers who followed the show about a group of female clones caught up in a war between their evolutionary-obsessed creators who have been monitoring their every move, and the people who consider them an abomination against God and want them dead. In addition to women in general, who enjoyed seeing several smart and tough female characters portrayed, the LGBT community via fan groups like the #Clonesbians latched on to the show thanks to two characters in particular: Sarah's gay foster brother Felix (played by Jordan Gavaris), and one of the clones, Cosima (played, like all of the clones, by Tatiana Maslnay), who developed a relationship with her female monitor, Delphine (Evelyne Brochu).
The show was praised for showcasing strong and complex gay characters whose sexuality was not their only defining characteristic, and I asked Maslany about that praise on the Felix's loft set during a break in filming on season 2 (which premieres April 19). “Yeah, that one means a lot to Jordan and I both,” says Maslany of the support from the LGBT community. “I mean, I'm honored in any way to speak to that community and to be playing a role. We sort of embrace the idea of every human having the potential to be anything, and I think that opens the door for all kinds of dialogue about sexuality and about gender. And it's exciting material that is not always on screen in a respectful way. And I don't mean respectful in the sense of martyrdom, I mean respectful in the sense of flawed, complex performance and characters.”
Gavaris also appreciates the connection many LGBT fans have felt with the show. “I love it,” he says. “In Canada especially, since gay marriage has been legal since 1999, and in Ontario we tend to be more socially and politically liberal. We're in a different place than the United States right now, from a civil rights standpoint. It's a great place to operate from, to shoot the show here, because we shoot all the storylines with respect and with care. I think it's important to show all sides of a minority. On television now we find a lot of characters are being portrayed in a very politically correct way — where they have great jobs and they aren't effeminate. These are seen as the right way to do it. But that's not necessarily fair. It's not fair to the side of the community that doesn't look like that. They can't identify with those characters. It's really great that we have people like Cosima and Felix and Colin and Teddy. It's great that we get to show all sides of the minority as best we can and hopefully do it respectfully. It's lovely that the LGBT community has responded so well. We take that really seriously and it's something we're really proud to do as a show. We have a social responsibility to be inclusive.”
Even while Orphan Black received praise for the diversity of its characters, there was some debate online about the decision to have Cosima be gay, because If she has the same genetic code as her clone sisters, does that mean the show is implying that she chose to be gay as opposed to being born that way (since other clones like Sarah and Alison appear to be heterosexual)? Absolutely not, says the woman who plays her. “By no means are we saying that Cosima chooses to be gay,” says Maslany. “It's by no means that. It's just that there are so many biological factors into the mother's womb, into the conditions of the womb. So much of the research I was doing about clones was about identical twins, right? Identical twins would actually be closer in expression than clones because clones are birthed from different wombs. And there's so much information that gets fed through the mother. I think we're not saying anything about that in terms of choice and biology or whatever. We're saying more that everyone could be anything.”
There's also the matter that we are only 10 episodes into the series and are still learning more about the clones, how they were created, and whether there are actually small differences in their genetic makeup. So more answers as far as that goes could be coming. We'll just have to stay tuned to find out.

On February 10, 2007, Vladimir Putin delivered his keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference, challenging the post-Cold War establishment. RT looks back a decade to see how accurate his ideas were.
The Munich speech presented criticism of a world in which the US gets to unilaterally take decisions on most important global issues with little regards to the interests of other nations, especially those not allied with Washington.

Putin called such a system inherently unfair and posing various risks to the world, compared to an alternative in which the US has to live by the same laws as the rest of the world and negotiate on conflict issues rather than use military force to resolve them.
“Just like any war, the Cold War left us with live ammunition, figuratively speaking. I mean ideological stereotypes, double standards and other typical aspects of Cold War bloc thinking.”
Over the past year, the US media has upped its rhetoric against Russia, going so far as to accuse it of war crimes and of putting its pawn in the Oval Office.
READ MORE: Kremlin to check if Fox News host who called Putin ‘killer' apologizes by 2023
“Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems. Moreover, they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension. Judge for yourselves: wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished... And no fewer people perish in these conflicts – even more are dying than before. Significantly more, significantly more!”
Since 2007, the US has continued its military action in Afghanistan and Iraq, played a key role in the devastation in Libya, is currently contributing to the Saudi Arabian intervention in Yemen and has attacked Syrian troops – presumably by mistake.
“In international relations, we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so-called issues of political expediency, based on the current political climate. And of course, this is extremely dangerous. It results in the fact that no one feels safe. I want to emphasize this – no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course, such a policy stimulates an arms race.”
READ MORE: The bully as the good guy: The looking-glass world of NATO's threats to Russia
Some leaders tried to play nice and hope for the better. Libya's Muammar Gaddafi paid compensation and invested oil money in Western banks. This didn't save him from being summarily executed by US-supported insurgents. Or Ukraine's Viktor Yanukovich, who caved in to a US-backed armed coup and signed a EU-brokered power-sharing deal with his opponents. The deal was thrown away a day later, and the president reportedly barely dodged an assassination attempt while fleeing to Russia.
“The use of force can only be considered legitimate if the decision is sanctioned by the UN,” Putin said. “And we do not need to substitute NATO or the EU for the UN. When the UN truly unites the forces of the international community and can really react to events in various countries, when we leave behind this disdain for international law, then the situation will be able to change. Otherwise the situation will simply result in a dead end, and the number of serious mistakes will be multiplied.”
NATO's mandate in Libya was to protect civilians from airstrikes. The alliance did this with a bombing campaign that targeted anything remotely resembling a military asset. Apparently that included Gaddafi's youngest son and three grandchildren killed by a missile intended for the man himself. The UK and France played key roles in the campaign.
“I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have anything to do with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe,” Putin said back in 2007. “On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact? Where are those declarations today? No one even remembers them.“
READ MORE: Russia conducts snap air force combat readiness check, Western media accuse Moscow of ‘going to war'
Over the past decade, NATO has absorbed two more nations, Albania and Croatia, and drawn closer with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia. The Ukrainian government has declared NATO membership a priority. NATO has deployed additional troops at Russia's border and moved to build an anti-missile system, which Russia sees as a threat to its national security.
“Let's say things as they are,” Putin said in his Munich speech. “One hand distributes charitable help and the other hand not only preserves economic backwardness but also reaps the profits from it. The increasing social tension in depressed regions inevitably results in the growth of radicalism and extremism, feeding terrorism and local conflicts. And if all this happens in, shall we say, a region such as the Middle East where there is increasingly the sense that the world at large is unfair, then there is the risk of global destabilization.“
In Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group Islamic State for a while managed to create a more or less functioning state. Their success was to a great degree fueled by propaganda that blamed alienation and disfranchisement of Muslims to the malice of the West. This message attracts not only desperate locals, but also Muslims in wealthy Western countries.

A former NFL player and Super Bowl MVP, has spoken out on the news that NBA star Jason Collins had come out as gay, and said that “football isn't ready”, for openly gay players.
Hines Ward said that he was fully supportive of gay players being able to come out and be themselves, but that he thinks not all players currently in the NFL would feel the same.
Speaking to NBC Sports Radio on Tuesday, Ward said he thought the time wasn't right for a gay player to come out in the NFL , reports the LA Times.
“I don't think football is ready,” Ward said “There are too many guys in the locker room and, you know, guys play around too much.”
Ward, who retired before the 2012 season, went on to say that, when an NFL player does come out, they will have his full support.
“Hopefully one guy comes out of the closet and [will] be comfortable with himself,” he continued.
“I don't have anything against a gay football player or a gay person period, so if he does, he has support from me. I want people to live their lives for who they are and don't have to hide behind closed doors to do that.”
The NFL this week sent out a document, which reminded teams and players that the league has a nondiscrimination policy, and said that “any jokes, comments or pranks”, around a player's sexuality constitutes harassment.
A former NFL player and Super Bowl Champion, this week had a speaking appearance cancelled by a church over a congratulatory tweet he sent to Collins.
Mike Wallace, an NFL player for the Miami Dolphins, took to Twitter to respond to Collins' revelation, noting that he personally found women attractive, and suggesting that being gay is a choice. He later apologised for the tweet.
Last week, the NFL agreed, in an unprecedented move, to better protect gay players against discrimination and harassment.
Alan Gendreau, a gay American footballer has expressed hopes of being drafted by an NFL team, and could be the first openly-gay player the industry has anticipated for some time.
Ayanbadejo earlier in April said he knew of four gay NFL players who were looking to coordinate coming out, in order to face any potential backlash together.
Other reports have suggested that, for several years, a currently active NFL player has been openly gay to many teammates, and coaches.
Vince Young won a national championship at Texas and was a two-time Pro Bowler in the NFL.
He was once considered great and hopes to be once more.
Young, 33, submitted an application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday requesting to trademark the phrase, "Make Vince Great Again."
MORE: Vince Young hires agent Leigh Steinberg to lead comeback
Young, 33, hasn't played in an NFL game since 2011, but is attempting a comeback. He's drawn interest from the new Spring League and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, is in discussions with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL.
Young has been out of football since a failed tryout with the Browns in 2014. He spent 2013 training camp with the Packers and has not played in an NFL game since 2011 while with the Eagles.
The 6-5, 232-pound quarterback led Texas to the 2005 national championship and was the third overall pick in the 2006 draft by the Titans. He was the NFL's Rookie of the Year and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2006, again making the Pro Bowl in 2009.
The USA Rugby South Panthers will be kicking off their 2015-2016 season next month. On October 17-18, 2015, the USA South Panthers will open training camp in Charlotte, NC with a match against the Charlotte Rugby. They will hold a second training camp in November.
The USA South Panthers will be preparing for their first NACRA season match against Bahamas National team on January 9th, 2016. The Panthers will precede this match with a warm up matches against the Capital Rugby Union on December 5th or 12th of this year.
The USA South Panthers play in the North American Caribbean Rugby Association. Last year they finished with a 0-2 record in NACRA for the Spring 2015 campaign.

Florida to become $1 trillion economy – What does it mean to Miami agents? by James McClister June 30, 2016
By 2019, the size of Florida's economy is projected to be nearly $1.1 trillion, according to a new projection from University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. Today, that would make Florida the world's 16th largest economy, and that has big implications on the state's real estate market – especially in Miami.
“The fundamental underpinnings of the housing market in Florida continue to strengthen. Job growth in Florida is forecasted to continue outperforming the U.S. labor market and more Baby Boomers continue to reach the end of their working lives,” wrote Snaith, defining the pillars of the state's economy: housing and jobs.
In his forecast, Snaith, an expert in economic projections, analysis and market sizing, and named by Bloomberg News as “one of the country's most accurate forecasters,” laid out an economic scenario that sees the Sunshine State's Real Gross State Product (RGSP) expanding at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent from 2016 to 2019 – faster than what he anticipates the national rate to be during the same period. At this pace, the state's RGSP is expected to break $1 trillion by 2018 – and Snaith expects the state to maintain a similar growth rate until at least 2045.
But Florida's exponential growth is no guarantee. The state's labor market will need to continue recovering, and its housing market will need to normalize and further strengthen.
From 2016 to 2019, job growth in the state is expected – much like its RGSP – to surpass the national rate, rising at an annual average of 2 percent, with the most robust growth happening this year (3.9 percent) and next year (2.4 percent). It drops off to a little over 1 percent in 2018 and below that in 2019. Snaith said the improved rates, driven largely by strong construction-sector growth, should not only encourage more Floridians to enter the job market, but also attract workers from out of state.
However, improvements in the labor market will depend on how the state's real estate market performs, which, according to the forecast, is currently suffering from a single-family shortage that is forcing up prices and throttling housing starts.
Nowhere in the state is this more apparent than in Miami.
Slowing home price appreciation gives way to wider healing
In May, the median sales price for an existing single-family home in Miami rose 4.6 percent year-over-year, or from $282,000 to $295,000, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. The association's 2016 Chairman of the Board Mark Sadek pointed out in the report that even after 54 months of consecutive increases, the city's home prices are still comparable to 2004 price levels. He failed to mention they are also currently more than $50,000 above the national median. Snaith explained the appreciation as a side effect of low inventory.
“While this looks like another housing bubble, it's really just an old-fashioned shortage in the single-family market,” the UCF economist explained. “It is expected to correct itself as new housing starts ramp up over the next few years.”
Today, home price growth in Miami is already slowing, allowing the market and earners to catch up.
Phil Spiegelman, a principal with real estate sales and marketing group ISG World, identified the primary contributing factor to the slowing market as “the strong dollar and the economy of Latin America.” But also, new construction in the city is on the rise, and more inventory begets lower price appreciation.
Year-to-date in April, residential construction spending in Miami was $2.279 billion, a 14 percent increase of the same time period in 2015.
Snaith has confidence in Miami's housing market's future, and his economic forecast for the city explains why: income and employment growth.
A road from recovery to healthy growth
In 2000, more than half of the households in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties reported earning “mid-level incomes.” But by 2014, after weathering the downturn and subsequent recession, that number dropped to 48.5 percent, according to Snaith's report. There was a similar shift in “upper-level” earners, which fell from 15.4 percent of households to 14.8 percent. The only economic tier to expand during that period was lower-income households, which grew from 33.6 percent to 36.7 percent.
But 2014 was a stellar year for Miami. The real damage was done between 2007 and 2009, when the U.S. economy was tanking. In those two years, Miami's Real Gross Metro Product (RGMP) fell by about $250 million; payroll employment dropped by more than 200,000; and personal incomes, at their lowest point, were declining year-over-year by 8 percent.
Since 2009, households have been in recovery. Between 2009 and 2014, which is the latest year data is available, median household income in Miami-Dade County increased by 15.7 percent, from $37,226 to $43,099. The increase precipitated growth in multiple sectors.
“When you're making money, you're spending more money, and more demand equals more jobs,” said Josh Navarro, a global investment specialist with J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
The momentum built over that five-year period placed Miami's economy on an upward trajectory it is expected to maintain until at least 2045. Snaith projects an average annual personal income growth of 4.9 percent; average annual wage growth of 3.6 percent, with an average annual wage level of $58,500 (the highest of any area studied by the economist); average annual employment growth of 1.7 percent, with construction and mining being the fastest-growing sector at 3.6 percent; and an average unemployment rate of 5.2 percent, which is moderate.
If Snaith's forecast is correct, or at least moderately accurate – which is entirely likely, considering the high praise his past forecasts have received – real estate professionals over the next 30 years can expect to face a welcoming and more stable market. Business should be good.
While Microsoft's DirectX 12 may have been the first low-level API to appear on PC (excepting AMD's proprietary Mantle API), its arch-rival Vulkan is potentially more interesting. Vulkan promises to be more widely adopted, thanks to support for Windows, Linux, and Android, and companies like Valve and Epic are firmly behind its development.
With Vulkan now at version 1.0 and drivers from Nvidia and AMD available, we can finally take a crack at answering the big questions: can Vulkan live up to all the low-level API hype? And will AMD see the same huge performance gains that it did in early DirectX 12 benchmarks?
But first, some caveats: The Talos Principle is technically the first game with Vulkan support, but it's in beta testing. The Talos Principle also isn't designed to take advantage of the CPU utilization and draw call improvements that are central to Vulkan, unlike Stardock's Ashes of the Singularity demo does with DX12. Furthermore, the new Vulkan drivers from AMD and Nvidia are also both still in beta.
Additionally, only Nvidia's beta driver has passed Vulkan conformance testing. Weirdly, it was Nvidia's driver that proved to be troublesome during testing, often crashing while trying to run the game's built-in 60-second benchmark. AMD's driver had no such issues. Given the early nature of both the drivers and the game, I've no doubt these problems will be ironed out further down the line. In short, take these benchmark results with a large pinch of salt.
All this matters for much the same reasons why DX12 matters; Vulkan sports similar improvements across the board. Developers have greater control over memory allocation and how commands are processed by the GPU—tasks traditionally handled directly by the driver. While that means developers generally have to do more work, it's largely similar to the work that needs to be done to optimize games on consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One.
Vulkan also makes far better use of multicore processors by spreading the workload evenly across cores, along with sending commands to the GPU in parallel rather than one at a time. By exploiting the massive parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, Vulkan should make games run a hell of a lot faster.
The benchmarks
TEST SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS OS Windows 10 CPU Intel Core i7-5930K (6-core) @ 4.5GHz RAM 32GB Corsair DDR4 at 3000MHz HDD Samsung SM951 512GB M.2 PCIe SSD Motherboard Asus X99 Deluxe Power Supply Corsair HX1200i Cooling Hydro Series H110i GTX 280mm Liquid Cooler GPUs Nvidia GTX 980 Ti, AMD R9 290X
The standard Ars UK test rig running Windows 10 was used to benchmark Vulkan, along with Nvidia GTX 980 Ti and AMD R9 290X graphics cards (the newest AMD card we have access to). Tests were run with six cores and hyperthreading for a total of 12 threads, along with four cores and no hyperthreading to better mimic a typical Core i5-based gaming PC setup. In theory, more cores should equal more performance thanks to better multithreading, but as we saw with DirectX 12, it's likely that the GPU will become the bottleneck way before the CPU is unable to throw enough commands to it.
Each benchmark was run at 1080p and 1440p resolution with all settings on ultra, antialiasing set to 4X, and 3D rendering MPIX set to unlimited.
Some of you may also be wondering where the 99th percentile benchmarks are. Unfortunately, Fraps doesn't work with Vulkan, and the built-in benchmark only spits out high, low, and average frame rates. SLI and Crossfire don't work either, and the Vulkan rendering path is so new that Talos Principle developer Croteam warns that it won't be as fast as its highly tuned DX11 implementation. As such, what's important here isn't the performance in comparison to DX11, but rather the performance in comparison to Vulkan's predecessor, OpenGL.
6-core
4-core
Let's get this one out of the way first: no, AMD doesn't enjoy the same ridiculous performance boost that it did in the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. Given that the Ashes demo made extensive use of CPU utilization and draw call improvements and The Talos Principle doesn't, AMD's ACE (Asynchronous Compute Engine) doesn't get to flex its parallel computing chops in quite the same way.
That said, both AMD and Nvidia see a lift in performance compared to OpenGL. With six cores and at 1440p, there's a 12 percent uplift for Nvidia and a slightly less impressive 4-percent rise for AMD. At 1080p there's a larger 16-percent rise for Nvidia and 18 percent for AMD. The four-core results are largely the same.
In GPU-bound scenarios, like higher than 1080p gaming, Vulkan isn't all that different from OpenGL. But there's a clear uplift in performance as soon as the CPU is taxed a little more, like at 1080p and lower resolutions.
This is a good indication that Vulkan may live up to the hype when it comes to better CPU utilization, and with much more powerful graphics cards on the way from both AMD and Nvidia, the extra CPU grunt could prove invaluable as 1440p and 4K gaming become mainstream.
So far, there are no shocks with Vulkan like there were with DX12. Nvidia and AMD users can rest easy knowing that, at the very least, Vulkan will give their existing hardware a boost. Given the performance gulf between Vulkan and DX11, there's still a lot of work to be done by developers to get the most out of the nascent API; plus, the graphics drivers are very much in beta and not suitable for widespread use just yet.
This stands in stark contrast to DX12, which despite opposition has benefited from being bundled with Windows 10. The API and the drivers are solid, and it's only a matter of time until there are some quality games that make use of them.
Vulkan is still a ways off; currently it's about what it might be rather than what it is. But with Google adopting Vulkan for Android and the likes of Unity, Epic (Unreal Engine), Valve (Source 2), and Dice (Frostbite) lending a hand, expect improvements to come thick and fast.

There is a very good possibility that the World War III option is an attempt to control the Internet by eliminating Net Neutrality and online free speech. It appears that the boundaries set between countries through treaties are vanishing due to the exponential dissemination of information through the Net. This is in conflict with the wishes of the oligarchy who are willing to do anything to maintain control. After all, it is, in large part, our technological evolution that is bringing about our socioeconomic metamorphosis that we see manifesting itself as a global financial crisis.
Click to enlarge - source.
The attack on the Internet use to be just three-pronged; bandwidth throttling by ISP's, Internet censorship by governments, and the oligarchy trying to prevent Network Neutrality. However, as of this year, we can now add a new category to this list, autocratic control over the Internet.
In April 2009, Senators John Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) introduced a bill “to establish the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor—an arm of the executive branch that would have vast power to monitor and control Internet traffic to protect against threats to critical cyber infrastructure.” The Cybersecurity Act of 2009 (PDF) gave “the president the ability to ‘declare a cybersecurity emergency' and shut down or limit Internet traffic in any ‘critical' information network ‘in the interest of national security.'” The bill did not define a critical information network or a cybersecurity emergency. That definition was left to the president.
Internet companies and civil liberties groups were alarmed with this Bill which “proposed handing the White House the power to disconnect private-sector computers from the Internet.”
“They're not much happier about a revised version that aides to Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, have spent months drafting behind closed doors. CNET News has obtained a copy of the 55-page draft of S.773 (excerpt - PDF), which still appears to permit the president to seize temporary control of private-sector networks during a so-called cybersecurity emergency. “The new version would allow the president to ‘declare a cybersecurity emergency' relating to ‘non-governmental' computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat. Other sections of the proposal include a federal certification program for ‘cybersecurity professionals,' and a requirement that certain computer systems and networks in the private sector be managed by people who have been awarded that license.”
These new despotic powers for the President of the United States of America are raising alarm bells across the globe, as they should.
Below you will find two maps of Internet censorship ratings per country. The first is from 2008 and the second from 2009. As is indicated, in one short year, many more countries have begun to censor the Internet.
Click to enlarge - source.
As well as the above, the mainstream media and the corporate elite have created the “Piracy” buzzword so that they can preserve our present discriminatory and bias system of disseminating information - a dysfunctional system that has given power and control to the elite through archaic copyright laws that have neither benefited artists nor consumers. This model has censored and controlled information, news, and entertainment for the benefit of multinational conglomerates.
As was previously stated, as a collective we must understand that democracy can only exist in a society with an educated populace, and the right for self-governance can only be obtained through knowledge. As long as the Internet remains Neutral and uncensored, we, as a global community, can make a difference. We can fill the gap left behind by our corporate governments by becoming proactive in every aspect of our lives and our civilization.
The more information that we share within our collective the more informed decisions we will be able to make for our society. For those who have not noticed yet, the established hierarchical system is collapsing.
The only way we will be able to bring about positive changes is by sharing our art and our vision without corporate censorship, distribution limitations, or government bureaucracy.
This global community that has been created through the Internet, functioning as the only true free society, is reshaping our world. Where this interaction and connectivity will lead us is yet to be determined, however, the changes are and continue to be unprecedented.
The following three presentations are an excellent introduction to this topic. Here is hoping that we maintain control of the largest library ever known in human existence.

A WOMAN who urinated in a police cell danced and sang an Oasis song in the dock as she was sentenced.
Sara McHale admitted three booze-fuelled incidents in September and October – which also saw her hold a knife to her own throat in public.
The 38-year-old admitted three counts of being drunk and disorderly and one of criminal damage at Halton Magistrates Court on Monday, November 30 but made frequent outbursts during her sentencing.
When she was told to enter the dock, McHale said: “I'm not going in there, I don't like it – I don't want to go in a cage, I'm not a dog.”
The court heard that on September 6, she required medical treatment after drinking in the Bank Chambers on High Street in Runcorn.
The police were called by ambulance staff after McHale, of Devon Place, Widnes, became aggressive and swore, shouted and used foul language.
She was taken to Warrington Hospital where she continued to use foul language and swore at a doctor before she was arrested.
On October 4, she was arrested after being ejected from a pub in Widnes town centre and taken to holding cells on Manor Farm Road in Runcorn where she urinated on the floor.
Just over two weeks later on October 19, a member of the public called the police after spotting McHale holding a knife to her own throat on Castlefields Avenue North, Runcorn.
Officers found her lying in bushes shouting about Osama Bin Laden and making comments about suicide bombers.
The court heard that McHale, who has 22 previous convictions, has a long history of alcohol misuse and emotional issues and has difficulty living from day to day.
Her barrister said that McHale's outbursts were ‘bravado'.
As magistrates decided what sentence to hand her, McHale covered her face with a scarf and said: “I need a drink – I'm not right in the head.”
She was fined a total of £420 for the incidents.
McHale shouted ‘Saddam Hussein' as she left the court before dancing and singing Married with Children by Oasis.
She added: “What a waste of money – I'd rather kill myself, I'm being fined for serving my country.”
Gallup Daily: Obama-Biden Ticket Leads by 6 Points No further increase for Obama since before Thursday's speech
PRINCETON, NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Aug. 28-30, including two days of interviewing since the close of the Democratic National Convention, finds Barack Obama with a six percentage point lead over John McCain in the presidential contest, 48% to 42%.
Though down slightly from the eight-point lead Obama held mid-convention, this represents a clear improvement for the Democratic candidate's positioning in the campaign compared to a week ago when the race was about tied. The last Gallup update conducted entirely before Obama's convention and vice presidential announcement was based on interviews conducted Aug. 20-22, and showed Obama up by two points, 46% to 44%. (To view the complete trend since March 7, 2008 click here.)
As the recent trend shows, Obama did not gain any additional support in the poll since his generally well-reviewed acceptance speech on Thursday night. However, the Aug. 28-30 field period also includes two days of interviewing since the Friday morning announcement by McCain that he has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to join him on the Republican ticket. Thus, it is unclear whether the full positive impact on national voters of the Democratic convention or Obama's speech would have been greater if not for the Palin announcement.
As Gallup has noted in recent weeks, both the vice presidential selections and the national conventions have historically produced small bumps in support for the presidential candidates associated with those events (on the order of about five percentage points for each). However, this year, Obama's announcement of Joe Biden as his running mate produced no immediate increase in support for Obama in a one-night USA Today/Gallup reaction poll.
Given that the immediate reaction by national voters to Palin was very similar to their first reaction to Biden -- mildly positive but also with a high degree of uncertainty about each -- it may not be surprising if the publicity surrounding her announcement also does not produce an immediate bounce in support for McCain.
The mounting news coverage over the past 48 hours of the impending landfall of Hurricane Gustav on the Gulf Coast introduces still another variable into the mix of factors possibly affecting voter reaction to the recent campaign events.
Monday's Gallup Poll Daily tracking report will be the first three-day rolling average based entirely on interviews conducted after the Democratic National Convention, as well as after the announcement of Palin as McCain's choice for vice president. -- Lydia Saad
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey, Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008.

The Turkey Blocks internet censorship watchdog has identified and verified that restrictions on the Tor anonymity network and Tor Browser are now in effect throughout Turkey. Our study indicates that service providers have successfully complied with a government order to ban VPN services.
Tor is a free and open system designed to allow activists, journalists and ordinary internet users to circumvent government censorship of digital communications. As last line of defence against the world's most severe internet censorship regimes, Tor has seen growing popularity in Turkey alongside commercial VPN services thanks to its free availability and resilience.
Impact of VPN blocking
New, sophisticated blocking measures mean Internet users will no longer be easily able to circumvent social media shutdowns and other mass-censorship events in Turkey as they have become accustomed to over recent years.
Partial or total blocking of VPN, Tor and similar services will shift Turkey's internet censorship regime from moderate to severe in character, allowing the state fine-grained control of the flow of information in a “walled garden” model of internet access like that imposed by China's Great Firewall.
Other circumvention methods, including Tor's bridged modes built to evade similar restrictions imposed by the regime in Syria, as well as custom VPN deployments, continue to remain available to technically skilled users in the short-term.
Government-issued VPN Blocking Order now in effect
In late 2016 reports surfaced that Turkey had ordered ISPs to block access to Tor and several commercial VPN services. On 5 December, ISP industry representatives Turk Internet reported growing pressure to complete the ban, including demands for weekly progress reports on the status of the new technical restrictions. Users started reporting connectivity issues around the same time.
Turkey typically cuts access to individual sites by court order or administrative measure to permanently restrict access to services on grounds of morality and state security. In recent years, the government has also started to shut down social media networks entirely for hours or days during national emergencies and political unrest – a form of network interference that the Turkey Blocks project was founded to investigate.
Internet users in Turkey increasingly resort to VPNs and Tor to circumvent both kinds of censorship, allowing them, for example, to access independent sources of information and seek assistance in the minutes and hours following terror attacks.
Summary of findings
Turkey Blocks finds that the Tor direct access mode is now restricted for most internet users throughout the country; Tor usage via bridges including obfs3 and obfs4 remains viable, although we see indications that obfs3 is being downgraded by some service providers with scope for similar on restrictions obfs4. The restrictions are being implemented in tandem with apparent degradation of commercial VPN service traffic.
Methodology
We selected four nodes on two ISPs from our network of monitoring probes, and pushed the latest version of the Tor software and bridge software to each device. We tested basic connectivity and data transfer rates over Tor with direct access, obfs3 and obfs4. Hence we collected 12 sets of data, each consisting of a packet capture, a download timing and a connection log, totalling 36 articles of data. We ran a control with identical hardware and software in the United Kingdom with an unrestricted internet connection to validate the results. We sought to cross-reference our findings against Tor metrics breakdowns for Turkey, taken from publicly available aggregated statistics of overall Tor usage worldwide (see Annex A).
Test configuration
Tor v0.2.8.11 (git-9fc59eddc17a726a) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.2g and Zlib 1.2.8; Ubuntu Server 16.04; Linux kernel 4.4.38-v7+ armv7l; Raspberry Pi 2
Test results
Direct Tor access restrictions started around 12 December 2016. Tor's direct mode is now entirely unusable via providers TTNet and UyduNet on the residential broadband connections we tested. Packet filtering or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) are likely used to disrupt the connection phase, which stalls around the 10% mark.
Connection is possible using obfs3 and obfs4 Tor bridges with both providers. While obfs4 is effective across all configurations, obfs3 intermittently fails with TTNet.
We found that removing one of the three obfs3 server IP addresses from the configuration allowed for more reliable connection, suggesting that it might be possible to mitigate interference improving failover in the default configuration or bridge implementation.
Annex A: Anomalous Rise in Tor Metrics Usage
We first sought to evaluate Tor restrictions using freely available statistical data provided by the Tor project. Yet our efforts were confounded by unexpected Tor metrics data. Tor metrics tracks the number of active Tor users in Turkey.
Where we expected a fall in usage corresponding to widespread reports of failure to access the Tor network, charts instead show a huge increase in Tor usage over the same period.
We produced these hypotheses to explain the phenomenon:
A genuine increase in usage triggered by censorship: We detected no censorship during the periods outlined that could explain such a sudden, large and sustained rise in usage. To put this in context, even absolute, long-term blocks of YouTube or Twitter in the past caused relatively small bumps in Tor usage. Genuine increase in usage triggered by privacy concerns: Leaks of private citizen data like the MERNIS database leak and Wikileaks data dump, and government surveillance in relation to alleged coup plotters haven't been in the headlines recently and it's unlikely Turkish citizens would switch to Tor so suddenly for its privacy-preserving features. A botnet or network of compromised hosts: Rootkits and viruses loaded onto PCs and IoT devices use the Tor network to disguise their control channel and coordinate of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. If such a botnet network had been deployed on the specified dates, that could well explain the sudden increase of Tor usage. A measurement anomaly caused by connection failure: The dates when usage spikes correlate with early reports of Tor unreachability. Although it sounds counterintuitive, it's possible that repeated failed connection attempts caused by Turkey's new access restrictions were registered by the metrics platform and counted as new users.
During tests we saw over a hundred connection attempts associated with a single user connection request, leading us to favour the theory Tor metrics have incorrectly counted these failed attempts in their overall usage tally.
In rare cases where a successful direct connection was made, Tor was subsequently able to establish further connections successfully using cached values written to temporary files. This means that existing Tor users with a primed cache may be able to connect directly despite the blocking measures.
We invite the Tor developers to take a closer look at the situation. In the meantime we recommend that figures published by the Tor project aren't taken to indicate increased Tor usage.
Conclusion
Our study corroborates user reports that Tor access with the default configuration is now widely, though not yet totally, restricted. The government ban also covers specific commercial VPN services but not corporate or custom VPN solutions such as those deployed by businesses to allow remote access by employees.
Network restrictions imposed by the government will become absolute for many internet users, even those who were previously able to work around frequent mass-censorship events with relative ease.
The new measures are thus likely to change the nature of internet usage over years to come, diminishing media freedom and freedom of opinion and expression in Turkey.
A few hours after he took charge as governor of the Reserve Bank of India three years ago, Raghuram Rajan took the unusual decision to speak with great clarity about the tasks that he had set for himself.
He said that a new monetary framework would be developed, a greater variety of financial entities would be allowed to operate in India, financial markets would be seen as complements rather than competitors of banks, the banking business is as much about loan recovery as it is about loan disbursal, there would be baby steps to internationalize the rupee, financial inclusion would be an important theme during his tenure, and financial infrastructure would be improved.
Rajan ended his speech on two improbable notes that sound very prescient today. First, he said that a central banker such as him starts his innings at the height of popularity, but taking unpopular decisions is also part of the job, so he would not go ahead with an eye on how many Facebook likes he collects. He then quoted from a poem by Rudyard Kipling: “If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too".
As Rajan ends his tenure at the Indian central bank, each of these themes resonate. Rajan pushed through most of the changes he had promised, especially a new way to conduct monetary policy, a more open attitude towards financial innovation and forcing banks to deal with problem loans.
He also stepped on many toes in pursuit of his goals, be it powerful business groups that had defaulted on bank loans, ministers whose sole contribution to economic debate was to call for lower interest rates, or many others who thought he had made it a habit to speak on issues outside the boundaries of what public officials are expected to.
Rajan eventually had to face a social medium lynch mob that focused on making personal attacks on him. We have already argued in these columns that the final responsibility for not standing by Rajan during this sorry episode should rest with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley. Any political leadership has the right to appoint public officials of its choice—but it should also understand that mature democracies work through independent institutions that are not beholden to the politics of the day.
This newspaper has also at times been critical of Rajan's outspokenness, but some of Ben Bernanke's sharp comments on US fiscal policy or Mark Carney's criticism of Brexit are counter examples of central bankers speaking on issues that seem to be outside their remit. More importantly, the expectation that a central bank governor should only speak on monetary affairs should be matched by the commitment that officials in New Delhi should not hold forth on interest rate or exchange rate policy, as is their wont.
Rajan took charge at a time when high inflation had not only damaged the economy but also dented the credibility of the Indian central bank. The fight against inflation is not yet completely over, but there is no doubt that the significant victories over the past few years is largely explained by four factors: The fiscal correction that began after P. Chidambaram came back to the finance ministry at the end of the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance; the determination of Jaitley to continue to bring down the fiscal deficit despite the obvious pressures to not do so; the deft handling of the food economy by the Modi government; and overdue retreat from loose monetary policy under Rajan.
The credibility of the Indian central bank has not yet been fully restored. The most obvious proof is that inflation expectations are still way above the inflation rate that is being signalled. The mess in the banking sector continues to present a daunting challenge—in fact, it could be the biggest threat to economic stability right now. Institutional territory markers will have to be defined. These are some of the tasks that Urjit Patel will have to focus on from next week.

If you've watched the Iron Man film franchise, you'll know that a powered suit gives inventor Tony Stark superhuman strength to fight the bad guys.
But away from the the fictional world of blockbusting movies, robotic exoskeletons offer more prosaic and useful help for humans.
The military has been in on the act for years, using them to help soldiers carry more weight for longer periods of time. Meanwhile manufacturers have been busy creating robotic suits to give mobility to people with disabilities.
But now exoskeletons are becoming an important part of the scene in more conventional workplaces, mainly because of their unique offering.
"Exoskeletons act as a bridge between fully-manual labour and robotic systems. You get the brains of people in the body of a robot," says Dan Kara, research director at ABI Research.
"But there's more to it than that. You can tie the use of exoskeletons to business benefits that are very easy to quantify. The main one is a reduction in work-related injuries, and we know that outside the common cold, back injury is the main reason people are off work."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robotic suits are used to help people with disabilities improve their mobility
The motor industry has used robots for many years. But robots can't do everything, points out technical expert Marty Smets, of Ford's human systems and virtual manufacturing unit.
"In our plants, we see a need for both people and robots," he says.
Some Ford assembly line workers lift their arms up to 4,600 times a day - that's about a million times a year. That sort of repetition leaves many suffering from back-ache and neck pain.
Now, though, the company has equipped staff at two US assembly plants with a device called the EksoVest, from California-based Ekso Bionics. It helps take the strain by giving workers an extra 5-15lb (2.2-6.8kg) of lift per arm.
"Incredible is the only word to describe the vest," said Paul Collins, an assembly line worker at Ford Michigan assembly plant. "It has made my job significantly easier and has given me more energy throughout the day."
The company says it's already seeing a dramatic decline in work-related injuries and is now planning to introduce the exoskeletons at facilities in Europe and South America.

Currently, the industrial use of exoskeletons is relatively small - this year only a few thousand have been sold, says ABI's Kara. But, he says, the potential market could be in the millions.
The types of exoskeleton used for rehabilitation can cost more than $100,000 (£75,000), needing, as they usually do, to replace a user's muscles altogether. However, industrial versions can be far cheaper, at around $5,000.
They generally augment human strength rather than replace it and tend to enhance one part of the body only. They also often don't need any external power. Instead, they can deliver a 10-20% boost to the user's lifting power by transferring weight to the ground.
In Japan, exoskeletons are being used for heavy lifting in the shipbuilding industry as well as in large commercial construction projects.
Meanwhile, US retailer Home Depot is testing exoskeletons to help workers unload trucks and bring materials onto the floor.
Another early adopter is Lockheed Martin, which is using its own Fortis exoskeleton to allow workers to operate tools for much longer periods. It has a support structure that transfers the weight of heavy loads from the operator's body directly to the ground through a series of joints at the hips, knees and ankles.
It can also be used with an arm that supports the weight of a tool helps isolate vibration and torque kick - rotational force - from the user. Workers using the devices, says Lockheed Martin, report two-thirds less fatigue, with higher quality work, greater productivity and fewer musculoskeletal injuries.
Image copyright Sarcos Image caption Sarcos robots can be operated remotely by a human wearing an exoskeleton
Other companies are producing powered industrial exoskeletons that are rather more like the suits from the movies. Sarcos, for example, offers three models, with the biggest - the Guardian GT (pictured) - handling more than 450kg with its 2m (7ft) arms.
"I think powered exoskeletons will become ubiquitous for industrial applications around the world. These devices will materially reduce occupational injuries while also dramatically improving productivity," says chief executive officer Ben Wolff.
"Additionally, these devices can extend the useful life of an aging work force, and can make jobs open for more people that previously could have only been handled by people of larger physical stature."
More Technology of Business

Other augmentation technologies are even stranger. Researchers at Cornell's Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, for example, have developed a robotic "third arm" that attaches to the user's elbow. The group says it sees applications in package handling, warehouses, and even restaurants.
"A third arm device would enhance a worker's reach, and allow them to access objects without having to reach or bend. This would be useful in pick-and-place tasks where the worker is moving, such as retrieving packages from warehouse shelves," says researcher Vighnesh Vatsal.
"It would also provide support in assembly tasks in challenging environments such as construction sites, for instance by holding a work piece steady while a worker operates on it with power tools using their own hands."
In the longer term, industry experts say the price of exoskeletons will fall further, meaning they could move into many more areas of work. They could even find a place in private life, with applications in DIY, gardening and sports such as hiking.
So while we'll never be likely to be able to emulate the exploits of comic book heroes, exoskeletons could help with mundane household chores such as ironing. So not so much Iron Man - more "ironing man", perhaps?

One of the most important days of each month is when the New Moon takes place. The New Moon is always about new beginnings, new strategies, new plans, and new ideas. What we will start during the New Moon, we will grow during the next month. The Moon is symbolically associated with our emotions, feelings, needs, subconscious, roots, habits, memories and dreams. However, each New Moon is part of a unique astrologic configuration. Then, this New Moon is in Gemini, which is an air, mutable sign, emphasizes the intellectual world, information, knowledge, communication and negotiation.
Despite other big configurations of the day, this New Moon semi-squares Venus and also sesquiquqdrates Pluto, symbolically emphasizing some minor tensions, fighting between our way of collaboration and our dark side of keeping things secrets. Hence, the day could open up some sort type of stress and feeling of frustration. Therefore, this New Moon will activate directly Venus and Pluto. But more than that, Venus and Pluto are already in a major hard aspect. Venus is at 19˚Aries and squares Pluto, which is at 19˚ Capricorn. This is the perfect orb, a time when a major conflict could arrive at a maximum point, involving our values and our mysterious world; our beautiful energy towards peace, harmony, diplomacy, and our dark secrets, what is behind the scenes. This could be the day or the time when a new intellectual strategy may take place.
At a personal level some relationships could be affected by some secrets that could be revealed during this day, one that could represent a new beginning, much more flexible in terms of affection. However, the New Moon shows a new beginning and if you have natal planets between 3˚ and 5˚ Gemini, or even 3˚and 5˚ opposite sign Sagittarius that you could bring new beginnings according to the house where this new moon will fall in your natal chart.
Wishing you all a very happy New Moon!
This week, Doom joined the first-ever class of the World Video Game Hall of Fame, and its reasons for being inducted now seem obvious in hindsight—particularly how the game table-flipped our expectations of things like 3D design and gun-wielding action. A few weeks before the game received that honor, game developer and educator Elizabeth LaPensée offered a less typical claim about what might have made the game so special at the time: its connection to Native American culture.
LaPensée counts Doom co-designer John Romero as a friend—along with his legendary game-designing wife, Brenda Romero—and she is intimately familiar with John's Cherokee and Yaqui heritage. As such, she brings up a topic game historians typically don't: “Something funny happened when John Romero became famous,” she said. “He became white.”
Doom's potential connections to Native culture go farther than that, though. “I have a theory,” LaPensée said from her home in Oregon. “John Romero broke ground with Doom, but what was it that he was doing? He was expanding dimensional space in that game.” The PhD graduate from Simon Fraser University, and her family, were familiar with concepts like dimensional space well before they could be related to the alternate realities of games like Doom. She talked about the teachings she drew upon as a member of the Anishinaabe and Métis communities—along with those of other communities she's encountered—and their commonalities.
“[Our communities] have always related in multiple dimensions,” she said. “I believe that influenced John's work and influenced games as a whole."
"I can't prove that!" she added.
Looking past Doom, LaPensée notes a new wave of Native games that are ready for their time in the spotlight. With the recent success of Never Alone, a game made by and about the Iñupiat peoples, a new spotlight is shining on Native cultures telling their stories through video games. As a result, LaPensée and the Romeros joined forces last month to host a gaming summit that didn't dwell on game design's past, but instead focused on efforts in, and possibilities of, modern Native design.
Far beyond Custer's Revenge
LaPensée helped organize the Natives In Game Dev Gathering, hosted by the University of California Santa Cruz in late May, in part because it spoke to how her cultural heritage was far more connected to the world of video games than outsiders might otherwise assume.
“Think about how space was represented [in Doom] and what made that game so interesting,” LaPensée said. “What created the impact. For us, time is not linear. It's actually space-time. They're connected. Really, our worldview has always been [similar to] Internet connections, about communicating from long distances. In our cultures, we've always had that technology.”
LaPensée spoke to Ars largely about the steps Native developers can take going forward to create and share new experiences, as opposed to addressing representations, both good and bad, that have appeared in older games. She had previously spoken at length at conferences and in blog posts about negative stereotypes, like those found in the sexually violent Custer's Revenge, along with triple-A games that have included better writing and consultation, like in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed III.
"At most [conferences], we're put in a position to say what [Native design] isn't, or what it is in comparison to other games," LaPensée said. "We're always pinned to talking about negative representations in games."
Instead, she said, the Natives in Game Dev Gathering was able to follow the success and strides of very recent efforts, particularly last year's Never Alone. Before starting the game, players are encouraged to watch a polished mini-documentary about the storytelling tradition of the Iñupiat peoples in Northern Alaska, narrated by members of the community—most of whom worked on or consulted for the game.
"We aren't a museum piece," one narrator in the game says, and the puzzle-platformer that follows is a reminder of that fact: Quite frankly, it's gorgeous stuff, full of lovely snow effects, superb visual cues, and smart co-op puzzle design that blends unique supernatural storytelling into the player's actions. This game, steeped in centuries of Native storytelling, also feels modern and fresh.
“We're already living in a post-apocalyptic reality”
Other speakers at the Natives in Game Dev Gathering, such as designer Renee Nejo, spoke to the specific empathy they hope to tap into via video games. Nejo's producing credits include the story-driven Ever, Jane and the space-puzzler Gravity Ghost. Her new game, Blood Quantum, is based on the issues surrounding United States' blood quantum laws.
At her Gathering lecture, she described a sense of cultural shame that developed, in part, because those laws meant she was not federally recognized as fully Native due to issues that amount to percentage points. Both the game's character-management system—which plays around with issues of bloodline purity—and the process of development have helped her overcome a cultural issue that she has struggled to talk about.
"I said things that for a long I was too scared to even realize, let alone talk about publicly," Nejo said about her Gathering lecture. "I met other Natives in games that are enthusiastic about sharing Native stories, and that kind of passion is hard to find in the games industry these days. I met Native devs that, when they found success, immediately sought out ways to share it with our kids."
LaPensée, herself a longtime educator, used the Gathering to advocate for more access and gaming education for Native youth across the United States. She mentioned stories about Romero's upbringing, in which he had to go to libraries and other public places to gain computer access, and over two decades later, she believes Native access to computers and high-speed Internet hasn't improved all that much.
"From where I'm living, I can't access Steam," LaPensée said. She stressed that if Native communities receive more access to game-design equipment and tools, the game industry will "get something back in return—the insights that we have in games and game design. We've been making games as a way to survive, thrive, play, and learn for centuries."
She also sees video games as a way to preserve dying Native languages, and not just in the form of things like translation patches for popular games that kids might be more likely to play through. "[In our languages], we don't just say ‘a box' or ‘a cup,'" LaPensée said. "Everything is relational. Where I'm headed is talking about indigenous game engines, where we build everything from the ground up. That's an idea for the future. Right now, we're just grateful for tools like Unity. But eventually, to portray our worldview, we're going to have to look from the code up."
For now, the future of Native game design is already benefiting heavily from increased access to free and low-cost engines and tools, and the Gathering ended with promises of Indigenous game jams and other collaborative efforts. Still, LaPensée believes Native design must be led by and for Native designers—as opposed to being co-opted by outsiders, as indie game designer Ben Esposito talked about when discussing a failed plan to include Hopi stories and imagery in his upcoming game Donut County. The Native games that come as a result, LaPensée says, may take longer to create, but they will come with a particularly unique vision that fits neatly into the gaming pantheon.
"The reality for us, something my mother passed on to me, this worldview, is that we're already living in a post-apocalyptic reality," LaPensée said. "It's not sci-fi to us. It already happened. Because of that, what are the stories we have to tell, the ways of life we have to show other people? We're doing more than surviving. We're continuing our traditions in ways that are malleable to the situations we're in now."
A Feathercoin meetup is being held in a pub in Oxford, England, this weekend, giving those interested in the digital currency the chance to meet the team behind it.
The event is taking place at The Oxford Blue on 20th July from 3:00pm. Among the attendees will be founder of Feathercoin Peter Bushnell, who worked as head of IT at Oxford University's Brasenose College for 10 years. He will lead an open discussion about digital currency and how it can benefit both consumers and merchants.
Chris Murray, owner of the Oxford Blue, said he's been “fascinated” with altcoins since he first learned about bitcoin back in 2010.
“I'm really looking forward to having a chance to meet with some of the people actually working on the framework of one of these currencies, and discussing the requirements of a small business end-user like myself in terms of being able to seamlessly take payments in altcoins,” he added.
Members of the Feathercoin forum have put a web-based payment system together for the event so attendees will be able to pay for their drinks using the cryptocurrency. To use the web app, staff members have to type in the amount of the bill and this will generate a QR code on the till.
“We have an open source point of sale system, which is a Java-based platform, so the Feathercoin team are going to look at giving us an option on the till that means you just hit a button and it will print out a bill with a QR code on it,” said Murray.
He went on to say that one of the things he would like to discuss at the meeting is the possibility of generating a label or ID for each transaction:
“If you have a busy bar where lots of people are paying in Feathercoin, how do you know the transaction that just arrived was from the person you're serving and not someone at the other end of the bar? A transaction ID would solve this problem.”
Murray said one of the reasons he's interested in accepting digital currency is because he's fed up of the “ridiculous” amount he is charged each month to accept payment by card.
“Payment process fees are up to 2% on some transactions and the card terminals cost about £20-£30 per month too. On top of this, it takes three days for the payment processors to actually send us the money, so not only do they charge you a large fee, they then just sit on your money.”
The owner said his pub has a mixed clientele, including some regular locals and students as well as those just visiting the city. He believes there could be quite a few students in the city who are involved in digital currency and mining – especially those who live in halls and do not have to pay their own electricity bills.
“I was trying to work out the figures the other day and I think, with a normal graphics card, you can currently mine the equivalent of two pints a week. Which is obviously quite appealing to students!” He added.
Those intending to attend the event are encouraged to RSVP on the Feathercoin events page.

Spanish train manufacturer Talgo will reopen their facility in the Century City business park. The news was announced by Mayor Tom Barrett during his 2017 budget address before the Common Council. The facility at 3533 N. 27th St. has most recently been used by crews assembling the glass curtain wall for the Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons, but Talgo has maintained a lease on a 25,000 square-foot section of the building for storage. As part of the deal, Talgo will expand their operations in the building and create dozens of jobs at the facility.
Talgo will be rebuilding 74 heavy rail cars for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro). The $73 million, 56-month contract will overhaul vehicles originally placed into service in the early 1990's. The cars were originally manufactured by the now-defunct Italian firm Breda.
The cars are in use on the busiest lines in the Los Angeles subway system, running on the Red and Purple lines that serve a combined 149,096 daily rides. That total is greater than the daily ridership of the entire Milwaukee County Transit System. Service began on the lines in 1993.
Mayor Barrett has been actively involved in trying to bring Talgo back to Milwaukee, including meeting with the evaluation team from LA Metro when they did a site visit. Barrett slammed Governor Scott Walker during his budget address, noting “As hard as the governor worked to kill this project, we worked even harder to build a solid relationship with the company. And that paid off.” Talgo hopes to expand their portfolio of business in the United States to include work on subway and light rail vehicles, expanding beyond their intercity rail offerings.
Talgo CEOsaid “with this opportunity we show LACMTA that our knowledge and experience in the sector make Talgo the perfect choice to improve the performance of trains serving in the railway network of the city,” in a press release posted on the firm's Spanish language website.
Talgo had manufactured four of their Series 8 trainsets at Century City. Two of those Milwaukee-made trains are now in service with Amtrak's Cascades Service, running between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada with stops along the way including Portland and Seattle. The other pair, originally intended to operate on the Amtrak Hiwatha Service between Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison will finally enter service in California. The company employed more than 80 people in Milwaukee to build the trainsets.
The move comes as a surprise, given that the Talgo CEO blasted Walker in a 2012 a story by Urban Milwaukee, complaining that “Gov. Walker does not keep his word. It's like we're talking about a Third World country, where people don't have respect for their contracts.” The state and Talgo finally settled a lawsuit in 2015, with the state paying an additional $9.7 milion to Talgo for the trainsets. In total, the state will have paid nearly $50 million for trains that it never owned.
As part of the settlement, Talgo maintains ownership of the trainsets and can sell them to another buyer. If Talgo were to sell the trains, 30% of the net proceeds from a future sale are required to be returned to Wisconsin (up to $9.7 million). Wisconsin had originally agreed to buy the trainsets in 2009 for $47.5 million as part of Governor Jim Doyle‘s jockeying to win a high speed rail grant. Doyle's bet did pay off, Wisconsin won a $810 million high-speed rail grant to connect Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison, but the funds were revoked by the federal government after Walker was elected and promised to end the project.
Talgo has yet to sell the trainsets, and instead leased them to a California transportation agency in August on a five-year deal for $15 million. They will operate on the 351-mile rail corridor between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo, offering a travel time reduction of 25 minutes. The trains will be operated by the Los Angeles – San Diego – San Luis Obispo (LOSSAN) Rail Corridor Agency. LOSSAN received an $82 million grant from the state of California for improvements to the corridor. The LOSSAN corridor provides 7.2 million annual rides on over 150 daily passenger trains including Amtrak Pacific Surfliner intercity service and Metrolink and COASTER commuter trains.
The facility Talgo will operate in is owned by the city-affiliated Century City Redevelopment Corporation. The REV Group, led by Tim Sullivan, will soon begin manufacturing a prototype “Liberty” vehicle for the United States Postal Service in the building and hopes to win a contract that would create about 1,000 jobs at Century City to build the vehicles. REV Group is competing against five other bidders. The winner is expected to be announced in 2018.
Talgo Trainsets
As our photos capture, the original trainsets for Wisconsin were removed from the Milwaukee facility in 2014. Before the lease to California, they had been in storage at Amtrak's Beech Grove, Indiana facility. It was previously believed that Michigan may purchase the trainsets, but that deal never came to fruition.

The personal letters of Indian Muslim soldiers who fought in World War I writing about Britain have been revealed for the first time.
The newly discovered letters, dating back to over 100 years ago, shine a light on the experience of Indian soldiers who share their impressions of Britain in comparison to their home country.
At least 885,000 Muslims were recruited by the allies, including from India and North Africa, according to Dr Islam Issa, lecturer in English Literature at Birmingham City University, who has been trawling through thousands of personal letters, historic archives, regimental diaries and census reports.
One fifth of British Empire recruits of the war were of Islamic faith, with at least 89,000 Muslims recorded as having lost their lives for Britain.
In a letter penned by soldier A. Ali dated October 1915, he writes about a range of experiences – from visiting London department stores and using the London Underground.
Ali writes in his observation about the police:
The police indeed deserve praise. If one policeman raises his hand every single person in that direction rich and poor alike, stands still where he is as long as his hand is raised.
On his trip to a London department store, A. Ali writes:
We visited a shop where 2,000 men and women were working and everything can be bought. There is no need of asking as the price is written on everything.”
In the same letter, he goes onto share his experience of the London Underground, writing:
Then we went in the train that goes under the earth, it was for us a strange and wonderful experience – they call it the underground train.
In a letter from another soldier Abdul Said, also dated from 1914, the Indian soldier's opinions on shopping and British butchers are shared.
Every shop in this country is so arranged that one is delighted to look at them. Whether you buy much or little it is properly wrapped up, and if you tell the shop man to send it to your house you have only to give him your address and he delivers it.
Said goes onto note his thoughts on butchers and the difference between the shops in Britain and India, writing:
The butcher's shops in Hindustan are very dirty, but here they are so clean and tidy that there is absolutely no smell.
Responding to the new findings, Dr Issa said: “When I decided to look at soldiers' letters, I expected a very bleak outlook on the war. Of course, sometimes, that's exactly what I found. But quite often, the letters were about individual experiences and very normal, human things."
Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass sums up the Obama administration's Syria policy and handling of chemical weapons in an appearance on Monday's edition of Morning Joe.
"History is going to be rough on this," Haass said. "This going to be the defining moment for Obama presidency."
RICHARD HAASS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: There was a sense that the Obama presidency was a bit of paralysis by analysis. And in some instances there was such a tight center, it was the president, Ben Rhodes and a few others who then afterwards tried to make a case that what they did was a solution to the chemical problem in Syria when everybody knows it wasn't. No, history is going to be rough on this. This going to be the defining moment for Obama presidency.
What is so interesting about it is it's going to be a moment of inaction, and it proves the point that what you don't do can matter every bit as much what you do when you govern. And I think all these people, one disagreed at the time, they were probably thinking about their futures, but essentially it showed also that President Obama was something of a departure from the Democratic foreign policy national security mainstream, which are tougher.

Stat Wipe clarification:
A: Stats are Kills, Deaths, Wins, Losses, Accuracy, etc. No MC, XP, CB will be removed or reset. This is in preparation for the addition of Achievements. This is also not final, but a thought. We may move to a seasonal concept, similar to other F2P products. No final decisions have been made.
Customization related:
A: Interesting idea, anything is possible.A: We have started to increase the number of sale events to help encourage players to make that first purchase. So far all of our recent events have been huge hits.A: No plans to allow changes here. The hardpoints are an important part of balancing out each variant.A: We plan to introduce 1 basic and 1 Phranken style pattern per month, starting in February.A: Yes.A: Neat idea. No promises.A: Yes, and it will cost MC to change.A: Yes, with UI 2.0. No firm ETA, it's in the works.A: Yes, with UI 2.0. No firm ETA, it's in the works.A: They use a custom geometry, and like Hero Mechs are designed to be recognizable on the battlefield. We are looking into the merits of allowing this customization. Stay tuned.A: At this point we are not ready to discuss Clan Technology. We are getting very close to a final design, so look forward to a more official announcement in April/May.A: Yes, but it's very low priority at the moment.
Console:
A: David Bradley is working on a concept, expect a Command Chair post when the design is ready.A: David Bradley is working on a concept, expect a Command Chair post when the design is ready.
Mechlab:
A: This has been partially addressed in the February 19patch.A: No plans.
Graphics
A: We continually expose more variables for players to tune. Depth of field is an aspect of gameplay, as it affects player vision. We are reviewing the gameplay impact, and may add the option to tune it.A: There is a CryEngine bug associate with this feature, expect to see it fixed in the future.A: I answered no in the last QNA, but this has been brought up numerous times, so maybe.
Weapon Related:
A: Not at this moment.A: Possibly, we have a design for it.A: Tuning is ongoing, expect some changes in the next 2-3 patches.A: Done.A: Yes. Thanks to Sean.A: Yes, in the future, provide it's available in the timeline.A: Melee is something we want to do… however making it fun, and practical, isn't so easy.A: Yes.A: It has been discussed, no plans yet.A: We plan to add this with UI 2.0.A: We have tuned the crit HP to make it more vulnerable.
Joystick:
A: Yes, no ETA.- What news, Any news, can you convey regarding native Joystick/Controller support?A: Ongoing improvements will come online in the next few months. Nothing firm yet.A: No updates, we are currently deciding the feasibility of the controller.
Maps related:
A: Yes, this is coming.A: No plans at this time.A: The content was created in a different engine, a lot has changed since then, including the design of the game. We plan to add more city levels, now that we have the assets available to us.A: Volcano, Canyons, and Moonscape are up next after Alpine and Desert. This gives us a full suite of art assets to play with and create dozens of combinations .Yes!A: Due to the complexity of designing maps, including the performance and balance requirements, we do not plan support user made levels. We are working towards more alien looking worlds with the upcoming new maps. At this time we are not able to discuss the details of CW, however, we are being very careful about player-to-player transfers, as it opens up the game to farming and cheating.
‘Mech related:
A: Yes. Very much so. There will be collector achievements, along with the need to own multiple configurations of Mechs for DropShip modes.A: We are currently working on implementing the quirks of each variant. These quirks are little stat boosts and nerfs applied to a variant of a Mech. This is meant to both balance different variants of the same chassis, and balance them when compared to all of the other chassis. Newly created Mechs will receive these quirks as they're released, and we hope to implement them on one or two older chassis per patch. [David]A: The first part of the question would require a more lengthy response from David Bradley, I will ask him to make a post. As for the second part, yes, we plan to add variants to existing Mechs.Note from David: Definitely something that I can do but, yes, it would require a somewhat lengthy response.A: It's still under consideration, not plans or ETA.A: I can't comment on Unseen/Reseen. Very sorry.A: I do not view them as P2W, as they do not create a way to circumvent skill as the primary attribute for success.A: We plan to give Pilot and Mech Trees an overhaul in the near future (late spring/summer).A: If a Mech calls for it, then yes.A: I hope so. So many mechs, to many choices… aaaaaahhhh.A: We plan a full range of Hero Mechs for most mech types.A: No plans to at this time. However, each of these systems is always undergoing tweaks, and we may see something like this in the future.
Matchmaking:
A: No plans to make ECM part of the matchmaker. As with all game systems, we continually adjust, tune, add new counters. Both the Feb 5and 19patch contain ECM tweaks and counters. Check out the patch notes for more details.
Repair and Ream:
No plans to bring back RNR. RNR was removed to create a balanced economy. In the end it created more problems than solved, and was essentially a tax. The system was prone to abuse by farmers and active players. The decision was made to protect the integrity of the game at the cost of removing a feature most people did not use (based on telemetry).
Servers:
A: Each region is having its own database and unique user names. Regions do not play with or against each other.A: I do not have a timeline for Asia yet. When we do, expect an announcement.A: None at the moment. If we did add more servers, they would likely be on the west coast.A: We are reviewing this.A: No yet.A: Our goal would be to offer a onetime transfer option. Regions will have their own servers and unique accounts.
Miscenalleous:
A: Yes. This is working, but waiting on some fixes to the netcode.A: No plans. We are looking at other ways for the community to participate however.A: Anything is possible!A: Yes. When stats are nearing integration, expect a Command Chair post with all the details.A: It will be turned on shortly.A: We're tracking better now. We had some unexpected delays when we went to OB, it was an adjustment managing Live Ops and Feature development. That hump is over, and we can plan and deliver with much more accuracy and predictability. This makes me a happy panda.A: The engineers are working on a fix.A: It's possible down the road, no promises though.A: It's coming in the next few patches. Sean Kolton.A: PVE has been talked about, no plans to develop or release anytime soon. We plan to add an offline Testing Grounds in March.A: No plans in the near future.A: I'm sure you will see a bunch of devs online over time.A: Plans are to be at PAX East (panel talk) and GDC (career both). We're working on some more formal events as well.A: It's in design and should be coming online May/June.A: 3ds Max, Mudbox, ZBrush.
Website:
A: Yes. We are adding more details in the coming weeks and months, the work is well underway.
Mash-up questions from Blade Pride:
A: MaybeA: No plans at this time.A: Maybe.A: Yes.A: No plans at this time. Reconnect is under review.A: No. Maybe. There's a technical reason for not allowing it. Trees are not replicated across the network. (client side only)A: Most likely.A: Yes.A: Not to start.A: We will see in a few weeks, but yes, all tests point to improvements. Only 10-15% of all matches end in a lopsided loss/win.A: No plans/Maybe.A: Eventually there will be a battle log, so yes.A: Millions.
Mash-up questions from jay35:
A: Maybe.A: Yes.A: Yes.A: Yes. Like 12v12, this feature is heavily dependent on network performance, and requires engineering work.A: Something similar, yes.
Aidy White: Could be set to sign a new deal with Leeds despite his injury
Leeds wideman Aidy White could be out for the rest of the season - but is set to be rewarded with a new contract at the club.
The 20-year-old youth team product was forced off just before half-time in Saturday's home defeat to Watford and left Elland Road on crutches.
But Leeds fans are unlikely to have seen the last of White. After rejecting a contract offer from the club in December, new boss Neil Warnock is confident the youngster will be signing a new deal shortly.
Warnock said: "We're finalising a contract offer that we should be getting to him in seven days I think."
White had previously been utilised at left-back before Warnock decided to play the Republic of Ireland Under-21 international further forward.
But Leeds will have to find a new solution on the left flank with White set to miss the remainder of the campaign.
Warnock added: "There's no break in it, that's the good thing, but I'd be very surprised if he plays again this season and it's a shame because he's done very well."
Text Analysis,Crawling and Interpretation Tool
Text analysis has become increasingly important for psychological research, and measuring psychological and demographic properties using computational text analysis is slowly becoming a field norm.
Though several limited-method tools for text analysis are already available (e.g. LIWC), and some have become part of standard statistical packages (e.g., SPSS Text Analytics), a unified, open-source architecture for gathering, managing and analyzing text does not exist.
The Computational Social Science Lab (CSSL) at the University of Southern California introduces TACIT: An Open-Source Text Analysis, Crawling and Interpretation Tool.
TACIT's plugin architecture has three main components:
Crawling plugins, for automated text collection from online sources (e.g., US Senate and Supreme Court speech transcriptions, Twitter, Reddit)
Analysis plugins, including LIWC-type word count, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, clustering and classification.
Corpus management, for applying standard text preprocessing to prepare and store corpora.
TACIT's open-source plugin platform allows the architecture to easily adapt to today's rapid developments in text analysis.

Commission: EU Too White, Mass Third World Migration Must Be ‘New Norm'
The mental patients are running the asylum!
Brussels has said that Europeans must accept mass migration from the third world as the “new norm”, warning that neither walls nor policies will allow any part of the EU to remain “homogenous and migration-free”.
“It's time to face the truth. We cannot and will never be able to stop migration,” writes EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos, in a piece for POLITICO, published Monday entitled, “Europe's Migrants Are Here to Stay”.
In it, the Eurocrat wrote “human mobility will increasingly define the 21st century”, and that mass migration is an issue Brussels has committed Europe to “for the long haul”, stating: “Migration is deeply intertwined with our policies on economics, trade, education and employment — to name just a few.”
Brussels is opening legal pathways for migrants “who want to come” says European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, declaring that Europe has a “clear need” for mass migration from Africa.
Pointing to migrants from the world's poorest countries who were granted refugee status in Europe, Avramopoulos made clear that Brussels sees asylum not as a way to offer temporary respite from war but instead as another method of permanently transplanting third world populations into EU nations.
“They have found safety in Europe, but we also need to make sure they find a home,” he writes of refugees, going on to insist that programming Europeans to welcome mass migration is “not only a moral imperative”, but “also an economic and social imperative for our aging continent — and one of the biggest challenges for the near future”.
To this end, the Commission is working to “enhance legal channels for economic migration with a more ambitious Blue Card for highly skilled workers and kick-start targeted labour migration pilot projects in key third countries”, he notes.
Whilst Brussels claims that the Blue Card will bring “highly-skilled workers” to Europe, Breitbart London reported last year that revisions to the scheme clearly contradict this, stating that it would be necessary to provide newcomers with education, employment, and vocational training.
Noting that people from non-European backgrounds living in Europe are much more likely to be unemployed or on low wages, the Commission even stressed that “integration measures” would be necessary for hosting the arrivals they claim are essential to the continent's economies.
In the piece, the Greek politician also praised a series of POLITICO articles which accuse the EU of being “too white”, in which the bloc was urged to bring in measures which would encourage replacing native Europeans with “people of colour” in Brussels jobs.
But this, the migration commissioner said, is “not nearly enough to prompt the changes that our societies need to be ready for the realities of the 21st century”.
Avramopoulos, who last week shot down Council of Europe chief Donald Tusk's suggestion to scrap the controversial migrant quota scheme forcing third world migrants on unwilling nations as “anti-European”, went on to make clear he believes that no corner of the EU can be exempt from mass migration.
“It is naïve to think that our societies will remain homogenous and migration-free if one erects fences,” he thunders, in a paragraph clearly aiming at nations in Central Europe, where leaders have fought against the imposition of third world migration.
“It is unwise to think that migration will remain on the other side of the Mediterranean, if one only shows solidarity in financial terms,” he continues. “It is foolish to think that migration will disappear if one adopts harsh language.”
“At the end of the day, we all need to be ready to accept migration, mobility and diversity as the new norm and tailor our policies accordingly.
“The only way to make our asylum and migration policies future-proof, is to collectively change our way of thinking first,” the migration commissioner concludes.
I thinks we must collectively remove the unelected, genocidal social engineers in Brussels to safe Western civilisation from African savages and 1000 years of dark ages. This is no longer a matter of choice, its a sacred obligation.
It sounded like an impossible dream. But the women and men, mostly Latino and African-American, who filled a Los Angeles basement meeting room at a union headquarters weren't dreamers. They were practical working people who struggle every day to pay bills and educate their kids.
They were members of California Calls, a coalition of community organizations working on issues ranging from improving schools to stopping home foreclosures. This particular session, lasting most of a recent Saturday, was designed to train people to campaign for California Gov. Jerry Brown's tax increase to provide financing for strapped public elementary and high schools and community colleges. But more than organizing for the tax increase, the meeting provided an illuminating look into the future of progressive politics — a future more focused on improving the day-to-day lives of working people and less on frequently attacking a progressive ally, President Barack Obama.
Bobbi Murray, a journalist and activist, had alerted me to the meeting. I met her 20 years ago when she and a colleague, Sharon Delugach, were working in a rag-tag narrow storefront office in South Central Los Angeles organizing an effort to get out the vote for progressive causes. As I settled into a chair for the interview on that long-ago day, Delugach warned me about a broken spring — too late. The headquarters is gone as is the chair, but 20 years later, Murray is still at it. “That little precinct operation is all grown up — really, really grown up — into a statewide outfit,” she wrote me in an email.
While the ballot measure campaigns are important, Murray said the long-range goal of California Calls is “to shift California's voter demographics away from a conservative-leaning older white majority like those who supported Prop 187 [an anti-immigrant measure that passed in 1994] and kill tax initiatives and toward a younger voter base that includes people of color in proportion to their numbers in the state.”
Accomplishing this is probably easier than it was 20 years ago, but still difficult. The minority population has increased since then. Latinos now make up 38 percent of California's population, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, but are only 16 percent of likely voters. African-Americans, 6 percent of the population, turn out to vote in numbers reflective of their population. Asian-Americans, 13 percent of the population, don't quite match African-American turnout. Non-Hispanic whites now number 40 percent of the population and account for 66 percent of the vote.
Those at the meeting were focused on matters that could improve their lives. The Brown tax increase proposal is designed to help accomplish that by improving the financial health of public schools and community colleges that have provided a historic path into the middle class and beyond. The plan would raise statewide sales taxes by a quarter of a cent and add a surcharge to income taxes of those earning more than $250,000 a year. The income tax surcharge would expire after seven years, the sales tax increase after four.
The campaigners know their job won't be easy, especially in the state that gave birth to the tax-limiting Proposition 13 in 1978 and the nationwide anti-tax movement.
“A lot of people don't pay attention to the propositions, a lot of people don't vote, a lot of people aren't eligible,” said Natalie Demus, an African-American woman from Los Angeles. Demus has long been active in the Community Coalition, a South L.A. group in which African-Americans and Latinos fight for better schools and against substance abuse, among other causes. “We're trying to organize in a way to influence the greatest number of people,” she told me.
California Calls drops the rage that sparked earlier campaigns to focus on hope, a message that clearly appeals to upward-striving working people.
Sabrina Smith, deputy director of California Calls, said the campaign seeks to evoke a sense of California before the anti-tax movement when the state had great public universities, community colleges and a public school system that ranked high in national standings. “We are talking about hope, dreams, what people care about,” she said. The theme is: “Together we can restore the California dream.”
The dream was expressed by people at the meeting, particularly one young African-American woman who talked about the struggles she has had to get an education. It was a success story about how her mom got her going. Heads nodded in appreciation throughout the room.
I came away from the meeting with two thoughts.
I was impressed by the participants' focus on practical solutions. The emphasis on practicality may be a national phenomenon. Roads upward are being closed as public schools are starved financially and classes are shut down in community colleges and public universities, where tuition is rising. This focus on solutions, and his detailed analysis of our problems, was why former President Bill Clinton's speech to the Democratic National Convention was so well-received. And why President Obama, who was more vague, got a chillier reception.
I was also struck by what the meeting meant to the future of the progressive movement, especially the relationship of Obama critics to Latinos and African-Americans, who overwhelmingly support the president.
This was the point of an essay “Saving Obama, Saving Ourselves,” by one of the foremost leaders of the old left, Tom Hayden. The essay was published on his Peace and Justice Resource Center website.
“Why Obama's achievements are dismissed or denied by many on the white liberal-left is a question worth serious consideration,” Hayden wrote. He said it could be post-2008 disappointment. Possibly, he wrote, it “could be pure antipathy to electoral politics” and a feeling that it is impossible to change established institutions. Or maybe the liberal left feels there is no difference between Democrats and Republicans.
“Or,” he wrote, “It could even be a white blindness in perceptions of reality on the left. When African American voters favor Obama 94-0 and the attacks are coming from the white liberal-left, something needs repair in the foundations of American radicalism.”
I saw real energy among the men and women at the California Calls meeting, all of them eager to spend a sunny Saturday in the basement of a union headquarters. Their reality is life — schools, kids, homes. Although I doubt if many would consider themselves radicals, they are the new and growing foundation of progressive politics.
Black Bow Records has officially announced September 1 as the date they will digitally reissue the back catalog of Texas doom/noise practitioners Crawl. The band's Bandcamp page might look a little lonely in preparation for these reissues but lucky for us all, today, we have a stream for “I” from their latest album This Sad Cadav'r. Head inside for more info and a stream of this track.
This is not happy music by any stretch of the imagination. It's acidic doom slowed to uncomfortable beats per minute and noise abrasive enough to peel the paint off a torture rack. The feeling encountered here is that of looking into the eyes of a serial killer and seeing absolutely nothing — no feeling, no remorse, nothing — but the desire to hurt and maim at will. No hope or light emits from this despondent recording, instead it shoots for the part of the brain that feels loss, sadness and utter devastation. Check it out for yourself immediately below.
Like I said, this isn't party music or dancing music but you didn't come here for that anyway. For the ensconced listener that is looking for utter depravity set to music there is much to discover here. With that said, make sure you check out this release, as well as more of the band's back catalog September 1 on Black Bow Records. Keep up with all things Crawl on their Facebook page.
What's the Matter With Democrats?
Ever since Thomas Frank published his book “What's the Matter With Kansas?” Democrats have sought a political strategy to match the GOP's. The health care bill proves they've found one.
Whereas Frank highlighted Republicans' sleight-of-hand success portraying millionaire tax cuts as gifts to the working class, Democrats are now preposterously selling giveaways to insurance and pharmaceutical executives as a middle-class agenda. Same formula, same fat-cat beneficiaries, same bleating sheeple herded to the slaughterhouse. The only difference is the Rube Goldberg contraption that Democrats are using to tend the flock.
First, their leaders campaign on pledges to create a government insurer (a “public option”) that will compete with private health corporations. Once elected, though, Democrats propose simply subsidizing those corporations, which are (not coincidentally) filling Democratic coffers. Justifying the reversal, Democrats claim the subsidies will at least help some citizens try to afford the private insurance they'll be forced to buy — all while insisting Congress suddenly lacks the votes for a public option.
Despite lawmakers' refusal to hold votes verifying that assertion, liberal groups obediently follow orders to back the bill, their obsequious leaders fearing scorn from Democratic insiders and moneymen. Specifically, MoveOn, unions and “progressive” nonprofits threaten retribution against lawmakers who consider voting against the bill because it doesn't include a public option. The threats fly even though these congresspeople would be respecting their previous public-option ultimatums — ultimatums originally supported by many of the same groups now demanding retreat.
Soon it's on to false choices. Democrats tell their base that any bill is better than no bill, even one making things worse, and that if this particular legislation doesn't pass, Republicans will win the upcoming election — as if signing a blank check to insurance and drug companies couldn't seal that fate. They tell everyone else that “realistically” this is the “last chance” for reform, expecting We the Sheeple to forget that those spewing the do-or-die warnings control the legislative calendar and could immediately try again.
Predictably, the fear-mongering prompts left-leaning Establishment pundits to bless the bill, giving Democratic activists concise-yet-mindless conversation-enders for why everyone should shut up and fall in line (“Krugman supports it!”). Such bumper-sticker mottoes are then demagogued by Democratic media bobbleheads and their sycophants, who dishonestly imply that the bill's progressive opponents (1) secretly aim to aid the far right and/or (2) actually hope more Americans die for lack of health care. In the process, the legislation's sellouts are lambasted as the exclusive fault of Republicans, not Democrats and their congressional majorities.
Earth sufficiently scorched, President Obama then barnstorms the country, calling the bill a victory for “ordinary working folks” over the same corporations he is privately promising to enrich. The insurance industry, of course, airs token ads to buttress Obama's “victory” charade — at the same time its lobbyists are, according to Politico, celebrating with chants of “We win!”
By design, pro-public-option outfits like Firedoglake and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee end up depicted as voices of the minority, even as they champion an initiative that polls show the majority of voters supports. Meanwhile, telling questions hang: If this represents victory over special interests, why is Politico reporting that “drug industry lobbyists have huddled with Democratic staffers” to help pass the bill? How is the legislation a first step to reform, as proponents argue, if it financially and politically strengthens insurance and drug companies opposing true change? And what prevents those companies from continuing to increase prices?
These queries go unaddressed — and often unasked. Why? Because their answers threaten to expose the robbery in progress, circumvent the “What's the Matter With Kansas?” contemplation and raise the most uncomfortable question of all:
What's the matter with Democrats?

A DEVASTATING bomb attack in the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, has killed at least 80 people and left nearly 400 injured, and given that only the first sentence of an article shows up in the preview window on Facebook, it's entirely likely that nobody is reading this bit here.
The deadly blast, which exploded in the diplomatic district of the city, has been widely wait a second, why waste any more time writing about something that nobody west of Qatar will give a monkey about?
In fact, if we just hit the word limit on this article, our editor will be happy enough that the columns got filled and nobody will ever check to see what was written.
Ducks are generally monogamous, although these bonds usually last only a single year. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons).
Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. Mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease.
We just copied that from the Wikipedia entry talking about the breeding habits of ducks.
Right, that's us done. Get the photo lad to stick an image at the top… it doesn't even have to be Kabul, nobody is going to check. Early lunch time!
Bayonetta 2's “Over-Sexualization” Complaint: A Perfect Example of What's Wrong with Modern Reviews
Giuseppe Nelva October 14, 2014 6:19:30 PM EST
Yesterday the first reviews for the Wii U exclusive Bayonetta 2 were published, and most were extremely positive, with Platinum Games' latest labor of love soaring with an extremely flattering 91 on Metacritic. Yet, among all the joy for a game that really makes Nintendo's home console shine, also bringing something radically different from the usual Mario's and Zelda's, there was a discordant voice.
Polygon published a frankly depressing review in which the author praised the gameplay profusely, only to drop the axe and dock points due to the “blatant over-sexualization” included in the game.
When Platinum Games is on, it's really, really on, and Bayonetta 2 is in almost any respect that counts a better game than the first, whose mechanics were already exemplary. But every time I'd feel on a roll, enjoying my time with Bayonetta 2 immensely, I'd be broken out of it by another cheap shot of T&A. I would be wrecking a flock of angelic or demonic enemies, sliding in and out of witch time almost at will, and then the special weapon I had picked up became a literal stripper pole for Bayonetta to dance on, because … well, because, I guess. I won't guess why the blatant over-sexualization is still there, often more intensely than before. But it causes an otherwise great game to require a much bigger mental compromise to enjoy.
I spent a good while conflicted on whether to write about this or to just elect not to touch this crap with a ten foot pole, but, in the end, I decided to commit my thoughts to virtual ink, as it represents a much bigger and widespread problem, and something needs to be said.
I won't spend a lot paragraphs defending Bayonetta 2‘s sexy imagery, because to be completely honest, it doesn't need to be defended. It's part of the character and of the franchise. It's expressed with joy and irreverent strength in a positive celebration of beauty and allure, and demanding or expecting a Bayonetta without it makes as much sense as wanting Call of Duty without guns (with the difference that those that criticize sexual imagery in games tend to have absolutely no problem with violence and assorted slaughter).
The problem is deeper and is starting to take deep roots in modern reviews. Authors are departing from the idea of giving their readers a fair assessment of a game's quality, and are increasingly using reviews as their personal soapbox, or as a high horse on which to sit to educate the allegedly unschooled gaming masses on whatever personal agenda they happen to support, and to “punish” this game developer that happen to produce games that don't fit said agendas.
I used the word “fair” on purpose. Fully objective reviews are not of this world, and expecting one is exactly like expecting a Bayonetta game without lovely curves on abundant display, but “fair” reviews are definitely something we should expect and strive for.
What should be reflected, first and foremost, in a review's content and in its score is the game's quality, and while several aspects of “quality” are subjective, there are also many that aren't. Production values are an example: graphics, animation, audio, textures, effects; Those are objective aspects of a game's value that should not be overlooked. Lately, on the other hand, you see reviewers completely ignoring them in favor of their personal gut feeling, which often has very little to do with the game.
When you see games with extremely high production values like Destiny being slapped with a 4 or a 5, it's obvious that the reviewer is completely ignoring the objectively positive aspects of the title, and is replacing them with spite and misinformation in order to punish the developer for having released something that didn't match his personal expectations.
And this is ultimately what we're talking about: the purpose of a review is to inform the reader on the game's quality. It's not to school gamers on what kind of imagery they are entitled to enjoy without “mental compromises,” nor to punish developers that happen not to agree with our moral, social, political or aesthetic standards.
Scoring a game lower (and possibly much lower) due to a very personal agenda is nothing short of misinformation, as it blatantly misrepresents the quality of a game, and ultimately does a disservice to the many readers that don't happen to match the reviewer's personal hurt feelings.
This doesn't mean that a reviewer can't mention his personal problems related to a game, but this kind of thing definitely should not reflect in the final judgement, as it simply has nothing to do with the game's real value as an entertainment product.
There are plenty journalistic tools to express displeasure for an element introduced in a game without marring a review with evident bias that goes much beyond the natural departure from objectivity characterizing any and every human being. That's why we're allowed to write editorials, in which we can rage and shake our angry fists against Bayonetta and her curvaceous graces to our hearts' content.
This is even more problematic when the one writing the review is a site's Reviews Editor, responsible not only for the content of all the reviews churned out by that outlet, but also for assigning said reviews to the staff.
Logic would dictate to avoid assigning a review to someone who has strong personal and preconceived feelings against a relevant element of a game, as the conflict of interests between writing a fair review and jumping on that gilded soapbox is evident. A Reviews Editor is supposed to know how he feels, and I don't believe for a moment that anyone working in even the most remote outskirts of this industry may not be aware well in advance about Bayonetta 2‘s sexual content.
This means that Polygon's Reviews Editor knowingly and probably intentionally approached Bayonetta 2‘s review to give Platinum Games a rap on the knuckles for daring to depict their protagonist in a sexually charged way, which is something I can't consider acceptable.
Polygon and its Reviews Editor definitely aren't alone in this saddening trend. Many are steering away from pure gaming coverage and moving towards pursuing broader goals, that not always fit with safeguarding diversity and fun in gaming.
Unfortunately, the idea of diversity many seem to share is: “diversity is awesome, as long as it fits my taste and ideas.”
Personally, I'm all for diversity, and I pride myself in writing for one of those sites that has always sported an extremely diverse mix of colors, genders, ideas and tastes. It saddens me that between the many calls for diversity we've seen lately, some actually fly in the face of diversity itself by implying that games that celebrate sexuality and beauty like Bayonetta 2 should not exist or are not worth playing and enjoying.
Humanity already went through dark and oppressive periods in which sexuality was seen as evil and sinful, and honestly we don't need another. Games have fought for decades against censorship and fanatics like Jack Thompson, and we definitely don't need more coming from our own midst (even if saying that some journalists come from “our own midst” does require a rather big “mental compromise” I guess).
Championing diversity should involve pushing for more and more diverse games to be made by more and more diverse people and cultures (and this includes Bayonetta 2‘s own Japanese culture, that many seem to enjoy reviling), not for the elimination of those games and styles that don't fit our ideas and morals.
Marring our reviews with our personal agendas against this or that game which we deem offensive to our personal sensibility goes against what we've always fought for, and I find it appalling.
When a game is “great,” it's great. Period. Worry about your “mental compromises” on your own time.

The increase in high-precision, high-sample-rate telemetry timeseries poses a problem for existing timeseries databases which can neither cope with the throughput demands of these streams nor provide the necessary primitives for effective analysis of them. We present a novel abstraction for telemetry timeseries data and a data structure for providing this abstraction: a time-partitioning version-annotated copy-on-write tree. An implementation in Go is shown to outperform existing solutions, demonstrating a throughput of 53 million inserted values per second and 119 million queried values per second on a four-node cluster. The system achieves a 2.9x compression ratio and satisfies statistical queries spanning a year of data in under 200ms, as demonstrated on a year-long production deployment storing 2.1 trillion data points. The principles and design of this database are generally applicable to a large variety of timeseries types and represent a significant advance in the development of technology for the Internet of Things.
NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday used a 2002 letter written by then Opposition leader of the Rajya Sabha Manmohan Singh to blunt Congress' charge that the then NDA government had travelled some distance on allowing FDI in retail trade.BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who rejected Congress' claim that the then government led by BJP had attempted to change the retail policy, said Manmohan Singh had amplified NDA's line against allowing FDI in retail.In a letter to the chairman of a Mumbai-based trade body on December 21, 2002, Singh had said that the issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha on December 19. “The finance minister gave an assurance that the government had no proposal to invite FDI in retail trade,” Singh had said in his letter.Jaitley also used speeches Kamal Nath and the then chief whip of Congress PR Dasmunsi to drive home his party's point that the charge of opportunism on retail trade should be directed at the ruling side. In a speech in the Lok Sabha on December 16, 2001, Dasmunsi had said that any proposal to allow FDI in retail would be an “anti-national” step.“The retail sector in India is dispersed, unorganised and labour intensive. It is not desirable to lift the ban on FDI in retail trade,” Dasmunsi had said. The BJP leader said his party's opposition to retail FDI has been prompted by its concern for the domestic manufacturing sector.“Our manufacturing sector, at best, is modest. International investors will source internationally and most merchandise sold in the first instance would be sourced from the low-cost economies of the world. It will be ill-advised to open the sector till such times we can implement effective reforms to reduce the cost of our own manufacturing by introducing steps such as affordable interest rates, better infrastructure, better trade facilitation and low cost of power,” he said.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A growing trend of people snorting chocolate could cause serious harm to their health.
First, there was Four Loko — an alcoholic energy drink that some kids just had to get their hands on — then there was the fire challenge, where young people across the country poured flammable liquid on their bodies before setting themselves on fire for a thrill.
Now, as CBS2's Marc Liverman reported, there is Coco Loko — a powder made up mostly of chocolate, that you snort.
“I've never heard this before, but yeah that's pretty scary,” Parsa Keyvani said.
The product is available to order from the company's website, but it's not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
But that's not stopping people from snorting it and sharing their experiences through social media.
“Intuitively there's going to be more pulmonary problems, more asthma, more bronchitis, and more other issues, maybe even cancers,” Dr. Jordan S. Josephson explained.
Dr. Josephson is a sinus specialist at Lennox Hill Hospital. He said there are no studies that look at the long term health risks of snorting chocolate, but the risks are there. Blocked sinuses can lead to snoring and sleep apnea, and that can be deadly.
“Sleep apnea leads to heart attacks and strokes,” he explained.
Another concern is that powdered chocolate can easily be targeted to kids.
Dr. Josephson said the dangers of snorting chocolate are actually amplified when it comes to kids, and that's because their noses are smaller, and so are their sinuses.
“It's going to clog it up sooner because there's less space to deal with it,” he said.
If you're going to have some chocolate, Dr. Josephson said skip the snorting and consume it the traditional way — eat it instead.
CBS2 left a voicemail with Legal Lean — the creators of Coco Loko — but so far has not heard back.
Nine people have been indicted by the Special Prosecutor for their involvement in a general market manipulation by Kaupthing Bank with its own shares.
Among the accused are Hreiðar Már Sigurðsson former CEO of Kaupthing Bank, Sigurður Einarsson former acting chairman of the bank, Magnús Guðmundsson former CEO of Kaupthing Bank in Luxembourg, and Ingólfur Helgason former CEO of Kaupthing in Iceland. The other five are all former employees of Kaupthing Bank.
This is the largest case of its kind in the world, that has lead to an indictment, and by far the most extensive case the Special Prosecutor has investigated. The indictments were issued last week, and served to the accused yesterday.
The case involves five different cases of market manipulation connected to Kaupthing Bank, which the Special Prosecutor has been investigating for a long time. These have now been combined into one indictment.
Among these are Kaupthing's acquisitions of 29% of its own stock in 2005 to 2008. The Special Prosecutor believes there is a well-founded suspicion that these transactions were carried out, with the knowledge and approval of the bank's chief executive officers, in a systematic and organised manner, to preserve the value of the bank's stock, usually through preferred customers who received loans from the bank for the acquisitions. The day before Kaupthing Bank collapsed, in October 2008, 92% of the portfolio of the bank's own trade were shares in the bank itself.
Canadian banks could see their forecast earnings decline if the oil downturn spills over into the wider economy.

Oil and gas companies defaulting on their loans could shave off as much as 4.3 per cent of estimated earnings at major Canadian banks next year, according to a stress-test report by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Combined with possible contagion effect on non-oil Western Canadian companies and defaults in Alberta's housing market and retail loans, banks could rack up earnings declines of as much as 8.6 per cent in 2016, CIBC estimated.
“We conclude that while the oil price does not strongly affect default rates in the energy sector in any given year, a prolonged significant drop in the price of oil, combined with weaker economic activity, will be a driver of higher default rates,” CIBC analyst Robert Sedran wrote in a report this week.
Canadian oil is the cheapest in the world, with Western Canadian Select prices settling at US$19.80 per barrel on Wednesday, a US$23 discount over West Texas Intermediate.
Together, Canada's biggest six banks carry just over a $100 billion of gross credit exposure to the oil and gas sector, and some defaults may ensue as the energy sector reels from a prolonged decline in prices, CIBC said.
The wider economy also remains lacklustre with manufacturing failing to fire up despite a deflated loonie.
“We were bouncing along fine, but it doesn't leave you an awful lot of room to absorb a shock such as this one, so it does concern you,” Sedran said in an interview Wednesday.
Even as they shored up their balance sheets with equity financing deals, a number of companies in the oilpatch approached their lenders after the first rate cut by Bank of Canada to renegotiate the terms of their loans and effectively blend and extend their borrowings, said John Aiken, director of global research at Barclays Capital.
“Anything that may have been coming due in the near term was renegotiated and pushed out,” Aiken said.
Bank of Nova Scotia is the most vulnerable to the oil and gas sector, with 10 per cent of its business and government loans exposed to the industry, according to CIBC's analysis. In one scenario, Scotiabank could stand to lose as much 5.4 per cent of its forecast 2016 earnings, CIBC's test shows. Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is least exposed to the oilpatch as a percentage of its portfolio, would see only a two per cent decline in earnings.
While CIBC has slightly lower direct exposure to the sector, CIBC's analysis suggest the bank would see the biggest earnings decline of 5.8 per cent in the most dire of three stress-test scenarios.
Even as oil doldrums continue and threaten the bottom lines of the country's banks, analysts say the large financial institutions are usually willing to work with borrowers who experience trouble paying their loans. They view calling a loan or seizing assets as a last resort.
“Banks effectively go into business with their clients, businesses or households, when they lend to them. Therefore, it is in a bank's interest for its clients to remain going concerns,” says Peter Routledge, an analyst at National Bank Financial.
The major Canadian banks' direct exposure to the sector stood at about $42.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, higher than in the fourth quarter. But drawn and undrawn credit facilities push the figure to $101 billion, with Bank of Nova Scotia holding just under $30 billion in gross credit exposure in its energy portfolio.
From a credit perspective, the third quarter for the banks, which ended on July 31, is still going to be reasonably benign, said Barclay's Aiken. “We are likely to see cracks form in the fourth quarter and start to see material increases in provisions for credit loses in the early parts of 2016.”
Some Canadian banks are also exposed to the U.S. oilpatch, which has already seen some credit impairment.
The major financial institutions could also stumble as the oil downturn leaks into the wider Canadian economy.
“I am not terribly fussed about the direct exposure… but when something is happening in your broader operating environment, it is difficult to remove yourself,” Sedran said. “When it becomes Canada risk, Canadian banks have it.”
Companies in Western Canada outside the oil and gas sector could also pose challenges for the Big Six banks that include Bank of Montreal, the Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada. A moderate decline in the credit situation of non-oil Western companies could see banks lose as much as 2.4 per cent in earnings, according to CIBC.
In addition, credit card and non-real estate retail loan exposure — which tend to carry a higher loss ratio even during good times — could see bank earnings decline by as much as three per cent.
The major banks also have $81 billion of uninsured mortgages and home equity lines of credit in oil-producing Alberta, with Royal accounting for about 40 per cent of the figure. However, the CIBC report argues that even a 20 per cent decline in housing prices in the province would be unlikely to create material loan losses.

Could it really be that someone on Fox News admitted that they were wrong about President Barack Obama driving down the stock market? On Fox News Sunday, Bill Kristol admitted that he was wrong to blame Obama for the 20% drop in the stock market during the first month of his term. This was a popular GOP talking point that has been debunked by the market's surge over the past month.
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress:
Kristol said, “Republicans who were chortling over that 20 percent drop in the stock market the first month or two of [Obama's] administration are going to be, fairly enough, hoist on our own petard by the fact that now Obama's getting this big stock market rally. … I — no one should base anything on this forecast — but in my view the short term is surprisingly bullish, but medium-long term very worrisome.”
It was a silly criticism to begin with. The market isn't partisan. It wasn't going to turn around in one day based on the fact that Barack Obama won an election. It also was not voicing its disapproval of Obama by dropping. The market started to turn when the administration provided their plan to underwrite the selling of toxic assets. It has picked up steam as there have been small signs that the US might be getting close to seeing the end of the recession, and the situation with the banking system has finally stabilized.
Conservatives knew that they were making dubious claims when they advanced this argument, but they were/are desperately seeking some way to damage Obama's popularity. This was a popular talking point with Congressional Republicans, Sean Hannity, Kristol, and Rush Limbaugh. Even though Kristol has apologized, I don't think Obama should be expecting many, if any, more.

A cluster of of well-to-do couples huddle in the lobby of the Waldorf Towers in New York City, buzzing with anticipation. At the stroke of 8:45 p.m. on Saturday evening, a tall man in a tailored suit ushers everyone into a gold-plated elevator – the same one that the President of the United States rides when he stays in New York. Primping and fidgeting, the group lines up at a suite at the end of a hallway on the 35th floor. 58 people file in for tonight's magic show in Steve Cohen's living room, run solely by word-of-mouth.
Cohen's “Chamber Magic” shows inspire an intimate, old-timey parlor feel. Attendees, many of whom have purchased tickets months in advance, are expected to dress well. He doesn't bother with hats, rabbits, or sleight-of-hand tricks; instead, he uses one gleaming tea kettle to produce five different drinks at the audience's request.
At age 10, Cohen worked the elementary school circuit, appearing at kids' birthday parties and Cub Scout meetings. Now, he brings in about 300 viewers each weekend – including high-profile guests like Martha Stewart, Barry Diller, and David Rockefeller – and a seven-figure annual income. “I put people in an environment where anything can happen,” Cohen says, pausing to sip Kombucha tea (the ginger helps his throat). “People start thinking, Maybe there's another force in the world, and this guy has control over it.”
Age: 41
Graduated from: Cornell University, psychology major; Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan
Based in: New York, N.Y.
Years as a full-time magician: 17
Previous jobs: After graduating from Cornell, I stayed in Tokyo for five years as an English translator. It involved sitting at a desk with lots of legal work and patents.
That seems like a pretty far stretch from your current line of work. The translation work was terribly boring, but lucrative. I was eager to do magic, so I got some part-time jobs performing in hotels, and those got more and more lucrative. I came back to New York and started from scratch as a consultant for other magicians. Then, I started doing my own shows.
Who – or what – brought you into the world of magic? My uncle. He was very talented with cards, and taught me the fundamentals of card magic that you need to become a good magician. I spent all my times at family parties with him. He gave me a book called Magic With Cards, a book from the 1890s that is very hard to find.
How did you turn a childhood hobby into a multimillion-dollar business? For two years, after moving back to America from Japan, I lied to my wife and told her we were breaking even. But we were losing money every show; I lost about $200,000 of my own money. I was about to throw in the towel when an editor from DailyCandy.com came to review the show. Overnight, the show sold out for a year in advance. Then CBS Sunday Morning did a segment on me, and by the end of the week, I had sold $1 million worth of tickets. I had to add more shows.
Is the Waldorf your permanent home? I stay here on weekends. I have another apartment on the Upper West Side with my family – my wife and two kids, ages 12 and 8 – during the week.
Do your kids love magic? They each practice one trick each year, and on Father's Day, they perform it at my show. But my daughter is more into it than my son. She's a ham. But there's not that many women in magic, if you think about it.
Why do you think more men than women are into magic? I'm not sure. But I don't really recommend becoming a magician to anyone. People are constantly making gags about it. Imagine going into your child's school for a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher says, “Your child seems to think you're a magician of some sort.” You always have to explain what you do.
In your grand finale, two audience members shuffle two separate decks of cards. Then, you reveal that each card in the first deck falls in the exact same order as each card in the second deck. The audience really goes wild for that one. People seriously go bananas – they have heart palpitations. They can't sleep that night. And I'm jumping up and down like Willy Wonka.
It's funny you mention Willy Wonka. You remind me of him — Gene Wilder's version, at least. The character of Willy Wonka has been a role model for me. I like his transition from mysterious man to crazed maniac – peeling away layers and seeing more and more about this nutty guy.
Did he inspire your three-piece suit, too? In London, I saw Prince William wearing this exact outfit – a morning coat, a vest with a little lapel, and striped trousers. So I went to the store where the princes shop, and bought that exact outfit. I think it's so appropriate in this environment.
It plays into the magician archetype. People want the character of a wizard or a magician to come into their lives and give them hope and possibility. Why do you think Harry Potter is so popular? I'm not doing wizardry here, but I feel like Harry Potter or Dumbledore. People squeal in delight. During my “Think a Drink” trick, a woman in the front row actually cried. [For this trick, five audience members wrote down their favorite drinks, from vodka to banana smoothie. Cohen then produced these drinks from a small kettle.]
Best part of your job: Immediate feedback. I can tell by looking at audience members' eyes whether I have them under my thumb. When people's eyes are glowing, I know I've done my job. I've learned what captures people's imaginations.
Most challenging part of your job: Nobody else in the world is doing this type of performance, so I don't have a support team. I've lost the camaraderie of fellow magicians; a lot of them are jealous.
Resources for new material: The Conjuring Arts Research Center in New York has a database with every secret that has ever been published in magic, from the 1500s to present-day. You have to be a member or have special access.
Any pre-show traditions? David Copperfield once told me that he brushes his teeth with a certain toothbrush before every show. I joke around and say that I floss before every show. But the fact is, no. I'm very relaxed. Everything in my show is meticulously planned. Without fail, I know the precise minute that I'll be saying a certain line.
The last time you got nervous: When Woody Allen came in and sat in the front row. I had cotton balls in my mouth, but he was the greatest audience. He laughed at all the right times.
On the Late Show with David Letterman, Steve Cohen performed his favorite trick, involving a lemon, an egg, a walnut, and a ring.
What would people be surprised to learn about your job? You can buy and sell secrets. I once licensed a trick from another magician for my show, but after the terms of the legal contract expired, he wanted the trick back. So I had to create my own version of the trick.
Your most expensive trick: I spent $10,000 for a trick that only lasts two or three minutes, but it's a really good trick. I fill a flower vase with all different flowers and cover them with a handkerchief. Then, I ask an audience member to name her favorite flower. Say she responds with yellow tulip. I take the handkerchief away, and all the flowers have transformed into yellow tulips.
How do you deal with uncooperative audience members? People have predispositions toward magic shows. Those who give me problems – maybe they got embarrassed at a magic show when they were little. I handle them the same way I would handle kids, and try to diffuse the challenge by making my show lively and interactive.
Your website boasts some of your more famous clients, like Warren Buffet. I still get people coming in here all the time, like, Warren sent me. I always carry with me a card that he signed.
Physical parameters of your show: I need to be inside of a room with no other distractions. People must be completely riveted on just me. I can't have people thinking about what they're going to make for dinner.
Your required reading: Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini. It's about how and why to persuade people to see things your way.
You never leave home without: My deck of cards. I rarely do magic outside of a venue, but it makes me feel good that I could, if I needed to.
Have you ever pulled a rabbit out of a hat? Yes, and it's wonderful. I don't do it regularly, though, because then you have to keep a rabbit as a pet.
LAUNCHING YOUR CAREER>>
Find a venue that is appropriate to your vision of magic, and become the person best suited for that venue. If you're really good at performing at Bar Mitzvah parties, for example, become the very best Bar Mitzvah magician out there, and work tons of them.

This involves both Cameralady and ShortFatOtaku. Some of you may not know who ShortFatOtaku is. He isn't as well known as many others in the #Gamergate community, but he's produces videos with cameralady, appears on a number of #gamergate podcast/discussion videos, and created videos about the Zoe that were later taken down. Their removal is likely because of the slander contained within it, but that's speculation.
Although that video was taken down, he has another one still up and what you can find linked here is really symptomatic of the kind of toxic slander, racism and misogyny #Gamergate is involved in. The screenshot below is a picture of the description of the video:
I downloaded the file and found some really, really alarming things inside. Remember, this is from a youtube video from one of the largest women in #gamergate. These are not “fringe” harassers or outside trolls.
To make things clear:
The people saying “#gamergate supports women, #gamergate condemns harassment” are the people that have been harassing women in gaming this whole time.

A common recurring theme in the comments here on TorrentFreak is that P2P file-sharing is 'stealing'. While such sentiments are often expressed by the industry lobby groups, it's completely at odds with the law. It could also be the very LAST thing those bodies want.
We get a lot of comments on articles from people saying things like “Yeah, it's stealing. Just embrace it already” or “Good excuse to steal right?.”
There are editorials in mainstream newspapers that say “Such theft costs the copyright- or trademark-holders billions of dollars each year.”
Even Vice President Biden said last year that “Piracy is theft, clean and simple, it's smash and grab.” But you'd think a long-time lawyer and member of the Senate Judiciary would know to read the law.
The fact is that if copyright infringement was theft, then it would be treated as theft, dealt with as theft, and ‘copyright infringement' wouldn't exist at all. Nevertheless, the claims are often made. We've dealt with this topic before three years ago, focusing on UK law. So let's take an example of a US case and see what would happen if it were tried as theft, instead of copyright infringement. The most obvious case is that of the RIAA against Jammie Thomas.
Civil trial
We all know the process. A John Doe suit is filed (over 200,000 of them in the US so far), usually amalgamated into a group for easy processing (although it is legality questionable). This then goes to discovery, where the identity is uncovered. At this point the suit is dropped and a direct appeal for ‘settlement‘ is made. If no settlement is reached then the civil lawsuit process can be started.
In the Thomas case the civil lawsuit was filed April 2006, and has now gone on for several years; the latest activity just this last week. Civil law (17 U.S.C. § 504) provides for both actual damages AND statutory damages from $200 to $30,000 for non-willful infringement and $750-$150,000 for wilful infringement – per infringement. In three trials, juries have set the per-track damages figure for Thomas-Rasset at $9,250, $80,000 and $62,500 while the courts have twice reduced it to $2,250 per track, which the RIAA is appealing, AGAIN.
The case has now been ongoing for over 5 years, not counting the original John Doe complaint, and it has occupied hundreds if not thousands of man-hours defending it. These hours cost money, and in a civil case that means finding a lawyer willing to take it on pro bono.
At first, Thomas-Rasset retained Brian Toder as her attorney, and later switched to Kiwi Camara. The much shorter Capitol v Foster case had attorney costs of over $68,000 awarded after the RIAA dropped the case, while the Atlantic v Anderson (dropped by the RIAA after 3 years) ended up with over $100,000 in costs awarded by the court.
As with all such cases the verdict is based on ‘balance of the probabilities' or ‘preponderance of the evidence'. Quite a contrast to a criminal case.
Criminal Trial
Were copyright infringement is ‘stealing', this would be the process Thomas-Rasset would undergo.
An investigation would be made by the police (rather than a private company, hired by the complainant). As infringement is ‘theft' she would be dealt with under Minnesota state law, specifically Minnesota Statute §609.52. She would be arrested, charged, and taken to court. If she could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided for her. Odds are, she would be dealt with in a matter of weeks, if not days.
The theft statute values goods at the cost to buy, so the 24 tracks would each be valued at $0.99 – the cost on iTunes – for a total of $23.76. If we take the worst case scenario though, and assume a whole CD per track at $20 per CD, that still brings the total value of the theft to $480. As the value is below $500, the maximum penalty available is stipulated as follows:
In all other cases where the value of the property or services stolen is $500 or less, to imprisonment for not more than 90 days or to payment of a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
The trial would be judged, not on ‘balance of the probabilities' as with a civil trial, but ‘beyond reasonable doubt'. Based on the evidence submitted in the trials so far, such a case would fail, as Ms Thomas-Rassett has never been proved to be personally responsible, only her connection and computer.
That means?
Of course, if it were just a choice of a civil suit or a criminal theft trial, then it's clear why a civil trial is prefered, even if it is a money sink. Yet, there's one last obstacle: The Supreme Court of the US.
In 1985, the Court ruled in Dowling v United States that copyright infringement is not theft, even when dealing with physical objects, such as vinyl records.
While industry bodies might still want to claim it's still theft there is one simple fact that's clear. In treating it as theft the benefit would be to the alleged infringer. A higher evidence standard, an independent investigation, legal counsel provided free for the alleged infringer, and vastly smaller penalties.
The infringement=theft argument has only one thing going for it, and that's its emotional impact. In reality, it's the very LAST thing they want, which is why new laws, like Protect IP and others have been pushed for many years. And again, we reiterate that we've dealt with the US here, laws for other countries are different, as we've seen twice in the past week in Sweden, yet it's still copyright infringement there, not theft.
If you're confused about it still, maybe this song will help you tell the difference.
In a rare decision, Reddit has taken down a forum that housed links to hacked Sony Pictures documents.
The website on Tuesday banned the subreddit SonyGOP, which was filled with links to hundreds of gigabytes of Sony (SNE) emails, movie scripts, internal memos and personal information about employees.
The hacking group Guardians of Peace has mostly used the website Pastebin to post links to the hacked documents, but other people have copied and pasted those links on Reddit, making it a popular repository for people looking to pore through the hacked materials.
Reddit said it shut down the SonyGOP subreddit in response to requests from Sony to take down the links.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act allows media companies to ask websites take down copyrighted material, but the websites are not obligated to take down links themselves -- let alone shut down an entire page or site. Yet Reddit took the unusual measure of banning the entire subreddit.
Related: Sony lawyer tells media to stop reporting on stolen material
Reddit has a longstanding policy of allowing users to post pretty much whatever they want -- so long as what they post abides by U.S. law. In a very controversial decision, Reddit opted in September to ban "TheFappening," a subreddit that was the go-to place for links to nude celebrity photos obtained by hacking iCloud accounts.
At the time, Reddit called the nude photo subreddit takedown "an extreme circumstance" that had to do more with illegal links to nude photos of minors than the company taking the moral high ground.
Sony attorney David Boies has been pressuring news organizations and websites, including CNN, to stop downloading and publicizing the hacked documents. In a three-page letter to the legal offices of several news organizations, Boies said Sony maintains a copyright on those materials, and it asked the companies to destroy them.
Google is finally adopting a standard that supports both mouse and touch navigation for its Chrome browser. If you've used a copy of Chrome on a Windows tablet recently then you'll probably be familiar with the poor scrolling performance and general touch support, and it's something Google will now address across all of its versions of Chrome. Google revealed today that it plans to support Pointer Events, a standard that was first introduced by Microsoft in Internet Explorer.
Janky Android scrolling will be a thing of the past
Google has traditionally focused its efforts on supporting Touch Events, a method used by Apple in its Safari browser. Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera have all adopted Pointer Events, and Google says that feedback from the web community has led to the change in heart. With support for Pointer Events, scrolling and touch interactions should improve dramatically in Chrome. Google's Rick Byers admits "replacing all touch event handlers with pointer event handlers will address the main longstanding source of scroll-start jank we see on Android."
Chrome users won't see the improvements immediately, as it will take time for Google to build the support and test it with nightly and weekly versions of Chrome, but it's encouraging to see Google finally back the standard. While Google and Microsoft have argued over privacy policies, YouTube on Windows Phone, and other topics, it appears the two companies have worked closely to make this a reality. Google's Rick Byers says "Jacob Rossi on the IE team has been very helpful" in assisting the Chrome team with its adoption of Pointer Events. Google has some technical hurdles to work through, but the company says it's "optimistic" it can implement the standard alongside its existing Touch Events support without performance constraints.

Image caption NDM-1 has been found in E.coli bacteria
A new superbug that is resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics has entered UK hospitals, experts warn.
They say bacteria that make an enzyme called NDM-1 have travelled back with NHS patients who went abroad to countries like India and Pakistan for treatments such as cosmetic surgery.
Although there have only been about 50 cases identified in the UK so far, scientists fear it will go global.
Tight surveillance and new drugs are needed says Lancet Infectious Diseases.
The fear would be that it gets into a strain of bacteria that is very good at being transmitted between patients Dr David Livermore, Researcher from the HPA Q&A: NDM-1 superbugs
NDM-1 can exist inside different bacteria, like E.coli, and it makes them resistant to one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics - carbapenems.
These are generally reserved for use in emergencies and to combat hard-to-treat infections caused by other multi-resistant bacteria.
And experts fear NDM-1 could now jump to other strains of bacteria that are already resistant to many other antibiotics.
Ultimately, this could produce dangerous infections that would spread rapidly from person to person and be almost impossible to treat.
At least one of the NDM-1 infections the researchers analysed was resistant to all known antibiotics.
Similar infections have been seen in the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands and international researchers say that NDM-1 could become a major global health problem.
Infections have already been passed from patient to patient in UK hospitals.
The way to stop NDM-1, say researchers, is to rapidly identify and isolate any hospital patients who are infected.
Normal infection control measures, such as disinfecting hospital equipment and doctors and nurses washing their hands with antibacterial soap, can stop the spread.
And currently, most of the bacteria carrying NDM-1 have been treatable using a combination of different antibiotics.
Analysis The Indian health ministry and the medical fraternity are yet to see the Lancet report but doctors in India say they are not surprised by the discovery of the new superbug. "There is little drug control in India and an irrational use of antibiotics," Delhi-based Dr Arti Vashisth told the BBC. Doctors say common antibiotics have become ineffective in India partly because people can buy them over the counter and indulge in self-medication. They also take small doses and discontinue treatment. Gastroenterologist Vishnu Chandra Agarwal says in the past year he has come across many patients with E.coli infections who have not responded to regular antibiotics. "In about a dozen cases, I have used a chemical - furadantin - to treat my patients. And it has worked. It makes them horribly nauseous, but it works," he says.
But the potential of NDM-1 to become endemic worldwide is "clear and frightening", say the researchers in The Lancet infectious diseases paper.
The research was carried out by experts at Cardiff University, the Health Protection Agency and international colleagues.
Dr David Livermore, one of the researchers and who works for the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: "There have been a number of small clusters within the UK, but far and away the greater number of cases appear to be associated with travel and hospital treatment in the Indian subcontinent.
"This type of resistance has become quite widespread there.
"The fear would be that it gets into a strain of bacteria that is very good at being transmitted between patients."
He said the threat was a serious global public health problem as there are few suitable new antibiotics in development and none that are effective against NDM-1.
The Department of Health has already put out an alert on the issue, he said.
"We issue these alerts very sparingly when we see new and disturbing resistance."
Travel history
The National Resistance Alert came in 2009 after the HPA noted an increasing number of cases - some fatal - emerging in the UK.
The Lancet study looked back at some of the NDM-1 cases referred to the HPA up to 2009 from hospitals scattered across the UK.
At least 17 of the 37 patients they studied had a history of travelling to India or Pakistan within the past year, and 14 of them had been admitted to a hospital in these countries - many for cosmetic surgery.
For some of the patients the infection was mild, while others were seriously ill, and some with blood poisoning.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "We are working with the HPA on this issue.
"Hospitals need to ensure they continue to provide good infection control to prevent any spread, consider whether patients have recently been treated abroad and send samples to HPA for testing.
"So far there has only been a small number of cases in UK hospital patients. The HPA is continuing to monitor the situation and we are investigating ways of encouraging the development of new antibiotics with our European colleagues."
The Welsh Assembly Government said it would be "fully considering" the report.
"The NHS in Wales is used to dealing with multi-resistant bacteria using standard microbiological approaches, and would deal with any new bacteria in a similar way," said a spokesperson.

Clinton has a 5-point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, 48 percent to 43 percent, the Quinnipiac University Poll found. She also leads him in Florida by 1 point, 46 percent to 45 percent, and in North Carolina by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent.
Trump has a 5-point lead in Pennsylvania, though, 46 percent to 41 percent.
Trump likely needs to win at least three of the four battleground states to have a path to 270 electoral votes on Election Day. Florida is worth 29 electoral votes, Pennsylvania counts for 20, Ohio for 18 and North Carolina for 15.
“After a two-year campaign which has produced the most unpopular presidential candidates in American history, the election comes down — as it historically does — to a handful of swing states,” said Peter Brown, assistant director of the poll.
“No one has been elected president since 1960 without carrying two of the key swing states, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. And, this year, North Carolina has been added to the mix. All four of these key states remain close entering the final days."
The polls were taken among 602 likely voters in North Carolina, 589 likely voters in Ohio and 612 likely voters in Pennsylvania with margins of error of 4 points.
The Florida poll surveyed 626 likely voters and has a margin of error of 3.9 points.

Ashley: Taking the women's and gender studies Disability, Power, and Privilege class was a moment for me when women's and gender studies came off the pedestal. That was a time period where I was like, "All right, there are problems here." In classes I started realizing I was looking at feminists who are using this ableist language in their scholarship and not including people with disabilities in this conversation, and other people as well. That was the time period I was kind of disenchanted a little bit. It really made my understanding of feminism and women's and gender studies more complex and empowering, I think, after that. But that was difficult.
Alison: It is the moment where you start seeing, like, "Oh, right, this is a field that's in motion." Or then you have the moments, too, of recognizing, "These scholars whose work I've admired so much aren't actually asking questions that I think are important."
Ashley: Yeah.
Alison: I'm having that right now thinking about prenatal testing. When feminist scholars are talking about reproduction and reproductive justice, why aren't they talking about prenatal testing?
Ashley: I read feminist works and I'm in feminist classes, and now I'm thinking, how can you not include this?
Alison: Women's and gender studies is a field that hasn't fully answered all the questions, and it's often in a mode of self-critique and potential for change. This makes me think about making disability studies part of the academy. In the call for papers for this collection, the editors quote Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell who argue that institutionalizing disability studies is challenging because "the field situates itself as a force of destabilization" (192). This is true of women's and gender studies, too. The sort of origin story for the field is that it emerged from feminist activism. And because of this, a lot of women's and gender studies practitioners have been reluctant to see women's and gender studies as a discipline, as a legitimate institutional player in the academic scene. I think that's troubling.
Do we want to talk for a few minutes about academic institutionalization? What has women's and gender studies gained in becoming comfortably housed in universities nationwide? It's provided me the space to do research and teaching which are very closely linked for me, that I'm able to have conversations about nuanced, complicated issues that matter to me, and those conversations in and out of the classroom are able to help me create a fuller understanding of the issues, whatever they may be. And that's part of what institutionalization has made possible for me: I have the space and the support to do really complicated thinking, which helps me to challenge stereotypes, which helps me to challenge easy reductive approaches to various ideas.
Amber: As a student, I have sort of a similar perspective. It's really important for me to be in a college atmosphere where I feel like I belong and where I feel like I have the validation and encouragement and resources to pursue work that has been really interesting to me. And often to be part of a student voice or student body calling for improvements or envisioning a way in which women's and gender studies can be grown, can be better. Having this role to play not only has cemented my feeling of belonging but makes me feel more able to have a space that responds to other students' needs of belonging that are different than mine. This is another reason that I felt like disability was so obvious—that of course students with disabilities on this campus need a space to belong, and if they're interested in women's and gender studies, then the women's and gender studies program is really happy to be one of the spaces in which they feel welcome and appreciated and, you know, made comfortable if they have physical disabilities or safe if they have intellectual disabilities.
Alison: Where they're recognized as full human beings.
Amber: Yeah, as really valid students whose work is appreciated and important. But even more than that, women's and gender studies is helping to change the campus climate and what this institution is—how it operates—to be more fully inclusive.
Ashley: Something that has been really important to me about being involved with women's and gender studies is that I feel like students' voices matter, and I feel like we students are a part of constructing women's and gender studies at the school. I feel like women's and gender studies is something that is well established institutionally, but at the same time, I feel like it still acknowledges that it will change and it's always changing, and, at least in my experience, that students are part of that change.
Alison: What I hear you two saying—you're voicing counter-arguments to what I think might be some people's resistance to becoming part of the institution. There were arguments made against women's and gender studies becoming institutionalized because becoming part of an institution means that you're less radical. It means that you're no longer fighting the system if you're part of the system. You know, in women's and gender studies classes we talked about the campus as a plantation, and it is a plantation, and here we are, playing a role in the plantation, so are we really trying to undermine the system? 8 Audre Lorde says, "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house." 9 So here we are, as professors and students, in the master's house with the master's tools, and yet what you both are articulating is that that's too simplistic an argument to make. Here we are, fully institutionalized, right? My paycheck comes from the academy. But you're voicing that women's and gender studies, and disability studies, can part of the system and yet still have room for a lot of voices to take part, still have space that is validating of people's identities. That's very hopeful.
Ashley: It's not perfect. I think it's really valid to have those arguments against institutionalization, but at the same time, I think it's necessary to look for the sites of resistance. Looking for the possibilities and hope in those.
Amber: I think that women's and gender studies programs in the institution are spaces where we're ready to acknowledge that we might be wrong—we ran this program or we brought this speaker or we have this class, we have this professor, we might have said something wrong, we might have said something offensive. You know, some event happened and it shouldn't have happened that way and acknowledging the way in which you could have invalidated someone's identity or made a space particularly harmful or unsafe is really important, and I think that is what women's and gender studies brings to the academy.
Alison: We can be institutionalized, recognize ourselves and be recognized as a discipline, and still be agents of social change. And part of what we're calling for is multiple levels of institutionalization—not just in the disciplines, which is crucial, but also inclusion like with the REACH Program.
Amber: Right, so this points to the ways that social change remains part of our institutionalization. I think that after learning about disability studies, women's and gender studies students and faculty now assess the campus differently. We see classrooms differently: "Whose body can be here?" Like, students from our Disability, Power, and Privilege class who directed The Vagina Monologues started including American Sign Language interpreters (who are fantastic). We think about accommodation and inclusion, and we examine what changes we can make with the power we have as students.
Alison: How does that relate to women's and gender studies?
Amber: Because that's what women's and gender studies scholars and students do. We're really focused on making social change happen.
Ashley: Women's and gender studies often allows us to think more broadly about what work we're supposed to do. Our final projects are often allowed to be activist projects, or efforts at social change. Even if students do really unsuccessful bake sales to donate to local charities or service organizations, they have to actively do something as part of their class grade.
Amber: Community change is what we do, and that's not necessarily a component of other academic programs. Women's and gender studies is at least willing to give lip service to social change, and this lip service is useful. I think that we as a discipline are slightly more willing to do actual change because we are so dedicated to the ideas of social change and justice. Having disability studies be a regular part of women's and gender studies intro courses and classes, particularly in combination with the REACH program could lead to better classrooms. Classrooms that teach differently, and also classrooms that make possible a welcoming space for all bodies. Fat people, and people who would rather stand up to learn than sit down for 50 minutes, and people who need technology to communicate with the class. All the people!
Ashley: Well, yeah, and then all the people go out into the world recognizing ways to make better spaces in offices and waiting rooms and on public transportation. All of us can then go out and look for ways to make our spaces not suck.
Alison: There's an implicit question that we're skirting around here, and it's whether disability studies should be part of women's and gender studies or should be its own entity that works in collaboration with women's and gender studies—crosslisted courses, cosponsored events, things like that. We all seem to be in agreement that being an official part of the academy has enough benefits—and leaves enough space for resistance—that disability studies should be here. But should it be here as part of women's and gender studies or as its own department or program?
Amber: I don't know. That's a question I don't think we can answer. The answer won't be the same on every campus, so maybe it has to be an individualized question for different institutions.
Alison: Talking about this is making me inclined to say yes, it should be its own field. Women's and gender studies has more status and power, and more opportunities to be a recognized part of academic conversations, because we're a stand-alone entity. So I think disability studies should be, too.

In an Electric Universe, plasma structures in space exhibit similar morphology regardless of scale. From galaxy clusters to individual stars, spheres and filaments predominate.
Spherical clusters of stars, otherwise known as globular clusters, are another example of how plasma is organized and confined into coherent formations that defy conventional explanations. Astronomers have long thought that globular clusters must begin as a uniform assemblage of stars from a single birthing event, since, according to standard theory, the gas and dust needed for new stars is no longer present within them.
However, as a recent press release states, some confusion has arisen because one of the Milky Way's largest globular clusters, NGC 2808, contains “multigenerational” stars. As Giampaolo Piotto of the University of Padua stated, “This result says globular cluster stars are not as simple as we are teaching to our students.”
Globular clusters pose a particularly difficult question when a gravitational model of the cosmos is considered. Why do their stars congregate into giant balls, rather than in disks or ellipses? Also, stellar orbits inside the clusters should gradually cause them to disappear over time if their stars are attracted to one another through gravity alone. Some stars should be accelerated out of the cluster, while stars closer to the center should slide into the gravity well.
As has been noted in a previous Picture of the Day, because globular clusters orbit galaxies in a halo, each time they cross the galactic plane tidal forces should disrupt the clusters, sending their stars every which way. Why this does not happen is not explained. NGC 2808 is supposed to be hundreds of millions of years old, yet it remains spherical despite crossing the plane of the Milky Way many times.
The Electric Universe view of stars provides an answer to that quandary. Since stars are positively charged objects bound together by electric and magnetic fields, their interaction with each other is not based on a gravito-centric model of the Universe, alone.
As Dr. Donald Scott, retired Professor of Electrical Engineering and advocate of the electric star model stresses, it is the strength of the electric charges flowing into a star that determines its characteristics. The old-fashioned Nebular Hypothesis has been found wanting when it comes to analyzing a star's behavior in galactic formations or globular clusters. Therefore, populations of stars are not dependent on how long it took them to evolve, so the “problem” with multigenerational stars in NGC 2808 does not follow.
Electrically, individual stars might be considered as discrete charged particles in both structures, behaving according to the laws of plasma physics and not the laws of mechanical motion. Galactic disks act like Faraday motors, while globular clusters (as has been suggested in the past) might be more like ball lightning than anything else.
So, the Hubble research team has not discovered anything extraordinary. The stars in NGC 2808 are acting in accord with their electrical natures. They may not be as old as the team thinks because they are not behaving according to gravity in a big bang cosmology but according to a plasma cosmology hypothesis.

Antonio Candreva is determined to win silverware with Inter following his transfer from Lazio.
The Italy international was initially linked with a move to Napoli, but eventually opted to join Inter instead and is looking forward to a new chapter in his career.
"I joined Inter to win. That is what Inter are used to doing," said Candreva.
"Inter were chasing after me and I am proud to have joined this club. Negotiations were long and hard and at some point I feared the deal would collapse. I did not reject Napoli. I don't know whether there were talks between both clubs.
"Inter wanted me right from the start and I am proud to be here.
"I have reached the right age to aim for success. Juventus have been the team to beat in recent years, but we want to improve on last season and have a good campaign.
"We have got a lot of quality players and we can achieve big things together."
The 29-year-old signed a four-year deal with Inter.

A woman caught with a “disgusting” collection of extreme animal porn celebrated as she walked free from court.
Wendy Jones, 54, amassed a sick stash over four years including pictures of women having sex with horses, dogs and a pig.
Her offences came to light when she showed an ex-girlfriend what appeared to be a photo of a child being sexually abused by a man.
But police never discovered the image and unemployed Jones, of Blundells Drive, Moreton, Wirral , was not charged over it.
She was handed a 12-month community order after admitting six counts of possessing animal porn between August 2012 and August 2016.
Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said: “You now have this conviction to your name, so you have lost your hitherto good character.
“These were after all quite disgusting images that you had on your laptop, extreme porn, that's what they are.
“That sums up their rather disgusting nature... the type of activity which you were looking at.”
Liverpool Crown Court heard Jones's former partner Kay Davies reported her to police after she showed her the disturbing photo.
Rob Jones, prosecuting, said: “The defendant was at her property and she appeared to be showing interest in images on the computer.
“She called Miss Davies over and showed her what appeared to be a photo of a young girl engaging in oral sex with an older male.
“The defendant appeared to find that amusing. Miss Davies was disgusted.”
He said Miss Davies ended their relationship and called police, who raided Jones's home on August 22.
Officers seized an Acer laptop, which was found to contain 31 images of extreme animal porn.
Mr Jones said: “All the images involved adult females and animals. Counts one and two involve horses. The other counts involved dogs and a pig.”
Jones was arrested and made no comment, but provided a prepared statement accepting responsibility.
Mr Jones said the first two counts were highlighted because of “the likelihood of serious injury to the individual concerned”.
He added there was “evidence of internet search terms appertaining to children”, adding: “That's a matter of some concern to the court.”
Kevin Batch, defending, said his client, who did not have any previous convictions, was an alcoholic and regularly admitted to hospital.
He said: “It's a combination of difficulties because of the alcoholism, various ailments and the conditions that Miss Jones suffers from.
“She accepted her culpability throughout. She has never sought to blame anybody else. She is deeply ashamed and remorseful.”
Mr Batch said Jones had been in hospital for the last 12 days and would return after the hearing.
The lawyer said his client, who receives £600 a month in disability benefits, would then go home, where she would receive daily care.
He said: “She has difficulty dressing and undressing at the moment because of a shoulder issue.”
Judge Trevor-Jones handed her a 60-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
He said: “You have your issues, it's quite clear. In particular a long standing and gripping alcohol problem.
“If that continues to beset you, this is the type of thing that is likely to be repeated, I suspect.”
The judge said Jones must tackle her drinking or risk coming back to court and being jailed.
He added: “That could be of even greater consequence to you than other many other people.”
On Thursday, June 9th, Nashville's Yazoo Brewing releases more bottles from their funky/wild line – Embrace the Funk.
Snag bottles of Deux Rouges (Batch 3) and Delicieux (Batch 2).
Deux Rouges Batch 3 is our Flanders Red aged with souring bacterias and multiple Brettanomyces strains for over a year in freshly emptied Merlot barrels. This year's blend consists of 10 select barrels (including a portion from the original batch 1) that together bring big notes of raisin, dark cherry, fig and an oaky tannic wine finish.
Délicieux Batch 2 is a delicious hoppy Belgian Pale Ale with 2 strains of Brettanomyces from the Senne Valley in Belgium. A generous dry hopping with Styrian Goldings give this funky pale ale an earthy, spicy and herbal flavor/aroma. This beer will age well and constantly evolve. This year's batch was slightly tweaked lending to a lighter color/body and drier/hoppier finish.
Limited apply for each. No distribution.

BitTorrent Inc. has been accused of loading its popular µTorrent BitTorrent client with cryptocoin miners that installation silently and then harvest the processor power of unwitting torrenters.
Users of the software created a thread on the official µTorrent forum to complain about a high processor load when the computer is idle. The culprit was a program called Epic Scale, installed alongside µTorrent.
Epic Scale is a distributed computing client from a company that claims it wants to harness "unused processing power to change the world." The website says that it uses the processors of machines with the software to solve "math problems for weather prediction, physics simulations, cryptography (including cryptocurrency mining) and more," and this computation is monetized. Currently, it appears that the software is mining the Litecoin cryptocurrency.
The "changing the world" part comes from what Epic Scale proposes to do with the proceeds of its distributed computing: the company says that long term it intends to donate 75 percent of its profits to charity, and in the short term, it's donating 100 percent of its profits. The chosen charities are presently healthcare funding initiative Watsi, and HIV vaccine researcher Immunity Project.
BitTorrent denies that Epic Scale was installed silently, and Epic Scale tells us that it was not aware of, and did not consent to, any silent installation. Our own testing supports this; during installation of µTorrent, the software clearly asks if Epic Scale should be installed.
We would note that "Accept Offer" is, however, the default button, so blindly hitting return or impatiently clicking the bottom right to Next your way through the installation wizard will result in the software being installed. While this clearly isn't silent installation, we can see how users might accidentally or unwittingly accept the installation.
The company also tells us that Epic Scale has been included for some two months prior to the accusations of silent installation.
While it may yet emerge that there is some way by which the Epic Scale client was indeed installed silently, for the time being it looks like both it and µTorrent are the victims of an overreaction. µTorrent does include bundled apps as part of its monetization system, but it asks prior to their installation, and makes them all strictly optional.
The response to this bundled software is perhaps influenced by Lenovo's Superfish brouhaha, wherein the PC manufacturer was found to be preinstalling software that completely subverted the security that secure HTTP is supposed to offer. This has provoked greater sensitivity to, and suspicion of, the unwanted software that's hitching a ride on the programs and hardware that we do want.
The fears over this software, and the apparent overreactions that can result, put both app and hardware developers in a sticky spot. End users may claim to dislike the crapware that's so often found on new PCs, but they're also extremely price sensitive; if a manufacturer can cut the retail price of a system by a few dollars, and make that up in kickbacks from crapware companies, they'll do so, because that price cut will produce stronger sales.
The same conflict repeats itself over and over again. Facebook users will gripe about the presence of ads and the mining of demographic data for better ad targeting, but it's hard to imagine Facebook becoming the social networking behemoth it has become if, as an alternative, it charged its members for its services.
Even µTorrent has a paid "pro" version with some additional features and no in-app advertising, but if we were to guess, this is about as popular as paid versions of WinZip, a program that exists only in myth and legend.
Without some great shift in consumer behavior, it's unlikely that we'll see any real change. If end-users can't be convinced to pay directly for useful services and desirable software, and if they insist on pinching every penny when buying hardware, those lost margins will be found elsewhere. Bundled ads and apps are going to be the answer, and they may not all be as harmless, or as explicit, as Epic Scale appears to be.
A London filmmaker has hailed the dedication of fans after they helped fund his debut sci-fi feature.
Justin Trefgarne, 40, wrote and directed Narcopolis and convinced actors Jonathan Pryce, Robert Bathurst and Elliot Cowan to star in it.
Four and a half years after starting the project, he has secured a cinema release for later this month.
Narcopolis was shot in London and is set in a future where drugs are legal. Cowan plays a policeman whose job is protecting the business of narcotics companies that control the markets.

Mr Trefgarne told the Standard: “I had been at Working Title films and was lucky enough to work with people like Joe Wright and Paul Greengrass. I had this idea for a film and it was people like them who encouraged me to pursue it.”
He secured initial investment and turned to crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise the final £20,000 of the budget, which eventually totalled at “under £1 million”.
He persuaded Pryce to take part after a meeting at a north London pub. He added: “By the time we had Jonathan, Robert and Elliot on board it helped attract even more investment. What I discovered about these kinds of actors is that they just want to make good stuff — it's not about the budget. The £20,000 from Kickstarter pretty much completed the shoot.
“Smaller films have really struggled to get funding. Kickstarter makes films like this possible. It's empowering and makes you think more about the fans and what they want. It also shows British films can do this kind of genre. We are sometimes a bit shy with sci-fi.”
Narcopolis is out on September 25.
Boulder rangers rescued a University of Colorado student over the weekend after she got high on mushrooms and took off all her clothes while hiking near the Third Flatiron, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.
The student, 21-year-old Taylor Powers, was hiking with her roommates at around 5:24 p.m. Sunday when they called police saying Powers was high on mushrooms and in distress. Rescuers arrived and found Powers had removed all of her clothing and was being restrained by her roommates.
Rangers handcuffed her and were able to secure her. It took rescuers about an hour to get her to a nearby shelter. At 7:50 p.m., Powers was transported to Boulder Community Hospital, where she was treated and released.
Powers was ticketed with unlawful consumption of a controlled substance. Officials indicated there could be additional charges filed against others involved in the incident.
The Depths Of Tolagal Review
Nary a day goes by when a new roguelike game doesn't pop up on Steam. The arrival of new roguelike dungeon crawlers on the digital platform is so regular, you could almost set your watch by it. This near-daily arrival of new games which give you one life to live does have some downsides though. Chief among which is the visibility new entries into the genre can garner. There's a need for some unique selling point to get people interested, and this is where the concern begins for The Depths Of Tolagal.
Why? Well on the face of it, there's nothing special about in the game. Or is there?
The Depths Of Tolagal‘s story is one of woe and loss. You play as a butcher whose son has disappeared so it's up to you to find him. Until the very end of the game, that's about it. Even as the curtains start to close, this tale only progresses forward one step. There are plenty of well written notes and interesting pieces of flavor text that try to bring some much-needed life into the narrative. They just don't really present themselves as anything more than a little interesting piece of writing. So the story's nothing great. Moving on.
This title's desired unique selling point isn't even to be found in the visuals. No gigantic explosions or mewling fantasy nasties with a billion heads to be found here. It's all present in a very retro and pixel-driven format, much like 95% of roguelikes to be born from the busy developers in the past few years. While again there's nothing special about the visuals, they lend the game an intrinsic feel of what's to be expected. Nothing over the top or fancy here. Just a game that's been made. They're not great though. Moving on.
Maybe The Depths Of Tolagal‘s sound design is similar to that of an angelic choral hum, rolling over distant hills to fill your ears with honey and dreams. Sadly again we're going to have to go with a no on this one. The Depths Of Tolgal sounds about as far from bad as you can get though. It's accompanying music and in-game sound effects are inoffensively capable. That's it though, they're quite literally the definition of okay. Moving on.
There's a pattern of some sort forming here. You see it? Nothing really stands out with The Depths Of Tolagal. No big shiny ball of wonder is promised to those who cast a quick glance over it. There's no outlying incentive to go and play the game. Hell, even The Depths Of Tolagal as a name is about as memorable as your typical bowel movement. They say a picture paints a thousand words. Going on the picture, sound, even story that this game makes, no more than a couple of hundreds have to be said.
Luckily, the picture that's being painted so far here is totally wrong 30 minutes into actually playing the game for one simple reason: The Depth Of Tolagal's gameplay is astounding.
Movement and actions outside of combat are fairly standard. It's when you take the game into the world of fighting monsters that The Depths Of Tolagal goes from being something of a lame duck to a glorious swan that'll have your mind tactically engaged for hour after hour. This isn't a game to play laid back in your chair, devouring custard creams like Jabba the Hutt on cheat day. Even the simple art of moving around in a combat situation takes careful thought and precision.
Activities play out in your standard turn-based fashion. Move a space and you'll spend one of your three action points. Attack an enemy and you'll spend one of your three action points. Use a healing potion and… you get the idea. You're only given three of these action points at any one time, meaning that simply running into combat and swinging your trusty weapon is far from a good idea. Instead, The Depths Of Tolagal demands that you take the time to think, demanding that even the most innocuous of moves is considered in the highest regard.
This powerfully tactical gameplay gives The Depths Of Tolagal its unique selling point. Those three action points are all that stand between you and certain death, so using them wisely becomes more important than actually breathing. When everything from moving forward one step to the simple act of readying your shield takes an action point, decisions have to be meticulously considered before making any decision.
With The Depths Of Tolagal‘s turn-based system, this committee-esque decision-making process is far from stressful, praise the Helix Fossil. What is stressful though is actually putting the choices into motion. Your enemies are constrained by the same action point system that you constantly struggle against throughout The Depths of Tolagal, but they've usually got some special ability to make your life a little less enjoyable.
For example, you may find yourself walking into a location with three basic goblin characters and a hulking troll. The goblins have two basic action points but can enrage to have four at any given time, making them dangerous at times. Clever use of a shield to negate their damage while managing your hitpoints can easily lead to victory.
The troll however is a totally different story. This lumbering monstrosity only has one action point a turn unless it sees you. Then it can enrage to have a grand total of four moves available to pummel your face into nothing more than a reddish paella. With only three action points available to you there's a choice that has to be made; either buckle up and take the damage, or move into range, hit it, then move away to try and whittle down the beast.
With only a small amount of weapon types available to you (swords, axes, maces, and bows of varying power) it'd be reasonable to assume that there's not a great deal of variety to combat. That assumption would be a sorely painful mistake to make thanks to The Depths Of Tolagal‘s intent on ensuring you're never comfortable. Later on in the game, you'll be offered more powerful axes and swords that can be used to cut your foes to ribbons – at a price.
This idea to give with one hand then take with the other epitomizes The Depths Of Tolagal‘s gameplay beautifully, wrapping everything into a neat little package. It lacks much of a story (which honestly can be ignored after one playthrough for the amazingly engrossing Infinite Mode) and doesn't score any points in the looks department. When you've taken a little time to become fully indoctrinated into its gameplay, everything changes.
Those rather iffy looking sprites become an angry monster hungry for your blood. The so-so music becomes a perfect accompaniment to a festival of nail-biting decisions. Even the story finds life as it becomes your sole desire in life. The Depths of Tolagal has a near-unmatched ability to take you in, turning minutes into hours and hours into days with gameplay mechanics that punch well above this small indie title's weight.
Alameda intends to bypass housing ban, develop ex-Navy base City intends to go around popular 40-year ban on new condos, apartments
The city is planning a development at Alameda Point with stores, offices and at least 800 housing units.

Alameda's 40-year ban on new multiunit housing appears headed for the scrap heap as the city embarks on an ambitious plan to build more than 800 apartments and condominiums - and not one single-family home - at its former Navy base overlooking San Francisco Bay.
Alameda opened its doors to developers on Thursday for proposals to build on two large bayfront parcels in the heart of Alameda Point, a 1,500-acre shoreline expanse that covers about one-third of the island and offers spectacular views of the bay, the East Bay hills and San Francisco.
The move comes as the demand grows for housing in San Francisco and Oakland, and it's expected to draw strong opposition from residents due to the limited access - three bridges and a tunnel - to the city.
The first project is 68 acres along the main thoroughfare and Seaplane Lagoon. It would include ground-level retail shops, offices, hotels and at least 800 apartments and condominiums. The second project is 82 acres reserved for corporate campuses or a large regional shopping outlet. That project includes no housing.
"The economy is very good right now, and we want to take advantage of that," said Alameda Point's chief operating officer for the city, Jennifer Ott. "Our hope is that these projects serve as a catalyst for the rest of the Alameda Point development."
Ultimately, Alameda Point will include 1,425 housing units, 250 acres of open space and a mix of light industry, offices and retail. Google recently signed a lease at the point for a renewable energy lab.
Alameda Point has been mostly vacant since the Navy left in 1997. At least two master developers pulled out of plans to build there in part because Alameda's 1973 ordinance, called Measure A, bans new apartments and condominiums on the island.
The last developer, SunCal of Orange County, tried to overturn the law in 2010, saying any profitable development at Alameda Point would be impossible without multiunit housing. Voters defeated that proposal by 85 percent.
After SunCal pulled out, the city took over as the master developer. To get around Measure A, the city is asking potential developers to apply for a state exemption to local land-use laws by including a certain number of affordable units for low-income residents, Ott said. The process is called a density bonus application.
"We went through a very thorough public process on this, and no one's challenged it," Ott said. "The opposition to SunCal's plan was based more on traffic and the sheer number of units - 4,800, compared to the 1,425 we're proposing."
Still, some residents mourned the apparent end of Measure A, which they credit with maintaining Alameda's small-town feel amid one of the most densely populated regions in the country.
"Measure A has become archaic. That's unfortunate, because that's what's saved this city," said Nancy Hird, a 15-year resident and community activist. "This housing plan totally violates what local people want, and there's nothing we can do about it. I think that's crummy."
Traffic and crowds are residents' primary gripes. Alameda, with about 75,000 residents, has only four land routes off the island. When one of those becomes clogged, the others almost instantly do, too.
When it's compete, Alameda Point will have about 4,000 residents and 9,000 workers, most of whom would rely on the Webster Street tunnel to get on and off the island. That tunnel is already near capacity, according to traffic analyses.
Alameda plans to give free bus passes to every resident and worker at Alameda Point and provide a free shuttle to Oakland's 12th Street BART Station, Ott said.
Thursday's announcement is a significant milestone in Alameda's long and contentious planning process for the point. The city has spent years negotiating with the Navy, developers and community groups over the fate of the land, which is among the largest, most scenic and most centrally located properties in the Bay Area.
Eugenie Thomson, a longtime Alameda resident and Measure A advocate, said she worries most about the traffic. Because Alameda is surrounded by water, options are limited. Widening the tunnel and bridges or adding a BART station would be extremely expensive and such a move is highly unlikely at this point, she said.
"I asked (city staff), how long will it take to get off the island? No response. How long will it take to get to work? Get across town? What if there's an accident in the tube? City Hall is just ignoring it," she said. "Will this change Alameda? Yeah, big-time."
The deadline for developers to submit plans is June 16, and the City Council will vote on the winners this fall.
The USPTO is big on Apple patents this morning, with a new application published around earbud technology spotted by AppleInsider. Apple's own earbud designs have been mostly underwhelming, even if the last change for the stock set that comes with iPhones and iPods was an improvement. The new patent application describes tech that could be truly game-changing, however, by adjusting earbud output to match any user's specific ear canal size and shape.
The somewhat sci-fi patent applications describe a method that measures earbud fit based on various signals, including electrical current, acoustic indicators with a mic including signal frequency and more. The ultimate result of those evaluations would then inform the earbuds how they need to change audio delivery to compensate for a less than perfect seal, altering balance, changing equalizer settings and adjusting noise cancellation response.
In addition to changing its sound output levels to try to counteract the effects of a less-than-perfect seal, the Apple method described in the patent would also be able to alert users of the imperfect fit on their device, presumably so that they could reseat the earbud in their ear themselves. But if the compensation methods put to work to fix problems like left-to-right balance that result from bad earbud fit are good enough, users shouldn't have to worry all that much about getting things just right, adjusting during runs or other activity or anything else to change the quality on their own.
Apple has taken a few cracks at earphones, including its in-ear variant and the latest stock earbud redesign, but it has yet to hit a home run. If this patent comes into play with shipping products, that could change everything, and the in-ear model Apple sells is definitely due for a refresh
In today's Age opinion page, he writes: ''If the Wikileaks disclosures tell us anything, it is that no government, whatever its political colours, is going to hesitate for a nanosecond to conflate the notion of 'national security' with 'my own career security'.'' He calls for a challenge to the ''war on information … call it what it is - a growing and insidious attack on free speech''. Mr Gordon's stance was backed by several top barristers, who said neither official secrets nor terror laws provided any offences under which Mr Assange could be charged in Australia. Mr Assange also received support from more than 500 people who attended a rally outside the State Library in Melbourne. The rally was one of several held around the country, with backers calling for a ban on WikiLeaks censorship and for Mr Assange to be freed. Julian Burnside, QC, said of the government: ''I think they are trying to defend the indefensible.''
He said the state had an obligation to protect citizens who got into trouble in a foreign country. ''They ignored that obligation and instead sided with the Americans. They even went so far as to threaten to cancel his passport. That's exactly the opposite of what any self-respecting country ought to do.'' Ms Gillard insists the actions of Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, are illegal. Attorney-General Robert McClelland has said Wikileaks' actions are likely to be illegal. Yesterday Justice Minister Brendan O'Connor said it was entirely up to federal police to say whether Mr Assange had committed any crimes. Several barristers agreed that it would be stretching credulity to try to mount a case based on terror laws, such as a claim that Mr Assange had recklessly helped al-Qaeda by publishing a list of the sites the US most feared would be terror targets. Greg Barns, a barrister with experience of Australian terror trials, said: ''Even under the outrageous curtailing of freedom of speech that the anti-terror laws represent in this country, you couldn't even at a stretch maintain that there was an intention or even recklessness on the part of Mr Assange.''
Mr Barns and others pointed out that any charge laid against Mr Assange would also have to be laid against all the large media outlets that had republished his documents. Even the United States had so far failed in its search for an offence, Mr Assange's Melbourne solicitor, Rob Stary, said. ''This issue has also been examined by the Congressional Research Service in the US, and they made the same observation. He's the second person in the chain; he receives material, but he doesn't take it himself.'' Therefore, no offence could be identified, he said. Mr Stary said lawyers at the forum expressed ''enormous disquiet as to the role of government attempting to suppress this information'' and had criticised Ms Gillard and Mr McClelland for undermining the presumption of innocence. Loading Mr Burnside said: ''I think, standing back from it, what we have seen is what happens to a citizen who breaks the unwritten law about embarrassing the governments of powerful countries … If they want to avoid embarrassment, they shouldn't shut down freedom of information. They should stop acting embarrassingly.''

With so much player turnover in college baseball, teams often undergo a makeover every year or two. That's what the Florida Gators have been going through the past three or four months.
With so much player turnover in college baseball, teams often undergo a makeover every year or two. That's what the Florida Gators have been going through the past three or four months. A total body/lineup makeover. This will be a dramatically different UF team that opens the 2013 season tonight against Duke. Gone is most of the home-run power, gone are most of the stars who propelled the Gators to the College World Series the past three seasons. The Gators will try to get back to Omaha this year using many different methods. Say hello to small ball.
“To put things in perspective, we've lost 28 players in the last two years — 11 recruits and 17 players off the team to pro baseball,” UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan said. “We're getting some very, very good players, but we're losing some as well. That's the world we live in. “But when you dissect our team and what their strengths are … we can run and we're athletic, and we're going to do that. You can certainly win. You look at the teams that win in Omaha every year. It's not about home runs and that type of things. “Would I love to have (Mike) Zunino back, and (Preston) Tucker? Absolutely. But I'm very proud of who we have and what we've been able to do. This team has a chance to be very successful. It's just going to be in a different way.” Last year's stars are all pretty much gone, including Zunino, Tucker, Brian Johnson, Nolan Fontana, Daniel Pigott, Hudson Randall, Austin Maddox, Steven Rodriguez and Greg Larson. Tonight, the Gators will unveil an almost all-new lineup and an almost all-new pitching staff. For the first few weeks of the season, leading up to the start of SEC play, O'Sullivan said the Gators will be fluid in terms of their starting lineup. “We always do that,” he said. “We've never been a staff that has set their lineup for Game 1 and it stays the same through Game 56. “We've had a lot of players who have worked hard and earned the right to play and show what they can do. We have 12 to 13 position players that we do feel good about. We'll kind of rotate those guys in and out and see what they can do. We've pretty much always done that.” The staples in the lineup figure to be second baseman Casey Turgeon, freshman shortstop Richie Martin, catcher Taylor Gushue and outfielder Justin Shafer. Whatever the lineup combination, the Gators expect to have far less power than a year ago, when UF hit 75 home runs. Of the 75, only 14 were produced by returning players. “It's definitely a different feel than we had last year,” said Gushue, who takes over for Zunino behind the plate. “All the power we had in the lineup last year, it's unmatched. “But we have so much more speed than we had last year. There are different facets to our game we can add because we have so much speed. That's one of the pieces of the puzzle that's pretty cool. “Are we going to hit as many home runs as last year? No. But we're going to do other things to put us on the board. That's who we're going to have to be this year.” On the mound, with junior right-hander Karsten Whitson out for the season, the Gators return only one starting pitcher — junior Jonathon Crawford, the Friday night starter. Sources confirmed Thursday that Whitson underwent a procedure on his sore throwing shoulder by Dr. James Andrews and will not pitch again this season. Along with Crawford, the other starters heading into the opening series are true freshman Tucker Simpson and Shafer, UF's newest two-way player. “Justin didn't pitch a whole lot last year because we didn't need him to,” O'Sullivan said. “He's earned his starting role. Our hitters are 2-for-38 against him since we started scrimmaging. “We originally had him slotted in the (bullpen). He's been really good. I think he's kind of forced our hand to put him in a starting role.” O'Sullivan said Simpson, a highly rated true freshman, also has earned his role as the No. 2 starter. “He's 6-6 and he's got a great feel for the strike zone,” O'Sullivan said. “He's got four pitches. He's got an advanced feel for a changeup, and he's around the zone. The most important thing is he's very competitive. “He's pitched in some big games. He's been on the national scene for quite some time. He's certainly ready for this challenge.” As for the bullpen, O'Sullivan said he'll rotate a number of players over the next few weeks and eventually make a decision on a closer. Overall, there will be many new faces in many new roles this season. But the goal is the same: get to Omaha. “If you ask most anybody in the country right now, they feel good about their team. Everybody is undefeated,” O'Sullivan said. “But we do feel good about ourselves. “We also understand that everybody we play is going to be very talented and certainly very capable of beating us. We're a youthful group. There are going to be some ups and downs. But we have been practicing well. We've got some good camaraderie.” Contact Robbie Andreu at 352-374-5022 or andreur@gvillesun.com.

That didn't take very long. Any more Republicans want to lecture us again on the juicy terms and all the money we're going to make from this deal? Who ever would have guessed that $123 billion was not going to be enough? I need to sit down I'm so surprised.
The troubled insurance giant American International Group already has consumed three-quarters of a federal $123 billion rescue loan, a little more than a month after the government stepped in to save the company from bankruptcy.
AIG has borrowed $90.3 billion from the Federal Reserve's credit line as of yesterday, the bulk of it to pay off bad bets the company made in guaranteeing other firms' risky mortgage investments. That's up from roughly $83 billion AIG had borrowed a week ago, and the $68 billion level it reached a week before that. The news comes as the company's new chief executive warned Wednesday that the government's financial lifeline may not be enough to keep AIG afloat.
By now we're all familiar with the standard forms of renewable energy such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric. We've even seen new takes on some of these sources, and various kinetic devices to generate power from ocean waves. They all have their pros and cons, which is just the nature of things in our world, and so they all have some areas or uses that are better than some others. We are just lucky enough to live in a time where innovation seems to be ongoing and we see new ideas, some viable, some are likely to remain only ideas for a variety of reasons, though most often because the technology isn't advanced enough to make them viable just yet. One company that has an idea that is already being put to use is Lucid Energy.
In a few cities there is a novel idea already in use and most of us are completely unaware of it and part of the reason for that is that it isn't visible to us in our day-to-day lives. For instance, in Portland they have installed water pipes that contain mini turbines and generators built right in. These pipes are able to produce power as water flows through them, and that power can then either be used to help run the systems that supply the water to the city, or it can be sold and shifted to the main grid. In either case it helps cut down on costs and strain on the main electric grid because water is always flowing in the pipes beneath our cities.
Another benefit is that they can also monitor the quality of the water that is running through the pipes thus allowing the city to better keep up to date on any impending issues and fix them sooner. It may not be able to power the entire city, but this is a great idea to help provide some extra power by utilizing an existing source with zero environmental impact.

BRUSLY, Louisiana – A family began to suspect that someone was peeping into the window of their 16-year-old's daughter's bedroom window. They initially thought it may just be kids playing a prank, but to be on the safe side they contacted police. A hidden camera was installed outside the home to hopefully capture the culprit(s) the family felt had been lurking around the home. What they ended up recorded was equal parts disturbing, pathetic and hilarious. Well, hilarious to me. What they captured was 22-year-old Charles Kazmir peeping into the teen's window. With his pants off. Jacking off. Charles Kazmir later admitted to looking into the girl's bedroom and bathroom windows on seven different occasions. Kazmir has been charged with seven counts of criminal trespassing, obscenity, voyeurism, peeping tom and criminal mischief. I am sure his parents are extremely proud of their son and any chance he may have had scoring with chicks in his area just fell about a bazillion points.
Something I thought was odd is the fact that Charles felt the need to completely remove his pants. Not sure if there is more of a thrill to doing that or not, but if I were peeping in some chick's house to toss one off on the bricks while she takes a piss, I'd want to be in a position to bolt if the need arises. I mean, he couldn't just pull his dick out and masturbate? But kinda glad he decided to go all “free willy” as a dude wearing nothing but a shirt and socks is a funny sight. Chicks can pull that off and look hot as hell. Dudes, well, not so much.
Hopefully Charles has learned his lesson and that if you are gonna do this kinda shit, do it in your car during morning traffic. Prefereably at traffic lights. Get them on your driver side, turn and stare at them while you do it. As an added bonus, be sure to keep your eyes and mouth wide open with your tongue hanging out occasionally licking your window. Bob up and down real quick too. They love when you do that.

The Chinese government is reportedly preparing to allow the resumption of cryptocurrency trading in the country in the coming months, with the required anti-money laundering (AML) systems and licensing programs in place.
A statement posted on Chinese state news agency Xinhua disclosed that the Beijing government has been concerned with “the crime situation” surrounding domestic special currency trading, given that cryptocurrencies have become the top choice by criminals to use for activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling and illegal fund-raising.
This concern has led to a government-mandated ban on cryptocurrency trading in the country last month, with most of China-based exchanges—including Big 3 exchanges BTC China, OKCoin and Huobi—announcing that they will stop yuan-denominated trading by the end of October. As a result, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $3,000 level as traders leave China and its unpredictable government in favor of cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions like Japan and nearby Hong Kong.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong-based exchange TideBit CEO Terence Tsang said based on the number of mainland customers opening up accounts at TideBit, it appears that the ban hasn't stopped Chinese investors from buying cryptocurrencies.
“They still want to play the game. I see a growing need in that they will come to Hong Kong or Singapore to buy cryptocurrency,” Tsang said, according to the report.
The Beijing ban, however, could soon be nearing its end.
The state-backed editorial piece, written by reporter Pan Ye, pushed for a “zero tolerance” approach towards crimes related to cryptocurrency. However, the editorial also made a list of suggestions for virtual currency “risk prevention, strong supervision” requirements, indicating that a licensing system for domestic cryptocurrency exchanges may be on the horizon.
Among the suggestions was the establishment of “a sound regulatory framework” and a “select targeted regulatory measures” that will require exchanges to introduce policies for filing management, licensing, anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and large transaction limits.
“The risk of virtual currency trading platform and even the crime situation, to further strengthen supervision, with ‘zero tolerance' attitude from the source to block the financial security risks,” the report stated.

Around the first anniversary of the infamous beheadings of 21 Coptic Christians on a Libyan beach, believers worldwide celebrated the release of the kidnapped Assyrian Christians that were feared to become ISIS's next propaganda massacre. (Instead, it was Ethiopians.)
Shortly after the videotaped martyrdoms in February 2015, the Islamist extremists kidnapped more than 200 Assyrian Christians in Syria's Hasakah province as the so-called Islamic State expanded its territory.
Some worried that ISIS would threaten to kill the hostages unless the US ended joint air strikes. Others speculated that ISIS would ask for a prisoner exchange for jihadists held by Kurdish forces.
“In light of the ISIS militants' “barbaric record with the captured,” Assyrian Church of the East leader Emmnauel Youkhana told one outlet, “the destiny of these families is a major concern to us.”
Instead, a few were executed. Five went missing. For the hundreds of remaining captives, ...

[EDITOR'S NOTE: I can't speak to the translation or the veracity of the website...but still think this is, at least, interesting. - DDC]
There is a (what I found) very interesting article on one Czech web page. It is based on interview with Hejda. He is talking about Hejduk, Sacco and current management and coaching changes. I have translated several most interesting quotes. You can see and Google Translate the whole article here: http://hokej.idnes.cz/hejdukovo-utrpeni-konci-zacnou-se-k-nemu-chovat-jako-k-legende-p6g-/nhl.aspx?c=A130527_202525_nhl_cig
Here is my translation:
Hejda on Sacco handling Hejduk:
He had no respect for the players and this was most associated with Milan. I give you an example: We are experienced and able to cope with the fact that we are not in line up. But for Milan to arrive two hours before the game at the stadium and only then to discover he is not playing, it's just silly. Mostly it is done differently: the player will know in the morning in order to arrive at the match, not that he is there for two hours waiting for a start, sitting in the stands and drinking coffee. This is twice as true when it comes to club legend.
On management:
Of course some members (of management) and even Joe Sakic did not agree with it but on the other hand there were several people who stood behind the coach. It was divided into groups.
On coaching change:
Basically I think it was a relief for everyone on the team because it was not working. I do not think I'd find anyone who would not agree with this change. Including me, although I did not have personal problems with the coach.
On Sacco's system and use of players:
We had poor results also due to inappropriately chosen system. I do not want to say he was a bad coach but Sacco did not take into account the types of players he has. Did not adapt style to them but instead forced them into something that did not fit them. I hope that new coach will understand this.
On Hejduk's future:
For a long time I persuaded him to give it another try. He said that if they change a coach he will go for another year. Now it only depends on whether he gets a new contract.
Porn studio Malibu Media has filed more than 4,300 lawsuits over Internet piracy since 2009, making it the most litigious copyright holder in the nation. The lawsuits accuse users at particular IP addresses of downloading Malibu's movies via BitTorrent. Malibu can only get contact information for the defendants from ISPs, who know which subscriber holds which IP address at any given time.
Now one big ISP, Verizon, is apparently tired of the dragnet tactics being used by Malibu Media and its attorneys. On Monday, Verizon filed a motion to quash (PDF) Malibu's newest subpoena, calling it an overreach that threatens Verizon's ability to, among other things, help law enforcement with their subpoenas.
In the motion, Verizon describes Malibu's practice of suing thousands of people for alleged copyright violations. The cases follow a "common arc," Verizon lawyers explain, quoting another case:
(1) a plaintiff sues anywhere from a few to thousands of Doe defendants for copyright infringement in one action; (2) the plaintiff seeks leave to take early discovery; (3) once the plaintiff obtains the identities of the IP subscribers through early discovery, it serves the subscribers with a settlement demand; (4) the subscribers, often embarrassed about the prospect of being named in a suit, settle ....
The subpoenas are taking increasing amounts of time, as Verizon employees "evaluate and respond to competing and sometimes overlapping requests for information."
In this case, Malibu is seeking much more than an IP address and name. Its document requests, posted Monday on the blog Fight Copyright Trolls, include demands for any DMCA or other copyright notices sent to the subscriber in question. It wants records about any rental of a router or modem to the customer and records about Verizon's "policies and procedures regarding the installation and maintenance of passwords on a subscriber's modem or router."
To boot, Malibu demands that a Verizon representative show up for a deposition about the records. The porn company's lawyers unilaterally set the date of the deposition as September 28, the last day of discovery in the case.
"The subpoena was issued from this district but served in Texas, and purports to command the appearance of Verizon's representatives—who reside in the D.C. area—to appear and testify in a faraway state, i.e., outside the 100-mile radius for commanding testimony of a witness," Verizon lawyers write. They add that Malibu's outside general counsel, Keith Lipscomb, "is well aware" that the relevant Verizon employees are based in DC.
The porn producer "is seeking much more invasive information which is expressly prohibited" by a subsection of the Cable Act, Verizon lawyers tell the judge. They accuse Lipscomb of selectively quoting the Cable Act in such a way as to suggest he's entitled to information that's actually reserved for law enforcement.
And speaking of law enforcement, Verizon attorneys don't miss their chance to make the point that Malibu's pile of lawsuits actually interferes with information requests that come from the cops.
"With more than one thousand cases filed by Malibu Media this year alone, permitting depositions of Verizon would create an entire industry devoted to discovery of ISPs," they write, "and take away from resources needed to respond to law enforcement personnel and others who require Verizon's attention to emergency criminal investigations, and other pressing business."
Monday's motion to quash follows recent Verizon objections in another Malibu case.
It raises the question of whether other ISPs will choose to push back against Malibu's style of litigation. Tangling with ISPs has led to adverse results for other mass copyright campaigns, including that of Prenda Law, which went so far as to sue AT&T and Comcast, saying the ISPs were siding with the pirates. That suit ended with Prenda being ordered to pay the ISPs' legal fees.
How do you design a filter that (ideally) has the same gain for all frequencies? And, furthermore, why would you want to do this?
Related Information
We're all familiar with low-pass and high-pass filters—the former attenuate high frequencies and the latter attenuate low frequencies. Most of us probably know something about band-pass filters, which attenuate everything above or below a specified frequency range. Maybe some of us have worked with band-stop (AKA notch) filters, which attenuate a specified band of frequencies.
But I wonder how many people are familiar with a fifth filter topology that has the unusual characteristic of providing equal magnitude response for all frequencies. This is what we call an all-pass filter, though I suppose you could also call it a no-stop filter. It has the easiest Bode plot you'll ever have to draw:
But Why?
As you may have guessed by now, the all-pass filter is by no means as useless as it first appears. The magnitude response is uninteresting, to be sure, but don't forget about the other effect produced by filters: phase shift. The all-pass filter is a phase manipulator—you can selectively adjust the phase of the signals passing through the filter without altering the amplitude.
All-pass filters are used in circuits referred to as “phase equalizers” or “delay equalizers.” As discussed in Understanding Linear-Phase Filters, it is sometimes important to ensure that all the frequency components in a signal experience equal temporal delay.
Perhaps the most intuitive example is audio signals—the frequency components corresponding to the various pitches need to reach the speaker at the same time. This can be achieved by using linear-phase filters, but it is also possible to use all-pass filters to compensate for delay inequalities introduced by preceding filter stages.
How Much Phase Shift?
As you know, a filter with one pole is referred to as a first-order filter, and that one pole produces a total phase shift of 90° centered on the cutoff frequency f c (i.e., the phase shift at f c is 45°).
The situation is a bit different, though, with all-pass filters. A first-order all-pass filter has one pole, but it also has a symmetrically located zero:
This leads to an additional 90° of phase shift. Thus, a first-order all-pass provides a total phase shift of 180°, with the phase shift at f c being 90° instead of 45°.
The Circuits
A first-order all-pass can be implemented with or without an op-amp. Here is the purely passive topology:
$$f_c=\frac{1}{2\pi R_1C_1}$$
The passive circuit is a bit awkward. The output is not referenced to ground, and the gain is 0.5 instead of unity. And, of course, you have the typical passive-filter problem of relatively low input impedance and relatively high output impedance.
You will probably prefer the op-amp version; it has the same simple formula for determining the cutoff frequency, the output signal is referenced to ground, and the gain is unity.
$$f_c=\frac{1}{2\pi R_1C_1}$$
This particular circuit can be thought of as being inverting for low frequencies and noninverting for high frequencies: the phase shift starts at –180° and transitions to 0° through the region surrounding the cutoff frequency. You can modify this behavior by swapping R 1 and C 1 :
The gain and cutoff frequency are the same, but now the phase shift begins at 0° and transitions to –180°.
This week marks the anniversary of one the most tragic events in black history — the Rosewood massacre — the result of rape accusations made by a white woman against a black man, which led to violent riots and the murder of several innocent African-Americans in January of 1923. To commemorate this event, historian Dr. Marvin Dunn interviews the last survivor of Rosewood and sheds new light on the event that still haunts African-Americans.
She was the last person alive with a living memory of Rosewood the north Florida black town that was consumed in racial rage this week more than eight decades ago. She was eight when it happened and her memory was as clear as a bell. Robie Mortin and I were friends. I met her well into her nineties living in an assisted living complex in West Palm Beach where what was left of her family settled after the event.
“I was in third grade,” she once told me. “I could read and write. I remember everything;” like playing in her aunt Sarah Carrier's yard every Sunday after church, like the plum trees that grew in her yard, like getting apples at Christmas and dancing and playing games on Emancipation Day; and the night the mob burned the town down.
Mortin had never gone back except for a short visit when the governor and state officials dedicated a historic marker on Highway 24, but that was not to touch the ground, to smell the woods or to go to the old graveyard where her mother is buried. But in 2008 she allowed me to take her back twice and she showed me everything.
We walked the railroad bed where the rails had been moved many years ago but the raised rail bed still runs true through the woods like a green tunnel; to the place where the Masonic lodge stood which was the building in which she attended school; and to that graveyard that not only holds her mother's bones but those of many Rosewood pioneers and victims. Her aunt Sarah who was killed during those terrible days is there. So is her uncle, Sam Carter who was the first person to be killed in the massacre. She lived in his house.
She recalled the cold night the mobs came. The moon was full and bright; so bright you could see shadows at mid-night. “My daddy told us to get up and put on all of our heavy clothes. He said the people were shooting and they had to get out of Rosewood.”
A lot of people had to get out of Rosewood that night. Mortin and her aunt Polly, Sam Carter's mother, were fortunate. They made it to the train depot from which they escaped to Chiefland about twenty miles away. Many others spent several freezing nights hiding in the dank woods trying to avoid the mobs.
Rosewood had been the perfect storm for racial violence. All of the usual suspects applied, an alleged sexual attack by a black man on a white woman, a black man with an attitude and lots of friends who had guns, economic jealousy because many blacks in Rosewood were doing better than the back woods whites who lived around them and the killing by blacks of a white law enforcement officer.
It had all been a lie. Mortin had heard the stories over the years. The white woman, Fannie Taylor was having an affair and almost got caught when her lover beat her one morning while her husband was at work. Fannie said a black man did it and that was all it took. Over the following week hundreds of white men descended upon Rosewood vengeance in mind and torches in hand. Sylvester Carrier would emerge as the hero of the moment. He gathered up his family and hunkered down in his mother's large two-story home. He was a Mason.
“Almost all of the men out there were Masons”, Mortin recalled. The night the mob came to the Carrier House an unknown number of heavily armed black men were waiting. Some were hidden in the woods. It was a gathering of Masons. When it was all over eight people were dead including Sylvester and his mother Sarah, Robie's aunt.
She and Sam Carter's mother moved to Riviera Beach which had become home to many Rosewood survivors.
“The old black cemetery in Riviera Beach is filled with Rosewood folks,” she once told me. In June of 2010 she joined them. On my way to Rosewood I had seen her the day before she died in a hospice facility in West Palm Beach. No one else was left who could remember what happened that desperately cold night in 1923.
What she left behind was a loving family and a many grateful friends, including me.
Google and Yahoo have already announced measures they are taking to secure user data in the wake of the revelations about the NSA surveillance of their internal networks and of external user Web traffic. Now Microsoft has joined in the trend, moving to expand the company's use of encryption for both its internal and external networks—promising cryptographic protection across the board by the end of 2014.
While Microsoft already encrypts much of its data, the move to be more transparent about measures to protect customer privacy comes as the US cloud industry faces losses of customers. The New York Times reports that Forrester Research projected that US cloud providers could lose as much as a quarter of their revenue—$180 billion—over the next three years as a result of the NSA revelations and a loss of confidence in American IT companies. And Yahoo's moves to protect its data have been largely criticized as too little and much too late, particularly as documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the company was at times the largest source of data for NSA surveillance.
Microsoft's announcement goes beyond beefing up its encryption. The company is also seeking to expand the legal measures in place to protect customer data, including doing more to fight gag orders placed on the company that prevent it from notifying customers when it receives FISA warrants or other legal orders associated with their data. And the company is "enhancing the transparency of our software code" to allow customers to verify the absence of backdoors, according to a blog post Wednesday evening by Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel and executive vice president for Legal and Corporate Affairs.
"Like many others, we are especially alarmed by recent allegations in the press of a broader and concerted effort by some governments to circumvent online security measures—and in our view, legal processes and protections—in order to surreptitiously collect private customer data," Smith wrote. "If true, these efforts threaten to seriously undermine confidence in the security and privacy of online communications. Indeed, government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyberattacks."
While Smith said there was "no direct evidence" that Microsoft's network had been breached by the NSA or other government agencies, the company is moving to expand its existing encryption efforts to encompass all its software-as-a-service and cloud developer platforms. In many cases, 2048-bit key cryptography is already in use, such as with the Office 365 service and Windows Azure storage. That encryption is applied between Microsoft and its customers and between Microsoft's own data centers. But the entirety of Microsoft's internal and external network communications will use crypto by the end of 2014. Smith added that Microsoft would also encrypt all "customer content" stored on its servers and offer the tools to do the same to developers building applications in the Windows Azure cloud.
Microsoft is also working to encrypt traffic passing between its services and those of other cloud providers—and other Web mail providers in particular—using Transport Layer Security.
The additional transparency promised by Microsoft does not mean that the company will be publishing its source code or giving all customers access to the code for review. Instead, the company will open "transparency centers" worldwide to expand its existing program to allow government customers to review its source code. "We'll open these centers in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, and we'll further expand the range of products included in these programs," Smith wrote.
With the 15 teams in the Rocket League Championship Series locked in, it's time to predict how each will stack up in their regions. Europe? Check. North America? Check.
Here's our predictions for the six-week RLCS season beginning this Saturday.
North America
1. G2 Esports
G2 Esports comes in with its best roster to date, one that finally lives up to the skill of captain Cameron "Kronovi" Bills. If G2 plays to its potential skill level and Dillon "Rizzo" Rizzo can keep his form going, it should comfortably finish with the top spot in North America.
2. NRG Esports
A very close second, NRG Esports will look to complete its third time as the No. 1 seed from North America. With the addition of Garrett "GarrettG" Gordon, the team has "potential," but to call it a favorite would be a stretch. The match between G2 and NRG could decide North America's top spot.
3. Genesis
Genesis is hard to dissect. Purely based off of individual skill, it'd rank easily in the Top 3. The potential to tilt looms largely over Genesis though. When it's lost a first game in a three-set series, it's shown signs of struggle. But if Genesis can keep its heads level and keep Trevor "Insolences" Carmody in his current form, the sky is the limit.
4. Selfless
Whether or not Selfless can finish in the Top 4 relies heavily on how consistent its lineup can be. If it keeps rolling on its current momentum, it'll likely clinch that spot. Selfless has shown its potential peak with a win over Iris, and if that level sticks around, Selfless could even take down G2 or NRG, and perhaps push higher.
5. Take 3
Take 3 had a worrying start to the offseason, locking in its roster at pretty much the last minute. The team looked strong in open qualifiers though; losing 3-2 to Genesis isn't a bad start and a sweep over Heroes of Tomorrow to qualify looks pretty good, all things considered. If you Take 3 can improve as it plays together, it might even be able to start taking sets off Genesis.
6. Denial Esports
Denial is a team that we underrated mostly due to lack of results. Losing 3-1 to NRG and beating Spectrum and Eggplant isn't a terrible result in any way, but Denial will look to keep pushing up towards the upper echelons of North American Rocket League.
7. Atelier
Atelier is hard to rank. It has one of the best single players in North America, Isaac "Turtle" App, but what he has surrounded himself with looks nowhere near the level of Orbit from last season. Losing 3-2 to Radiance is frankly a shocking result for the level Atelier would expect to play at. Bringing it back a bit by taking down Freestylers In Disguise 3-1 is a much more solid record, but we need to see more from Atelier to move them up the rankings.
8. Radiance
It feels wrong to rank Radiance so low, since it completed the biggest comeback in all of RLCS. Taking down both Iris and Atelier to qualify in the winners bracket is one of the biggest upsets in the history of Rocket League. Unfortunately, it seems quite likely that Radiance will be the punching bag of North American League Play.
Europe
1. FlipSid3 Tactics
FlipSid3 Tactics is still the best team in the world. We've said this for eight months but it's really just the truth. Led by Mark "Markydooda" Exton, FlipSid3 will look to solidify the fact that it's still the top dog in global Rocket League. The only concerns for the team and its dream of a second consecutive title are the surging contenders, Northern Gaming and Team Secrecy.
2. Northern Gaming
What do you get when you take the second best team in the world and add the best free agent in the world? A true contender for the top spot. David "Deevo" Morrow will look to be the edge Northern needs to surpass FlipSid3. While that's a tall order, Northern should feel confident in its ability to become top contenders in Europe, especially under the leadership of Remco "Remkoe" den Boer.
3. Team Secrecy
Team Secrecy today is the fruition of a lot of hard work. With the addition of Linus "al0t" Möllergren, the team has hopes of being a contender at the very top of the global stage. Qualifying with a 3-0 over Red Eye, Secrecy might just ride that wave of good form for all it's worth as it heads into League Play.
4. Pocket Aces
Pocket comes in over Mock-it for one reason and one reason alone: the 3-2 defeat it handed Mock-it to qualify for League Play. Pocket and Mock-it are as close as two teams can be and the fact that one of them will most likely not qualify for the Grand Finals feels like a crime. With the core of the Mock-it roster that finished second last season, Pocket coming in fourth is much more of a testament to Europe's strength than its individual weakness.
5. Mock-it Esports
Mock-it qualified for League Play 3-0 over PENTA after a heartbreaking loss to Pocket Aces. If we could put two teams in fourth, we would, but unfortunately, someone has to end up fifth and today that's Mock-it. Similarly to Pocket, Mock-it being fifth speaks truly to how stacked Europe is as a region. If the team were in North America, Mock-it would be surely be contending for the top spot.
6. The Leftovers
The Leftovers qualified for the RLCS League Play with a 3-1 over Leaf Esports. Don't let the scoreline deceive you, the performance put in by Nicolai "Snaski" Andersen was one of the best individual performances in the history of Rocket League. If Snaski can somehow keep that level up for League Play, two things will happen: One, Snaski will inevitably become the best player in the world. Two, Leftovers will make the Grand Finals. Short of that, a sixth place gatekeeper finish for The Leftovers is the expected result.
7. Cow Nose
Cow Nose (formerly Xedec Nation) begins the group rounding out Europe's League Play participants. Beating The Leftovers 3-2 almost edged the sixth spot for Cow Nose and getting 3-0'd by FlipSid3 is nothing look down upon but if you want to be a Top 6 team in RLCS, dropping a game to Copenhagen Flames can't happen. Cow Nose is a solid team but the skill above it is going to be hard to surpass.
Copenhagen Flames/Leaf Esports/Red Eye/PENTA
Due to Zentox being disqualified, a playoff will be held between the four teams listed above to determine the final participant..
A shoplifter trying to make a supervillan's getaway after stealing from a Times Square comic book store plunged two stories onto the sidewalk below, police said. Ray Villeda reports.
A shoplifter trying to make a super-villain's getaway after stealing from a Times Square comic book store plunged two stories onto the sidewalk below, police said.
The shoplifter at Midtown Comics on West 40th Street fell through a second-story window after first trying to bull-rush his way out at about 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, according to the NYPD.
Witnesses at the scene said that the shoplifter landed on the ground and tried to crawl, bruised and bloodied, to a van nearby. But he was taken into custody by officers before getting away.
A food vendor across the street said he heard the glass break, and when he looked behind, he saw the man "flying."
"It was like we were in a comic book movie," said one street vendor. "And a villain got kicked out of the window onto my table!"
Another witness said he'd seen the man in Times Square with comic books and other items on the street before.
It's not clear what the man had tried to steal, but authorities said he went through the window in an attempt of getting away from security guards at the store.
The 24-year-old suspect, who police haven't publicly named and say is homeless, is charged with criminal mischief, assault, criminal possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of marijuana.
He's being treated for minor cuts and bruises.

As the influence of Big Data continues to permeate the tech world, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the intricacies of the field. To help you get to grips with some of the fundamental concepts and terms, we have compiled a brief guide of what we feel are the most important definitions you should know. (If you are new to Big Data, then you might also want to check out our overview of industry-favourite Apache Hadoop)
Algorithm: A set of rules given to an AI, neural network, or other machine to help it learn on its own; classification, clustering, recommendation, and regression are four of the most popular types.
Apache Hadoop: An open-source tool to process and store large distributed data sets across many machines by using MapReduce.
Apache Spark: An open-source big data processing engine that runs on top of Apache Hadoop, Mesos, or the cloud.
Artificial intelligence: The development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
Blob storage: A Microsoft Azure service that stores unstructured data in the cloud as a blob or an object.
Cluster: A subset of data that share particular characteristics. A cluster can also refer to several machines that work together to solve a single problem.
Cassandra: A popular open source database management system from Apache. Cassandra was designed to handle large volumes of data across distributed servers.
Data flow management: The specialised process of ingesting raw device data, while managing the flow of thousands of producers and consumers. Once ingested a series of steps are then applied to prepare the data for further business processing, these include: data enrichment, analysis in stream, aggregation, splitting, schema translation, and format conversion.
Dark data: This refers to all the data that is gathered by enterprises but not used for any meaningful purposes. It is ‘dark' and may never be analysed. It may take the form of things like social network feeds, call center logs, meeting notes, and other miscellaneous items. It is estimated that between 60-90% of all collected data is ‘dark', but the exact figure is unknown.
Data lake: A storage repository that holds raw data in its native format.
Data mining: Finding meaningful patterns and deriving insights in large sets of data using sophisticated pattern recognition techniques. To derive meaningful patterns, data scientists use statistics, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence.
Data scientist: Someone who can make sense of big data by extracting raw data and working with it to come up with useful insights and analytics. Data scientists need to be skilled in statistics, computer science, story telling and have a good understanding of the business context they work in.
Data warehouse : Repositories for enterprise-wide data – but in a structured format after cleaning and integrating with other sources. They are typically used for conventional data (but not exclusively).
Device layer: The entire range of sensors, actuators, smartphones, gateways, and industrial equipment that send data streams corresponding to their environment and performance characteristics.
Distributed File System: As big data is too large to store on a single system, a Distributed File System is a data storage system meant to store large volumes of data across multiple storage devices. This helps to decrease the cost and complexity of storing large amounts of data.
Machine learning: Machine learning is a method of designing systems that can learn, adjust, and improve based on the data fed to them. Using predictive and statistical algorithms that are fed to these machines, they learn and continually zero in on “correct” behavior and insights and they keep improving as more data flows through the system.
MapReduce: A data processing model that filters and sorts data in the Map stage, then performs a function on that data and returns an output in the Reduce stage. MapReduce is the foundational component of Apache Hadoop.
Munging: The process of manually converting or mapping data from one raw form into another format for more convenient consumption.
Normalizing: The process of organising data into tables so that the results of using the database are always unambiguous and as intended.
NoSQL: This stands for Not Only SQL (Standard Query Language). NoSQL refers to database management systems that are designed to handle large volumes of data that do not have a structure or ‘schema' (like relational SQL databases have). NoSQL databases are often well-suited for big data systems because of their flexibility in the type of data they can accommodate.
Predictive analytics: Using collected data in order to forecast with probabilities what might happen in the coming weeks, months or years.
R: An open-source language primarily used for data visualization and predictive analytics.
Stream processing: The real-time processing of data. The data is processed continuously, concurrently, and record-by-record.
Structured data: Anything than can be put into relational databases and organized in such a way that it relates to other data via tables.
Unstructured data: Data that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner e.g. email messages, social media posts and recorded human speech etc.

Staffing is the latest hurdle facing Nashville's growing hospitality industry, which is set to add over 100 restaurants and more than 3,000 hotel rooms by the end of next year.
A sparsely attended career fair at Music City Center on Tuesday reflects a much bigger problem facing the city.
Looking around the mostly empty ballroom, it's obvious that Nashville's hotels and restaurants are having a hard time finding new hires. Among the hardest hit areas are unglamorous entry-level jobs like line cooks and housekeepers, says Dan Piotrowski.
The Omni Music City general manager says that hospitality brands are trying to make unskilled jobs more attractive by providing clearer paths towards more lucrative careers.
“So while someone may come and work at the front desk, we're looking at the skillset of that individual and their aptitude to grow them maybe into a sales manager – not immediately, but down the road," says Piotrowski.
Piotrowski says that the city is also focusing on high schoolers as a source of future hires – they've established hospitality training programs in five Metro high schools.

Un aumento globale del livello del mare sta accelerando e i ghiacci perenni della Groenlandia sono i primi a patirne le conseguenze. Dato questo ritmo incalzante, è possibile che entro la fine di questo secolo l'innalzamento del livello del mare possa minacciare le comunità costiere di tutto il mondo, da Miami a Mumbai.
Un nuovo studio, pubblicato sulla rivista Nature Climate Change, è una delle poche ricerche recenti avviate per verificare l'accelerazione del livello del mare nel corso degli ultimi decenni. C'era stata maggiore incertezza in passato, quando sosteneva che tale accelerazione non si stesse verificando.
Tuttavia, utilizzando i calcoli dei vari fattori che contribuiscono all'innalzamento del livello del mare, come ad esempio lo scioglimento dei ghiacciai, l'espansione degli spazi di acqua che si verifica con gli oceani caldi, e di altri fattori, i ricercatori di diverse istituzioni in Cina, Australia e negli Stati Uniti hanno scoperto che il livello medio del mare globale è aumentato da circa 2,2 millimetri all'anno nel 1993 a 3,3 millimetri all'anno nel 2014.
Anche se questo può sembrare un dato insignificante, i numeri si sommano rapidamente. Queste variazioni dei tassi sono la differenza tra un tasso di aumento del livello del mare decennale di 0,86 a e 1,29, con una maggiore accelerazione attesa in futuro.
I risultati anche reso chiaro come i principali responsabili del cambiamento del livello del mare stiano cambiando nel corso del tempo. E non dipingono un bel quadro. Se la perdita di massa di ghiaccio globale costituiva il 50 per cento dell'aumento del livello del mare nel 1993, questo è salito al 70 per cento nel 2014. Lo studio ha rilevato che il maggior aumento è venuto dalla calotta glaciale della Groenlandia, che ha compensato solo il 5 per cento della crescita globale del tasso del livello medio del mare nel 1993 e ora costituisce il 25 per cento di esso.
Date le preoccupazioni degli scienziati sulla stabilità dell'Antartide, ora cercano nello scioglimento dei ghiacciai una quota ancora maggiore del bilancio del livello del mare in un prossimo futuro. I risultati di questa settimana sono in linea con le stime della NASA per l'attuale tasso di aumento del livello del mare, che è di 3,4 millimetri all'anno .
Il significato del nuovo studio è quello di risolvere le incertezze persistenti circa discrepanze tra ciò che gli scienziati sono a conoscenza dell'innalzamento del livello del mare e i tassi misurati dai satelliti. Questo studio, insieme ad altri lavori recenti, mostra i due match up da vicino e inchioda proprio l'accelerazione del livello del mare.
Inoltre, la nuova ricerca mostra che le comunità costiere che sono già alle prese con aumento delle inondazioni su base annuale, quali Miami Beach, dovranno far fronte a una situazione in rapido peggioramento nei prossimi decenni. Per ogni millimetro che il livello del mare acquista, più facile diventa per l'oceano colpire con livelli di piena mai visti prima.
Clinical trial space found at SA Health and Medical Research Institute building
Updated
A dispute over a lack of clinical trial room at the new Royal Adelaide Hospital may be resolved by using space at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) building.
Two internal reports showed not all clinical trials could continue at the new hospital due to space constraints.
The Government had suggested moving some trials to the Eleanor Harrald building at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, but clinicians rejected the plan.
Eight staff members involved in administration functions will now be located at the SAHMRI next to the new hospital on North Terrace.
There will be space in the new hospital for 132 staff involved in face-to-face patient consultations as previously planned.
About 140 staff are currently working on 287 clinical trials at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, with another 100 trials expected to start in the next year.
Clinicians had said that beneficial research and drug funding could be lost interstate if there was not room for all trials at the new hospital.
An analysis done by a senior clinician Michael James on behalf of all clinical trial coordinators and investigators found the Eleanor Harrald building was completely unsuitable.
In the report, researchers warned that splitting trials across two locations would lead to a second rate new hospital and lead to reduced recruitment and gross inefficiency.
Small number of staff to be located close by
Health Minister Jack Snelling said the trials being conducted were world class.
"These important trials will deliver potentially lifesaving medical breakthroughs for many years to come," he said.
New RAH Activation executive director Paul Lambert said the trials would be located "where the action is".
"We have been able to allocate space for nearly all researchers within the new RAH, with a small number utilising space in the SAHMRI next door," he said.
"There has been great progress and great cooperation and we will continue to work with researchers to finalise plans for the move."
Australian Medical Association state president Janice Fletcher welcomed the latest development.
"The need for clinical research to continue uninterrupted by the relocation has been a longstanding area of concern and advocacy for the AMA," she said.
"Finally the Government has responded and we welcome the promise to continue this important work.
"Clinical research is a vital component of any major health facility, let alone a flagship hospital."

One of Wales' biggest employers, Admiral, warned transport links in the South East of the country are not good enough. David Stevens, the Chief Operating Officer at the insurance firm which employs 5,000 people in South Wales, says many people are held back by poor transport link, particularly in the Valleys.
It comes on the day that a task force set up by the Welsh Government to work on improving transport infrastructure delivered its first interim report. The South Wales Integrated Transport Task Force said it aims to "develop a vision of sustainable modern integrated public transport system", which it said could help "economic growth and job creation" and improve "accessibility for economically inactive people to employment centres, and also promoting social cohesion and reducing poverty."
Last year, it was announced that the electrification of the Great Western Line from London Paddington will continue to Swansea, and the Valleys lines will also be electrified. The investment, worth £350m, will start between 2014 and 2019.

However, the task force expressed doubt over the most high-profile transport plans for South East Wales, a rapid transit metro system. It said the plans "require significant technical developments and value for money consideration."
No, the Internet doesn't travel through the air. Nor does it live in one big, epic cloud. In fact, chances are it's traveling under your feet right now.
To demonstrate the trajectory of the Internet, Fortune magazine writer Andrew Blum and graphic designer Nicolas Rapp teamed up with telecom data and infrastructure company GeoTel Communications. The company maps fiber optic cables and geographic information systems (GIS) that connect people all over the world.
The result was a Fortune article called "Mapping the Internet." The piece contains stunning visuals that literally display where said fiber optic cables run: for the most part underwater, across the worlds's largest oceans.
These cables transfer data in the form of light to and from power repeaters in major cities — such as Hong Kong and New York — in a matter of milliseconds.
From there, the cables become part of an interconnected metro communications grid, whereupon carriers like AT&T and local government create lateral hubs by pulling cable conduits into darkened buildings on the street. One of the largest in Manhattan is 60 Hudson.
Although the physicality of the Internet boggles most people's minds, people like Dave Drazen have been working hands-on with it for decades. He launched GeoTel 12 years ago and continues as its CEO today, busier than ever as the world demands more, better, faster web connections.
"Most people have no clue what the world's communication infrastructure looks like," Drazen tells Mashable. "When they open this [article] up, they're astonished. You're actually mapping the Internet right here."
The information his company collects helped in creating the maps you see here, which appeared in Fortune magazine as well as in interactive form on its tablet app. The world map (as seen from the North Pole) visualizes major fiber optic cable lines as they run between major cities, most of which are financial and trading hubs where a millisecond's delay in communications can make or break entire economies.
<img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mapping-the-internet-ny.jpg" alt="" title="mapping-the-internet-ny" width="780" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-1225991" />
The article also features a map of Manhattan's cable system, which centers on Wall Street. In the name of security, the map doesn't get too detailed by naming streets that house heavily populated data conduits or the carriers that operate them. On Drazen's insistence, no bridges or tunnels were included on this map either.
"[GeoTel is] granular down to the street corner," explains Drazen. "But we really have to be sensitive that it's a worldwide publication, that we're secure in what we're putting out there."
According to him, however, the information on each of his company's micro-specific fiber optic maps is available in the public realm. The Freedom of Information Act maintains that the public has the right to know where that fiber is running.
"If you were to go to any number of websites, they publish their metro fiber routes online," says Drazen. "The information that we research and get comes directly from the carriers themselves [about 80%] ... The other part we get from the web." He cites websites like Level3.com, which collect and share that knowledge.
Even the average pedestrian can pick out the general locations of fiber channels running beneath their feet. The law requires that utility companies place aboveground labels on manhole covers or designate areas with a white-capped orange stick to prevent construction projects from accidentally cutting cables.
New York City itself houses some 75-100 carriers, which means fiber conduits oftentimes run every 500 feet.
So, what good are these maps and information? Open-source companies like GeoTel sell communications and mapping data to clients, like private and commercial companies. Clients then analyze that infrastructure on top of their proprietary information, says Drazen. Some companies use it to supplement their existing internal communication systems, while others wish to monitor where competitors are laying fiber.
However, GeoTell doesn't do business with any international companies, and those in the U.S. go through a strict credit analysis. Neither does the company work with any federal government installations, including the military.
The point is, despite who is running them, we know these complex systems are out there. And with the help of visualizations like these, today's Internet users can learn just how closely connected we all are.

A Canadian expat has taken to the pages of Boston Magazine to decry what he sees as the city's "poutine problem."
"It seems like for some reason just as poutine is starting to catch on in Boston, instead of giving Bostonians a lot of really good quality traditional poutine ... restaurants have gone in a really disturbing direction and have given us some really odd versions of this dish that I love so much," Spencer Buell told As It Happens host Carol Off.
"The word has come to mean just a pile of stuff with other stuff on it."
Take, for example, The Gallows, which serves a rotating menu of poutines based on the culinary traditions of each of the 50 states.
The poutine for Ohio features fries topped with chili and spaghetti noodles.
"It's really a problem," Buell said.
Or Boston Chops, which serves "poutine-style" twice-baked potatoes that are "injected" with gravy.
"This one was really bad," Buell said.
"Just because it has gravy injected in it or just because gravy is an ingredient that's included in a dish doesn't make it poutine. I think it's time for someone to set the record straight."
Then there's the tater tot poutine, a trend Buell says is popping up at restaurants around the city.
"I don't understand what the problem is with regular fries," Buell said.
And sometimes, the ingredients are right, but the "execution" is lacking.
"In many cases, the version of poutine that people are presented with is ... just this coagulated goo of gravy and cheese," he said.
"It's just sort of this flat, cheesy mess."
The perfect poutine, according to Buell?
"For my money, a good handcut fry, cooked a little bit darker than usual, with a good quality flavourful gravy and cheese curds so fresh that they squeak when you bite into them. I think that that is the trifecta."

And while he's not against experimentation — he admits he enjoys a good butter chicken poutine from time to time — he says you should really learn the rules before you bend them.
"I've come to love traditional poutine and I just wish that Bostonians would get a chance to appreciate it as much as I do," he said.
"I think people should understand the baseline of what poutine is before they're exposed to some of these horrific alternatives."
Although, he admits, he can't lay the full blame at Boston's feet.
"I should mention that Canadians are not immune to this, taking poutine and doing some unforgivable things to it. So we have our own checkered past as well."
Neoliberalism: There is no alternative By Scott Sumner
Margaret Thatcher coined the phrase; “The is no alternative” back in the 1980s. Of course this is not literally true, as the unfortunate residents of Venezuela are now discovering. But the alternative is so unpleasant that Thatcher's claim contains more truth than many people suspect, especially in the long run. In other words, I have pretty good idea as to the direction the next government of Venezuela will take. And the next government of North Korea.
See if you can find the problem with this quote from the Financial Times:
This time, however, Spain's Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) looks likely to be beaten not just by the centre-right Popular party but also by the far-left Unidos Podemos movement. According to recent surveys, the once mighty PSOE will come a distant third in this month's general election, with just 20 per cent of the vote. Not only will it not lead the next government. Barring an unlikely late surge, it will not even lead the Spanish left. The decline of the PSOE is, of course, part of a broader story. In Germany, the Social Democrats are polling around historic lows, as are the French Socialists under their unpopular president. Pasok has turned into a splinter group in the Greek parliament. In the UK, meanwhile, the venerable Labour party has undergone something of a reverse takeover, and is currently led by a politician who spent his entire career on the party's leftist fringe. . . . Spain offers a textbook example of the travails that have befallen the centre-left. Call it a crisis of representation. Call it a capitulation to neoliberalism. Call it horribly unfair. The fact is that in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, voters have come to associate the centre-left with many of the (unpopular) policies traditionally championed by the right: austerity, deregulation, liberalisation, free trade. . . . Socialist leaders thought they were simply bowing to reality. But along the way they left millions of core supporters without a voice. That was the vacuum into which Podemos was launched in January 2014, and that was filled by Syriza in Greece and by Jeremy Corbyn in the UK Labour party last year. The choice today for Europe's centre-left is stark, says Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations: “Either you are wiped out by Podemos or you become Podemos.”
Perhaps you noticed that one of those “far-left” parties has actually taken power–Syriza. And what sort of policies did Syriza adopt? It now favors (or at least pays lip service to) pretty much the same “austerity, deregulation, liberalisation, free trade” that the author says are associated with the right.
At this point I'm not sure if it matters who is elected in Europe. Even Pol Pot would be forced to bow down to the realities of global capitalism. Speaking of which, Cambodia is currently ruled by former members of the Khmer Rouge, and is of course adopting neoliberal reforms.
The European far left and nationalist right can rage against the machine all they want, as can Trump and Sanders supporters. But the machine isn't going away.
I say this with mixed feelings, as there are many aspects of the machine (the war on privacy, etc.) that I don't like.
Pamela Anderson and Lady Gaga rally to cause of Julian Assange
News Hour:
“Baywatch” actress Pamela Anderson retweeted a smiling selfie of Julian Assange on Friday after Sweden dropped its investigation into the Wikileaks founder, reviving intrigue around the couple's rumored romance.
Anderson's blog posts about her numerous trips to the Ecuadorean embassy in London to visit Assange have proved one of the more fascinating aspects of the Australian's five-year bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape and molestation allegations, which he denies.
Assange, 45, is a cyber hero to some for exposing government abuses of power and championing free speech. To others he is a criminal who has undermined the security of the West.
To Anderson, he is “the most intelligent, interesting and informed man in existence. Yes – I think he's quite sexy,” the 49-year-old actress, former Playboy model and animal rights campaigner said in a March blog post.
Photographers have snapped Anderson, often carrying take-out food, making numerous visits to the Ecuadorean embassy in the past six months.
Anderson is not Assange's only celebrity supporter. Pop singer Lady Gaga visited him in 2012 and filmed him for a video that was distributed this week to mark the release from a U.S prison of Chelsea Manning, who provided Wikileaks with more than 700,000 classified U.S. army documents.
“You may be an enemy of the state but you are not an enemy of humanity,” Lady Gaga told Assange in the video interview, which was released by Wikileaks on Wednesday.
Assange has said nothing about his closer relationship with Anderson, and she has been coy about characterizing it as dating or romantic.
“Let's see what happens when he's free. But you know I spend probably more time with him than any other man socially, which is very odd,” Anderson said in a Swedish TV talk-show appearance in March.
Anderson, who is currently promoting the new Hollywood “Baywatch” movie in which she has a cameo role, made no comment on Friday on the Swedish decision other than to retweet the smiling photo Assange posted of himself in his first reaction to the news.
In April, Anderson said that “our ‘affair' and the curiosity surrounding that might bring some attention to his situation. That's fine, but I'd rather not go into private details. Let's just say everyone deserves love.”
Earlier this month, she blogged again about Assange in a post called “We have more than a romantic life,” in which she said that the romance rumors were “a distraction when so much is at stake.”
The blog post was accompanied by a black-and-white picture of the two of them cheek to cheek.

Sony has announced their new flagship smartphone, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and the smaller Xperia XZs, with significant improvements to their cameras. Sony's new Motion Eye™ is capable of 960fps super slow motion.
Around three weeks ago, we informed you about Sony's new smartphone image sensor being in the development. Back then, Sony already presented some real-world 1080p super slow motion footage, so we could have guessed it would not have taken long for a new finished product to hit the market. It seems this is just what happened with the unveiling of their new flagship smartphone, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium and the smaller version, named the Xperia XZs.
Sony has combined their new memory stacked image sensor with a redesigned Sony G lens and an image processor, and decided to market this new smartphone camera system as Motion Eye™. Its main feature is the 960fps super slow motion capability. According to TheVerge this is however limited to 720p resolution and 0.18 seconds (180 milliseconds) filming time which gives you around 180 frames of super slow motion footage. It is still impressive as other current smartphones only top at 240fps.
The good thing is that lately more and more smartphone manufacturers have been dropping the pixel count in their cameras, which leads to bigger pixels and therefore better lowlight capability. Sony have now dropped the resolution of the earlier Xperia XZ from 23MPx to 19MPx in their new Xperia XZ Premium and XZs.
Here's the official promotional video for the new smartphone camera system, from the Sony Xperia YouTube channel:
Another cool feature is predictive capture. The camera can start buffering images one second prior to pressing the shutter button and enables users to choose from four shots.

An Oxford student sparked outrage after writing a jubilant Facebook post describing how he and friends refused to tip a Cape Town waitress because she was white.
“LOL wow unable to stop smiling because something so black, wonderful & LIT just happened!” campus activist Ntokozo Qwabe wrote in a now-deleted post. “And of course, the catalyst was a radical non-binary trans black activist…”
Qwabe asked his trans friend what the going rate for tips was in South Africa. The friend responding by taking the bill, writing in bold letters, “WE WILL GIVE TIP WHEN YOU RETURN THE LAND,” and giving it to the waitress.
“She sees the note & starts shaking,” he recounted. “She leaves us & bursts into typical white tears (like why are you crying when all we've done is make a kind request? Lol!)”
Qwabe's Facebook post went viral and others were not so amused. A GoFundMe page called “Tip the ‘Ntokozo Qwabe' Waitress” was set up, reaching its $5000 goal in three days. “Not only did they reduce this poor woman to tears but they took away her dignity for something she has no control over,” the description says. “If this server had any land to ‘give,' I would assume she would not be waitering in a cafe trying to make ends ”

As recently as 2013, Russia's venerable fleet of rockets commanded nearly half of the global share of the commercial launch market. Since then, the emergence of other players, most notably SpaceX, has considerably shrunk the once-dominant Russian position.
This year, although Russia has made 17 successful orbital launches, only about a third of them have flown for paying customers other than the Russian government or the International Space Station. By contrast, SpaceX has made 16 launches this year, 11 of which have been for commercial customers. A SpaceX projection for 2018 suggests that disparity will continue to grow if the company continues to increase the flight rate of its Falcon 9 rocket.
Recognizing its dimming market position, the Russian rocket corporation, Energia, has fast-tracked development of a new medium-class launch vehicle that it is calling Soyuz-5. This rocket could replace the existing Soyuz rocket that carries cosmonauts and astronauts into space while competing with SpaceX for commercial payloads.
According to Russian space reporter Anatoly Zak, Russian officials have high hopes for the launch vehicle. "Even more importantly, the Kremlin saw the new-generation vehicle as the Russian response to the American challenge on the commercial launch market, making the work on the Soyuz-5 booster especially urgent," Zak writes.
Too little, too late?
The big achievement for Russia, Zak says, is potentially completing preliminary design work on the new rocket this year, which keeps Energia on track to bring the Soyuz-5 vehicle to market by late 2021. The three-stage rocket will be powered by RD-171 engines that will burn kerosene fuel. (SpaceX's Merlin engines also burn rocket-grade kerosene fuel.)
Left unstated in the Russian press is that SpaceX is unlikely to stand still between now and 2021. Four years ago, the company was still launching the initial, expendable version of its Falcon 9 rocket, one that could lift about 10.5 tons to low-Earth orbit. Next year, however, SpaceX is likely to debut the fifth and final version of its Falcon 9 booster, optimized for reusability and likely with a capacity of 23 tons to low-Earth orbit.
If that rocket is even a modest success, which seems plausible given SpaceX's recent progression, then when the Soyuz-5 rocket debuts in 2021, it won't be competing with a Falcon 9 rocket that costs $60 million and has a backlog in launches. Rather, with rapid reusability, it seems more likely that by then, SpaceX will be capable of launching nearly on demand for some fraction of $60 million.

FRANK TUNNAT/BILD An asylum seeker has been jailed after using four different names to claim £30000 in benefits
Eritrean Harun Adam Abo Aela, 28, was charged and sentenced under the name Ahmed Mohammed, even though authorities said that was “probably” not his real name. But they could not find a passport for his Aela identity, even though he insisted that is his correct ID. He used the identities Salah Gafer, Hamam Achmed, Amgd Abas and Ahmed Adnan to claim for money in three different German cities.
Authorities say there are numerous cheats like him among the 1.3 million refugees Germany has absorbed in the past 20 months, costing the state tens of millions of pounds. Aela came to Germany in 2015 and realised he could milk the system by moving from place to place. Sentencing him to 21 months jail in Hanover on Thursday Judge Sabine Mzee told him: "There was huge damage to the public purse through your actions.”

Tamales are a beautiful thing: A wonderfully self-contained dish of delicate, slightly sweet masa (basically a corn dough) filled with meat or vegetables and wrapped in a corn husk or banana leaf until steamed to perfection.
Like tamales? You'll want to go to TamalFest this weekend. (Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)
Most of us probably think of Mexican-style tamales, but there are more varieties than that. And you'll be able to sample them at this weekend's TamalFest DC.
Hola Cultura, a nonprofit that helps promote Washington's Latino community, is the host of the Sunday event at St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church in Columbia Heights.
The group's managing editor, Christine MacDonald, said inspiration for TamalFest arose after holding a tamalada, or tamal-making party, with her summer interns.
MacDonald worked with embassies and restaurants to find 10 contenders for the lighthearted competition, which will crown people's choice awards in professional and amateur categories.
Represented nations include Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala and Peru.
[Five free things to do during the week of April 13-19]
Even after living in Mexico for six years and eating lots of tamales, MacDonald had no idea there was so much diversity in the dish throughout the Americas. Some nations have different names for this staple -- "hallaca" in Venezuela or "humita" in Chile and Bolivia. Most variations include the corn dough and meat, though vegetarian ones exist. Some versions use rice or mashed bananas rather than masa, MacDonald said.
Expect a wide array at TamalFest, including classic Mexican tamales filled with pork or chicken, Oaxacan tamales with mole sauce and chicken and Peruvian tamales with pork, olives and boiled eggs. There will be a few meatless options, such as Salvadoran tamales filled with a three-mushroom blend or an eight-vegetable mix, both served with a tomato-based sauce.
"Every country seems to have a little different take," MacDonald said.
TamalFest DC, Sunday, 5-8 p.m., at St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church, 1525 Newton St. NW. $8 in advance or $10 at the door; family four-pack $30. 202-733-0335. www.holacultura.com.

Removing giant boulder on Cunningham Highway near Warwick will stretch into weekend
Updated
Authorities now say the Cunningham Highway on Queensland's southern Darling Downs will remain closed at least until the weekend.
A 300-tonne boulder came down at Gap Creek Bridge near Warwick yesterday, blocking the highway in both directions.
Traffic is being diverted through Toowoomba and other local roads.
Paul Noonan from Transport and Main Roads says the massive rock has caused serious damage.
"When the rock's come down it's actually embedded itself about one-and-a-half-metres into the road surface," he said.
"What that means of course is that not only do we have to remove the rock by breaking it apart we also then have to repair the road surface.
"That'll take probably a couple of days."
Southern Downs Mayor Peter Blundell says it is frustrating.
"It's impacting on our tourism businesses, it's impacting again on our freight and transport network," he said.
"It's particularly important that road information is very up-to-date and very current and also those issues are resolved as quickly as possible."
Transport Minister Scott Emerson says the boulder is nine metres long and five metres high.
"Unfortunately it did come down yesterday but it didn't endanger motorists," he said.
"No-one was put at risk but now the task is there to remove it from the road.
"It's not very common for them having to remove a massive boulder of this size."
Mr Emerson says work had been done in the area to prepare for the wet season.
"We've been working on that site," he said.
"There's about 800 tonnes of rock and debris that over the last week we have been working to remove, so we are doing work around that area.
"Unfortunately that boulder, which was unstable, has come loose and landed on the highway."

Every flagship phone's official announcement is usually followed by the manufacturer releasing samples showcasing the prowess of the device's camera. These samples, however, are usually touched up and processed, making them poor examples for deciding the real-life camera performance. Samsung released quite a few camera samples from the Galaxy S6 after the device was unveiled, but you can now look at some actual images that we managed to take using the S6 at MWC.
As you can see in the images below, the Galaxy S6 can capture a lot of detail and seems to handle noise very well (even when we photographed a plant, something that is often a difficult thing for smartphone cameras). Daylight imaging has always been a strong suit for Samsung's cameras though, so while the S6's camera is quite impressive when there is ample light, we will need to take some pictures in low-light conditions to see if Samsung has managed to improve in that area on its latest flagship.
Check out the samples below, and don't forget to check out our hands-on experience with Samsung's new Galaxy S devices!
Introduction
Shortly after George W. Bush took office in 2001, his administration launched a concerted effort to crack down on a supposed epidemic of voter fraud in the United States. The campaign to identify and eliminate such fraud became such a priority that escalating political pressure from the White House eventually drove the Justice Department to fire U.S. attorneys who were seen as weak on prosecuting cases of fraud, in a politically-charged purge. State legislatures across the country also embarked on a zealous mission to fight the problem of “voter fraud,” while right-wing pundits and advocacy groups made it their goal to expose and defeat the so-called voter fraud epidemic. Claims that corrupt organizations, illegal immigrants and political machines were stealing elections away from voters became common refrains in the right-wing media and political debates. But the Bush Justice Department's war on voter fraud found little evidence of the illegal voting it alleged. Between 2002 and 2006, the DOJ's efforts resulted in only 86 convictions out of nearly 200 million votes cast, a rate of 0.0000004%. Unfazed by the complete lack of proof that widespread voter fraud exists, right-wing politicians, media personalities, activists and think tanks have continued their attacks on voting rights in the name of “voter integrity,” “ballot security” and “fighting voter fraud.” The resulting policies present a massive threat to citizens' right to vote, which is at the very foundation of our democracy.
Is There Widespread Voter Fraud?
While open to a variety of interpretations, the term “voter fraud” usually refers to voting without registration, registering nonexistent voters, voting more than once, voting in places where one is ineligible to vote, manipulating or rigging the vote count, or buying votes. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law has found that the most common causes of voting irregularities include clerical mistakes, transcription blunders and computer errors, such as mistakes in poll books or in voter registration documents. Personal information listed on voter rolls may be out of date, incomplete, or include typos. In 2005, the Brennan Center looked at a list of purportedly fraudulent voter registrations in New Jersey and found that most of the suspected cases of ”double-voting” ended up being matching errors, where two people with identical or similar names were thought to be one person voting twice. A New York Times analysis of federal voting fraud cases found that roughly a third of the 86 convictions from 2002 through 2006 involved small vote-buying schemes in local elections. Nearly all the others were the result of honest mistakes by those who didn't know they were ineligible to vote or instances of individuals acting alone. Ultimately, as the Times reported, prosecutors and election experts agreed that evidence of large-scale or coordinated fraud just wasn't there. In 2010, Tova Andrea Wang, a senior fellow at the think tank Demos, wrote, “Law enforcement statistics, reports from elections officials and widespread research have proved that voter fraud at the polling place is virtually non-existent.” Lorraine Minnite, an elections expert at Barnard College, argues that there is “no threat” of voter fraud, with official statistics showing that from “2002 to 2005 only one person was found guilty of registration fraud. Twenty people were found guilty of voting while ineligible and five people were found guilty of voting more than once.” In Minnesota, which has been at the center of the Right's search for voter fraud, a report by Citizens for Election Integrity Minnesota found that a grand total of 26 people were convicted of voter fraud in 2008 — all because they were felons who mistakenly voted. In other words, “nine ten-thousandths of one percent (0.0009%) of 2008 voters were convicted of fraud” in Minnesota. Nonetheless, the Republicans who control both houses of the state legislature are pushing a voter ID bill that would disenfranchise tens of thousands of Minnesotans: the Star Tribunefound that approximately “144,000 eligible voters in Minnesota lack a valid, state-issued identification card.”
The Voter Fraud Myth's Partisan Program
There is a reason the Right Wing has been so eager to invent the mythical problem of voter fraud and then offer gratuitous “solutions”: to disenfranchise the voters least likely to back conservative politicians. The abundance of new “anti-voter fraud” laws currently working their way through state legislatures attempt to drive down turnout among young and low-income voters who tend to live in cities, particularly African Americans and Latinos, all groups more likely to vote for Democrats. Frequently these laws require or request that poll workers ask voters to show photo identification. Although these laws are often presented as simple anti-fraud measures, some prominent backers have made it clear that they are in fact intended to prevent those who are less likely to have government IDs from voting. For example, the Republican speaker of New Hampshire's House told a tea party group this year that the photo ID bill he championed targeted “foolish” young people because “voting as a liberal” is “what kids do.” The chief sponsor of Georgia's voter ID legislation told the Justice Department that “if there are fewer black voters because of this bill, it will only be because there is less opportunity for fraud.” Laws meant to address “voter fraud” may be tackling a fictitious problem, but they have real consequences. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology examined why an estimated 23.2 million registered voters did not cast ballots in 2008. Researchers estimated that nine percent (2.2 million) of these did not cast ballots because they lacked proper ID. Eight percent were unable to find their polling place. Eleven percent were turned away because of long lines. Another nine percent were turned away from the polls because of registration problems. The study reported that African American and Hispanic voters were more frequently asked to provide photo IDs in states that required them: “African Americans and Hispanics were asked to show ‘picture ID' more often than Whites — 70% for African Americans, 65% for Hispanics, and 51% for Whites.” The researchers also found that “it is the youngest voters who are more likely to lack the necessary identification. For instance, of those 30 years of age and younger, 64% said they had an unexpired driver's license with their legal name and current address.” Like younger voters, black and Hispanic citizens are less likely than whites to have the identification required by voter ID laws. The Brennan Center reports that while eight percent of voting age white citizens don't have a current, government-issued photo ID, the number jumps to 16 percent for Hispanics and 25 percent for African Americans. In addition, those earning less than $35,000 per year are more than twice as likely to lack proper ID as those with higher incomes. According to a University of Washington study, “[I]ndividuals who are racial and ethnic minorities, foreign-born, of a lower socioeconomic status, and are younger all are less likely to have a driver's license,” which is “the primary valid form of identification accepted for voting purposes.” “Strict voter ID regulations would eliminate more Democratic than Republican votes from the final tally,” the researchers found, noting that in “jurisdictions with competitive elections and close outcomes, this could easily change the final vote results in favor of Republican candidates.” As Professor Minnite explains in her book The Myth of Voter Fraud, arguments that America is facing a voter fraud epidemic allow politicians not only to enact new laws suppressing the vote, but to “justify voter-challenge campaigns that can lead to voter intimidation.” Minnite writes that minorities who throughout American history have experienced the most disenfranchisement and discrimination are particularly targeted by such campaigns: Classes of voters such as African Americans, Latinos, and new immigrants once on the margins of the U.S. electorate, voters who have struggled for inclusion and a political voice, are cast to suspicion by voter fraud allegations that suggest their votes are “illegal” or that they are prone to subvert the rules—in other words, cheat—to overcome their minority status in a majoritarian system. Thus, voter fraud allegations that taint the votes of these groups are useful to politicians engaged in politics by other means. As voter suppression laws have clear partisan implications, is it any wonder that Republican politicians and conservative activists have been the chief champions of such burdensome laws? Accusations of voter fraud have real consequences, encouraging voter suppression by means of burdensome new laws and increased voter intimidation. Minnite writes, “Over time, unfounded fraud allegations influence voting policy by shaping voting rules and procedures in a way that inhibit the democracy-expanding potential of voting rights movements.” According to the Brennan Center for Justice, more than five million eligible voters will face prohibitive barriers to voting in the next election as a result of new laws passed to purportedly crackdown on “voter fraud.”
Voter Suppression Strategies
Who's Behind the Attacks on Voting Rights?
Why Is the Voter Fraud Myth So Widespread?
A startling number of Republican voters believe that voter fraud is the reason President Obama won the 2008 presidential election. Public Policy Polling found one year after the presidential election that 52% of Republicans, and 26% of all Americans, “think that ACORN stole the Presidential election for Barack Obama last year.” Only 27 percent of Republican voters believed that the president had been elected legitimately. Accusations that ACORN propagated systematic voter fraud throughout the country by helping minority voters in cities vote illegally en masse helped conservative activists fan the flames of racial resentment while perpetuating the myth of widespread voter fraud. Undocumented immigrants are another frequent target of voter fraud accusations, with Tea Party and anti-immigrant groups often alleging that the Democratic Party is working to help undocumented immigrants vote illegally. In Arizona last year, Republican congressional candidate Jesse Kelly said that Democrats were “busing” in Mexicans to illegally vote for his opponent Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Kelly claimed to have video to corroborate his charges but never released it. Election officials said they had no records of undocumented immigrants voting. William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC told Fox News that “the Obama administration is doing everything it can to make sure as many illegal aliens vote in 2010 although that is a violation of federal law.” One Arizona anti-immigrant group sent out an email before the election warning that undocumented immigrants were on the verge of “stealing the election”: “Our grassroots army of VOTER FRAUD PREVENTION VOLUNTEERS will stand vigilant across the nation. We will be the first and strongest line of defense to ensure that only legal citizens vote on November 2nd.” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was also the target of voter-fraud allegations in 2010. The campaign of Reid's Republican opponent Sharron Angle warned, “Harry Reid intends to steal this election if he can't win it outright.” Following Reid's narrow victory, one right-wing group alleged that the SEIU stole the election for the Democrat because union technicians worked as the repairmen for the voting machines. Other Democrats famously, and falsely, accused of winning elections as a result of voter fraud include Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire and Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, who won close races in 2004 and 2008, respectively. In 2005, a Washington court rebuffed Gregoire's Republican opponent's claims of voter fraud. The Seattle Times reported that the judge “saw no evidence of fraud.” In Minnesota, the Supreme Court wrote in its decision affirming Franken's victory that neither Franken nor his opponent claimed voter fraud took place and “found no allegations or evidence of fraud or foul play and no evidence to suggest that the Election Day totals from the precinct are unreliable.” However, the GOP and right-wing commentators continue to state as a matter of course that these Democrats were elected as a result of fraud. The conservative media also continues to push the myth that Republicans lost those races, among others, as a result of voter fraud. Before the 2010 election, Fox News host Megyn Kelly cited unnamed reports of “voter fraud on a massive scale with the intention of keeping Democrats in office.” Fox News even set up a voter fraud tip line, VoterFraud@FoxNews.com. Among the complaints of wrongdoing Fox reported: The buttons for each party are so close together, that if a person tries to press the Republican button with the pad of their finger, it is possible that their fingernail might accidently press the Democratic button. Not surprisingly, the claim of massive voter fraud diminished after Republicans made significant gains in congressional, gubernatorial and legislative elections in 2010. But that did not prevent newly elected Republican legislators and governors from moving the flood of voter suppression measures we've seen post-2010, masquerading as efforts to combat the mythical scourge of “voter fraud.”
Conclusion
Update, 12:30 p.m.: The Kansas City Star reports that "the fountain/heart logo is on the official flag of the city. And a similar logo makes up the official seal."
That won't change unless it's brought before the City Council for a vote. So, this new image will serve as a secondary brand, a marketing logo.
As city communications director Danny Rotert told the Star: "We are going to use this new symbol on marketing pieces. It adds a new look to our (television) station and upcoming website." This site is scheduled to launch on January 1, 2014.
Update, Friday at 11:15 a.m.: "We're honored that Kansas City's baseball heritage has served as part of the inspiration for the city's new logo. The Kansas City Monarchs were one of the greatest baseball franchises, not only in Black Baseball history, but in baseball history," says Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.
"The new brand embraces that history and we believe will provide an even greater connection to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum for residents and visitors to our great city."
Original story follows:
After displaying the same logo for more than two decades, a fountain shaped like a heart, a new image for the city of Kansas City, Mo. was revealed on Thursday.
"It will seem very familiar to people. And I think that's really important," says Danny Rotert, the city's communications director. "What we didn't want to do is to create a new brand for the city that people would have to scratch their head and wonder what it was."
Rotert says they're calling the brand a "linked K and C," with a nod to the logo of the Kansas City Monarchs, considered one of the best-known and most successful Negro Leagues baseball teams.
"One of the things that we really think is important is that that brand and that endeavor was an entrepreneurial endeavor. It was something that happened right here in Kansas City that really brought us to the national stage," says Rotert. "So in some ways, reflecting that has been important for us."
The image was designed by Emily Elmore, creative director and managing partner at Single Wing Creative, a Kansas City-based company.
Elmore says the process to create an "immediately recognizable mark" began by researching Kansas City's history and then developing imagery to reflect the past. She says it also connects to the city's sports teams and entrepreneurship.
"I wanted to create a 'linked' logo that can show a connection between a young and innovative new City with the roots of a City that has always had an edge," says Elmore. "Artists, creators, makers and doers call Kansas City home. The new brand capitalizes on that energy and yet can be described as visually classic."

[Breaking down the plausibility of the week's biggest rumor.]
A lot of attention is paid to a good young defenseman in Western Canada who may or may not have fallen out of favor with his club. But this time around, it's not Jacob Trouba who spent the past several days as the subject of the most intriguing trade rumors in the NHL.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Instead, the somewhat surprising revelation from a number of reputable sources was that the Calgary Flames may or may not be shopping Dougie Hamilton started to percolate over the weekend. The idea here is that Calgary may no longer enamored of their young defender, less a year and a half after giving him six years at $5.75 million against the cap.
It would certainly be an interesting wrinkle in this early season, and there is some foundation for the rumors in terms of how Hamilton is used, and has been for some time.
Take, for example, Hamilton's ice time last season, as he averaged 19:46 per game under Bob Hartley. This was the fifth-highest number on the Flames' blue line, and in fact also trailed Johnny Gaudreau's usage. To put it another way, Hartley felt he was better off giving Hamilton fewer minutes per night than both Dennis Wideman (20:37) and Kris Russell (22:52). Despite the TOI limitations, Hamilton finished with 12 goals and 43 points, appearing in all 82 games.
[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Hockey contest now]
Story continues
Things have only gotten worse this season under Glen Gulutzan. Not only does the new coach use Wideman a little more than Hartley did last season, but he also seems to have bumped Deryk Engelland ahead of Monahan Hamilton on the depth chart. In the Flames' game on Oct. 24, Hamilton only played 15:58, one of the lowest totals of his career. (To be fair, he's also committing a lot of penalties these days, so that doesn't help his TOI totals.) But pairing him with Nicklas Grossmann seems like misuse even if you don't think he's as good as the hype around him suggests.
So the question is, is that enough evidence of disenchantment on Brad Treliving's part to want to trade a 23-year-old, 6-foot-6 defenseman with two straight 40-point seasons?
Who's Going Where?
The thing is, though, that these rumors seem to have cropped up lately because of something Pierre LeBrun said earlier this week. Namely, that someone had called Treliving to kick the tires, but that there wasn't a lot of traction for such talk.
But back in June, Bob McKenzie reported that some people around the league felt Hamilton might have been available around the draft. Obviously nothing happened then, but the Flames are off to another crap start, Hamilton is getting third-pairing minutes, and some might be inclined to see if they can shake something loose.
And hell, it's a good time to be interested in acquiring a defenseman, what with Trouba, Hamilton, and maybe even Hampus Lindholm being available. Although, with the Lindholm stuff, consider the source, and then take this harsh on-the-record quote from his GM as a pretty strong indicator that Anaheim isn't looking to move a top-10 defender in the league. (More on that in Trending Topics tomorrow, though.)
But with this in mind, you can safely start connecting the dots on who might want to acquire a player of Hamilton's type — young, huge, high-scoring, and locked up at a relatively low price point for his entire prime — at a time when his stock might be particularly low. After all, if he may or may not have been available in June, a rough start to the season for player and team alike might have further encouraged imaginings of a Hamilton-free future for the Flames.
Pick a team that wants blue line help: The Rangers? You bet. The Oilers? Heck yeah. The Bruins? Well, probably not. But everyone else who's been in on Cam Fowler or Kevin Shattenkirk or any other top-four D will probably be connected to Hamilton if these rumors stretch on much longer. The revived rumblings are only two or three days old at this point, so you might want to give it a minute for everyone to get into a froth over things.
The Implications
Again, what you have to keep in mind here is that this all comes because LeBrun reported that a team called Calgary about Hamilton's availability and talks, if they were entertained at all, didn't get very far.
GMs get calls about players all the time, whether they'd be interested in trading them or not. Where do you think all those rumors of “Malkin to (insert team here)” come from? Teams want to see what it would take, and that's the kind of thing that gets reported and snowballs into “The Penguins almost traded Malkin.” Things that start out innocuously enough — with an actual capital-I Insider making a simple report that teams are asking about a player — quickly get out of hand like a game of telephone. Now Treliving is looking to trade Hamilton for Dylan McIlrath and a purple monkey dishwasher? C'mon.
This doesn't, of course, mean that Calgary wouldn't entertain a trade if someone came in blew their doors off. Nor does it excuse the brutal way two separate Flames coaches have misused Hamilton the past two seasons. The reason these trade rumors exist is, again, that Calgary is still pretty bad and its coach is still mismanaging its defense.
Fans hate to see their teams' good young players talked about like this, but the reason why this came up is entirely on the Flames.
While the Flames have made some talent misevaluations in recent years, Treliving isn't about to offload a good young defenseman over fewer than 10 bad games to start a season in which literally no one on the team has been any good. Especially not one for whom he just traded a decent raft of picks in the 2015 offseason.
This Is So Huge, If True: Is It True?
On a B.S. detector scale of 1-5, with one being the most reasonable and 5 being the least:
This is so unlikely I almost feel bad writing about it, but no, your favorite team is not trading for Dougie Hamilton any time soon. Try again in five years.
Calgary trades Dougie Hamilton:

Well, that title is a mouthful.
This story's going to be a little hard to swallow, isn't it? I'm going to say it right now that this probably happened in Florida. Only in f*cking Florida. I'm surprised the state is still in one piece.
Recently, a 65-year-old man, Richard Patterson, has been cleared of strangling his girlfriend. They had been in a relationship for four months before the event occurred. The girlfriend in question is Francisca Marquinez, who passed in October 2015.
Patterson's lawyers filed a motion to put his penis on display.
His claim was that she had died while she was performing oral sex on him. Confessing to being the reason for her death, he denied all possibility that it was deliberate and malicious.
His lawyers said it was “essential” for the jury to see the size of his penis to understand his claim in full effect. However, the legal team changed tactics once a medical expert testified the impossibility of these allegations.
They later said that Patterson actually believed his version of events to be the truth.
Unfortunately, her body had become too decomposed for there to be an accurate analysis on the cause of death.
He did not call 911 immediately because he was “embarrassed and humiliated.” He did contact his daughter and ex-girlfriend saying, he “did something bad' and ‘was so sorry”.
This lead to his arrest in November after he called a defence lawyer and told him about Marquinez. The police found no trauma or force on her body, and the defence argued that he claimed to have “choked” her rather than have “strangled” her.
Only in Florida could something like this happen. Crazy stuff happens there all the time.
Stop the Mass-Killing of Romanian Dogs
by: World Animal Protection - USA
recipient: Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta
On the 25th September 2013, the Constitutional Court authorized the mass killing of Romania's stray dogs.
Under this new law, dogs will be kept in detention for 14 days in overcrowded dog shelters, and then killed if they are not claimed or adopted. This means that tens of thousands of dogs will be killed in the coming weeks.
History shows us that mass killing is not the solution. Stray and roaming dog populations can be managed in ways that are both effective and humane.
Help us stop the senseless killing of healthy dogs today. Urge the Romanian Prime Minister to suspend this cruel law immediately.
read petition letter ▾
I am writing to you to support the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) appeal to the Romanian government to suspend the application of the unacceptable, cruel and inevitably ineffective law approved in September 2013.
The Romanian Government should immediately open a dialogue with WSPA and other animal welfare NGOs to deploy a proper implementation plan of the 2008 law, which aimed to tackle dog overpopulation through the use of humane methods instead of senselessly killing healthy animals.
Stray and roaming dog populations can be managed in ways that are both effective and humane. WSPA can offer evidence of that through several years of work around the world to promote responsible pet ownership and effective population management programs.

Gov. John Kasich has reiterated his threat to veto any legislation that would eliminate standards for renewable energy and energy efficiency. His comments, which were made Friday at an event in Austin, Texas, could be a bad sign for proposals on the topic that are pending in the Ohio General Assembly.
Gov. John Kasich has reiterated his threat to veto any legislation that would eliminate standards for renewable energy and energy efficiency.
His comments, which were made Friday at an event in Austin, Texas, could be a bad sign for proposals on the topic that are pending in the Ohio General Assembly.
The standards, which went into effect in 2008, say that electricity utilities need to meet annual benchmarks for renewable energy and for finding ways to help customers reduce energy use.
Two years ago, Kasich signed a measure that placed a two-year freeze on the standards. Now, as the freeze is months away from expiring, some lawmakers would like to see it extended in one form or another.
Kasich spoke about the standards in response to an audience question on environmental issues. He said that the 2008 standards were "unrealistic," but that he would veto any plan to "kill the standards."
"I'm for developing all these other resources, and we have a program in Ohio that requires us to meet these certain standards, and I've told the legislature the standards that were set were unrealistic but if you try to kill the standards, whether it has to do with the renewables, or whether it has to do with the issue of saving energy, I'll veto the bill and we�ll go to the higher standards. And so you know I�m committed to it."
The Dispatch reported last week that Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, R-Cincinnati, is about to introduce a plan that would make the renewable-energy standards optional from 2017 through 2019 and make them enforceable starting in 2020. That plan would be part of a larger measure.
Kasich gave no indication in his Austin remarks that he was addressing any specific proposal.

It is with reluctance that Leighton Baines finds himself cast as the poster boy for those who want reassurance that not all footballers are money grabbing, self-serving egomaniacs.
There is a perception that if the Everton and England left-back was more practised in the art of agitation, he would have been a Manchester United player several years ago, but those old-fashioned values of loyalty, duty and being an all-round good egg kept him on Merseyside.
Speaking in detail for the first time about United's failed attempt to sign him, Baines says his decision to stay at Everton was more complicated than unquestioningly pledging his future to his boyhood team.
"I sat on the fence and saw how the thing played out," Baines says. "From this end, you might get credit for turning someone down that you probably don't deserve. The whole thing in the summer was letting things unfold. I could have signed a contract at any time in the summer and put it all to bed.
"It was a case of letting the business side of it get conducted, knowing you couldn't lose. The perspective was I could only win from this situation.
"I don't want to keep playing that tune of being humble. You just appreciate where you are. It was stressful because I didn't know which way it was going to play out. You just try to conduct yourself in the proper manner as much as you can. There is always that. That is a factor throughout.
"I had the important conversations myself and didn't have someone in there for me feeding back what was happening. I spoke with the manager, I spoke with the chairman and we had private conversations. They kept me in the loop all along. I just let them deal with it and I wanted to be kept informed. I guess you never know if you're doing the right thing or not but at the time, it's not your decision as a player to make those calls."
Whether Baines accepts applause or not, the fact he never asked for a transfer or issued public ultimatums is an admirable distinction from many of his peers.
Marouane Fellaini handed in a transfer request to ensure he left Everton for Manchester United, and one only had to witness the different exit strategies of Gareth Bale and Luis Suárez – with varying degrees of success. There is another shrug.
"Maybe it was just how I was brought up," says Baines. "If I was playing for a foreign club I may have acted differently but I think there is a different level of respect."
There has been no cause for regret since. What attracted Baines to United was the Champions League, annual title bids and a manager he admired. All have gone, Baines's penalty in David Moyes's final game indicative of how fate conspired against the former Everton coach.
"There are a lot of lads here who were long-serving under him. We all feel the same, we are a bit gutted for him," says Baines. "There are personal relationships there – you don't want to see anyone having a hard time. It's hard to know what to say but we know from working with him that he is a top manager. He has to do what is right for him now whether that's coming back straight away or having a little bit of time. The lads here who worked with him know he is a top manager.
"It's really hard. The important thing is the start. When you go in everyone is sussing each other out and from both sides. If you start well as a player when a new manager comes in the first impressions are positive. It can also work the other way."
While Moyes sank, his successor Roberto Martínez has thrived at Goodison. There is still a top-four chance, albeit slim, heading into Saturday's meeting with Manchester City, although Baines recalls the early months when no one was certain that the Spanish coach's methods would work.
"We started with a few draws and everyone was kind of sitting on the fence, and then we beat Chelsea and went on a bit of a run. That game was massive," Baines says.
"Even if you look back, we nearly conceded a ridiculous goal trying to play out of defence. What if that had of gone in and you lose the game because of it? It was the tipping point. If we had lost maybe people would have started to want what they had before. But we went on a run.
"They are fine lines. Beating Chelsea gave us the lift and made us kick on. We were trying to buy into all the new ideas and concepts but it's the same with everyone. It's a results-based business and until you start getting results, you're not going to buy into it. I guess over there [Manchester United] they never quite got going and, if they had, they would probably have been flying.
"I can only be happy with the way we are going along now and the position we are in, still in with a fighting chance of getting Champions League football. We have our highest Premier League points tally in a season and that under the new manager, for a first season, is extremely positive going. The next step is to see what we can do about strengthening. I'm sure the manager is looking at that."
One of Martínez's plans is to redeploy Baines as a central midfielder, enabling him to follow the journey of Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm from full-back to midfield.
Baines accompanied his manager on a scouting mission when Bayern played United at Old Trafford.
"No pressure!" Baines jokes. "The lads have been talking about it and I've been getting a bit of stick. I'm teacher's pet now. I've never heard of it happening before but it was good to see the game live and for him to show the things that they do and the similarities of what he wants us to do.
"I'll be excited to give it a go. I know it sounds stupid but for a few years we used to play a 'young versus old' game on a Friday and that was my position. Tim Howard was saying the other day, 'I hope you do play there because I called it two years ago'. Steve Round [former Moyes assistant] had mentioned it before so it wasn't out of nowhere but I wouldn't expect to be playing there.
"Roberto is such a contrast to what we had before, the way he wants us to play and the fact he won't compromise on it. He wants you to do what he wants and if he sees it's not really happening, he's not going to go, 'right we will play long'. We could play good stuff before but I think now there is a real tactical meaning to everything.
"There are certain triggers within the system that someone takes up a certain position knowing that another guy is going to see that trigger, and he will go into a different position himself. It is all very specific and thought out and that's the difference."
Victory over City will secure Everton's European place but whatever the outcome the impact on the title race, for Liverpool as much as City, has dominated the pre-match agenda.
Baines says the players are thinking only of winning.
"Loads of people have obviously mentioned that potential scenario [of helping Liverpool] but when the game comes around we will want to win the game, pure and simple," he says.
"You understand the fans' side of the rivalry but you shouldn't judge yourself on others' success or failure. I think Liverpool not winning the league doesn't make us any better."

Christian Walker and Scott Wingo each tallied two-run homers and on the back of junior left-hander Michael Roth's quality start, South Carolina erased an early three-run deficit to defeat Clemson 6-3 on Friday evening in front of a sellout crowd of 8,242 fans at Carolina Stadium. The Gamecocks are now 8-0 on the year while the loss drops Clemson to 6-2 for the season. Game two of the series is set for Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C. with first pitch at 4:15 p.m.
Roth, who hurled a complete game vs. the Tigers last year at the College World Series, was effective again as he allowed three runs, all unearned, on seven hits with six strikeouts and three walks in seven innings pitched. Gamecock sophomore right-hander Matt Price hurled 1.2 perfect innings of relief and struck out the side in the top of the ninth for his third save of the year. Clemson starter Scott Weismann suffered the loss and is now 2-1 on the year. He went five innings and allowed four runs on six hits with three strikeouts and a walk.
Clemson broke ahead 3-0 in the top of the second inning with three unearned runs off of Roth. Richie Shaffer opened up the frame with a leadoff walk and the Tigers got their second base runner as John Hinson reached base on a fielding error on shortstop Peter Mooney. With two outs and runners on second and third base, Phil Pohl ripped a double down the left field line to score both runners. He would then score on a RBI single up the middle off the bat of Jason Stolz.
South Carolina answered in the bottom half of the second as Brady Thomas delivered with a two-run homer to cut the Clemson lead to 3-2. After Christian Walker led off with a hit by pitch, Thomas roped his first homer of the year over the right field wall.
It would remain that way until the bottom of the fifth when Walker delivered with his third home run of the season. With two outs and Evan Marzilli on second base, Walker drilled an 0-1 pitch from Weismann over the left-centerfield wall giving the Gamecocks a one-run lead.
Roth faced a moment of truth in the bottom of the sixth as the Tigers loaded the bases with two outs. Facing Jason Stolz and with a 3-2 count, Roth was able to induce a strikeout against the Tiger hitter bringing the packed house on to its feet as the Gamecocks remained ahead by a run. After Richie Shaffer led off the top of the eighth inning with a hit by pitch, the Gamecock bullpen battled as Bryan Harper came in to strike out John Hinson with Price relieving Harper then and getting Spencer Kieboom to roll into a 6-3 double play keeping the Gamecocks ahead 4-3.
Carolina received some much-needed insurance in the bottom of the eighth then as Wingo drilled a two-run homer to right field to give Carolina a three-run cushion.
South Carolina finished the evening with a 9-7 advantage in hits. Walker, Thomas, Marzilli and Jake Williams all had two hits apiece to lead Carolina. Walker now has a hitting streak up to 13 games that began last year. Phil Pohl went 2-for-3 to lead Clemson.
A religious Williamstown, Kentucky, theme park created a stir this week in the gay and transgender community by announcing it will be illuminated in a rainbow light every night.
While the colorful new lighting of the Ark Encounter, a large-scale Noah's Ark replica filled with exhibits, spurred numerous responses from Ark supporters, some in the LGBTQ community made fun of the move.
Ken Ham, president, CEO and founder of the Ark Encounter, announced the new color scheme in a series of tweets on Tuesday, saying that the decision was made to “remind the world that God owns the rainbow.”

Ham's call to “take back” the rainbow dates to at least 2007. He wrote a post on his website, Answers in Genesis, that said the rainbow should be a reminder that God judges sin, but said he would never judge the world with a flood again.
“The rainbow has been used as a sign of a new era and a symbol of peace, love, and freedom,” Ham wrote in the 2007 post. “Sadly, the colors of the rainbow are even used on a flag for the gay and lesbian movement.”
While Ham said Christians want to re-appropriate the rainbow, Twitter responses indicated the LGBTQ community and their supporters are enjoying the Ark's new lighting.
One person responded to the announcement on Twitter, saying “I didn't realize Noah was so progressive,” while another called it an “awesome pride float.”
John Gidding, a celebrity architect, responded with a thread of tweets, including one that read, “Will you have a gay animal couple in there?! Penguins are overplayed — I say make the dinosaurs you have in there gay! JurasSICK!”
Other Twitter users appeared to align with Ham, saying it “was about time” and thanking him for returning the symbol to “God's glory.”

This isn't the first time in recent months that the Ark Encounter has made headlines. In late June, the attraction sold its main area of land, worth $48 million, to a non-profit affiliate for $10. Williamstown officials said they think this could have been the first step to becoming a non-profit, which would allow the theme park to avoid city, state and federal taxes.
On Wednesday, the Williamstown City Council was reportedly told by the city attorney that the Ark Encounter had offered to pay a newly proposed safety tax as long as it was capped at $500,000 a year.
The Ark Encounter is a 510-foot-long, 85-foot-wide structure meant to express the belief that the earth is 12,000 years old or younger and that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time.
EAGAN, Minn. - A former Delta flight training center will be demolished next month to make way for the new Minnesota Vikings headquarters and practice facility.
Right now, there's an online auction for everything inside of the building, including office equipment.
The building has been abandoned since 2012 after Delta merged with Northwest Airlines and consolidated its Flight Operations training centers to Atlanta.
Inside of the buiding, you can see old name tags of employees who used to work there.
Grafe Auction, of Spring Valley, is tasked with selling three floors of equipment, from office supplies to generators. The auction can be found by clicking here.
"There's a lot of people that have commented on the post that announced this sale 'Oh I remember my dad was a mechanic there at Northwest and I remember NWA,'" said John Schultz, of Grafe Auction.
A former Delta flight training center in Eagan will be demolished next month. Now, there's an online auction for everything inside of the building, from office equipment to flight simulators.
Inside, there are still remnants of Northwest Airlines, including signage, a manual, and a desk bearing the old logo. But what's attracting the most attention are nine flight simulators for sale, including Boeing 747 and DC-9 simulators.
A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines says during its consolidation, the company moved 10 simulators from the MSP Training Center, including four A320s, two Boeing 757s, two A330s, one 747-400 and one DC-9.
Schultz says people have reached out to his company excited to see the simulators for sale.
"This is unique. These type of facilities nationwide, there aren't a lot that exist in the country or even the world," said Schultz.
On Friday, Oct. 7, the center is open for the public from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. so people can look at the equipment for sale. It's located at 2600 Lone Oak Point, Eagan, MN 55121. The auction ends late next week.
Carwyn Jones has suggested there could a new federal arrangement of the UK nations in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.
The first minister said he wanted to avoid Wales being seen as "some sort of annexe to England".
Wales and England both voted to leave the EU, while majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.
The discrepancy has led to calls for a fresh referendum on independence in Scotland.
In other developments:
The terms of a final negotiation between the UK and the EU will have to be put to the British people, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said.
The UK has no need to be hasty withdrawing from the EU, the body representing Welsh councils has said.
Mr Jones told the BBC's Newyddion 9: "The last thing we want is to be considered some sort of annexe to England.
"We don't have to have independence - there is a way to ensure there is some sort of federation, or some sort of agreement.
"That doesn't mean you have to have independence."
But Mr Jones rejected calls from Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood for Wales to become an independent state within the EU, saying the people of Wales had voted to leave the union.
The first minister has floated the idea of a federal UK in the past, notably in a speech in October 2014 where he said: "Enabling unity while guaranteeing diversity is precisely the challenge we face.
"In other words, striking the best balance between national citizenship and local flexibility. Federal thinking gives us a new starting point to challenge the way we habitually view the state."

A mushroom used in Asia for its medicinal benefits has been found to be 100 per cent effective in suppressing prostate tumour development in mice during early trials, new Queensland University of Technology (QUT) research shows.
The compound, polysaccharopeptide (PSP), which is extracted from the 'turkey tail' mushroom, was found to target prostate cancer stem cells and suppress tumour formation in mice, according to an article written by senior research fellow Dr Patrick Ling in the online journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public Library of Science.
Dr Ling, from the Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre-Queensland and Institute for Biomedical Health & Innovation (IHBI) at QUT, said the results could be an important step towards fighting a disease that kills 3,000 Australian men a year.
"The findings are quite significant," Dr Ling said.
"What we wanted to demonstrate was whether that compound could stop the development of prostate tumours in the first place.
"In the past, other inhibitors tested in research trials have been shown to be up to 70 per cent effective, but we're seeing 100 per cent of this tumour prevented from developing with PSP.
"Importantly, we did not see any side effects from the treatment."
Dr Ling said conventional therapies were only effective in targeting certain cancer cells, not cancer stem cells, which initiated cancer and caused the disease to progress.
During the research trial, which was done in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong and Provital Pty Ltd, transgenic mice that developed prostate tumours were fed PSP for 20 weeks.
Dr Ling said no tumours were found in any of the mice fed PSP, whereas mice not given the treatment developed prostate tumours. He said the research suggested that PSP treatment could completely inhibit prostate tumour formation.
"Our findings support that PSP may be a potent preventative agent against prostate cancer, possibly through targeting of the prostate cancer stem cell population," he said.
He said PSP had been previously shown to possess anti-cancer properties, and 'turkey tail' mushrooms (known as Coriolus versicolor or Yun-zhi) had been widely used in Asia for medicinal benefits.
However, Dr Ling said it was the first time it had been demonstrated that PSP had anti-cancer stem cell effects.
Although 'turkey tail' mushrooms had valuable health properties, Dr Ling said it would not be possible to get the same benefit his research showed from simply eating them.
A fundraiser has been organised in September to support further tests for the therapeutic potential of PSP against prostate tumours either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer compounds.
ST. LOUIS – St. Louis Blues President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Doug Armstrong announced today the club has signed forward Scottie Upshall to a one-year, two-way contract.
Upshall, 31, dressed in 63 regular season games with the Florida Panthers last season, posting 15 points (eight goals, seven assists) and 28 penalty minutes.
The 6-foot, 200-pound forward is a veteran of 12 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons including stints with Florida, Columbus, Phoenix, Philadelphia and Nashville.
Overall, the Fort McMurray, Alberta, native has accumulated 234 points (115 goals, 119 assists) and 480 penalty minutes in 553 career regular season games, as well as 10 points (four goals, six assists) and 48 penalty minutes in 26 career postseason games.
Upshall was originally drafted by Nashville in the first round (sixth overall) of the 2002 NHL Draft.
Comedian Tracy Morgan screamed for help after the limousine bus he was riding in was involved in a fatal multi-car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, his driver recalled.
The crash early Saturday killed one man on the limo bus and injured four others, including Morgan, 45.
"I climbed around and heard Tracy screaming for help," said his driver, Tyrone Gale. "I climbed up on the body of the limo bus ... but I couldn't reach them."
N.J. State Police said they believed a truck driver was dozing and didn't see traffic slowing in front of his 18-wheeler until it was too late, crashing into the vehicle carrying comedian Morgan and his entourage.
"I just remember the impact. ... We didn't know which way was up, which way was down. I don't know if we flipped several times or one time," Gale said. "I saw the condition of everybody and I knew it would just make it worse if I tried to pull them up and out of the vehicle."
Morgan and Entourage The Latest Victims of "The Black Dragon"
The Walmart truck driver, Kevin Roper, 35, of Jonesboro, Ga., was charged with one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. He surrendered Saturday night and was released on $50,000 bail, according to N.J. State Police.
"The facts are continuing to unfold. If it's determined that our truck caused the accident, Walmart will take full responsibility," Walmart U.S. President and CEO Bill Simon said in a statement

1 Killed, 4 Injured in Crash
James McNair, a passenger on board the limo bus with Morgan, was killed in the crash, police said. He was comedy writer for Morgan.
Morgan, his assistant, Jeff Millea, and Ardie Fuqua were listed in critical condition, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital spokesman Peter Haigney told ABC station WABC-TV. Harris Stanton, another comedian, was treated and released.
Morgan's rep, Lewis Kay, said the comedian's family was with him and "he is receiving excellent care."
The group was returning from a performance of his "Turn it Funny" tour in Dover, Del., Friday night.
"A great show in Dover, a lot of excitement going home," Gale said. "Tracy was holding his baby before we left and he said, 'I'm holding my princess.'"
The Chain Reaction Crash
The six-vehicle crash happened in the northbound lanes at mile marker 71.5 about 1 a.m. Saturday, according to N.J. State Police.
The crash was a chain reaction caused by the first truck, a Peterbilt with Oklahoma plates, New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said.
When the driver of the truck suddenly became aware of the Mercedes Sprinter limo bus in front of him, he swerved left to avoid it, but struck the limo bus in the rear and then hit another vehicle, Williams said.
The limo bus carrying Morgan lost control and began rotating clockwise and then turned over onto its left side. While it was out of control, the limo bus hit a Buick, which crashed into a Ford F150 pickup truck. The limo also hit another tractor-trailer.
The truck that caused the crash came to rest on the left shoulder after hitting a guardrail.
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway told ABC News that the NTSB was dispatching a team to investigate the crash along with the N.J. State Police.
The NTSB was going to focus on the "broad issues concerning commercial traffic safety," Holloway said.
Morgan has four children, including a daughter to whom his fiancee Megan Wollover gave birth last July.
Scouting report: What is Oregon getting in Keith Smith?
ESPN four-star small forward Keith Smith, the No. 67 prospect in the class of 2016, has committed to the University of Oregon after re-opening his recruitment last week.
The 6-foot-7, 190-pound Rainier Beach High School (Seattle, Washington) product is rated as the No. 1 junior in his state and chose Oregon over offers from Cal, Gonzaga, Oregon State, San Diego State, Washington, Washington State and others.
But getting to that point wasn't easy.
In February, Smith took a visit to San Diego State and decided to commit, but later had second thoughts.
"I first committed to San Diego State right after my official visit, then I sat back and started thinking about it," he said. "I was in my season for basketball, so I didn't get a chance to see both teams play. The style of play didn't fit me, so I opened back up."
According to Keith Smith's father, who carries the same name, his son struggled with the decision to change course.
"He said, 'Dad, I might have made my decision too early and I'm having second thoughts," Smith explained. "I told him, reassured him not to feel bad, that he wasn't the first 17-year-old to have that feeling. San Diego State is a great school, but he wanted a better look at Oregon."
Smith, who was down to San Diego State and Oregon when he made his February decision, said he called the Ducks coaching staff to see if the interest was still mutual. Oregon coach Dana Altman assured him that it was and a visit was scheduled for the April 17-19 weekend.
"I had a really good relationship with the coaches beforehand. I took my visit down there and I loved everything I saw," Smith said. "We got to see the whole campus, student life, the players, we got to see a session of player development. Everything fit me. That's the reason why I chose Oregon."
Keith Smith's father shares those sentiments, believing he saw the total package in Eugene.
"It was a great visit. I told (my son) that we needed to go back and think on this - check the pros and cons," he said. "At the end of the day, he said that's the place he wanted to go and pursue his degree and play basketball."
Equally impressive to both Smiths was Altman's commitment to player and program development.
"He's developing, not only the program, but players too," the elder Smith said. "They are putting in a lot of work. And you see that he's really hustling and putting it in on the recruiting end. He's all over the place. I said, 'Good gracious coach. You need three or four of you to get to all the places you are trying to get to.'"
Smith, a junior at University Washington-pipeline Rainier Beach, was long considered a Washington lean, but he said the pieces never quite came together for him.
"It was hard, but I didn't feel like it was a good fit there," he said. "It was still hard to leave home. I wasn't looking for the team everybody wanted me to go to, but the team that fit for me."
That program turned out to be Oregon, a school that Keith Smith's father believes is well on its way to national relevance in the college basketball landscape.
"They are well on their way to competing at the highest level, not just making the tournament, but making a deep run," Smith said. "We're excited to be a part of that."

CLOSE An Alaska Airlines plane accidentally landed on a taxiway in between two runways in mid-December, prompting an FAA investigation at Sea-Tac International Airport. No one was injured in the incident. VPC

SEATTLE — Both the FAA and Alaska Airlines have launched investigations after a plane accidentally landed on a taxiway instead of a runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport earlier this month.
While nobody was hurt in the incident at Sea-Tac, had another plane been parked on the taxiway, the results could have been catastrophic.
A few minutes before landing at about 8:30 a.m. PT on Dec. 19, the air traffic control tower offered up runway 16 Center to Alaska Flight 27. The flight was originally scheduled to land on 16 Right. The crew accepted, but minutes later, the pilot mistakenly landed on the taxiway in-between the runways.
At first glance to those who are not seasoned pilots, it doesn't look too different from the runways at Sea-Tac, but safety experts say for decades the airport has worked to educate pilots to avoid this strip when they land.
"This is not a new problem at Sea-Tac. There have been cases going back to the 1990s of aircraft inadvertently landing on what's called 'taxiway tango,'" said aviation safety expert Todd Curtis.
Curtis says the landing instructions for Sea-Tac warn pilots about the potential for confusion on taxiways.
"So although this was a dangerous condition, a condition that should be avoided, it's something that can be learned from," said Curtis.
Sea-Tac officials say the last time it happened was in 2004, before the addition of the third runway. They say the markings and size of the taxiway are different than those of the actual runways, which include distinct markings.
"Even though it doesn't rise to the extent of a full (National Transportation Safety Board) investigation, this is something that will be investigated and investigated thoroughly," said Curtis.
It's unlikely any of the passengers on board that flight even realized what had occurred, but the FAA is investigating. Alaska Airlines officials say this is not the first time this pilot has landed at Sea-Tac Airport, and they're trying to figure out why a mistake was made.
Curtis says he doesn't believe there is a problem with the layout at Sea-Tac Airport.
Depending on the results of the investigation, the FAA could order Sea-Tac Airport to make changes if they think it's necessary.

Religion of rape: The Islamic State has issued a detailed and horrific guide to the capture, punishment, and rape of female non-believers, in accord with sharia (Islamic law).
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) requires its rank and file to follow a strict Islamic code of conduct in the matter of stealing young women and trading them like cattle for sexual gratification.
Members of ISIS have kidnapped thousands of women and girls in their raids on towns and villages across northern Syria and western Iraq. The captured females are often sold and traded as sex slaves, or given to ISIS fighters as “gifts.”
The pamphlet was published by the Research and Fatwa Department of ISIS on Dec. 3 and is written in the form of questions and answers.
The rules allow ISIS members to have sexual intercourse with, beat and trade non-Muslim slaves, including Yazidi women and girls.
The posted guidelines make it clear that, in the mind of ISIS leaders, “It is permissible to buy, sell, or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property, which can be disposed of.”
The most shocking information the pamphlet offers is the notion that it is “permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse; however if she is not fit for intercourse, then it is enough to enjoy her without intercourse.”
Below is each of the 27 horrifying rules:
The ISIS price list for slaves ranks the cost of a woman by age, so while a woman aged 40-50 would sell for just 50,000 dinars or $43, a girl aged 10-20 would be worth 150,000 dinars ($125) and a child under nine would sell for 200,000 dinars ($166).
Some Muslim apologists and other misguided liberals will claim that ISIS does not represent “true Islam.” Yet the fact is, there is no “true Islam,” only competing interpretations of Islam. And for all intents and purposes, the Islam of the Islamic State is just as legitimate as any other interpretation of Islam.
Also, some will try to argue for a moral equivalence between the horrors of Christianity and the horrors of Islam. However, the claim that Christianity in its current state is just as morally repugnant as Islam in its current state, cannot be maintained by reasonable people.
While it is conceivable, and perhaps theoretically possible, to concoct a similar program of sexual slavery using Christian patriarchal teachings, the fact remains that currently there is no “Christian state” using Christianity to justify the capture, punishment, and rape of female non-believers.
This is an interesting and possibly odd video into the search for Bigfoot but really is a pretty entertaining watch.
California On Sasquatch: A Not Finding Bigfoot Special with YouTuber Kassem G takes a kind of light hearted journey into Bigfoot but does contain some very interesting interviews and information. He visits Bigfoot Day in Willow Creek California along with the Willow Creek Bigfoot Museum and the Bigfoot Discovery Project and Museum in Felton California and many other interesting Bigfoot locations.
There are some great interviews with Dr. Jeff Meldrum and William Barnes from the Falcon Project and looks into some Bigfoot evidence that has been collected over the years. They even discuss a possible Bigfoot tooth that is currently being tested and debated as possible evidence of Bigfoot. I think you will enjoy the video even though its not a completely serious look into the elusive cryptid It's pretty entertaining and even a tad informative. Hey sometimes even Bigfoot and a Bigfoot video needs to have a lighter side.
Scheme will benefit 200,000 buyers but prevent 2 million more from getting on housing ladder, campaigners say
The government's starter homes initiative could deliver a taxpayer-backed windfall of £141,000 each to 200,000 lucky first-time buyers, but 2 million more aspiring homeowners will be stuck renting, campaigners say.
The scheme, which allows developers to replace shared ownership and affordable rented homes with properties sold at a 20% discount, has been widely criticised since it was first announced in December 2014. One of the key concerns for housing campaigners is that the homes can be sold on at the open-market rate after five years.
Lobby group Generation Rent said that this meant a “£27bn raffle” in which the original buyers stood to gain, while those who missed out would find it ever harder to get on the housing ladder. It said the scheme's potential rewards “far exceed the already generous returns of home ownership”.
The figures are based on average newbuild house prices and numbers of new homes being built around the country. The average cost of a newbuild property in England stands at £297,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. So as a starter home it would be bought at £238,000, Generation Rent said. If house prices rise at 5% a year, after five years the same property could be sold for £379,000. Outside London, the maximum cost of a qualifying home is £250,000 but in the capital that rises to £450,000. Generation Rent said buyers could stand to make a profit of £228,139 on a home bought for £383,200.
The group is calling for the homes to be subject to rules saying that they can only be sold on at a 20% discount. Betsy Dillner, the director of Generation Rent, said this would help multiple first-time buyers “instead of a jammy handful of winners in a multibillion pound raffle”.
She added: “The government said its starter homes would be exclusively for first-time buyers, but by letting them vanish into the open market after five years, they're betraying the millions who are stuck renting.”
The housing charity Shelter last year described the properties as “non-starter homes”, saying that by 2020 in more than half of the country they would be unaffordable for families earning average wages.
Shelter's chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “While the government is offering these discounted homes to a select few, for those who aren't so lucky, all they're offering is more time spent in expensive and unstable private renting, or living with mum and dad well into their 30s.
“This crisis can be turned around, but only if the government moves beyond schemes that only help the well off, and starts investing in homes that ordinary families can actually afford as well.”
As the House of Lords prepare to debate the policy as part of the housing bill this week, experts said there were many unanswered questions surrounding the policy. Neal Hudson, an associate director at property firm Savills, said that despite the scheme being a key plank of government housing policy “there is still a massive amount of detail outstanding on how it will work”.
He added: “There is likely to be a lot of uncertainty about how much people should be paying for land because they are not sure how they will be able to use it.”
Hudson said uncertainty remained over how the prices of starter homes would be determined if there were no comparable properties nearby, and how mortgage lenders would treat a property that could not be sold at market rate for five years.
Other analysts have questioned how the policy will run alongside the government's help-to-buy loan scheme, where buyers are offered a 20% interest-free loan but must repay it when they sell.
In January the head of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey said that confusion over how the scheme would work was causing problems for developers. Pete Redfern said: “It's quite hard if you're looking at a future site to know how that policy balance will end up, because local authorities feel more threatened by starter homes than by anything else.”
Research carried out by Savills for the Local Government Association (LGA) found that the discounted starter home prices were out of reach for all people in need of affordable housing in 220 council areas and for more than 90% in a further 80 council areas.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed an anti-abortion omnibus bill on Friday that imposes restrictions on abortion clinics and physicians. In a surprise, the governor vetoed a separate bill that would have prohibited Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan from including abortion in its standard health coverage.
The Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature passed both anti-abortion bills in a lame-duck session, sparking statewide protests. The bill that Snyder signed on Friday, HB5711, regulates abortion clinics as hospital operating rooms, requires doctors to screen women for coercion before providing abortions, and bans telemedicine to prescribe first-trimester medication abortions. The bill also regulates the disposal of fetal remains after abortions.
"To be screened for coercion is a reasonable thing," Snyder told The Detroit News. "It is really a question of women's health and safety."
Abortion rights advocates said the bill is intended to impose onerous regulations on abortion clinics that could force them to shut down. “This bill was meant to ban abortion in Michigan, and it was pushed through in a lame-duck session by legislators who were voted out of office because of their extreme views on women's health," said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
Snyder said he vetoed the abortion insurance bill because it would have eliminated coverage for women who had been raped or whose lives were in danger, and it dictates what kinds of coverage a private insurance company can offer. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan is the largest health insurance provider in the state.
"It just went too far," Snyder said after vetoing the bill.
Ted Dawe can understand where Family First is coming from in trying to get his book restricted, but he thinks they are ignorant of teenage reality.
The conservative Christian group wants the book Into the River to be classified R14, because it contains sex, drugs and swearing. The Film and Literature Board of Review has put an interim restriction order on the book until a classification decision is made next month.
"I know that [Family First has] this purpose as moral guardians for young, sensitive people and I have no argument with that purpose until it starts to impinge on the rights of free speech and free expression," says Dawe. "We all care about our children actually, even I do."

The former high school English teacher, who taught at Dilworth School and Aorere College among others, says his book is "innocuous" compared to other forms of media that teenagers use and he finds the restriction "baffling".
"To me it says something strange about society and parenting. Don't they know the music their kids listen to, don't they look at the games they're playing, don't they check their internet sites? To look at my book and [say] it's damaging to the youth of this country shows a gross ignorance of how things are these days."
The young adult novel, which tells the story of a 14-year-old boy who is bullied at boarding school and contains an adult-child sexual liaison, is based in part on what Dawe saw happening at schools where he worked.
"I don't like to make it too transparently obvious, and characters and situations are not photographic reproductions of what happened, they are a pick and mix - but I couldn't have written that book if I hadn't seen the things in that book happen before my eyes. That happens in New Zealand schools, it's happened at schools I've worked at, it happened at a school I went to. That's life, I'm not just throwing it in there for a gratuitousness, it's just part of what goes on in schools — read the paper."

Supporters of the Black Stars of Ghana fled the stands and sought refuge on the pitch as fans of the host Equatorial Guinea side reportedly attacked them leading to a suspension of the Africa Cup of Nations semi-final today in Malabo.
Ghana had just taken a 3-0 lead on Equatorial Guinea when the play was suspended after hundreds of Ghanaians rushed down to the playing level. It's been nearly a half hour now, and play has yet to resume; an observer says a helicopter is on the scene, and:
Unconfirmed reports that sections of the Equatorial Guinea fans are waiting at the exit of the stadium to ambush the Ghana supporters. Police are now trying to escort the Ghana fans through the players' tunnel.
The stadium in Malabo is still scheduled to host the third-place match, which will almost certainly feature that same Equatorial Guinea team. Ghana is likely to face the Ivory Coast.

By Patch O'Furr and Fred Patten, furry's favorite historian and reviewer.
Remember the amazing story about Syrian refugee kids at VancouFur? They were freshly arrived in Canada from a conservative arabic country, and housed in the same hotel with the furries. At first there were warnings and high caution about the situation. Then the kids went wild about how cool it was. Remember that happened when you read the culture clash topic below!
Fred Patten wanted to learn about furry writing in Southeast Asia. (It's a natural interest – he isn't just a “founder” of furry fandom, he also helped bring anime to North America in the 1970's). So Fred spoke with an academic in Malaysia who said this about furry novels:
“In Malaysia, portraying animal being human-like and intelligent is something rare and was not encouraged. This is because it contradicts with the Islamic teaching (Islam being the national religion of Malaysia). So, I am sorry to say I could not recommend any titles for you. Would be similar case for Indonesia too. But currently, there is a rise of independent novel publishers that doesn't confine to the typical novel styles in Malaysia. They are labeled as rebels and those who tend to ‘speak their mind' without any censorship.”
The discussion is related to Fred's 2012 article – Survey: Foreign Furry novels. It adds relevant thoughts from a poster to the AnthroAsia forum:
Anthropomorphism is very much a Western concept passed on to this part of the world. When I was growing up, the only exposure to anthropomorphic characters was through children's storybooks or through cartoons on the television. Even the first few books that I did get (Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern) was at a local Borders store or through Amazon. Here, in Singapore, where English is the language of instruction, most of our material originates from the West.
New furry conventions are sprouting up in Southeast Asia. This includes south China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand:
One Southeast Asian country is conspicuously missing: Burma/Myanmar. Of course, there have been furry conventions in Japan for the last decade.
The Southeast Asian furry community has been growing since AnthroAsia went online in 2004. There have been higher-profile furmeets in Bangkok since 2012, and these conventions have had no trouble getting meeting space. At least one furry author, MikasiWolf in Singapore, has risen since 2013, although his short stories have all been published in English outside Southeast Asia so far.
Disney's Zootopia has been distributed throughout Southeast Asia including in Cambodia and Vietnam, although this may have been only in the largest and most cosmopolitan cities. In general, things are looking encouraging for the furry community there, and furry fandom has been accepted without notice.
Could such Western influences bring backlash? Things haven't always been positive. Some terrorism in Southeast Asia has been blamed on reactionary Islamic groups, such as the bombing of Western tourists in Bali in 2002.
Disney's Zootopia was released in Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Does this mean that attitudes have changed in some Islamic countries? Or that it is an example of the power of Disney? Or has distribution there been only in the most cosmopolitan cities?
Things taken for granted elsewhere in the West aren't free to see everywhere; consider how ubiquitous Santa Claus is. But the government of Uzbekistan ordered Santa Claus and Russia's similar Grandfather Frost taken off TV because they're non-Uzbeki… but it's more probably because they're non-Islamic.
Remember when the Iron Curtain dominated half the world up to the 1980's? It was a huge deal when rock and roll, jeans and McDonald's came to Russia. Such things can be unexpectedly subversive.
It's universal to love anthro animals. Art and cartoons speak in ways that words can't. Maybe kids will have that as part of loosening domination in their countries. There already are pockets of furs in places like Iran.
Furry is an international conspiracy built from grassroots. It could take a little part in a bigger clash. So far, all I have are questions and curiosity. Especially if this ever starts to involve “the topic we love to hate” – the duality of Disney vs. Dirty in the fandom. As much as it causes concern, it's also a source of independence and liberation. Something that many parts of the world could use in whatever form it takes.

As a child, Anthony Villarreal knew he was different. His elementary school friends had girlfriends; he planned weddings.
Villarreal was raised Catholic, in the small town of Sanger, east of Fresno. He accepted an athletic scholarship to William Jessup University – a private Christian college in Rocklin, northeast of Sacramento – and enrolled in 2010.
“I was conflicted,” he recalls. “I was Christian and I had an idea that I might be gay, but I was in denial.”
Villarreal only came out to a few people during his years at William Jessup. But in his final semester, something very public happened. A loud argument with his live-in boyfriend over whether he should come out led his neighbors to call the cops, and he was arrested for domestic violence.
Soon after, the university dismissed him. Villarreal is convinced he was kicked out because he's gay; the university says it was for domestic violence.
“In a sense, they ruined my life,” Villarreal said. “They may not know it. They may not feel it. And they may deny it. But they changed the path of my life dramatically.”
Now, this example is an imperfect one: Villarreal was never charged with domestic violence, and there's no proof the university dismissed him for being gay. In fact, the university says, it never discriminates against students based on sexual orientation.
But Villarreal says many LGBT students at faith-based schools feel pressure to be someone they're not, “and this bill will make sure that no one has to go through what I had to go through.”
The bill he's talking about is a measure in the California Legislature, SB 1146.
“We're saying, if there is discrimination, and you can prove that in a court of law, people should be able to have damages for that,” says the bill's author, Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara.
Religious colleges and universities can claim an exemption from federal and state anti-discrimination laws. In California, those laws cover sexual orientation. Lara wants to end that exemption under state law for any institution that receives public funding – including state financial aid.
William Jessup's president, Dr. John Jackson, says Lara's proposal would force his school to change its faith-based policies, stop admitting students on state aid, or be sued.
“We do think it's ultimately a religiously discriminating bill,” Jackson says. “To our knowledge, there has never been a religious test for public benefits.”
Some California lawmakers agree.
“The danger that we pose is that when we try to parse out what is religious and what we view should be the proper view, we're kind of imposing a secular view on that religious institution,” Republican Asm. James Gallagher said at a recent legislative hearing.
That opposition led Lara to strip the liability provision. It now requires religious colleges and universities to notify current and future students and staff of the anti-discrimination exemption. The scaled-back bill must pass the California Legislature by the end of the month.
“This is really about the classical balance in the United States between religious liberty and the moral imperative not to harm others,” says Marci Hamilton, an expert on law and religion at the University of Pennsylvania.
Hamilton says 21 states have religious freedom restoration acts (RFRAs), where religious groups could try to overturn this scaled-back bill.
“But California is the only state where the disclosure is being introduced, and there's no background RFRA, and so the religious groups are basically having to explain themselves to the Legislature,“ Hamilton says. “So it's dramatically different politically.”
And the issue isn't going away. Lara says he'll try again next year to make religious colleges and universities liable for discrimination.

The Letter William Jessup Sent to Villareal
Story highlights As many as 1,000 Foxconn workers rioted in Chengdu on Monday, reports Taiwanese news site
Foxconn called the incident a "disagreement"
The company has been repeatedly been dogged by reports of alleged poor treatment of its employees
Workers at Foxconn, which makes products for companies including Apple, have rioted at an employee dormitory in China, a Taiwanese news site reported Thursday.
There are differing accounts of the Monday incident.
The Want China Times reported that as many as 1,000 Foxconn workers in Chengdu threw trash, chairs, bottles and destroyed public facilities in a fracas that lasted two hours. The clash broke out at a male dormitory for Foxconn employees after workers hindered security guards who were trying to stop an alleged thief, the website said.
Foxconn, a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, described Monday's incident as a "disagreement." Local police were called to restore order, it said in a statement received by CNN.
A website affiliated with the publicity department of the Sichuan province, where the incident occurred, stated that the riot was triggered by a disagreement between seven Foxconn workers and a restaurant owner.
Foxconn is one of Apple's biggest manufacturing partners and employs hundreds of thousands of people in China to build popular electronic products like the iPhone and iPad. It has been repeatedly dogged by reports of alleged poor treatment of its employees including hazardous working conditions, harassment of workers and harsh living conditions.
Foxconn said events began after several of its workers from the plant had a disagreement with a restaurant owner in Chengdu. The disgruntled workers returned to their dormitory, "at which time a number of other residents also became involved in the disagreement and local police were called to the scene to restore order," the company added. The statement did not clarify with whom the workers had a conflict.
"Foxconn is cooperating with local law enforcement authorities on their investigation into this incident," the company stated.

The company also noted that the dormitory where the incident occurred was "owned and managed by third-party companies."
A publicity website for the Sichuan province stated that seven Foxconn workers affected by alcohol argued with a restaurant owner and began damaging the restaurant, which was reported by the China Daily.
Police were called and the workers fled to their dormitory, shouting "They are beating us," which triggered the riot involving about 100 workers, according to the statement. The provincial government said that no one was injured during the incident.
In a contrasting report, the Taiwanese news site reported that the initial rioting workers had prior grievances with the security guards. Citing Molihua, a news advocacy website for human rights in China, it said dozens of employees were arrested.
In recent months, Foxconn has been under intense scrutiny over working conditions at its Chinese plants.
A report released in June by a Hong Kong-based labor rights group said Foxconn workers in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhengzhou were subjected to long hours, low pay, humiliation and harassment. Another report issued by the Fair Labor Association in May found numerous safety problems at the factories.
Foxconn first came under the spotlight in 2010 after a series of worker suicides. This prompted Chairman Terry Gou to make an unprecedented public apology. Foxconn then released a statement saying it had introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out their frustration on mannequins with bats.
Although Foxconn makes electronic goods for Sony, Microsoft, Nokia and other household brands, it is most recognized for producing Apple products.
Washington preens itself on being “the world's greatest democracy.” Washington uses the claim that it is spreading democracy as a justification for its naked aggression–a clear and unambiguous war crime–against other countries. Washington cloaks its illegality in democratic rhetoric despite the obvious fact that its wars are not a consequence of democratic decision.
Washington has used deception and lies to gain acceptance of its extra-constitutional and extra-legal wars, but Washington's wars have all been launched outside the constitutional/democratic framework of the United States.
Obama's war against Libya occurred without the participation of Congress. And now Obama is again revealing that the US is so far removed from democracy that he plans to attack Syria without a vote by Congress. Where is the democracy when a Caesar makes the decisions that the Constitution reserves to Congress?
Polls indicate that 80 percent of US citizens believe that a US military attack on Syria requires approval by the House and Senate. Yet, the Obama regime is purposely avoiding any such vote. The Obama regime has also ignored the letter signed by 162 members of the House of Representatives demanding to see evidence, debate it, and vote prior to any US military strike.
It is an act of treason for the US military to carry out any war orders without congressional authorization. Any military commander who violates his oath to defend the Constitution of the United States has committed high treason against the United States. If the US were truly a lawful democracy, such commanders would be subject to arrest and trial.
The fact that the executive branch and the military operate outside the Constitution and democratic process is proof that the US is not a democracy.
In yesterday's columns I noted that Obama, his media whores, and worshiping Obamabots are overlooking considerations of critical importance. One is that military aggression is a war crime. In the past, Bush and Obama had cloaks for their war crimes, such as a “coalition of the willing,” NATO, some limited “congressional consultation” or vague resolution, or a UN resolution that is then stretched to cover the regime's actions.
None of these things are adequate legal cover. Their worth comes from the fact that other countries and institutions besides the US executive branch are involved in the war crime. There is safety in the numbers. Charging the entire Western world with war crimes means only that the entire Western world will defend the validity of their excuse.
But this time the regime has no cover. There is no “coalition of the willing,” no UN resolution, no NATO support, and Obama has ignored both Congress and the American people. For Obama to proceed with his attack on Syria would be the action of an unaccountable dictator. He would have no cover for his war crime.
Obama's effort to rush to war with Syria has already destroyed the credibility of the US government as a truthful, honest government. The entire world, even Washington's most subservient puppet states, have recognized that Washington has no evidence to back its accusations. No one believes Obama or Kerry. Both have revealed themselves to the entire world as brazen liars. The Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.90 Buy New $5.00 (as of 01:55 EST - Details)
This has destroyed all trust in the US government. And now Obama seems determined to prove that America has a dictator, not a democracy.
It is difficult to imagine a more serious blow to the US than the one Obama has delivered.All of the important props for Washington's propaganda, such as “the world's greatest democracy,” have been kicked out from under what now stands revealed as a criminal enterprise.
Russia's President Putin has openly expressed his contempt for the lies that are flowing nonstop from the mouths of Obama and Kerry. Putin called Obama's claims “utter nonsense.” Putin said that if the Americans have any proof, “let them show it to the United Nations inspectors and the Security Council.”
In fact, the evidence that exists indicates that the chemical attack originated with the rebels and may have been an accident caused by “rebels” transporting chemical weapons given to them by the Saudis but without instruction to correct handling. The reporter, Dale Gavlak, who spoke with the rebels, who were themselves harmed by the weapons, is a Middle East expert from the University of Chicago who has reported for the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and the BBC.http://original.antiwar.com/Dale-Gavlak/2013/08/30/syrians-in-ghouta-claim-saudi-supplied-rebels-behind-chemical-attack/
For another perspective unreported by the US media, see Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's report in the UK Telegraph that Saudi Prince Bandar, head of Saudi intelligence, attempted to bribe and intimidate Putin into abandoning Syria to the Americans. Reportedly, Bandar offered Putin a Saudi-Russian oil cartel and offered Putin protection against Chechen terrorist attacks on Russia's Winter Olympics.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10266957/Saudis-offer-Russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-Syria.htmlAs farfetched as all of these sounds to Americans, it is more plausible than anything Washington says.
Washington's claim that the Syrian “rebels” have no access to chemical weapons is obviously false. On May 30, an Istanbul newspaper reported that Turkish police apprehended al-Nusra “rebels” with sarin gas that al-Nusra planed to use in an attackon Adana. http://www.todayszaman.com/news-316966-report-police-foil-al-nusra-bomb-attack-planned-for-adana.html
Having repeatedly declared that the use of chemical weapons requires a military response from the US, what will Obama and Kerry do when it comes clear that the “rebels,” not Assad, are responsible for the chemical weapons? Will Obama and Kerry attack the “rebels”? Will Obama and Kerry attack Saudi Arabia for giving the chemical weapons to the “rebels”? Don't hold your breath.
My Ph.D. dissertation supervisor, G. Warren Nutter, was brought into the Pentagon by Melvin Laird as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and given the task of winding down the Vietnam War. Nutter opposed US foreign policy based on secrecy and deception. He was convinced that US foreign policy had to be transparent, consistent with the country's principles, and carry public support. A policy based on secrecy and deception would undermine democracy and the trust of the public and foreigners in the US government.
Today there are no Warren Nutters in Washington, and there have not been such people in government for many years. As Nutter foresaw, the consequences are the loss of public confidence in government and the isolation of the US in world affairs.
Obama now stands on the verge of military aggression as isolated as Adolf Hitler when Germany attacked Poland.
UPDATE: 4:00 PM US East Coast Time
The White House Fool, learning from the alternative media and not from his moronic advisers that he is isolated in the world and has no cover for his war crime against Syria, has announced that he is going to wait until he gets approval from Congress.
No doubt the White House Fool was also moved by the letter from 161 members of the House of Representatives that to engage in hostilities without congressional authorization is unconstitutional. The letter contains the threat of impeachment:
“We strongly urge you to consult and receive authorization from Congress before ordering the use of U.S. military force in Syria. Your responsibility to do so is prescribed in the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973.
“While the Founders wisely gave the Office of the President the authority to act in emergencies, they foresaw the need to ensure public debate – and the active engagement of Congress – prior to committing U.S. military assets. Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the Constitution.” http://antiwar.com/blog/2013/08/31/impeachment-congress-fires-opening-shot-across-obamas-bow/
We can be thankful that at least 161 members of Congress recognize their responsibility to hold the executive branch accountable to the Constitution. Perhaps the lies from the executive branch became so brazen that they lost their effectiveness. Instead of fearing a hyped “terrorist threat,” people now see the threat of a White House Tyrant.
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
Americans have, at this juncture in our history, become accustomed to conducting our most painful reckonings in public. The balcony of the Lorraine Motel, Dealey Plaza, the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, and a forsaken driveway in Mississippi occupy a profane corner in the minds of a generation of Americans. Yet the geography of conflict extends well beyond the locales where Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Medgar Evers perished. There are lesser-known addresses: the street corner where residents are routinely stopped and frisked, the side of the road where a driver is detained for a minor violation. These are the less visible conflicts that cumulatively become something volatile. Fifty years ago this week, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, a piece of legislation that was hailed as a hallmark of racial progress. Five days later, a police traffic stop in Watts, California, detonated five days of riots that left thirty-four dead and cleaved the city's history into the era before the fires and the years that succeeded it.
The theatre of revolt that was staged in the streets of Watts became a redundant feature of the period, with successive explosions taking place in many other American cities before the end of the decade. That history, despite whatever efforts were made, has not been interred in the past.
The photographer Philip Montgomery was born in 1988, twenty years after the assassination of Martin Luther King and the wake of fire that his death brought about. Yet Montgomery's images convey an elemental historical quality—familiar in the way of the angry imagery from Watts, Newark, Harlem, Detroit, and the other flammable precincts of the late sixties. These new photos capture recent events in Baltimore, Maryland, in Ferguson, Missouri, and in Newark, New Jersey, where Montgomery shadowed police officers in order to study the department's use of stop-and-frisk. But his images from these three cities feel interchangeable, not just geographically but temporally as well. Canfield Drive in Ferguson and Presbury Street in Baltimore are reference points in a much longer lineage. (That we could easily add Sanford, Florida, Cleveland, Ohio, Charleston and North Charleston, South Carolina, and Staten Island, New York, to this list of racial flash points establishes just how redundant this phenomenon is.)
Montgomery's photographs capture the humanity of people for whom this lineage is not an abstract concern. There's a woman, palm to the sky, anguish etched in her features. We know nothing of what happened immediately before that moment, but we're tragically familiar with what she's gone through. A young man stands in the middle of the street during a storm, his gaze focussed somewhere far behind the lens. What fear animates the expression he wears? Here is a different man who has been stopped, but “frisk” is the grossest of misnomers for what is being done to him. These are not disjointed moments bound by a single artist's perspective. These are stations in an American crucible.
Photographs from Baltimore were shot for The New Yorker. Photographs from Newark were shot for The Atlantic.

April 14, 2016 - In a recent issue of Forbes magazine, author Dan Munro asks the question, “Is Ransomware Considered a Health Data Breach Under HIPAA?”
In developing the answer to that question, Dan speaks with experts in the healthcare and compliance domains, and the headline question is answered with a reasoned “No.”
According to the information presented, a ransomware attack should not be considered to have violated the PHI disclosure restrictions in HIPAA, and it is more about “the message of lax security that's being broadcast to cybercriminals around the world.”
I think otherwise.
Ransomware attacks need to be disclosed as unauthorized exposures of private information because they are every bit as dangerous as the outright theft of the laptop, desktop, or server that they infect.
READ MORE: Urology Austin Ransomware Attack Possibly Affects 279K
In 2015, according to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the US Department of Health and Human Services, there were over 300 disclosed healthcare breaches. Of these, about one-third are attributed to the loss or theft of some piece of equipment: a laptop, desktop, server, or other portable electronic device.
Over 100 of the disclosed breaches, representing hundreds of thousands of records, were reported because a system that contained PHI came under the control of a criminal. There is no need to verify that the information stolen in this manner is ever accessed or used; the existence of this important information in the hands of a criminal is enough of a threat that it must be reported.
These losses and thefts require disclosure under HIPAA because the systems being accessed, and the PHI they contain, are no longer in the control of the healthcare provider. This sounds a lot like ransomware.
Understanding ransomware attacks
There are a couple of different popular types of ransomware. Some are programs that take control of the machine and lock it down so that the legitimate user can't even enter the system before paying the ransom. Clearly, in this case, the system is no longer in the control of the healthcare provider, and is, for some period of time, under the control of a criminal.
READ MORE: 79K Patients Affected by Emory Healthcare Data Breach
Sometimes it is being remotely accessed and driven by whatever criminal awaits the Bitcoin payment, and its activities are unknowable to the legitimate owner until the criminal reconfigures and unlocks the system. Here you have PHI, on a system under the control of a criminal.
A more common form of ransomware takes the time to encrypt files that are expected to be valuable to the system owner. In this case, the ransomware installs itself, then identifies and individually encrypts those valuable files.
In this process, it accesses the files, passes them through an encryption function, and then stores the resulting encrypted copies in their place. Again, the ransomware has now obviously accessed any PHI on the infected system and will access it again when the original patient data is reconstituted after the ransom has been paid.
In April of 2014, the FBI released a report where they set the value of a stolen medical record at approximately $50. Last year, National Public Radio reported on the value of stolen medical records and highlighted a dealer selling them for roughly $470/record.
In contrast, the monetization of these infected systems through ransomware is currently around $500 an attack. With this kind of access to records and a Bitcoin-enabled anonymous transaction engine, it is predictable, if not expected, that the same attacks will evolve to take advantage of this additional value via a two-phase collection.

First, ransom will be demanded to make the system and data accessible to the rightful owner so that healthcare can be provided. Second, the accessed records will be put up for sale on the dark web, ultimately exposing the patients' healthcare information.
This question of breach disclosure matters because underreporting makes it difficult to create a balanced solution to any complex and costly issue. We are at a tipping point with ransomware, and appropriate disclosure is critical to informed preparation and prevention.
We need to get a handle on the actual spread and cost of these attacks so that organizations can justify investments to prevent infection, and so that legislators and law enforcement agencies will see clearly the enormous risk that ransomware poses.

Senator Leila De Lima's claim that convicted kidnapper Jaybee Sebastian was a government asset is stupid, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said on Friday.
De Lima earlier said that Sebastian was a government asset. She said he has given the government useful information that led to the December 2014 raid in the Bilibid.

READ: De Lima says Jaybee was her asset
The senator initiated the “Oplan Galugad” or the series of raids inside the New Bilibid Prison. The first raid was on Dec. 15, 2014 where members of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) seized firearms, illegal drugs, cash, jewelries and posh appliances inside the prison. Nineteen high-profile inmates were then transferred to the NBI to prevent them from continuing with their illegal activities. Sebastian was not included.
Before the end of 2014, De Lima gave the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) two weeks to dismantle all kubols.
“I told them not to wait for me to be the one to do it…I reiterated that if Jaybee Sebastian has a kubol, it should be dismantled. Do not wait for me to do it,” De Lima told reporters in a previous interview.
Aguirre said if Sebastian was a government asset, he should not have been included in the list of investigative agencies as among the personalities involved in crimes.
“Also, if it is true that he was an asset, it is stupid to separate Jaybee from the Bilibid 19 [inmates transferred to NBI after De Lima's first Bilbid raid],” Aguirre said.
“Why did you separate him from the other high-profile inmates?” he added.
During the House of Representatives inquiry into the proliferation of illegal drugs inside prison, Aguirre presented a documentary that featured Sebastian's posh office inside the prison. RAM/rga

J.E.B. Stuart High School in the Lake Barcroft community is seen on June 14, 2014 in Falls Church, Va. (Amanda Voisard/For The Washington Post)
One of the nation's largest school districts has amended its school-naming policy, opening the door for changes to schools that honor Confederate generals and evoke the school system's legacy of resisting integration.
Students, community members and alumni in Fairfax County have been agitating to change the names of two high schools named for Confederate generals — J.E.B. Stuart and Robert E. Lee — and a third honoring a past superintendent, W.T. Woodson, who was an opponent of desegregation.
The school board voted unanimously Thursday to alter the policy that barred officials from changing the names of school buildings unless the building was repurposed. Under the new policy, the board also can change a name “where some other compelling need exists.”
Those who lined up to speak in favor of changing the names linked to the Confederacy and segregation said they definitely have a “compelling need.”
Lee and Stuart high schools opened in the late 1950s, as Fairfax County battled desegregation orders. Many believe that the naming of the schools for Confederate generals was a way to send a message to black students that they were not welcome. Stuart did not admit black students until 1961.
“Make no mistake; J.E.B. Stuart High School was not named to honor a Confederate general's role in the Civil War,” said Stephen Spitz, a neighborhood resident who has litigated school desegregation cases. “The school was named as part of Virginia's massive resistance to school integration.”
Lidia Amanuel, 17, a Stuart senior and an Eritrean immigrant, said the school's name disgusts her and her classmates, who are part of the most diverse high school in the county.
“This change is imperative to revise the original message that was sent to the people of color,” Amanuel said. “My values are challenged when I am forced to celebrate the Confederacy to express the love of my school.”

The campaign to change the schools' names began in June, after the fatal shooting of nine black members of a church in Charleston, S.C., by a self-proclaimed white supremacist, which spurred officials across the country to reexamine monuments and institutions named for Confederate figures and others who defended slavery. That scrutiny has expanded to include statesmen and leaders who backed segregation.
Students and alumni started a petition in June to change the name of Stuart. In August, two famous alumni — actress Julianne Moore and director Bruce Cohen — lent their name to the cause, starting a second petition to rename the school for Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice and a former Fairfax County resident. The latter petition has garnered nearly 35,000 signatures.

Other community members have expressed opposition to changing the name, starting their own petitions. The school board, while voting unanimously to change district policy, hinted that they disagreed over whether the name should be changed and if Thurgood Marshall would be an appropriate replacement.
“What's the cost that's associated? What's to be gained?” said board member Elizabeth Schultz (Springfield), who added that she is wary of changing the name. She said she could not support renaming the high school for Thurgood Marshall because there's already a Marshall High School, named for George C. Marshall, in Falls Church. But she suggested an alternative, honoring the man who founded Martin Luther King Jr. Day: Ronald Wilson Reagan High School.
William Parker's Abstract Grooves Collected In Box Set

Steve Lacy used to say that the right partner can help you make music you couldn't get to by yourself. Take the quartet William Parker founded in 2000, for example. Parker's bass tone was always sturdy as a tree trunk, but power drummer Hamid Drake gives him lift. The upshot is that free jazz can swing, too. The quartet's front line is another firm partnership: quicksilver alto saxophonist Rob Brown and flinty trumpeter Lewis Barnes. Their scrappy unisons on the melodies are raggedly right, and they finish each other's phrases when they improvise. Parker writes them all catchy tunes to use as springboards.
A new Parker box set deserves to be on a bunch of Christmas lists. Wood Flute Songs includes six concerts on eight CDs, recorded between 2006 and 2012. The first half is for the quartet alone. On the rest, that foursome plus guests make up units of five to 12 pieces, with mixed results. In a sextet, singer Leena Conquest and pianist Eri Yamamoto only intensify the groove, as in Parker's war-victim's protest song "Boom Boom Bang Bang." A seven-piece edition includes Bobby Bradford on cornet, Billy Bang on violin (he's sometimes a spiky presence in the rhythm section) and altoist James Spaulding, who played on dozens of vintage Blue Note dates without getting one of his own.
For Hamid Drake, this band and William Parker's composing let the drummer get to all sorts of stuff he's into, including reggae ("Daughter's Joy"), funk, North African and Native American rhythms ("Ojibway Song," "Hopi Spirits").
Wood Flute Songs comes in a handsome and unfussy little cardboard box, with a fat program book containing fine art reproductions and William Parker's notes. Its six recorded concerts are also available separately as downloads. The cautiously curious might try the quartet's roaring good night at Yoshi's in Oakland in 2006 — even if it starts with a 10-minute bass solo. The most recent music comes from June 2012, and a quintet where pianist Cooper-Moore throws some firecrackers.
I like the quartet with guests. But I like it alone at least as much.
Lionsgate has expanded its output agreement with Russian distributor Central Partnership for the distribution of Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment films in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The previous agreement covered only Summit titles. The new agreement will encompass both Lionsgate and Summit films, including Otto Bathurst's “Robin Hood” — the contemporary reboot starring Jamie Foxx and Taron Egerton — and the action thriller “Granite Mountain,” featuring Josh Brolin, Jennifer Connelly, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges and Taylor Kitsch. Sony recently took U.S. rights to “Granite Mountain.”
Its other pics include Lionsgate/CBS Films' “American Assassin” with Michael Keaton and Dylan O'Brien; the supernatural crime thriller “Kin,” starring Jack Reynor, James Franco, and Zoe Kravitz; and “Chaos Walking,” toplined by Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland.
Under the previous deal, Central Partnership had distributed the “Now You See Me” titles, the “Divergent” franchise, “John Wick: Chapter Two,” and “La La Land.” The agreement was announced by Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chairman Patrick Wachsberger and International COO Andrew Kramer, along with GPM KIT's CEO Rafael Minasbekyan and Central Partnership's CEO Pavel Stepanov.
The agreement was negotiated by Lionsgate's Crystal Bourbeau and Central Partnership's Armen Dishdishyan.
Limerick winger Ian Turner has been named the SSE Airtricity/Soccer Writers' Association of Ireland Player of the Month for October.
It was the first time Turner, who played a key role in Limerick's late attempt to avoid relegation, has won the award.
Limerick avoided automatic relegation on the final day of the season, despite failing to win any of their opening 21 games.
However, they lost out to Finn Harps over two legs in a play-off to condemn the Blues to a season in the First Division.
Turner reckons it is hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong this season but believes the move from Jackman Park to Markets Field helped steer them in the right direction after a poor start.
"The Finn Harps defeat was an anti-climax after what we went through to put ourselves in that position," he admitted.
"I don't think we can make excuses but Jackman Park didn't help us. We try to play good football and get the ball on the ground and that pitch didn't suit us.
"Moving to Markets Field gave us a lift because it's a bigger pitch and a good surface.
"Ultimately we failed to get over the line and it's hard to put your finger on why we got off to such a bad start.
"They say winning is a habit and losing is a habit too. I think we got into a bad habit and it was hard to get out of it."
Turner was bitterly disappointed after the play-off defeat to Harps and feels Limerick lost the tie in the first leg having only won the game 1-0 and missing a number of chances.
"I thought the second leg was a very even game," he said.
"The first leg killed us. We should have had two or three goals going up there, we missed a lot of chances. But to be fair to them they set up defensively and they kicked and headed everything away."
Turner is unsure what the future holds for him and he does not know where he will be playing his football next season.
"It's hard to say because it's still very fresh" he added.
“I'm waiting to see what happens. There are meetings planned for this week so we'll just have to see what the future holds."
Double-winning Dundalk midfielder Richie Towell was runner-up for the monthly honour, while Ciaran Gallagher of Finn Harps finished third in the voting.

City officials shot down a $550 million plan to lure an NBA team back to Seattle — and sports fans flung violent threats and sexist abuse at the five women who voted against the measure.
The City Council voted 5-4 along gender lines to reject the measure, which would have cost taxpayers $200 million, due to their concerns over the project's promised benefits, reported the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
Lisa Herbold, who voted against the proposal along with the rest of the council's first female majority since 1994, said she feared the development would cost the region some of its industrial and maritime jobs.
Their decision is supported by 77 percent of registered voters, according to polls — but some opponents expressed themselves with ugly rhetoric that's been renounced by the project's would-be developer.
“While we may not agree with the Council's vote, misogynistic insults, vile comments and threats are unacceptable and need to stop,” said developer Chris Hansen.
The five women have received a barrage of sexist and violent threats against them since Monday's vote.
“You have made this world a worse place by whoring yourselves out to the highest bidder,” one man wrote via email. “Each of you should rot in hell for what you took from me yesterday.”
“I TRULY pray for nothing but horrible things for each of you moving forward,” said the man, who was identified as Lynwood attorney Jason Feldman. “As women I understand you spend a lot of your time trying to please others (mostly on your knees) but I can only hope that you each find ways to quickly and painfully end yourselves.”
The Seattle Times reported that Feldman is currently appealing a 2 1/2-year suspension by the state bar association for having sexual relations with a client.
The client had accused Feldman of sexual assault in 2013, but he was not charged.
A Seattle man has filed a new bar complaint against Feldman for his “abusive” email — which he sent to each of the City Council's five women.
The women have not yet commented on the sexist insults, which included individual threats and attacks against all women.
“I think someone should smash Kshama Sawant's head into a brick wall,” one Twitter user wrote, referring to one of the City Council members by name.
“So this is why Ann Coulter has said that women shouldn't be allowed to vote,” another man said.
Hansen, the developer, has a memorandum of understanding with the city that lasts through 2017, so his plan to build an NBA arena is not yet entirely derailed.
JAKARTA: The death toll from a ferry disaster in central Indonesia has risen to 63 with a handful of people still missing as the search and rescue operation winds down, an official said on Friday.Search and rescue agency chief Bambang Soelistyo said as of Friday morning 103 passengers aboard the ill-fated boat had been recovered, with just 40 found alive."If the information is correct, we are still searching for 15 other missing people," Soelistyo told AFP, adding that all the bodies found so far were within the search area.The ferry operator said the boat was carrying 116 people when it ran into trouble, but Soelistyo said there were two canteen staff who were not mentioned on the manifest.Ten vessels — including navy warships — and two aircraft are scouring the seas for any sign of the missing, while families wait anxiously for news in Siwa, the port town where the stricken vessel was heading.Soelistyo said according to the initial plan the search should end on Saturday but could be extended depending on a final evaluation of the operation.The ferry sank on rough seas last Saturday with survivors describing massive waves smashing into the vessel before the engine died and the order was made to abandon ship.The Indonesian archipelago of more than 17,000 islands is heavily dependent on ferry services but fatal accidents are common.
Almost three years ago, on Feb 19, 2013, I opened the 8.x-dev branch of the Honeypot module (which helps prevent form spam on thousands of Drupal sites). These were heady times in the lifetime of the then-Drupal 8.x branch; 8.0-alpha1 wasn't released until three months later, on May 19. I made the #D8CX pledge—when Drupal 8 was released, I'd make sure there was a full, stable Honeypot release ready to go.
Little did I know it would be more than 2.5 years—and counting—before I could see that promise through to fruition!
As months turned into years, I've kept to the pledge, and eventually decided to also port a couple other modules that I use on many of my own Drupal sites, like Wysiwyg Linebreaks and Simple Mail.
Two years ago, I mentioned in the original Honeypot D8 conversion issue that I'd likely write a blog post "about the process of porting a moderately-complex module like this from D7 to D8". Well, I finally had some time to write that post—and I'm still wondering how far off will be the release of Drupal 8.0.0!
When working on the initial port, and when opening a new issue almost on a monthly basis to rework parts of the module to keep up with Drupal 8 core changes, I would frequently read through all the new nodes posted to the list of Change records for Drupal core.
These change records are like the Bible of translating 'how do I do Y in Drupal 8 when I did X in Drupal 7'? Most of the change records have fitting examples, contain a good amount of detail, and link back to the one, two, or ten issues that caused the particular change record to be written.
However, there were a few that were in a sorry state; these change records didn't have references back to all the relevant Drupal core issues, or only provided contrived examples that didn't help me much. In these cases, I took the following approach:
Try to find the git commits that caused Honeypot tests or code to fail, do a git blame. Find the issue(s) referenced by the breaking commits. Read through the issue summary and see if it helps figure out how to fix my code. If that doesn't help, read through the commit itself, then the code that was changed, and see if that helps. If that doesn't help, read the entire issue comment history to see if that helps. If that doesn't help, pop over to the ever-helpful #drupal-contribute IRC channel. (The most important part) Go back to the deficient change record and edit it, adding appropriate issue references, code examples and documentation.
In the course of the 71 distinct Honeypot 8.x commits that have been added so far, I had to go all the way to numbers 5 and 6 quite often. If it weren't for the incredible helpfulness of people like webchick , tim.plunkett , and others who seem to be living change record references, I would've probably given up the endeavor to keep Honeypot's Drupal 8 branch up to date the past three years!
Automated tests are a pain to maintain... but help immensely
The Drupal 7 version of Honeypot had almost complete SimpleTest coverage for primary module functionality. One of the first steps in porting the module to Drupal 8—and the best way to make sure all the primary functionality was working correctly—was to port the tests to Drupal 8.
There have been dozens of automated testing changes in Drupal 8 that have caused tests to fail or give unexpected results. This caused some frustration in figuring out whether a particular failure was due to failing code or changes to the testing API.
Even with the small frustrations of broken tests every month or two, the test coverage is a huge help in ensuring long-term stability for a moderately-complex module like Honeypot. Especially when refactoring a large part of the module, or porting a feature between major Drupal versions, automated test coverage has more than made up for the extra time spent creating the tests.
The Drupal community is ever-helpful
The other thing that's been an immense help throughout the development cycle is community involvement. Since Honeypot was one of the earliest modules with a stable Drupal 8 version (it's already seen 15 stable releases with 100% passing tests!), it's already used on many public Drupal 8 sites (over 80 at this point!). And this means there are users of the module invested in its success.
These early Drupal 8 adopters and other generous Drupal developers contributed code to fix a total of 12 of the hairest issues during the D8 development cycle so far.
Come for the code, stay for the community; my experience porting Honeypot to Drupal 8 (the easy part), and chasing Drupal 8 HEAD for three years (the hard part) has again provent to me the truth of this catch phrase. I hope I can say thanks in person to at least some of the following Honeypot D8 contributors over the past three years:
2.5 years, and counting
Much has been written about core contributor burnout, but I wanted to give some credit and kudos to the army of dedicated contributed module maintainers who have already made the #D8CX pledge. A major reason for Drupal's success in so many industries is the array of contributed modules available.
The very long development cycle between major releases—coupled with the fact that many contrib maintainers are now supporting three major versions of their modules—means that contributed module maintainers are at risk for burning out too.
I'd really like to be able to focus more of my limited time for Honeypot development on new features again, especially since a few of these new features would greatly benefit the 55,000+ Drupal 6 and 7 websites already using the module today. But until we have a solid API freeze for Drupal 8.0.x, most of my time will be spent fixing tests and code just to keep Honeypot working with HEAD.
I'll be at DrupalCon LA, and I hope to do whatever small part I can to get Drupal 8.0.0 out the door—will you do the same?

It's now been 48 hours since the biggest leak of private nude photos of celebrities in history, an event dubbed “The Fappening”. Details are starting to appear about what had happened. At the same time, some are demanding blood and wanting to know “whose fault” this was. It's more complex than that.
“Whose fault was it?”
That's been the question I've heard the most regarding the enormous leak of nude photos this week. It's a bit more complicated than denouncing hackers and thinking the world is nicely black and white. Yes, what they did – leaking the private photos – was illegal. But if the exact same thing had happened as part of a law enforcement investigation, the same leak would have happened legally.
To top that consideration off, we know that employees at the NSA are routinely intercepting nude photos in transit, passing them around, considering looking at others' private photos a fringe benefit of the job.
So it's not as easy as saying that the people who leaked the photos are criminals, when others can do it legally, and others still at government agencies are doing it all the time, including right now. The difference here was not one of action, but one of who took the action. Does that make it wrong? Yes. Would it still be wrong if the NSA did it? Yes. But it would be legal. Or at least legal enough. Was it wrong of Apple to provide so sloppy security so that both the NSA and the hacker could easily get at the nude photos? Aha, now we're getting somewhere.
This is a story playing out on moral, technical, and legal levels at the same time.
At present, the archive with images from The Fappening is the most-shared and most-seeded torrent on The Pirate Bay across all categories, sporting a record 36,738 seeders. This demonstrates quite clearly that whatever goes on the net, stays on the net.
What happened was that a new interface from Apple, one called “Find My iPhone”, allowed for an unlimited number of failed password attempts with no time limit between them. This allowed people to literally try millions and millions of passwords of their intended targets, all on automatic, until they stumbled on the one password that happened to be correct. Once they had that, they were able to download the entire contents of their targets' iPhones to their own computers.
It's safe to assume there was more than photos that were leaked. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg.
Apple, meanwhile, reacts to this by saying that people who had their photos leaked should have stronger passwords, and two-factor authentication. While technically true – you should always use two-factor authentication as it helps to thwart these kinds of attacks – it's nowhere near enough good from Apple in this case. You don't blame the victims of your own sloppy security, even if your victims could have done a better job, too.
The NSA are actually even more to blame here. They have confused “keeping us safe” with “needing to hack into any system”, and therefore, all of a sudden, they have forgotten their initial mission, being blinded with the ability to penetrate systems and networks. But NSA safeguarding their ability to penetrate means that systems stay vulnerable, and that we are considerably less safe as a result. The Fappening is an excellent example: if the NSA had done their job, they would discover the vulnerability and informed Apple in no uncertain terms that this was not secure. But that's not what they do; they do the exact opposite. They discover the vulnerability and let it stay hidden.
And then, Apple blames its victims. The only thing they can be blamed for is having a bad sense of information hygiene, for trusting Apple with their unencrypted data, and for having sensitive data unencrypted in a cloud service at all.
Victim-blaming, even partially, is not something you should ever do lightly. At the same time, lack of basic security practices does have real-world implications. If you're reckless with the PIN number to your ATM card, the fault is placed squarely on your shoulders and yours alone if somebody uses your ATM card with your PIN – even if the theft is solidly illegal, and a police report can be filed, it's still considered your fault that it happened. We need to come to a similar understanding with sloppy protection of private data, while at the same time holding corporations liable who don't take responsibility for private data entrusted to them.
Overall, the fault here lies primarily with Apple and not its (yes, Apple's) victims. No company should have as sloppy security as to allow millions of password attempts in a short timespan without raising any kind of red flag. Apple should definitely have formal liability here. At the same time, it denies all such liability, and not only that, it tries to divert attention to its newest phone which also wants to be a wallet. A bit of trust issue, there.
now that Apple is saying they're not liable for protecting you against well known attacks…here, have a new phone that wants to be a wallet — davi (((德海))) (@daviottenheimer) September 3, 2014
Your stance, meanwhile, need to be that you must protect yourself from not only sloppy companies, but also from legal leaks of your private data. Consider that point carefully: you need to protect your private data from legal seizure by law enforcement, which will effectively make it public. If you do this, you are going to protect yourself from illegal leaks as a pure bonus. In other words, encrypt everything.
Some people are expressing that The Fappening wouldn't be a problem if we didn't consider women's bodies and casual nude photos to be something to hide in the first place. That does have some truth to it; things that everybody does eventually lose their taboo:
“Yes, but I didn't inhale.” — Bill Clinton, 1992
“Of course I inhaled. That was the point!” — Barack Obama, 2006
However, this observation dodges the real issue – that there will always be private data that, when leaking, can be used against the individual concerned. It's possible that nudes won't be sensitive in the future, but it doesn't matter. There has always been, and will always be, private data that can be used in political or financial extortionate situations if it leaks. Consider that the attack vector used here was against a positioning service. Whoever got phone data also got a complete log of the victims' movements. I'd say that's a whole lot more sensitive than casual nude photos.
Information hygiene – awareness of how you store and transmit your data – is not something that can be ignored anymore. It's mandatory. In some areas, it's literally a survival skill. At the same time, media keeps ignoring these fundamentals of security: at the end of the day, it's remarkably disheartening that a catastrophic privacy leak only gets the media attention it deserves if somebody is masturbating to it.
Unencrypted data which is stored on or sent through somebody else's computer is not your data anymore. It's as simple as that.
Privacy remains your own responsibility.
Scientists claim those in age group who drink average of more than four cups of coffee a day are at 56% greater risk of death from all causes
Drinking more than four cups of coffee a day can raise the risk of dying from a host of diseases, scientists claim.
Researchers in the US found that death rates from all causes rose by more than half in people aged under 55 who drank more than 28 cups a week.
The apparently harmful effects of heavy coffee consumption were not seen in older people, according to a study published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
The team led by Steven Blair at the University of South Carolina warned that younger people in particular might want to avoid drinking large amounts of coffee.
Previous studies have found conflicting evidence for the impact of coffee on health, with some suggesting it can raise blood pressure, and alter adrenaline and insulin activity in the body, while others point to beneficial effects on the immune system and cognitive performance.
For the latest study, researchers analysed medical and personal history questionnaires filled out by more than 40,000 people aged 20 to 87 between 1979 and 1998. After a typical follow-up period of 17 years, more than 2,500 participants had died.
The study found that those who drank larger amounts of coffee were more likely to smoke and had less healthy lungs and hearts.
Younger men had a greater risk of death even at lower levels of coffee consumption, but the effect only became significant at around 28 cups per week, where the under 55s had a 56% increase in death from all causes.
The impact of coffee appeared to be more serious on women. Those aged under 55 years old had double the risk of dying from all causes than those who did not drink coffee.
Which constituents of coffee may be to blame for the effects are not fully understood. "The exact mechanism between coffee and mortality still needs clarification. Coffee is high in caffeine, which has the potential to stimulate the release of epinephrine, inhibit insulin activity, and increase blood pressure," said Xuemei Sui, a co-author on the study.
The reason the under 55s are most at risk is also uncertain, but related vices, such as heavy drinking, may play a part. "Heavy coffee consumption behaviour might cluster with other unhealthy behaviours such as sleeping late, and eating a poor diet", adds Sui.
Hajra Siraj, a GP in Chelsea and Westminster, said: "Drinking coffee forms a large part of modern living in our society, so it's easy to lose track of how much we're actually consuming, and this study suggests this could have a greater impact on our health than we may realise."
Perhaps the biggest mystery leftover from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with the exception of Luke Skywalker's recent past, is the question regarding the identity of Rey's parents. Fans have debated and theorized as to whether she's the daughter of Luke Skywalker, the estranged daughter of Han Solo and Leia Organa, a descendant of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine or some random girl who just so happens to be Force sensitive. Thankfully, it sounds like that mystery will be addressed in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
Here's an interview clip where director Rian Johnson was asked whether we find out who are Rey's parents:
For those who can't watch the video, director Rian Johnson is at first leery about saying anything about Rey's parents, but then responds cautiously and cryptically, “It's something that's going to be addressed in the movie.” When the interviewer follows up by asking if there would be clarification as to whose Rey's parents are, Johnson starts to answer, “It depends on – I can't say. I was about to say something. You almost got me!”
Johnson fell back to repeating, “It will absolutely be addressed in the movie. It's tough, because this is the other element of the secrecy of it all. There are lots of surprises in this movie. There [are] lots of twists and turns, and I really want people to experience those when they see the movie for the first time. How we address that and how you feel about it and what happens with that is one of them.”
There's no real way to discern what that means yet, but it's almost as if Rey's parentage doesn't have an easy explanation as most fans have though. Perhaps when Rian says her parentage will be addressed, he means that we'll learn about who they are without necessarily finding out specifically who they are.
One interesting tidbit that supports that train of thought came from an interview with Daisy Ridley at Star Wars Celebreation this weekend, which further indicates that we might not learn exactly who Rey's parents are in this movie, though they will be addressed in some form. Speaking with MTV, Ridley was asked about her reaction when she found out who Rey's parents were. She thinks for a moment and then responds:
“The one thing I have seen, because I did some ADR last week and saw a clip of something that I didn't know was going to happen in it. I was like ‘Oh, wow. Okay.' I think quite a few questions that people have are answered in this.”
That tells us literally nothing about who Rey's parents are, but it does tell us that Daisy Ridley may not yet be privy to the identity of her character's parents. If she did ADR (automatic dialogue replacement, or looping) for a clip that she hadn't seen, then it sounds like there's a scene that she didn't appear in but has some kind of voiceover part in it. That means this could be some kind of revealing Force vision or a flashback of some sort where the audience learns something about Rey's past as she talks about it, but maybe she didn't fully understand as a child.
One theory that seems to have gone out the window at this point is Rey being Luke's daughter. In another interview with Fandango, Daisy Ridley confirmed that Luke has no idea who Rey is. That doesn't guarantee that she's not Luke's daughter, but that seems rather unlikely, especially since Mark Hamill even made a remark “accidentally” referring to Daisy Ridley as his daughter during The Last Jedi panel before changing his tune. It was an intentionally made joke, and if that were true, he likely wouldn't make a joke about it, despite it being a funny way of fueling the fan theories and keeping the mystery intact.
As of now, I'm thinking that maybe we learn that Rey was orphaned at a young age, but we don't know where she came from before that. Maybe Rey doesn't even know who her real family is and that's a mystery she'll have to uncover herself with the rest of us. At this point, anything is possible, and we'll just have to suffer for another seven months before we get the answer.

If they were like pro athletes in mainstream sports earning a huge wage that would keep them comfortable for a long time, then it might at least be an interesting philosophical argument, but trying to shame players like these as running away from the most difficult competition just because they want to maximize what they can earn (or potentially earn) from their very short windows as SC2 pros is just too unsympathetic I want to see the best compete with the best, of course, but at the end of the day, most SC2 pros are barely adults who haven't done their military service, haven't gone to college, and don't really stand to gain any tangible long-term benefits from the years they have dedicated to entertaining us. There is a lot more money to be made in the foreign tournament scene than in the impossibly difficult domestic scene, so transferring to a non-KeSPA/foreign/"lower-tier" team that is willing to give them more opportunities to play for that tournament cash is just pragmatic.If they were like pro athletes in mainstream sports earning a huge wage that would keep them comfortable for a long time, then it might at least be an interesting philosophical argument, but trying to shame players like these as running away from the most difficult competition just because they want to maximize what they can earn (or potentially earn) from their very short windows as SC2 pros is just too unsympathetic

Im not blaming them. But blaming league institution. Grand final is for better player right?? But because of runner, foreigner's opportunity is getting smaller and GF is not for better player. Is this really right thing??. I really dont care about how much they earn. But GF should be composed with many gsl players. Im not blaming them. But blaming league institution.

Foreign teams' demand for korean players has gone down quite a bit over the past ~6 months, unless you are very popular or very very very good there is almost no chance to get picked up by one of them. In my opinion True is neither very popular nor at the very top. He is pretty good right now, which makes him an expensive player, but still has to prove himself.

Correct. Not many tournaments offer flights and those that do are doing so in heavily stacked qualifier formats in which only the winner of the qualifier gets flights covered. Flight expenses are a massive part of team budgets, particularly since they are so unpredictable. Correct.

The intrigue launched by coquettish correspondence between Bob Dechert and a Chinese reporter was more of a comedy than a thriller for Canada's spy service.
Emails sent after the Conservative MP's amorous notes to a reporter for China's state news agency were made public suggest some within the Canadian Security Intelligence Service got a chuckle out of the whole affair.
One email chain carries the subject line "By far, my favourite news story this year."
A recipient of the email wrote back: "Scandal.. haha."
Toronto-area MP Bob Dechert is pictured with Shi Rong, right, in an undated photo. Dechert, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs, acknowledges he sent flirtatious emails to Shi, a Toronto-based journalist with China's state-run news agency.
The emails circulated around CSIS in the days after news broke of Dechert's flirtatious exchange with Xinhua news agency correspondent Shi Rong.
The Canadian Press obtained the documents under the Access to Information Act.
CSIS blanked out nearly all the emails. But the bits that escaped the censor's pen may offer a glimpse at how seriously the spy service took the episode.
A CSIS spokeswoman did not seem to know much about Dechert, who is parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird.
"I have an urgent request to find an article ... on Mississauga-Erindale Conservative MP Bob Dechert which alleges that this individual has been hacked," she wrote in one of the emails.
"Apparently the individual is now a parliamentary secretary to DFAIT."
The rest of the uncensored emails contain news stories about Dechert and Shi.
While some emails appear to be light-hearted, other documents show CSIS director Richard Fadden sat in on at least one high-level meeting about the incident. But notes from the Sept. 12 meeting are completely censored.
The Conservative government has played down Dechert's dalliance with Shi, insisting no state secrets were spilled.
Neither CSIS nor Dechert responded to requests for comment.
Innocent friendship
Dechert has insisted his relationship with Shi was an innocent friendship.
"The person is a journalist whom I have come to know as a friend. I met her while doing Chinese-language media communications," Dechert said in a statement posted on his website last year.
"These emails are flirtatious, but the friendship remained innocent and simply that — a friendship."
Their correspondence, distributed anonymously to almost 250 recipients in September, dates back to 2010.
"You are so beautiful. I really like the picture of you by the water with your cheeks puffed. That look is so cute. I love it when you do that. Now, I miss you even more," wrote Dechert in an email sent on April 17, 2010.
Another email sent two days later urged Shi to watch a vote in the House of Commons.
"I will smile at you. I miss you. Love, Bob."
Shi has since been reassigned to China.
The Chinese Communist Party created Xinhua in the 1930s to handle revolutionary propaganda. Run by the Chinese government in Beijing, it has grown into a multimedia empire with offices across the world and throughout China.
Xinhua is also widely suspected by Western intelligence agencies of having links to China's spy services.
What happens if Google develops a conscience and acts on it? Jens Meyer, File/AP Photo
Google's celebrated maxim is, “Don't be evil.” But what would happen if the data collection giant (or other companies like it) decided to be just a little bit evil? Or decided that – in the name of research and its users' best interests, of course! – its definition of “evil” (such an ugly word) might be a bit different than everyone else's?
Those questions recurred to me this week when word spread (mainly through social networks, of course) that Facebook, another giant data-monger, had run an experiment to see if it could manipulate its users emotions.
In case you have been under a rock and otherwise without Wi-Fi, it turns out that Facebook, working with social scientists from Cornell University and the University of California, San Francisco, decided in 2012 to manipulate the site's news feed – skewing it to show more happy content or more sad content – for nearly 700,000 users. They were trying to test the so-called “emotional contagion” effect – whether seeing your friends post happy or sad things on a social network can nudge your mood in that direction. The answer, it turns out, is yes, if just barely. The study's authors found a one-tenth of 1 percent change, which doesn't sound like much until you consider the scale of Facebook's 1.23 billion monthly-user reach: “For example, the well-documented connection between emotions and physical well-being suggests the importance of these findings for public health,” the study's authors wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, adding that in early 2013, that one-tenth of 1 percent would have meant hundreds of thousands of users.
“The goal of all of our research at Facebook is to learn how to provide a better service,” one of the study's authors, Adam D. I. Kramer, posted on the site earlier this week. “Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone.” No doubt. But consider this: Per The Atlantic's Robinson Meyer, the study also found that tweaking the site's algorithm to omit emotional content led users to write less – the more bland your feed, the less engaged you are. While this is not surprising, it does suggest that Facebook has a vested interest in making sure its users see emotionally provocative content. What happens if the social networking service decides the way to keep users engaged is by downplaying emotionally neutral content? “So is it okay for Facebook to play mind games with us for science?” Forbes' Kashmir Hill asked in light of the experiments. What about for profit?
Part of the reason the denizens of Facebook were taken by surprise that people were outraged the company had attempted to manipulate its users' emotions may be because it conducts data experiments all the time. “Facebook's Data Science team occasionally uses the information to highlight current events,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Recently, it employed it to determine how many people were visiting Brazil for the World Cup.” The key difference, however, is between observation and interference, between analyzing data and seeing if you can move the numbers. The number of people visiting Brazil is the wrong analogue – an apples to apples comparison would be if Facebook tweaked its algorithm to see if it could encourage or discourage World Cup tourism, or whether it could manipulate betting on the tournament.
Here's another arguably more troubling Facebook experiment about which you might not have heard: In 2010 the company set out to see if it could increase voter turnout in that November's midterm elections. As Harvard's Jonathan Zittrain wrote recently in The New Republic, tens of millions of Facebook users were shown “a graphic containing a link for looking up polling places, a button to click to announce that you had voted, and the profile photos of up to six Facebook friends who had indicated they'd already done the same.” Peer pressure has been demonstrated as an effective tool for increasing voter turnout, and that was the case here: The researchers figured that directly or indirectly they had moved 400,000 additional voters to the polls. Increasing voter turnout is, of course, a laudable goal, but what if Facebook decided to put its finger on the scale? Suppose someone at the company quietly decided that the country would be better off if more Democrats voted or more Republicans and acted accordingly?
Or take another experiment: Could a search giant like Google tip an election by tweaking how someone ranked in search results and what sort of results is displayed? Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology decided to find out, running an experiment in this year's Indian elections. “That's right, we deliberately manipulated the voting preferences of more than 2,000 real voters in the largest democratic election in the history of the world, easily pushing the preferences of undecided voters by more than 12 percent in any direction we chose,” he wrote in U.S. News last month, adding that, while he's not suggesting that Google manipulates elections, if he ran the company, “I would have a crack team of my Mountain View prodigies studying and manipulating elections worldwide 24/7. Not doing so would be counter to the quest for profit.”
Don't be evil is a sound maxim for a corporation to live by – but who gets to decide what is evil? What happens if, Hobby Lobby-like, a Google or a Facebook or other company develops a conscience and religious beliefs, and acts on them for their users' own good? Would that be evil, strictly speaking? What if the users held different beliefs?
O brave new world, that has such corporations in't!
Gainesville Police are reviewing an incident in which an officer Wednesday released a police dog on a 10-year-old boy, who was bitten, while responding to a burglary call that turned out to be false.
Gainesville police are reviewing an incident in which an officer responding to a burglary call Wednesday released a police dog on a 10-year-old boy, who was bitten.
Capt. Ed Book said it is routine that K-9 bites be reviewed. He said police later learned the woman who had reported the burglary allegedly has mental health issues.
Bitten was Bryce Bates of the 3300 block of Northwest 21st Drive. Bates said his mother had asked him to get the mail and that he had ridden his bicycle a short distance from his condominium when he saw a police car speeding toward him.
The 10-year-old, who is 5 feet tall and weighs 85 pounds, said he became scared, jumped off his bike and began running for home.
"I saw the police car, and he was speeding real fast. I thought he was going to hit me, so I jumped off my bike and ran," Bryce said. "I heard the dog barking and looked behind and saw it running after me."
The dog caught Bryce just as he reached his front door, biting the back of his left thigh. Bryce had one puncture wound that tore the flesh and several smaller bite wounds and scratches.
Brice's parents, Ferris Bates and Cheron Hampton-Bates, said they insisted that their son be taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was treated and released.
The incident began about 3:20 p.m. with a burglary-in-progress call in the 3400 block of Northwest 21st Drive. Cpl. Tim Durst, with his dog Grady, responded and saw a youth on a bicycle in the area.
Police say Durst yelled for the boy to stop. The officer then released Grady, which bit the boy on the leg and caused minor injuries, Book said.
Book said details, including whether Bryce matched any descriptions that might have been given by the woman, will be part of the review.
"We believe that there were some warnings given. He didn't stop," Book said of the incident involving the boy. "We think he probably got off his bicycle and ran, but we don't know if he was running from police or running because he was scared. There is a difference.
"Unfortunately ... it was only well after we had this K-9 incident that we learned that the woman has a mental health condition that causes her to see things or imagine things," Book said.
GPD's manual regarding the use of dogs for apprehension states a K-9 can be released: to prevent the escape of a person whom the officer believes has committed a felony offense; if the subject has outstanding warrants; or if the person is believed to be armed and a serious threat to officers.
The officer must warn the subject to stop, according to the manual, and state that the dog will be released if the subject does not stop.
Bryce will be a fifth-grader at Glen Springs Elementary School. His mother said she saw Bryce running to the door with the dog behind him and initially thought it was a neighborhood dog chasing him.
"It attacked him right in the doorway. I saw the dog just bear down on him and moving and tugging and constantly biting and biting," Hampton-Bates said. "(Bryce) didn't know the officer was telling him to stop. He was screaming my name the whole way here."
Hampton-Bates said the incident "made me question whether (Bryce) is the victim of profiling" because he is a black youth. She added that she spoke with Police Chief Tony Jones and that he assured her the incident will be fully reviewed.
Gainesville lawyer Robert Rush, who has won settlements against GPD in other dog bite cases, questioned whether police had any probable cause against the boy to release the dog.
"If he gets off the bicycle and runs, what probable cause do they have to believe that this child is an imminent threat and danger?" Rush said. "That's a misuse of the dog. It's a complete misuse of the dog."
Boomerang OTT Service, Twitter Adds Lacrosse, Netflix Funds Orson Welles' Final Movie – Cordcutting News From Around the Web
The cordcutting field continues to grow more popular and diverse, and there continue to be news. This is a summary of the big cordcutting news that has happened this week.
Boomerang Launches $5 / month streaming service
You may know Boomerang as a TV channel where you can watch classic cartoons like Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. The parent company, Time Warner, will be making their collection available as an over-the-top service, starting at $5 per month or $40 per year. The app will be available on major platforms, hopefully at some point in the spring, and include some new series such as a “comedic fantasy” that will be set in the world of The Wizard of Oz.
Twitter Adds Lacrosse Streaming
Twitter has been partnering to get live sports on their platform, and through their TV app, and now they've landed another partner: The National Lacrosse League. Though not as big as the NFL, it still attracts a number of viewers.
Hulu Adds A&E
Hulu will be launching a live streaming service in the next few months with many TV networks on board. Their service will become more useful with the announcement of an agreement with A&E. This will add more channels to the service: A&E, Viceland, History, Lifetime, FYI, and LMN. It will quickly end up competing with YouTube and their own upcoming TV service. Their new site shows off their DVR offering and how users will get notifications about what to watch.
VICE Produces Original Shows for Snapchat
Media company VICE has made a deal with Snapchat to start producing original shows. Snapchat is currently a mobile-only app, has been making these deals with other partners like the BBC. These mobile-optimized shows, vertical video and short, don't necessarily translate well to larger screens or long shows. A Snapchat TV app may be out of the question, but will this content draw more people to the app as it faces increasing competition from Facebook (and Instagram)?
Netflix Funds Orson Welles's Movie, The Other Side of the Wind
Director of the movie Citizen Kane, Orson Welles, had been working on another movie until he passed away in 1985, leaving the work unfinished. The Other Side of the Wind had been left in this state until a few years ago when Royal Road Entertainment bought the rights and launched a crowdfunding campaign to produce it. They did not reach their goal at the time, even with flexible funding, and were unable to fully produce it. Now Netflix is stepping in to give the group the funds they need to complete it. Today, small production groups can quickly get funds to produce their craft from more parties than may have existed in the past.

Even after the recent signing of veteran lefty J.P. Howell, the Toronto Blue Jays apparently remain active on the free agent front. With obvious holes to plug and, according to Shi Davidi, about 10 million remaining in their budget, the Toronto Blue Jays are still attached to Jerry Blevins and Boone Logan in some capacity. However, the question remains, given the Blue Jays track record of quickly advancing young arms and giving bullpen opportunities to players who have been cast aside, who will make the ascension this year? Who are the possible Spring Training surprise stories this year?
Blue Jays Bullpen Still a Work in Progress
The clear number one on this list, Reid-Foley brings all of the skills to the table necessary to make the jump from minor league prospect to Major League contributor. He features a mid-to-upper 90's fastball, a decent mix of developing off speed, improving control, and a knack for missing bats. At times, he looks like he can do whatever he wants on the mound. Based off of his recent success and self-belief, Reid-Foley remains the Blue Jays the best internal option to turn heads during a Spring Training tryout.
He got an opportunity last year, among the Aaron Loup chaos, to show off his skill set after a successful campaign in the minors. Girodo is a standard lefty who has the chance to succeed at the Major League level, with three pitches that all sit as league average. Furthermore, Girodo has the ability to get outs with deception alone. With Howell and Loup in the mix and they Jays still attached to Blevins and Logan through free agency, Girodo would have to have a perfect Spring Training campaign to have a chance. He has the ability to put himself in the conversation he if executes at a high level.
Being protected from the Rule 5 draft is always a good sign. After being selected in the 15th round, Borucki has never been able to find health. He has a good arm with low 90's velocity, but an elite change-up. Think a lefty Danny Barnes (who should also be a mainstay in the Blue Jays bullpen this year). Borucki may not have the ability to throw balls through bats, but he can consistently miss them. Look for Borucki to move quickly this year. There is a chance he breaks camp with the Jays.
In every system, there are guys who just never seem to get a chance. Browning is that guy for Toronto. After five years in the system, the sidearming Browning has never posted an ERA above 2.34. He has a career minor league ERA of 1.98, while striking out well over a batter per inning and walking 2.75 batters per nine innings. Browning has been nothing short of exceptional during his career in the minors. Sometimes, being viewed as a novelty can negatively alter how evaluators view a pitcher's success. Browning isn't a trick and his success is legitimate. Look for him to make it very difficult for Toronto to ignore his skill-set this spring.
Long Shot: Angel Perdomo
If they Blue Jays truly want to shake things up, Perdomo could be the move. The 6'6″ lefty strikeout machine has all the talent to dominate if given the chance. The only sticking point remains whether his future lies in the bullpen or rotation. If the bullpen is the choice, he can make that jump very soon. With his mix of a 90-94 mph fastball, a big breaking ball, and a lot of deception, look for Perdomo to move quickly on that path. If he is a starter, however, look for Perdomo to spend the year between Dunedin and New Hampshire. Either way, Perdomo will make a large impression on the franchise very soon.
Finally, in a world that lives and dies with velocity, the Toronto Blue Jays may be going the other way. With a mix of change-up artists, sidearmers, and borderline senior citizens, the Blue Jays are looking to build a bullpen straight out of the 1980's. To what level of success, no one knows. Nevertheless, it should be interesting. The 2017 Toronto Blue Jays have some interesting decisions to make.

Ottoman composer's ‘tekbir' to replace Chopin's piece at funerals of fallen Turkish soldiers
ANKARA
The Turkish Interior Ministry has ordered governors to play Ottoman-era composer Itri's piece with lyrics from Quran verses instead of Frédéric François Chopin's “Marche Funèbre” during the funeral processions of fallen soldiers.“The honoring procession during martyrs' funerals will be done with Itri's ‘Segah Tekbir,' which is in accordance with the morals of the martyr and its place in the hearts of our nation. The same procedures and principles will be applied for the members of the Interior Ministry when they pass away,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Sept. 12.No trumpet will be played during the funerals of soldiers and silence would be observed without any music instruments, the ministry added.“Our responsibility for the bravery of our martyrs, their families and our nation is eternal. The suitability of the ceremonies according to our national and moral values and the roots of our civilization is the main issue of this responsibility and its importance,” it said.The discussions had started after a soldier's funeral where the friends of the soldier silenced the band playing the funeral march with loud shouts of “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) in the southeastern province of Hakkari's Yüksekova district on April 3, 2016.After the incident, Turkey's War Veterans Foundation head Lokman Aylar announced that they started a campaign to use Itri's “Tekbir” in the funerals instead.“A foreigner's death march doesn't suit our martyrs,” Aylar said on April 12.Turkey's Directorate General of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) head Mehmet Görmez offered replacing the funeral march with the 17th century Ottoman composer's “Tekbir” on April 15, 2016.The world-renowned Turkish pianist Fazıl Say's father and composer-music critic Ahmet Say and Presidential Symphony Orchestra General Music Director and Maestro Rengim Gökmen said in April that Chopin's funeral march is recognized universally and changing it would break away from the international tradition.Itri's “Segah Tekbir” was for the first time performed on Aug. 29 during the funeral procession of Martyr Gendarmerie Specialist Corporal Muhammed Meriç by the band of the General Gendarmerie Command.

With the Affordable Care Act facing an uncertain future, could California set up its own universal health care system as an alternative?
State senators Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, recently introduced a bill to do just that — the most recent of several failed attempts to set up a single-payer system in California, in which the state covers the costs of health care for anyone who wants it.
At stake for California is $23.4 billion in federal funding.
At least some policymakers and advocates are open to discussing the idea but they think the first priority should be to save what they believe are the most important parts of the Affordable Care Act.
“As week by week goes by and as popular protests mount, it's becoming clear the life and death consequences of these decisions,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of the consumer advocacy coalition Health Access California. He believes there's a better chance now than a couple of months ago that parts of the Affordable Care Act may be saved.
Proponents of a single-payer system say it would reduce administrative costs, passing savings on to consumers and that it would encourage preventative care. Opponents say taxes would go up for everyone regardless of how much they use health care and that there would be less choice and less efficiency in a government-run system.
Meanwhile, the ACA is proving harder to dismantle than Republicans had hoped. While President Trump and Republican congress members made repealing the act a major priority, no consensus has yet been reached on what the replacement should be.
According to a Feb. 17 report by the Legislative Analyst's Office, the Affordable Care Act reduced the number of uninsured California residents from 6 million to 3 million. As of fall 2016, 4.6 million residents (12 percent) statewide obtained health coverage funded by the ACA through either Medi-Cal or through a subsidized plan from Covered California, the health benefits exchange that lets individuals and small businesses with 50 or fewer employees shop for insurance.
“We can't afford to lose the federal funding or we're going to have huge, huge issues,” he said.
The huge Medi-Cal program, financed by a mix of state and federal money, has served the poor in California for decades, including those receiving welfare assistance.
It also has been going through an expansion to serve the young. Overall, it provides services to about 13.4 million people*, or roughly one in every three Californians, according to the Department of Health Services most recent numbers.
At stake for California is $23.4 billion in federal funding. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, California could lose $18 billion in federal funding for the expanded Medi-Cal program and $5.4 billion in premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions for Covered California, endangering the exchange's survival, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office report.
Though the threat that the ACA could end health coverage for 32 million Americans is real, “it is no way a done deal,” Wright said.
Wright supports universal health care as an ultimate goal but his group's first focus is the federal fight which is happening right now. Any state proposal like the single-payer plan will take months to formulate and implement.
“California is not an island,” he said. “We are very much dependent on these federal funding streams for large parts of our healthcare system,” he said. “A single-payer system would have to reclaim those funds and would need a federal partner to do that.”
Assembly member Jim Wood, D-Eureka, who is one of the leaders heading up the Assembly's efforts to study a single-payer system, said he is “laser-focused” now on trying to save what he believes are the most important components of ACA.
“We can't afford to lose the federal funding or we're going to have huge, huge issues,” he said.
Woods said the state doesn't have the money to backfill $23.4 billion. “That's not a one-time figure, that would be an ongoing challenge for us.”
“Single payer becomes a diversion when the real focus should be on protecting the gains of the Affordable Care Act.” — David Panush
In principle, he does support universal health coverage. “Health care should be a right, not a privilege,” he said. “A system that covers everyone is a healthier system for all of us.”
But Wood said he can't give much of an opinion about the new Senate proposal since there isn't much detail. “Historically, there's a pretty high price tag on this,” he said. “If we're going to go it alone, I hope we have a strong financing mechanism to do that. Maybe California becomes a leader on this issue.”
David Panush, president of the consulting firm California Health Policy Strategies, said the senate single-payer proposal would have to overcome some hefty barriers to get the needed two-thirds vote of the Legislature for approval of the needed tax increases. He said it will be difficult to unify the legislators and the governor on a financing plan.
“Single payer becomes a diversion when the real focus should be on protecting the gains of the Affordable Care Act,” he said.
L.A. County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, a former state senator who authored a single-payer system that was approved by the Legislature, then vetoed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger a decade ago, said single-payer may have a better shot at acceptance now.
“The time might be better for single-payer because everybody is worried what it might mean if Washington discontinues subsidies for people who get insurance through ACA,” she said.
In her opinion, it would be better for California to move decisively to universal health care coverage than to leave a sizable group of people without any insurance at all in the event of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
Sen. Atkins, who co-sponsored the single-payer bill, seems to agree.
“In light of threats to the Affordable Care Act, it's important that we look at all options to maintain and expand access to health care,” she said in a written statement.

"Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer is no. That's not America. Is there something wrong with a seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing he or she could be president? Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion that he is a Muslim and might have an association with terrorists. This is not the way we should be doing it in America.
I feel particularly strong about this because of a picture I saw in a magazine. It was a photo essay about troops who were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. And one picture at the tail end of this photo essay, was of a mother at Arlington Cemetery and she had her head on the headstone of her son's grave. And as the picture focused in, you could see the writing on the headstone, and it gave his awards - Purple Heart, Bronze Star - showed that he died in Iraq, gave his date of birth, date of death, he was 20 years old. And then at the very top of the headstone, it didn't have a Christian cross. It didn't have a Star of David. It has a crescent and star of the Islamic faith.
And his name was Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan. And he was an American. He was born in New Jersey. He was fourteen years old at the time of 9/11, and he waited until he could serve his country and he gave his life."
Defective Sweet Taste Receptor Shapes Cat Cuisine
Genetic studies make purrfect sense: No sweet treats for kitty
Philadelphia, PA (July 25, 2005) — Scientists from the Monell Chemical Senses Center, in collaboration with scientists from the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, UK, report that a defect in a gene that codes for part of the mammalian sweet taste receptor can account for cats' indifference to sugar and other sweets.
Cat owners have long recognized that, unlike most mammals, domestic cats are uniformly uninterested in sweet-tasting foods. According to an early study conducted at Monell in the 1970s, the same indifference to sweets is also evident in wild cats such as lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars.
“One possible explanation for this behavior is that felines are unable to detect sweet-tasting compounds like sugars and high intensity sweeteners because their sweet taste receptor is defective,” comments Xia Li, PhD, a molecular geneticist at Monell and lead author of the current study. “An obvious place to look, therefore, is at the genes coding for the sweet-taste receptor.”
The mammalian sweet receptor is composed of two protein subunits, known as T1R2 and T1R3. Each is coded for by a separate gene. In the new study, reported in the July 2005 inaugural issue of PLoS (Public Library of Science) Genetics, the researchers show a defect in the gene encoding the T1R2 protein in domestic cats.
The Monell researchers also detected the same gene defect in tiger and cheetah, suggesting that it is common to species throughout the cat family. “This type of gene is known as a pseudogene and is somewhat like a molecular fossil,” says Li. “It presumably once coded a functional protein, but no longer does so.”
Li explains, “Genes contain signals that indicate the start and stop points for information about the amino acid sequence of a given protein. We found a deletion of 247 base pairs in the gene that codes for T1R2 in the cat. As a consequence of this deletion, the stop point is shifted. The T1R2 protein is not made and thus is unavailable to join with T1R3 to form a working sweet taste receptor.”
“Our results account for the common observation that the cat lives in a different sensory world than the cat owner,” comments Véronique Legrand-Defretin, Ph.D, Director for the Global Feeding Behavior Research program at the Waltham Centre. “Waltham finds it critical to understand these unique characteristics of the cat in order to make foods that they not only enjoy but that also meet their unique nutritional needs.”
Parallel studies showed that the defect is specific to the gene coding for the T1R2 protein, as the gene coding for the cat T1R3 protein is similar to those found in other mammals and appears to express a complete and functional protein.
The findings demonstrate the major role that genetic influences on taste play in food selection and consequently on nutrition.
“The non-functional sweet receptor provides a molecular explanation for why cats have no avidity for sweets,” says senior author Joseph G. Brand, PhD, a Monell biophysicist. “Looking beyond this elegant explanation, one can contemplate the importance that this molecular change had on the evolution of the cat's carnivorous behavior.”
“What we still don't know is – which came first: carnivorous behavior or the loss of the T1R2 protein? With regard to the gene, is this a case of use it or lose it?”
Brand continues, “From a nutritional viewpoint, since in the wild the cat eats very little carbohydrate, it is constantly consuming a high-protein diet. Perhaps the cat can teach us something of the physiological and metabolic consequences of diets restricted primarily to protein.”

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is essential in the maintenance of brain homeostasis both by preserving normal brain functioning and also by protecting the brain from exposure to a range of potentially harmful substances. This review presents some of the evidence of BBB disruption following exposure to the substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy') and methamphetamine (METH), two drugs of abuse which are widely consumed recreationally by younger sectors of the population.
Both MDMA and METH have been shown to produce disruption of the BBB as reflected by IgG extravasation and Evans Blue leakage. In particular, METH decreases the expression of basal lamina proteins associated with an increase in matrix metalloproteinase activity. These changes in BBB integrity appear to be related to MDMA-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK1/2.
The consequences of the disruption in the BBB by these two drugs remain to be established, but there is evidence in the literature that, at least in the case of METH, increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity may be related to increased behavioural sensitization and reward perhaps because of the modification of the passage of the drug into the CNS. In addition, the high incidence of AIDS-related neurologic disease in METH users may also be related to increased entry into the brain of virally derived neurotoxic products.
This article is part of the Special Issue entitled ‘CNS Stimulants'.
Former President Bill Clinton on Monday blasted Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney over a misleading advertisement his campaign recently released.
“Now it turns out that Jeep is reopening in China because they made so much money here they can afford to do it and they are going on with their plans here,” he said at a campaign event in Youngstown, Ohio. “They put out a statement today saying that it was the biggest load of bull in the world that they would consider shutting down their American operation.”
“They are roaring in America thanks to people like the people of Ohio. So in keeping with that, here is what I want to say I think this election is about. I support Barack Obama because I think he has got a better jobs plan, and a better jobs record, a better budget plan, a better education plan, a better health care plan than his opponent Governor Romney.”
Citing a Bloomberg News report, the ad suggests that Chrysler is moving Jeep production from North America to China and blames Obama for taking the carmaker into bankruptcy. The President forced Chrysler into federal bankruptcy protection in 2009 and the company is now operated by Italian carmaker Fiat.
However, Chrysler is not actually shifting Jeep production from North America to China. Instead, it is looking to expand production in China — the world's largest auto market — while still maintaining production in the U.S. The company announced Monday that it nearly doubled its profit in the July through September period.

Anne Frank's father will be listed as co-author on her famous diary in a move to extend the copyright on the book, according to the foundation that owns the copyright.
The news, reported by the New York Times, comes just months before the copyright was set to expire in Europe. The co-author listing will extend the life of the copyright to 2050, 70 years after the death of Anne's father Otto.

The move by Anne Frank Fonds, the Swiss foundation that owns the copyright to the work, drew criticism over the historical question of who authored the book. Otto Frank had maintained that the book was mostly his daughter's words during his lifetime. The foundation's move contradicts that long-held position.
The announcement disrupted the plans of many book publishers to print new editions of the book once the copyright expired. The Diary of Anne Frank, which documents Frank's time in hiding to avoid Nazi persecution, has sold more than 30 million copies and has been translated into 70 languages.

DETROIT - A shocking video that was posted to Facebook shows a man firing a paintball gun at road workers with a young child in the back seat of his car.
The attack happened in the area of I-75 and Outer Drive on Detroit's west side. It was streamed on Facebook Live.
The 22-year-old man accused of shooting a paintball gun in the video wanted as many people as possible to see it, according to police. Police said the video shows him firing paintballs at road workers on Outer Drive in Detroit.
You can watch segments of the Facebook Live post in Shawn Ley's video posted above.
When he broadcast the event to Facebook Live, it caught the attention of Detroit police officers.
Anyone who looks closely at the video can see a baby girl riding in the back seat. Both men in the car bragged about the paintball shooting and the driver's marijuana. The driver was behind the wheel with the baby girl in the back seat.
In the video, the men said they were on Outer Drive. They had a warning for road crews.
"Out here on Outer, be careful if you're taking too long," one of the men said.
Local 4 showed the video to a crew in the heat resurfacing a road, and they were not amused.
"That's not -- not good at all," a road worker said. "It's very dangerous for us as well."
Detroit police said Crime Intelligence Bureau officials looked at the video, identified the paintball shooter, found out he had outstanding warrants for traffic incidents and arrested him.
The man is not facing charges for the paintball shooting because Detroit police said the road crew never called 911 or made a complaint, so there's no victim in the case.

Today, ESPN published something pretty remarkable; an in-depth look at what it is like for Latinos in the Major Leagues. They are calling this project the Béisbol Experience.
They interviewed over 50 players for the story, breaking down their comments into various categories, giving us a better look at whom these people are as people. Given the language barriers that often exist between these players and many of their fans, this is a look into areas those of us who don't speak Spanish often don't see and regularly don't understand.
A few of my favorite quotes from the series.
“I went almost two years without seeing my family. Sometimes I talked to [them] and they cried. You have to fight twice as hard — fight to succeed for you, for your family and fight mentally because you miss your family and you want them close. Sometimes it takes you out of the game.” — ADEINY HECHAVARRÍA “I went down to a gas station to buy a phone card for calling my family. I didn't know how to say ‘phone card.' The lady asked me, ‘How can I help you?' and I didn't know what to say. It was so hard. I went to the gas station alone because I didn't want anyone laughing at me. I waited until no one was left but myself and the cashier.” — JEURYS FAMILIA “I remember once we were in the elevator at the All-Star Game and a woman was talking to Vladimir Guerrero in English. She said, ‘Hey, you don't speak much English,' and Vlad said to her, ‘I speak English with my bat.'” — ALBERT PUJOLS “Respect [your opponents] so that they respect you. But passion should not be confused with a lack of respect.” — MIGUEL MONTERO

Last December, we continued our Highsnobiety Crowns — a dedicated end-of-year awards roundup of the best brands, products, stores, sneakers and more from the past 12 months. From each shortlist, our readers picked their favorites, and we compiled the votes into one definitive set of results. Now we sit down with the winners for a series of exclusive interviews.
Highsnobiety readers voted Kith the best store of 2016, ahead of the likes of Kanye West's “Pablo” pop-up shops, and online marketplace Grailed, which landed firmly in second and third respectively. Building on the shop's retail stronghold in New York, Kith owner Ronnie Fieg made big moves into new markets last year, like Miami and Aspen. Fieg even brought back the iconic Bapesta in two new made-in-Portugal versions. Given how much Fieg pushed his business forward in 2016, our expectations are quite high for what Ronnie and Kith have planned for this year.
Kith
Kith was voted the best store of 2016, why do you think there was such a big response from our readers?
While I don't know the exact reason, I can say that my team and I are extremely grateful for everyone's responses. Kith is still “Just Us” and we still represent the close-knit fraternity of consumers that support us, whether they've been around since day one or if they've just encountered us.
Kith made some big moves into Miami and Aspen this year, why are these important markets for Kith?
Miami is a major destination for travelers and a central hub for culture in the US, not to mention It's always been like a second home to me. Since doing our first pop-up there in 2013, I've felt that Miami was missing a shop like us, so I'm very excited to fill that void. As for Aspen, I believe that our presence there was necessary in order to deliver a fully immersive experience for our Aspen collection last year.
We will continue to find amazing places around the world to create these moments for our customers and help new demographics to engage with our brand on a face-to-face level. The Aspen shop really opened my eyes to the reach the brand has now. Showing up to a line for our first day was one of my favorite moments of 2016.
Kith
Kith also unveiled some surprising collaborations with Cap'N'Crunch, Coca-Cola, and others, how do these tie into the Kith customer?
Our theme for the fall/winter seasons last year was “nostalgia.” I drew inspiration from a lot of the things that I cherished growing up, and I wanted to share these moments through my lens. As a brand, we are storytellers, and we like to highlight moments in history that were important to us.
These narratives resonate with our customer, and people are either able to personally relate to them or find interest in them and delve into their significance. So while it may seem obscure for a brand to release collaborations with the likes of Cap'N'Crunch, Coke, Rugrats, Power Rangers, Iceberg, and more, all in the same year, we remain consistent in the audience we are speaking to.
The Kithland show was pretty large-scale in terms of collaborations, performances and more, will these events be held regularly by Kith at NYFW?
I can confirm that we will be returning to NYFW this fall. Last year was our first time and was certainly a learning experience, but now my team and I are more comfortable and ready to raise the bar another notch. I don't like to be predictable, so all I can say is to expect the unexpected this time around.
Kith
What will we see from Kith Women in 2017?
We have some big announcements in store for our Women's line, which will be made soon. In the meantime I can say that we are shaking things up this year and I'm very optimistic about the future.
What else can we expect from Kith in 2017?
2016 was our biggest year so far, and I have no doubt that we'll top it this year.
Stay posted for more conversations with the Highsnobiety Crowns winners.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Close by the luxury high-rises of Seoul's most expensive neighborhood, 80-year-old Kim Ok-nyo burns charcoal to heat her two-room shack in Guryong, a shantytown of 2,000 residents.
Demolition of Guryong, the last slum in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district made famous by Psy's Gangnam Style song and video, is expected to start this summer after redevelopment plans were mired for years in squabbling among the city, district and developers, and even battling residents.
Left behind by South Korea's economic miracle, Guryong is a grim symbol of growing income inequality in a country where nearly half the elderly live in poverty, the highest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)grouping.
Kim, a widow who shares her cramped wooden dwelling with one of her sons, is ready to leave the fire-prone slum, where the church she attended burned down about five months ago.
"I am scared that I will continue to live here and die here," she said. "I want to die in a slightly better place."
After her husband died of a heart attack nearly 30 years ago, Kim moved into the farmland-turned-slum, doing temporary work at building sites, and once even cleaning at one of the nearby high-rise apartments.
"I envy them," the mother of five said in her shack, which is too small to accommodate even a television. "Why wouldn't I? I pray every day that some day my kids can have a life like them."
Kim, who depends on a monthly government living subsidy of 200,000 won ($187), uses a shared toilet around the corner and takes showers and does laundry at public baths.
"Later you will see all kinds of bugs, like cockroaches, and rats," she said. "Bug killers don't work."
In December, city and district officials agreed on a redevelopment plan to build thousands of units of low-cost housing, including subsidized homes for current slum residents.
"We need to develop the area quickly to improve housing security for people there, because these illegal shacks are old, so they are vulnerable," said Cho Gyu-tae, a Gangnam official handling the redevelopment.
Slum residents were old and ailing, said Ahn Young-chan, a 79-year-old grandfather and victim of backaches, who has lived in the shantytown since it sprang up in the late 1980s.
After the failure of previous resettlement efforts, he is wary of getting his hopes up.
"We have to wait and see," he said. "Honestly we don't have power. We have no choice but to follow what the authorities tell us."

David Todd and I discussed the Gaby Sanchez trade on our last podcast, and I again came out against it, with the idea being that it's difficult for the Pirates to draft stars, and a competitive-balance pick in the 30s at least represented the possibility that the Pirates might get a star, even if it wasn't a particularly likely possibility.
Huntington addressed the Sanchez trade again in his interview with David last week:
You see a comp pick, and there's the risk, is that we may have given up David Wright. But ... there's about a 15 percent chance of getting an everyday big-leaguer in the 30 to 40 pick range ... We felt like it was worth that 15 percent chance that we were going to get an everyday big-leaguer. ... The draft is much more scripted than it's ever been, it's much more difficult to get a tough sign to slide later, to be able to maybe take him with that sandwich pick.
Looking through previous drafts shows Huntington's analysis to basically be correct -- most years, one or two players between 30 and 40 turns out be decent regulars, and a much smaller percentage turn out to be David Wright (who was taken with the No. 38 overall pick in 2001).
* * *
Maybe the most striking aspect of my trip to PNC this week was what I saw outside the stadium. You know those huge player photo banners that decorate the outer walls of the ballpark? Remember what a joke those used to be? You'd walk by and wonder if the world really needed a 12-foot portrait of Tike Redman, or Humberto Cota or Josh Fogg, and if it was just a giant joke on you that those portraits existed anyway. Well, this week I walked by the banners and saw six or seven in a row of players performing inarguably well or downright brilliantly.
This is not 2005. The Pirates are not a joke. And so, while the Pirates should have assessed (and, I'm sure, did assess) the value of a competitive-balance pick versus the value of Gaby Sanchez based on some quantitative standard (like projected WAR, for example), there's more to the Sanchez deal than that. In 2005, it would have been a ridiculous trade for a team with no future. But in 2012, it meant something different.
Sanchez has played very well in 2013. But it's not a case of him merely playing well. He's playing well because he's essentially in the correct role, getting slightly less than half his plate appearances against lefties (against whom he's posted a 1.153 OPS). Moreover, it's a role the Pirates can use, since Garrett Jones doesn't hit lefties well. Sanchez is good for the Pirates, and the Pirates are good for Sanchez.
If any fans of, say, the Cardinals happen to read this, they'll probably think, "Well ... yes. And?" But to me as a Pirates fan, I almost feel as if I'm trying to express something there was never any need to communicate before, like Ricky Gervais in The Invention of Lying or something. Look over the Bucs' roster. Jason Grilli looks like he was born to be a closer. Russell Martin is helping all the pitchers look better, while also contributing offensively. The same goes for Starling Marte. Justin Wilson and Vin Mazzaro are ably compensating for the Pirates' starters' difficulties going deep into games. Clint Barmes is gobbling up ground balls induced by pitchers like Wilson and Mark Melancon.
In other words, there's symbiosis all over the place, and the roster is full of players who are well-suited to their roles. Those are the marks of a well-constructed team. Gaby Sanchez has been good because of Garrett Jones, who has been good because of Gaby Sanchez. I'm used to seeing this happen in other teams, but I'm not used to seeing it happen with the Pirates, who usually seem to have three or four good players with 21 or 22 average or bad players scattered randomly around them.
The Rays' acquisition of Matt Garza and Jason Bartlett prior to the 2008 season was the key move that changed the Rays from a random accumulation of talent to an actual team. It might be premature to declare that the same thing is happening to the Pirates (and I'm not saying they're as good as the 2008 Rays, although I'm sure some idiot somewhere will gleefully claim I was saying that if the Pirates find more ways to disappoint us). But man, this sure feels like that. To get Garza and Bartlett, the Rays gave up Delmon Young, who at that point was still perceived as a very, very high-upside player. The Rays probably had a much clearer read on Young than most of us on the outside, obviously. But at the time, I didn't like that deal from the Rays' perspective, and I'm not sure I would have even if I'd known whatever they knew about Young. That was mostly because I still thought of the Rays as being in a random-talent-collecting phase, not in a building-a-team phase.
Collecting talent and building a team aren't mutually exclusive, and it wouldn't be wise for the Pirates to, say, draft a major-league-ready reliever at No. 9 this year instead of a player who might be a star four years from now. But I think Neal Huntington's behavior in the past year suggests he's mostly building a team now, and not just randomly collecting players who might one day be good. Gaby Sanchez is a useful player, but the Marlins were mostly using him as a Random Talented Guy, playing him every day even though he has a career .893 OPS against lefties and a .708 OPS against righties. The Pirates are using him as part of a team by utilizing his strengths (pounding lefties and playing good defense at first) and minimizing his weakness (hitting righties).
So the Marlins have the No. 35 overall pick in the draft now. Maybe they'll end up with the next David Wright. But they probably won't. And the more I think about it, the more I think that's probably fine. For once, the Pirates have bigger fish to fry.
Four bottles were closely grouped behind the Costanti. No. 2 came from Donatella Cinelli Colombini, graceful, pretty and fresh, enjoyable now yet well structured for the long haul. By contrast, the No. 3 bottle, from Canalicchio di Sopra, will need some time to show its best self. Right now, the tannins and structure stand out, but underneath are stony, earthy, cherry flavors that show a refreshing bitterness.
No. 4, from Fattoria dei Barbi, was in a different style, leaner and more herbal than many wines, yet with enough fruit and minerality to achieve complexity. This wine, too, will need some time for all the parts to integrate. Check back in 2020. The Barbi was also our best value at $45.
At No. 5 was Poggio Il Castellare, a producer I had not had before, an excellent example of the style of the 2010 vintage, which in the most balanced wines combines opulence and a sense of structure.
Other wines well worth checking out include the rich Gianni Brunelli with its lingering flavors, the structured yet well-balanced Fornacina and the beautifully aromatic Caparzo.
With wines as good as these, it's hard for me to understand the widespread criticism that I continue to hear of Brunello di Montalcino.
Without question, the region is a far cry from what it could be. On the question of terroir, for example, Montalcino does not have the careful organization into communes with identifiable characteristics, which you find in Burgundy, and, to a lesser extent, in Barolo. This is a tremendous drawback that makes it difficult to understand the nuances of terroir, yet the realities of local politics make it unlikely that such a division into subzones will happen in the future.
Nonetheless, the beauty and distinctiveness of these wines are clear, and their potential for pleasure great. For now, that is enough.
Tasting Report
★★★½ Conti Costanti Brunello di Montalcino 2010, $75
Dense yet fresh, rich yet elegant, with pure, lingering flavors of red fruit, flowers and minerals. (Empson U.S.A., Alexandria, Va.)
The Kings will host five prospects Sunday for a predraft workout at the team practice facility.
The quintet includes two first-round prospects, Wisconsin forward Sam Dekker and Arizona forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson.
Dekker (6-9, 219) averaged 13.9 points as a junior for the Badgers, who lost to Duke in the NCAA Championship title game. His versatility is said to be a strength but his shooting could be better. He shot just 33.1 percent from the college three-point line as a junior.
Hollis-Jefferson (6-7, 217) averaged 11.2 points and 6.8 rebounds as a sophomore for the Wildcats. He's also seen as a prospect with versatility who could become a good defender. His offensive ability at the pro level has also been questioned.

Neither is considered likely to be picked where the Kings are in the first round, sixth overall.
Point guard Mike Caffey (6-0, 180, Long Beach State), power forward Duje Dukan (6-10, 218, Wisconsin), and point guard Juwan Staten (5-11, 186 lbs, West Virginia) are also scheduled to be a part of the workout.
Image caption Imports to the US rose while exports from the US fell
The gap between the value of imports to the US and exports from the US widened in January.
The trade deficit grew to $44.45bn (£29.53bn) in January from December's figure of $38.14bn, the Commerce Department said.
There was better news on unemployment, with a fall in the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits.
The Labor Department said the number of initial claims for state benefits fell 7,000 to 340,000.
The figure had been expected to rise.
The initial claims news will not affect the week's most important economic news, which is Friday's non-farm payrolls figure for February, because the weekly claims figures are for the beginning of March.
Much of the rise in imports came from a 12% increase in imports of oil.
The trade deficit for the whole of 2012 was revised down slightly to $539.5bn, which was 3.6% below the level from 2011.
Analysts said that the trade figures would cut the country's economic growth in the first three months of 2013.
"The sharp deterioration in trade shaves a bit from the outlook for growth in the first quarter," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
"There are signs that domestic demand is firming, which would provide a major offset to weakness abroad."
CLOSE More heavy rains are expected in West Virginia, where floodwaters have killed at least 25 people in the past week. More than 20 counties were under a flash flood watch Monday. USA TODAY

Officials in flood-stricken areas of West Virginia shifted their attention Sunday to repairing damage inflicted by the historic deluge that killed at least 25 people as it washed out homes, roads and bridges. Search and rescue operations continued in some pockets of the state.
And more rain is forecast Monday, creating “a risk for additional flooding concerns, especially in areas hard hit this last week,” the National Weather Service said.
President Obama declared a major disaster in three counties on Saturday, clearing the way for people to start seeking federal aid for housing, food and rebuilding. West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said Sunday that the state was “working to add more counties” to that list. The declaration covers Greenbrier, Kanawha and Nicholas counties.
Some people in Greenbrier County were still unaccounted for, according to Tomblin's office, the Associated Press reported. Kanawha County officials were conducting search-and-rescue operations Sunday near Frame, W.Va., the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said.
Volunteers, federal officials and 300 National Guardsmen fanned out across the state on Sunday to deliver supplies and begin the job of assessing the full extent of the damage from the flash floods. Heavy rains on Thursday rapidly overflowed creeks and rivers, driving hundreds of people from their homes.
Of those who died, 16 were in rural Greenbrier County, southeast of Charleston. Six others died in Kanawha, and one person each died in both Ohio and Jackson counties, the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said in a statement.
Damage assessments continued Sunday. More than 500 homes in Roane County were damaged or destroyed by the flooding, the state emergency office said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will begin damage assessments for individual homes and businesses on Monday, plus start measuring damage to government buildings and infrastructure on Tuesday.
More than 12,000 homes and businesses had no electricity Sunday morning, according to Appalachian Power, which said at least one of its substations was submerged by the flooding. The company said it hoped to have power restored throughout the state by Monday evening.
The power outages also knocked out water service in Fayette County, the state emergency management office said Sunday.
Tomblin had said that the flooding had closed 60 roads, and many of them were destroyed.
The West Virginia Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster sent out damage assessment teams on Sunday and planned to start dispatching cleanup crews Monday. The group also handed out water and cleaning supplies.

They then took the tanks to the local disaster relief area so they could be used for the grills which were being used to cook food for those in need. (Photo: Ty Wright, Getty Images)
The American Red Cross said 20 shelters were opened for people displaced by the flooding.
The luxury Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. — which was forced to close and its namesake PGA Tour tournament was canceled because of damage to its golf course — provided rooms and meals to more than 200 people left homeless by the storm.
“We just hope that by providing a good meal and a comfortable and safe place to spend the night that we can help ease the pain just a little to those who are suffering so much from this unbelievable disaster," the resort's CEO, Jim Justice, said in a statement.
The floods were the third-deadliest on record in West Virginia, according to state climatologist Kevin Law. The Buffalo Creek flood in 1972 killed 125; and floods in 1985 killed 38, Law said.
The latest floods pushed water levels on the Elk River to some of the highest levels ever recorded. In Queen Shoals, W.Va., the river swelled to a height of 33.37 feet, breaking the record set in 1888, the weather service said.
At this time, individual @FEMA assistance is available in Greenbrier, Kanawha and Nicholas counties. We are working to add more counties. — Governor Tomblin (@GovTomblin) June 26, 2016

The working poor need more money. “But retail stores can't raise wages very much—their profit margins are too small,” say conservatives. Aha—but there is a solution!
All types of people across the political spectrum agree that people who work hard should not have to live in poverty. Movements like The Fight for 15 have focused on raising the incomes of the lowest-paid workers by forcing low-paying industries like fast food to raise their hourly wages. Which is fine. They need a higher income. But the most common response from corporations that employ lots of low wageworkers is simply: we can't afford it. Our profit margins are too thin. A prime example of this genre appears in the Wall Street Journal editorial page today, in a piece written by Andy Puzder, who is the CEO of a fast food restaurant chain. He calculates the average profit per employee at a major American retail or restaurant chain to be $6,300 per year. Then comes some back-of-the-envelope math:
How would a minimum-wage increase affect the retail industry? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hours worked a week in the retail trade sector is 31.5. Assuming an employee earns the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour and works only 30 hours a week, an increase to $9 an hour would result in an annual wage increase of $2,730... At $10.10 an hour, this employee would make $4,446 more a year, decreasing profit per employee by 71%. At this level, the CBO found that the economy would lose about 500,000 jobs.
In essence, Puzder argues that the service industries that employ most low wageworkers operate on small profit margins, cannot easily raise their prices significantly, and therefore will be impacted so negatively by minimum wage increases that they will begin to busily lay off workers. Leaving aside the question of whether minimum wage increases cause job losses (a point that is hotly disputed in economics), the broad outlines of this argument have at least some truth to them: these industries are not currently constructed in a way that would enable them to implement large wage increases without digging into (or destroying) profits.
Poverty level wages are a key part of the service industry's business model.
Hardcore free marketeers believe this is the end of the argument. “Businesses can't afford to pay people more, the end.” But that is backwards. The purpose of human existence is not to service the bottom line of ethereal corporations. On the contrary, corporations exist to serve humans. The proper way to begin this conversation is to accept that no just and functional society can afford to pay people who work hard poverty wages. That constitutes a broken system. The question, then, is: How can we get more income to the poorest workers while retaining as many of the advantages of the current model as possible?
You do not have to be an economist to grasp the fact that forcing hundreds of millions of Americans to rely for their basic needs on the good graces of corporations is not a wise system. Corporations are machines built for making money. They are not programmed to care about human needs unless those needs directly impact the bottom line. A corporation is not the thing you want overseeing your welfare. We live in a democracy, which means that (if we could ever make it function correctly) the state is a much better choice for looking out for people's needs.
Fortunately, there is a way to reconcile the needs of people to earn a living with the desire of greed-centric corporations not to pay higher wages. It is to provide everyone with a basic income. The state takes in tax money; everyone is granted a certain sum to provide for their basic needs; and everyone can then work without feeling that they must beg a faceless corporate monster for enough income to cover rent and food and child care. And what do you know: the idea of providing a minimum income is catching on. It is somewhere near the realm of reality in Canada; it's been instituted in a Dutch city; it's being tried in Germany; it's popular in Finland and Switzerland. In other words, the most civilized nations in the world, with the highest standards of living and strongest social safety nets, are leading the way on the minimum income issue.
A minimum basic income would allow us to dismantle vast bureaucracies that exist to police welfare recipients, and just cut everyone a check. And it would take a great deal of pressure off the movement to raise the minimum wage, because everyone's income would have a floor already, meaning even low-paid workers would be less vulnerable to financial disaster. It's a large-scale way to smooth out some of the inequality that plagues our nation. And it would allow fast food CEOs to stop bitching.
How would we pay for it? Partly by redirecting money we already spend, and partly by taxing the rich, like fast food CEOs, and by taxing corporations, like fast food corporations. Well. At least they could bitch about something novel.

To mark his first 100 days in office, President Trump granted an interview to CBS' John Dickerson, but he ended up cutting it off in frustration as the two stood in the Oval Office. Dickerson, host of Face the Nation, made the Very Fake News decision to ask the president about a previous statement. In this case, it was the claim that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had wiretapped him during the campaign. When Dickerson pressed Trump on the issue, he grew frustrated and eventually threw his toys out of the sandbox:
Here's a transcript of the encounter:
Trump, asked about his claim Obama tapped his phone, says "I don't stand by anything," says his side was proven, then bails on the interview pic.twitter.com/dRX1WItcOl — Mark Berman (@markberman) May 1, 2017
"I don't stand by anything."
Could there be a more perfect encapsulation of these past 100 days? Trump pledged to "drain the swamp," then filled his transition team and cabinet with lobbyists, billionaires, and plenty of Goldman Sachs alumni. He promised to take on China and declare them a currency manipulator—then said they weren't. He pledged to tear up NAFTA, "the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world," then told the leaders of Mexico and Canada last week that he'd keep it. In all, he made 60 different promises in his "100-day action plan"—part of his Contract with the American Voter—and has taken no action on 60 percent of them. He's broken five outright. He has also, at every turn, echoed his behavior in the interview with Dickerson: refusing to acknowledge anything he previously said.
Of course, this is all part of the Trump White House's actual worldview: there is no such thing as objective truth, so there's no flip-flopping or hypocrisy, either. Truth is whatever you can get enough people to believe, which is why Trump tells Dickerson that they can have differing opinions on whether or not President Obama ordered a wiretap (or any other kind of surveillance) against him. It's just two competing views of the world. There is no evidence at all, of course, for Trump's claim, which he tweeted off in a fit of rage before hitting the golf course. But the evidence is ultimately irrelevant.
The president believes he should be able to accuse his predecessor of a felony and then move on, never providing justification or explanation. That Dickerson felt the need to continually remind Trump he is the President of the United States probably says it all. After 100 days, the president still does not realize that his words can literally change the trajectory of world history. Or worse, he knows this, and he thinks it's unfair.
At a recent International Game Developer Association (IGDA) keynote presentation in Toronto, The Last of Us' creative director, Neil Druckmann, revealed his personal vision of the title's ending to fans of the critically acclaimed game.
The popular interpretation of Ellie's reaction at the end of the game is she's complacent with Joel's lie about the Firefly doctors. She knows he isn't telling the truth but doesn't care. She's simply just happy to finally have a companion and father figure in her life.
“One of the things that happened during production was I became a dad to a girl (it sounds weird to say it like that). One of the first ‘ah ha!' moments I had when working on the story and structure, was when we figured out Joel's arc. His arc is all about this irrational love he feels for this kid. He would do anything to take away her pain and definitely anything in the world save her from harm. It's about how far this guy is willing to go to save Ellie. Clearly he's willing to give up his life (he frankly doesn't care much about it),” said Druckmann.
Druckmann also gave more details on Joel's emotional state at the end of The Last of Us and how much his teenage companion, Ellie, means to him. Their relationship is a huge part of the The Last of Us' plot line.
“There are all these walls he's put around himself to try to protect his emotional state. He's willing to put all those down and put himself at risk because it's worth it. It's worth it to put himself at risk to have that love of your kid, even though you might have to deal with something horrible happening. He's even willing to put his soul on the line, damning the rest of man kind in exchange for this girl's life. What happens here with this lie and this emphasis on the lie, is that this has taken his journey to the end of the line,” said Druckmann.
Druckmann then discussed his relationship with his daughter. He explained that as his daughter gets older and becomes her own little person, he gets to see the world through her eyes. He used this realization as inspiration for Ellie's story arc in The Last of Us.
“As a game creator I look around at kind of what we are making and what will be her role models from our stories, and I don't like what I see. More specifically I'm talking about our female characters. Whether we want to admit it or not, these are role models. We sexualise, we objectify, we marginalize and we reduce these female characters to lot less than they can be,” explained Druckmann.
While The Last of Us' ending is designed to make the player think and is open to interpretation, Druckmann's intentions for the game's finale are very different than what many gamers might imagine.
“While working on The Last of Us, I had this secret agenda, an agenda that's becoming less and less secret the more I talk about it. I wanted to create one of the coolest non-sexualized female video game protagonists. I felt like with the last of us, if we did that, we had an opportunity to change the video game industry. I know it sounds pretentious, but that was my goal.”
Ellie was designed to be a very capable character in The Last of Us. As the game progresses, this becomes even more apparent, especially towards the end of its story and during the sections where the player takes direct control of her.
“Ellie starts off clinging to parental figures thinking she needs someone much stronger than her to survive in this world. It starts of with Malrene and quickly shifts to Joel as they start off this journey. She wants to be like Joel; she looks up to him and she kind of wants to win his respect… When Ellie's talking to Sam, she talks about how her greatest fear, more than anything, is ending up alone. But as the story develops, we find out she's quite capable and in fact she's been capable this whole time. At times she stands up to Joel and forces him to respect her as an equal…”, said Druckmann.
The next piece of information is perhaps the most interesting thing discussed during the keynote. Apparently Druckmann and his team of writers intended Ellie's reaction to Joel's lie to be interpreted very differently than many gamers have.
“Then we come to that ending and that lie and that okay and what does that okay mean? It's definitely not a complacent ‘yea I'll go along with you', in fact, it's the opposite. It's Ellie waking up for the first time, waking up and realizing she can't rely on him anymore. While she loves him for what he's done for her, she hates him for robbing her of that choice. She knows that she has to leave him and make her own decisions and mistakes.”
During the talk, Druckmann also discussed the possibility of a sequel to The Last of Us and the game's upcoming single player downloadable content. Also, check out my review of The Last of Us where I state that it's the best game of this console generation (a statement I still stand behind).

THE cracks are beginning to show. Greenland's ice sheets slid into the sea 400,000 years ago, when Earth was only a little warmer than it is today. That could mean we are set for a repeat performance.
Greenland's ice sheets slid into the sea 400,000 years ago, when Earth was only a little warmer than today
The finding, along with data from Antarctica, suggests both of Earth's big ice sheets may have already passed a crucial tipping point, condemning them to collapse – either melting, or sliding into the ocean. That will mean sea levels rising by as much as 13 metres, leading to massive coastal flooding. So how fast will the ice collapse, and can we stop it?

Rising seas are an inevitable consequence of global warming as warmer water expands. But the big risk comes from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which contain enough ice to force the oceans up by tens of metres if they melt completely. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that sea levels could rise by a metre this century, and that will just be the start.
The obvious danger is that low-lying coastal areas will be gradually swamped. That includes many major cities, such as New York, London and Rio de Janeiro. In the long run, we will have to choose between protecting them with elaborate sea defences or abandoning them to move inland. But long before that, rising seas will make coastal flooding worse. The deluge that swept through New York when superstorm Sandy struck in 2012 was worsened by sea level rise, as were the floods caused by typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last year.
Now a team led by Alberto Reyes of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has evidence that the southern Greenland ice sheet melted during a relatively warm spell that interrupted the ice age. If they are right, the planet may already be warm enough to unleash a collapse.
Short of a time machine, we cannot see how big the Greenland ice sheet was in the past. But ice sheets grind away the rock they sit on, dumping sediment into the sea. So Reyes's team studied a sediment core that had been drilled out of the Eirik Drift, a sandy hummock in the sea south of Greenland. The core contained sediments laid down over 440,000 years that chemical analysis showed came from Greenland. But hardly any sediment was deposited around 400,000 years ago, for a period of about 10,000 years, suggesting that at this time there was no ice sheet on Greenland to break up the rocks (Nature, DOI: 10.1038/nature13456).
“Our study provides the first evidence that the southern Greenland ice sheet has collapsed in the geologically recent past,” says team member Anders Carlson of Oregon State University in Corvallis.
Indirect evidence suggested the ice sheet shrank considerably back then, but there was always a question mark, says Richard Alley of Penn State University in University Park. “I would probably take the question mark off now.”
This is the latest in a flurry of work suggesting that Greenland's ice is vulnerable. For instance, better mapping of the bedrock has revealed that the valleys in which the glaciers sit extend further inland, and deeper below sea level, than previously thought. That means warm seawater can creep many kilometres inland, melting the glaciers from beneath (Nature Geoscience, doi.org/s96).
All this means Greenland's ice may be on course for full-scale melting. But it is difficult to pin down the temperature tipping point when a collapse becomes inevitable. “We might pass it before we know,” says Alley. We don't know how much warmer Earth was 400,000 years ago. “It may have been as little as 1 °C warmer than present,” Carlson says.
News from the other end of the planet is no better. While most of Antarctica's ice appears to be safe, the western fringes may have already passed a point of no return. Several west Antarctic glaciers have retreated by tens of kilometres (Geophysical Research Letters, doi.org/srf). If west Antarctica's ice sheet does collapse, it will mean metres of sea level rise.
“We can only hope it takes a long time to happen,” says Tim Lenton of the University of Exeter, UK. The word “collapse” implies a sudden process, but in human terms ice sheets disappear slowly. In the case of Greenland, it will probably take centuries, says Alley. That's because friction with the underlying rock slows ice flow into the sea, setting speed limits.
But Antarctica's sheets may melt faster. Its valleys open out into much wider canyons than those in Greenland, so the ice feels less friction. “There remains a chance that west Antarctica doesn't listen to the speed limits,” says Alley.
Can we stop the ice sheets collapsing? Some suggest cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space, a controversial idea known as geoengineering. But it might not help the ice, says Lenton, as much of the melting is caused by warm seawater and that takes a long time to cool.
The best option is to stop emitting greenhouse gases, and then start removing them from the atmosphere, says Lenton. “We might be able to get back under the threshold in a couple of centuries,” he says. “Even if you can't stop the meltdown you could slow it.” That might sound like admitting defeat, but every year we postpone the meltdown is another year in which to get ready for it, he says.

The American left is very good at turning ferociously on politicians who start ill-advised wars. In Lyndon Johnson's final years in office, anti-war activists picketed the White House holding signs saying, “Lee Harvey Oswald, where are you now?” A poll found that by 2006, 76 percent of Democrats were open to impeaching George. W. Bush Where the American left is less effective is in preventing politicians from starting those wars in the first place.
Take, for example, the legislation introduced last week by fourteen Senate Democrats (and thirteen Republicans) to levy new sanctions on Iran unless its leaders agree to a final nuclear deal that, among other things, abandons all uranium enrichment. To understand how absurd that standard is, it's worth noting that Mohammed ElBaradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and John Kerry have both said Iran has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. That right is felt so strongly in Iran that even Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the reformist who had the presidency brutally stolen from him in 2009, has declared that enrichment “is our right and we have no right to backpedal” on it. Iran's current foreign minister has said that if the U.S. enacts new sanctions, even ones that go into effect at a later date, “the entire [interim] deal [signed last month in Geneva] is dead.” A December 10 report by U.S. intelligence concurred, declaring that “new sanctions would undermine the prospects for a successful comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran.” White House press secretary Jay Carney has said they would “greatly increase the chances” of war.
So why on earth are fourteen Democrats joining Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio in openly defying the president? In a party that is clearly moving left on economics, how can so many prominent Democratic senators support a bill so widely scorned by Democratic foreign policy experts? Because in recent years grassroots Democrats have turned their attention away from Middle East policy and AIPAC has not.
A few years ago, the backlash against such a bill would have been deafening. In 2007, Hillary Clinton voted to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group, a vote some feared gave the Bush administration license to attack Iran. Among her opponents for the Democratic nomination, the response was ferocious. “Instead of blocking George Bush's new march to war,” declared John Edwards, “Senator Clinton and others are enabling him once again.” Candidate Obama mailed a flier to Iowa voters denouncing Clinton for her vote. Candidate Joe Biden called it a “serious, serious mistake.”
But back then, rank and file Democrats were still shaking with rage over Iraq. Over the last few years, the winding down of George W. Bush's wars plus the financial crisis and rise of the Tea Party has radically reoriented the left's focus. It's a sign of the times that the party's hottest star, Elizabeth Warren, is an anti-Wall Street crusader with no distinct foreign policy views whatsoever.
All of which is terrific for AIPAC, once compared by its former foreign policy director to “a night flower: it thrives in the dark and dies in the sun.” AIPAC will resist any move toward rapprochement with Iran because a menacing Iran is crucial to its efforts to convince American Jews that, without AIPAC, they'd be living in 1938. Only a mobilized liberal activist base can overcome AIPAC's influence. But despite the best efforts of MoveOn, CREDO, that doesn't exist right now.
Among the senators who have cosponsored the new sanctions legislation are Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand from New York, Chris Coons from Delaware, Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut and Robert Menendez and Cory Booker from New Jersey. These are bright blue states where most Democratic voters would be appalled to know that their senators support a bill that both President Obama and U.S. intelligence believe increases the chances of a third Middle Eastern war. Indeed polls show that Democrats overwhelmingly back Obama's Iran policy. The more these senators are forced to publicly defend their positions on Iran, the more politically costly those positions will become. What we don't know is whether the left can generate a movement strong enough to force that public debate.
In 2006, Democrats enraged by Joe Lieberman's support for the Iraq war denied him their party's renomination for senate. In 2008, Democrats embittered by Hillary Clinton's support for Iraq helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in presidential history. But they were too late; the damage was already done. The American left is very good at punishing politicians for supporting disastrous wars. Its challenge in 2014 is to show that it can stop politicians from promoting those wars in the first place.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Donald Trump took the stage in Colorado Springs almost an hour after he was scheduled to speak, he blasted the fire marshal, saying "they don't know what the hell they're doing," for not allowing more people in to see the town hall Friday afternoon.
But KRDO-TV, our sister station in Colorado Springs, reports it was exactly the knowledge of Colorado Springs Fire Department officials which allowed him to get to the rally in the first place.
"A mechanical issue involving a rescue mission by the Colorado Springs Fire Department is what caused Donald Trump's delayed arrival to UCCS on Friday," KRDO reported Saturday.
Trump was reportedly trapped inside an elevator at The Mining Exchange Hotel with ten other people 30 minutes before the event was scheduled to begin at 2 p.m.
Firefighters were able to open the top elevator hatch and lower a ladder into the elevator so all parties, including Trump, could safely evacuate into the second-floor lobby area of the hotel, KRDO said .
No one was injured.
Fire Marshal Brett Lacey would later go on a local television station to respond to Trump's criticism of how the event was handled, saying the problem was that organizers handed out too many tickets.
“There's an old adage that when a fire marshal walks into a room, milk curdles. So because we're always looking out for public safety and trying to make certain venues go off successfully and safely sometimes there are people that aren't very happy with some of the rules and regulations we're required to enforce. But it doesn't bother me at all,” Lacey told the TV station, according to our partners at The Denver Post .
On Sunday, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper responded to Trump's criticism of the fire marshal on Twitter, asking Trump to apologize to Lacey.
Donald, unbelievable. Even for you. Fire Chief Lacey deserves respect, not humiliation. How about an apology? 2/2 https://t.co/7lI7F765pc — John Hickenlooper (@hickforco) July 31, 2016
The Gallogly Events Center at UCCS has a capacity to sit 1,500 people. Organizers set up an overflow room where another 1,000 could watch his speech on television.

If you were reading some of the major tech-news sites on Wednesday — including the New York Times and Washington Post tech blogs — you might have gotten the impression that a huge proportion of the Chinese internet somehow got redirected to a small house in Wyoming on Tuesday. Why? Because that's what a lot of the headlines said. The truth is almost as strange, but a Chinese technical glitch plays the starring role in the story, not a small house in Wyoming.
The house that captured everyone's attention is a tiny brick home on what looks like a well-manicured street in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It showed up in photos on Gizmodo and The Verge, under headlines like “Most of China's Web Traffic Wound Up at a Tiny Wyoming House Yesterday” and “Chinese Internet Traffic Redirected to Small Wyoming House” (that one was the New York Times tech blog). The Washington Post said that “thousands if not millions of Chinese Internet users were being dumped at the door of a tiny, brick-front house.”

That's a great story, but it's not even remotely true, as Megan Garber at The Atlantic has also noted. As some (but not all) of the stories pointed out much further down, much of the traffic from China was actually redirected to a little-known company called Sophidea, which provides tools for evading China's infamous “Great Firewall.” Is the company based in a small house in Cheyenne, Wyoming? Nope. Are its servers located there? No.
In fact, the small house is just the company's registered business address, one that is used by thousands of shell companies and other corporations who want to remain relatively anonymous (and the company that registered it has actually moved to a different address in Wyoming). The traffic actually went to wherever Sophidea's servers are located, which is hard to say with any precision.
According to networking analysts who specialize in China, technologists running the Great Firewall likely meant to block traffic to Sophidea's domains, but instead they re-routed a large quantity of traffic there by mistake, resulting in outages for websites and other services within China. But none of that had much to do with a small house in Cheyenne, Wyoming — as interesting a story as that might be.
In an earlier post, I discussed how the Sāńkhya notion of manifest and unmanifest matter addresses some fundamental problems related to perception and realism. In a later post, I discussed how the unmanifest becomes manifest through several stages—para, pasyanti, madhyama and vaikhari. In a subsequent post, we talked about how the agency to cause this manifestation is prāna, which acts as the “force” of nature, under the control of free will, time, karma, and God. This description leads to a natural doubt: is prāna an objective entity by itself, or is it simply a combined effect of other entities (soul's choice, time, karma and God)? This post discusses how prāna is an objective entity called kundalini in yoga philosophy, but it is not objective in the sense of material objects.
Three Kinds of Possibilities
The world exists as a possibility but there are many forms of possibilities. In one form, possibility is a desire to do something. The existence of the desire makes something possible, but not real. In another form, possibility is an ability to do something. The existence of the ability makes something possible, but unless that ability is actually employed, the action is not real. In yet another form, possibility is an opportunity to act; the opportunity can be converted into a reality, it is not yet reality.
These three kinds of possibilities are called māyā śakti, kriya śakti and bhūti śakti. The desire to do something is māyā śakti. The ability to do something is kriya śakti. And the opportunity to do something is bhūti śakti. In this post, I will focus upon kriya śakti or the ability to do something.
Each of these three śakti is material, in the sense that desires, abilities, and opportunities are temporary. And yet, they can carry over from one life to another. For example, the desires we develop now will be present in the next life as well. The actions we perform now will create opportunities in the future. And the skills we acquire in this life will continue to exist in future lives.
What is Ability?
Many of us are born with hidden talents. Some people are born artists or musicians, some are writers and poets, some are great speakers and thinkers, while yet others have an uncanny ability to motivate and inspire other people and organize them into purposeful activity. If you look at just the present life, you might often not find anything special that these people did in this life to acquire an extraordinary ability. The most rational explanation of their abilities is that they had them right from birth.
The abilities exist in our body as possibilities that have to be realized. It is not necessary that you know of all your abilities at the moment; there are countless abilities that each person has, but they are simply unaware of their existence. A good leader is able to extract these talents by engaging people in activities that they may not have done earlier, and those who are so engaged may not even believe in their own abilities. In a sense, these abilities are hidden even from those who have them.
Ability is an objective material reality that can exist even if we are unaware of its existence. And since it can exist objectively, it must have been acquired in the past through practice, although just as we are often unaware of our past desires and actions, we can be unaware of our abilities too.
Kundalini is Hidden Abilities
What modern science calls “energy” is the ability to do work or bring about changes. When this change is devoid of meanings, it simply reduces to motion, and we cannot distinguish between various kinds of abilities. However, when energy is given meanings, then it represents abilities which can cause different kinds of actions. There is, hence, not one monolithic “energy”. There are instead innumerable kinds of abilities which can cause different kinds of changes. In essence, energy has many forms.
These forms are organized hierarchically into chakra or lotus which is a metaphor for space, such that each spoke in the wheel or each petal in a lotus represents a unique type or dimension.
At the lowest level lies the abilities to manipulate material objects—e.g. to accurately set the value of a property (e.g. temperature). Higher is the ability to perceive new sensations or tanmātra—e.g. to perceive new properties such as momentum or energy. Higher than that is the ability to use the senses in new ways—e.g. to run like a horse, to swim like a fish, or to smell evil like a dog. And successively higher than the senses are the abilities to manifest ideas in the mind, judgments in the intellect, intentions or goals in the ego, and morals and happiness in the mahattattva.
The successive levels of abilities become accessible to the living entity as the kundalini “rises” but the height here is not physical distance. It is rather rising through higher kinds of abilities until the living being reaches the highest material point of happiness in pure sattva-guna.
Kundalini Gives Mystical Powers
Lots of things we today consider commonplace (e.g. airplanes, telephones, computers) would have been considered magical a few centuries ago. Similarly, there are many other abilities called anima (becoming smaller than the smallest), mahimā (becoming larger than the largest), laghimā (becoming lighter than the lightest), garimā (becoming heavier than the heaviest), etc. which currently lie outside our current technology and ability, but can be attained if the kundalini rises through successive levels.
Kundalini is not spiritual. It is a material energy called kriya-śakti which has many forms. This śakti can be used to create new material phenomena, or used to transcend these phenomena. The body, the senses, the mind, intellect, ego, and happiness we feel can all be transformed by this material energy; this energy can be used to achieve great feats, and many yogis have done that.
Hanumān, the great devotee of Lord Rama, demonstrated all these mystical abilities. For instance, when Surasā tries to capture Hanuman, he continuously grows his body just as Surasā expands her mouth to swallow him. In the process, both demonstrate mahimā. Then Hanumān suddenly becomes very small, enters Surasā's mouth, and exits quickly, showing his mastery of the power called anima. Hanumān demonstrates laghimā when he flies for great distances (e.g. to fetch Trikūta Mountain), and shows garimā when Bhīma is unable to move his tail because it has become extremely heavy.
These mystical powers are said to come naturally to one who is self-realized—i.e. transcended the material layers. But these are no more magical than māyā-śakti which is the power by which we desire and enjoy different things or bhūti-śakti which is the power of being due to which we call ourselves “I am” such and such.
The Vile Pursuit of Material Power
Many people are currently enamored by the promise of rising kundalini to obtain new powers. The risk in such endeavors is that kundalini rises from bottom to top, which means that a person can obtain sensory skills without the necessary mental, intellectual and moral development. If the mental, intellectual and moral development preceded sensual skills, there would be no risk in the process. There is considerable risk if the sensual skills are obtained without the necessary mental development.
Again, the example of Hanuman is quite pertinent. As a child, Hanuman had the ability to fly in the sky, and once he flew towards the Sun considering it to be a red ripe fruit ready to be eaten. He would sometimes shake trees causing the sages who were meditating in those trees to fall off the branches. Considering that Hanuman was still a child and did not have the maturity to use his powers properly, the sages cursed him to “forget” about his powers, until he was reminded of them later.
Ramayana narrates how Jāmavanta—the leader of the search party sent to search for Mother Sītā—reminded Hanuman about his latent powers after the vulture Sampāti mentioned to them that Mother Sītā had been abducted by Rāvana to a place across the ocean and while Sampāti could see Mother Sītā sitting in a forest, he could not fly there himself because Rāvana had cut off his wings. It is only after being reminded by Jāmavanta that Hanuman jumps from a mountain and flies to Lanka.
The key point is that the mystical powers are not supposed to be used except for a higher purpose, and only upon the instructions of a superior being. Extraordinary power needs extraordinary safeguards. Those who use this power whimsically—e.g. Aśvatthāmā, who launched the weapon Brahmāstra without the skill to recall it—cause great suffering to others, and eventually to themselves.
God's Power Exists in Everyone
Most proponents of yoga today teach that the self is the goal of yoga, and because true knowledge and power lies hidden from us, they teach their students that we are all God and that we have forgotten our true nature. This is a mistake because if indeed we are all God, then why am I not always aware of the truth, and why do I have to endeavor to realize it? And when I have forgotten the truth, how can I remember it except through external reminder, which means that my being God is a construction of another? These are essential questions that most advocates of yoga in modern times never answer.
The answer is that knowledge and power is not our property, but God's property, who never forgets His power although we do. When we understand God, we can also understand His power. Through that specific type of understanding of God, we also become aware of His abilities and how they are used. That awareness then gives us some powers. Our power is dependent on the extent to which we understand God. We might not recognize that understanding as God, because we just try to understand the power and not its original proprietor. That approach, however, limits the powers themselves. The awakening of the kundalini is an illusion if we think that we have discovered our latent power. The awakening is true when we understand that kundalini is God's power that has been hidden from our vision because we do not know God.
The proponents of yoga try to make the practice impersonal and decouple it from questions of God, in an attempt to separate it from conventional “religion”. And yet, it is precisely that separation which leads to a variety of misconceptions about kundalini: (1) that it is a “spiritual” power, when it is in fact a material energy, (2) that it is “our” power, when it is actually God's power, (3) that by awakening this energy we become God, when this awakening only gives us new ways to serve God, and (4) that when we understand how kundalini is God's power and used to serve Him, the material energy becomes spiritual. Therefore, “material” means separated from God, and “spiritual” means attached to God. In a separated state, the energy appears and disappears, which means that we remember and forget its existence. In the conjoined state, the remembrance is eternal and therefore our power is also eternal. But it is still God's power use to serve Him.
This ability to use God's energy for God's service is called yoga and yajña. The process of yoga is symbolized in the act of offering a river's water into the river. The idea is that everything is God's energy, and therefore we cannot offer to God anything other than His own creation. In so doing, we are not giving God that which He did not already own. However, in the act of offering God's creation back to Him, we renounce our sense of proprietorship and acknowledge God's ownership. That is real yoga.

Christian Richter spent his teens exploring abandoned buildings in what was then Communist East Germany. As an adult he's still doing it, but now he takes a camera to capture the advancing decay of their interiors.
My childhood was surrounded by the industrial, crumbling buildings of the former German Democratic Republic - lots of ramshackle structures, and power stations.
There's a feeling that this is the end of time Christian Richter, Photographer
I was 14 years old when the Berlin Wall came down. It was a huge change for us. People didn't know how it would all turn out. It was very exciting - the start of something new. At first we visited the West a lot just to see what it was like, and although quite a few people moved away, I stayed.
Because so many people had left, everything began to fall into disrepair. That's when I started visiting abandoned buildings, sometimes with friends and sometimes on my own. Then much later, when a friend gave me a digital camera, I was able to capture the beauty of these old places.

They are very peaceful places because no-one ever goes there. The way they deteriorate, when nature starts to take over, reminds me that everything is transient. There's a feeling that it is the end of time and you don't find that kind of atmosphere anywhere else.
Over the past seven or eight years I must have visited about 1,000 buildings in Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Poland. I have to go to a lot of places to get one good image or find something that excites me - many of them are just empty and not particularly beautiful.

It's often hard to get inside - I've had to find tunnels or climb through windows. I've travelled long distances to see a building and then found it's been torn down, or I simply couldn't get in.
Sometimes I can tell there might be something special inside, but it's more like a game of chance - maybe I'll find something, maybe I won't. At some point I may hit the jackpot but there's a lot of work behind it - it's very hard to find this kind of beauty.
I once got a tip-off about an old doctor's surgery and I think I was the first person to go inside for 10 or 15 years. It was full of cobwebs and felt slightly mystical. It was like going back in time. The way the light was coming in gave it an amazing atmosphere.

Former industrial plants are also falling into ruin, and psychiatric hospitals have been closed down. No-one looks after them and there's no money for their upkeep - it would be too expensive to preserve them.
When the roof is falling apart and water comes through the ceilings, moss and lichen grow. If the windows are closed it can get very warm in summer and plants start to take over. Often there's a very mouldy smell, but I like it when nature starts taking the building back, and when things are blooming and growing inside.
We used to have lots of inns in the east of Germany - every village had one, with a bar, a ballroom, a function room or a theatre. But as people have left the villages and moved to the towns, they're just not used any more.

When I see an old building in this state I can imagine its former glory, but it's always sad that it's falling apart and not being used.
I keep the locations secret to stop vandals damaging them - some people don't value them and when they get inside it's not just the plants taking over, it's people who are tearing down the banisters or spraying graffiti tags on the walls.
If someone wanted to restore a building, they could write to me and if I thought they were actually the kind of person who might genuinely do something to help, then of course I would try to put them in touch with the right people. That would be theoretically possible, but it hasn't happened yet.

I never break in - I always try to find a way to get inside that doesn't involve damaging anything. That might mean going through a hole in the cellar, over a fence, through cracks, through a window - there's a lot of climbing involved. It's hard work and I have to be quite fit. Some buildings are so tightly secured that you have to be a real climber in order to get in without breaking anything.
It is illegal to go into these places and I have been stopped by police - I've been escorted out of buildings two or three times and issued with a notice, but they've never pressed any charges. They seem to let it go because I'm just taking photos.
Some of these places are very atmospheric, very moody. I once photographed a former crematorium where bodies had been burned. It made a deep impression on me.
Image copyright Christian Richter
Another time, I found a beautiful room with a skylight in an abandoned five-star hotel. I think it was a dining room - I could see the old columns and the dirt on the crumbling floor, and this enormous skylight was covered in curtains, and the light was spilling into the whole room.
Then there was an old public bath, possibly built in the 19th Century, with the original changing rooms, magnificent columns and stucco on the ceiling, and of course a big pool in the middle, without water - but on the walls there were the beautiful colours they used back then, yellows and reds, big contrasts. It was really stunning.
The real beauty for me is discovering these places. The photos aren't exactly secondary but they come alongside the discovery itself. I take the photo to give other people a sense of what it's like.
I think people like them for the same reasons I do - this beauty and sadness mixed up. I think people can identify with the fact that even if you have a wonderful, big house right now, at some point everything will decay. Even palaces and villas are transient.

Twice failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is embarking on a tour to promote her latest book — and she's using the tragic murder of Heather Heyer to promote it.
Clinton begins a recent promotional letter by writing, “Friend — I have been thinking lately about bravery — the bravery of citizens like Heather Heyer who lost her life fighting the organized forces of hate and divisiveness.” However, a mere two paragraphs after referencing Heyer's murder at the hands of a white supremacist, Clinton immediately jumped to pimping out her book tour.
“This fall, I'll be embarking on a book tour of my own — which means that I'll be able to see many of you while I'm out on the road. Click here to get more information about where and how you can get tickets, and hopefully I'll see you soon. Onward!” She writes.
However, though Clinton may feel allied to Heyer, she conveniently failed to mention that Heyer chose not to vote for her. Instead, the 32-year-old voted for progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. Additionally, Heyer opted to abstain from voting in the general election, given the main options of Clinton and Donald Trump.
“She voted for Sanders in Virginia's primary. When Bernie wasn't the Democratic nominee, Heather didn't even vote in the general election,” said Heyer's mother Susan Bro, per The Cut.
Clinton's advertising letter was released by Onward Together, an organization Clinton established earlier this year. The group is designed to create fundraising ventures on behalf of left-of-center political institutions.
“Resist, insist, persist, enlist,” is the organization's ever-so poetic slogan.
The former Secretary of State's book has received endless ridicule, mockery, and disdain from many on the left, claiming that “What Happened?” is filled with excuses and blame-shifting from Clinton on why she lost the election.
Mediaite reached out to Onward Together for comment on Clinton's aforementioned advertising decisions, but did not receive a response.

Wales 15 Ireland 17:The Grand Slam famine is over 61 years after Ireland's only previous triumph, as Ireland produced a remarkable performance underpinned by high tensile mental steel to win a truly heart-stopping encounter that wasn't decided until the final kick of the game, writes JOHN O'SULLIVANin Cardiff
Stephen Jones failed with a long range penalty from the halfway line but it would have been a travesty if he had managed to land the kick. Ireland scored two tries to nil and for the intervention of referee Wayne Barnes, whose wrath they incurred religiously, might have won the match a great deal more comfortably.
They won't care one whit now because in the end Ronan O'Gara's 77th minute drop goal, coming less than 90 seconds after Jones had given the home side what looked like victory with a similar strike, sealed the win.
There were many outstanding performances on the day but none eclipsed the contribution of Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, Paul O'Connell and first half replacement Denis Leamy, who had a truly stupendous match. In the context though every single player contributed something to the win with Tommy Bowe, Luke Fitzgerald and Gordon D'Arcy coming up with some fine individual plays. The pack were simply outstanding to a man.
Ryan Jones sly trip on Ronan O'Gara on 41 seconds after the Irish outhalf hoisted an up and under drew an irate response from Donncha O'Callaghan whose one-on-one grappling with the Welsh captain was soon joined by most players from both teams.
Referee Wayne Barnes awarded Ireland a penalty but O'Gara pulled his attempt from the Welsh 10 metre line narrowly left and wide.
The visiting side were quickly into their stride and a brilliant Gordon D'Arcy break gained 30 metres but after a couple of rucks, Tommy Bowe could not quite gather O'Gara's cross kick. Ireland, though, had started impressively, mixing the game nicely
between playing for territory and keeping the ball in hand.
Tomas O'Leary's clever kick to the corner proved even more precipitous when Ireland spoiled the Welsh lineout and Shane Williams was collared over his own line. From the scrum five, the Irish surged three times through the pack before O'Leary linked with O'Driscoll but the Irish captain's overhead pass to Luke Fitzgerald was adjudged forward and the chance was lost.
The tension of the occasion was manifest in prolonged bouts of aerial ping-pong with the Irish halfbacks guilty of a couple of errors in putting the ball out on the full. The departure of Stephen Ferris after just eight minutes with a hand injury brought Denis Leamy into the fray and he immediately made his presence felt.
The portents for Ireland based on those opening 20 minutes appeared promising as O'Connell nicked a couple of Welsh lineouts, Ireland were forcing the home side backwards and defensively the visitors were forcing turnovers. The only cavils were that Wales looked slightly more dangerous because of the willingness to try and offload in the tackle and that Ireland's kicking game was periodically lax.
O'Gara was being constantly targeted by the Welsh as they ran down his channel and the consistent punishment was having an impact on his general play. As the game reached the half hour mark without a score, two pieces of Irish indiscipline – they conceded a brace of penalties within a minute – gave Wales first field position and then the opportunity for three points. Jones posted the penalty from 20 metres.
A spiralling error rate was beginning to seriously undermine Ireland's good start. Runners were getting isolated and Wales aggressive defence started to force mistakes. On 38 minutes Barnes decision to penalise Heaslip for obstruction appeared ludicrously harsh: accidental obstruction appeared a more correct call.
Jones landed the resultant penalty, a beautiful strike from 45 metres to nudge the home side 6-0 in front. Ireland were handed a valuable lesson concerning the importance of scoring when in opposition territory. The visitors had enjoyed the best of the first half in
terms of field position and possession but ominously the trailed 6-0 at the interval.
Ireland coach Declan Kidney needed to recalibrate the game-plan at half-time, his priority to improve the team's kick-chase game and try and get them to offload or at least be more dynamic at ruck time. The Irish scrum was also under pressure and on a couple of occasions in the Welsh 22, a steadier platform might have proved a decisive launching pad.
Whatever was said had the desired effect based on the opening throes of the second half. Bowe raced onto D'Arcy's long pass sprinted 40 metres from inside his own half and although tackled by Jamie Roberts, Ireland got the field position they craved. Wales right wing defended O'Gara's cross kick but conceded the lineout and from that platform, Ireland would not leave the home 22 without points.
O'Connell won the lineout, the Irish pack edged closer and closer and just as he did against England, O'Driscoll demonstrated his poacher's instincts.
From a ruck virtually on the Welsh line, the Irish captain forced his way under Welsh hooker Matthew Rees for a try which O'Gara converted, as he would do again 90 seconds later as Ireland grabbed a second try.
The Irish outhalf dinked a little kick over the Welsh defence and Bowe arrived at full tilt between two Welsh defenders to take the kind bounce with one hand and race 40 metres under the posts.
Ireland were suddenly 14-6 ahead but indiscipline – O'Callaghan turned an Irish scrum into a Welsh penalty for verbals – cost Ireland another three points as Jones kicked his third penalty.
The outcome of this game was going to be decided by fine margins; mental strength and composure almost as prized as physical attributes.
Another Irish transgression, this time Heaslip at a lineout, allowed Jones to kick a fourth penalty and at 12-14, any Irish momentum from their brilliant start to the second half had petered out.
The visiting team desperately needed their talisman to step forward.
Leamy did on the very next play, so too O'Connell but the key in the final quarter was going to be discipline. O'Leary's clever cross-kick was picked up by Bowe but he chipped Gavin Henson a little early allowing the latter to turn and get back and then the Irish wing compounded his error by pushing Henson and conceding a penalty.
Fitzgerald then tidied up brilliantly and beat several defenders on a slaloming run but as Ireland surged into the 22 with two brilliant offloading cameos from John Hayes, they conceded their sixth penalty of the half: Wales were getting every marginal decision and a 6-0 penalty count reinforced this. It didn't matter whether Barnes was right or not. He wasn't, but as the only arbiter that mattered it was a moot point.
Henson attempted a long range penalty from the halfway line but it fell short and the Welsh star, who had been operating at fullback for most of the game following Lee Byrne's injury, was brilliantly stripped in the tackle by O'Driscoll.
But mistakes would continue to cost Ireland dearly.
Geordan Murphy was adjudged to have knocked on from a superb Henson clearance and once again the visitors were on the back foot.
Wales were being kept in the match and a side of that quality was unlikely to spurn every single turnover. On 74 minutes, Mike Phillips surged clear beating and bullocking through defenders from sloppy lineout ball and although grounded five metres short of the Irish line, Jones dropped back into the pocket, two rucks later to drop a fine goal.
The home side had clawed their way back to lead 15-14.
It's a measure of the character of this Ireland team that they refused to buckle, getting first the field position and then following half a dozen rucks, O'Gara dropped back into the pocket to drop a goal with two minutes and 15 seconds left.
Still Barnes was to give the home side one final opportunity with 16 seconds left on the clock. Stephen Jones stepped up but from almost the halfway line his effort fell short.
Geordan Murphy ran the ball along the in goal area, touched down and history beckoned. The better team on the day won but it is the sheer character and indomitable will that they displayed that will be as long remembered as anything from Cardiff, March 21st, 2009.

Bitcoin Price Breaks Downtrend With Upward Correction
Rate this post
Bitcoin markets are now seeing rising prices only a short time after the rally reached its peak and price started falling. Prices did reach above $2250 but are now keeping above $2200 nevertheless. Resistance might not be as strong as one would expect but selling pressure is still in effect as upward movements seem hard to come through.
Major Signals The change in the market's sentiment from a more bearish one to the current, neutral one happens following a breach of $2000 levels. While support doesn't seem significant at this point, bitcoin prices are still settling around $2200 levels after today's recovery. Sell walls appear to be outweighed by buy walls at this point, something that's indicative of the market sentiment driving the recovery.
GDAX BTC/USD charts are showcasing how selling pressure still does have a major impact on the market, yet it was able to break out of the downtrend leading bitcoin prices down shortly after $2000 levels were breached. This wave of positivity comes only a short time after a major sell off broke the rally of bitcoin's price but it doesn't seem like the current recovery is driven by bulls.
OKCoin BTC/USD weekly futures charts showcase how futures traders are once again keeping a safe distance from the recent positivity of live BTC/USD markets. Futures markets were probably not ready to support a recovery of this extent and so futures rates are maintaining a spread greater than before as it keeps deviating from live bitcoin prices.
All in all, it's worth highlighting that whilst the current recovery might not have the momentum of the rally as it was heading to its peak but it's following a major sell off nevertheless. It's sure something to appreciate that amid a trading session with as high trading volumes,
Mitch McConnell gives a speech. McConnell wants to fund Afghan surge
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) – who was against the stimulus in the first place – has come up with a Republican-endorsed way to spend the untapped balance of that money: funding the surge in Afghanistan.
“We know the stimulus failed,” McConnell said Tuesday. “It was sold to the Congress and to the American people with the suggestion that it would hold unemployment below eight percent. We know unemployment is over 10 percent. We're looking for a way to fund several years of the war. I would suggest unexpended stimulus funds would be a good place to start.”
Story Continued Below
Although unlikely, McConnell comments are part of a larger argument in Washington about how to pay for the Obama administration's plans to increase troops in Afghanistan. House Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-Wisc.) said he wanted to institute a surtax to pay for the war. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) said they do not support that measure. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said those questions are “way ahead of what's necessary at this stage.”
But it sets the stage for a fight in Congress. Democrats have made fiscal responsibility a centerpiece in the fight for health care reform. Now, the party is divided if, and how, it should pay for an increase in troops in Afghanistan.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee, said he would freeze discretionary spending in appropriations bills – much of it in earmarks. McCain suggested a freeze on that type or spending at last year's level – something that would save approximately $60 billion, he said.
“I would look forward eagerly to going through the appropriations those items which are far, far less important than funding our efforts in Afghanistan,” McCain said.
A white dress with a lace overlay. It was one of my favourites. I wore it when I felt good about myself. I wore it for brunches, to meet friends and occasionally because I wanted to look nice. My beautiful white dress now stained a big fat scarlet letter…a memory of how for a brief period of time I was the lightning rod for slut shamers across the country." Aishwarya's account is part of Blank Noise's ongoing I Never Ask For It campaign. You can contribute by submitting an audio account of the sexual assault you faced along with the garment you were wearing when it happened.
The idea is to co-create a public installation made up of 10,000 garments and their stories by 2020. The venue should be a place of public significance such as India Gate, founder Jasmeen Patheja believes.
“How deep-rooted is victim-blaming? How are spaces of violence connected? What does it mean to you to revisit something you've experienced and end blame? This is about anyone who is made to feel vulnerable and is made to feel shame," says Patheja, who juggles many such complex yet fundamental ideas at Blank Noise, a network that seeks to transform attitudes towards private and public sexual violence.
“We are in the process of co-creating a safe place together, a space that is not judging you," adds Patheja, who started Blank Noise in 2003 as her final thesis project at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Bengaluru.
If you want to be inspired by the ideas surrounding women's safety and our responses to everyday sexual violence, you need to look beyond the protective surveillance industry of CCTVs and mobile apps that invade your privacy rather than offer you any real assistance and, of course, court-sanctioned anti-Romeo vigilante squads who hunt down couples in public spaces allegedly to keep street harassment in check.
Patheja's response is my favourite but three state initiatives are also worth tracking. The Hyderabad police has been operating gender-sensitized SHE Teams comprising around four personnel (with at least one woman officer) for more than two years now. They roam the city incognito and speedily book perpetuators of street violence once a complaint is registered.
In Pune, the municipal corporation recently converted old public transport buses into public loos. The buses are now equipped with five toilets, a shower area and a machine that dispenses sanitary napkins, The Indian Express reported. “Initially, women would hesitate to enter the bus, but once they check the cleanliness and safety, they use the facility and give good feedback about the service," one attendant told the newspaper.
In Mysuru, the police commissioner plans to equip the city's 25,000 autorickshaws with an optically readable QR code by June. Anyone who downloads an app and registers can scan the prominently displayed code when they hail an auto. The app tracks the journey and offers more than one way to trigger an alarm that registers in the police control room if anything goes wrong. The app also offers you the option of recording the fact that the auto driver refused your ride. “In an ideal situation, all auto drivers would register and all commuters would have smartphones," says police commissioner A. Subrahmanyeswara Rao, who knows this idea will have to evolve as it gets under way.
Often ideas work best when it's a partnership. Safetipin, an app that collects data about our streets in an attempt to make the city safer, has worked with the New Delhi Municipal Council to do a last-mile connectivity audit of the city's Metro stations; the tourism department to evaluate the safety of 10 big city monuments; and with the public works department to identify 7,483 dark spots in the city.
Safetipin does this by collecting data on factors that can improve our streets: the number of working streetlights, the presence of organized vendors, the state of pavements. “Public space improvement is a low-hanging fruit, much easier than mindset change," says co-founder Kalpana Viswanath.
One unusual cross-border partnership is between Why Loiter?, a campaign (born from a book by the same name) about the need for women to reclaim public spaces, and Girls At Dhabas, a similar initiative in Pakistan where roadside dhabas (eateries) are a male preserve. Why Loiter? inspired the Pakistani initiative and the two groups have been in touch on social media since 2015. Last year, they partnered for Why Loiter's annual year-end campaign encouraging women in India and Pakistan to loiter, then post about it on social media and tag it #WhyLoiter.
“We are friends and comrades and support each other in the common goal of: Let's have more women out there loitering in public spaces. One day we hope to actually hang out and loiter together," says Sameera Khan, co-author of the book.
Then there are those citizens who don't wait around for a non-governmental organization or a government agency to help them fix the problem. At their main campus in small-town Rajasthan, engineering college students of BITS Pilani recently united to remove a 40-year-old girls' hostel curfew.
Student union members went from door to door polling female students: “Should the girls' hostel in-time restriction be removed?" Has the in-time restriction hampered your productivity and performance?" Parents were co-opted to support the move by signing a letter to the university.
“The important thing about this letter is that it was phrased not to be a ‘No-Objection Letter' but as a ‘Letter of Faith' reaffirming the parent's faith in their daughter's decision making and in the institute's decision to remove the curfew. An objection is a negative statement, but faith is a positive one," says student Sibesh Kar in a blog outlining how they did it. The university didn't respond formally, but the curfew was lifted. Sometimes, faith is all you need.
Priya Ramani shares what's making her feel angsty/agreeable.
The mysterious group that authored the “Amazonian Manifesto” to urge changes in Amazon's workplace culture has hired a marketing company to get the message out to employees on the Amazon campus.
The group, led by an anonymous person claiming to be an Amazon employee, told GeekWire that materials would be handed out on Amazon's Seattle campus starting on Tuesday morning. But when we spoke to a woman handing out the cards, it turned out she was hired for the job and has nothing to do with Amazon or the manifesto group.
The woman was wearing regular street clothes, quietly handing out business cards and saying, “A gift from Amazon” to anyone who walked by. The cards had the Amazonian Manifesto logo, Twitter handle and web address. It also listed the seven alternative leadership principles the group has been lobbying for ever since it popped up in the wake of a widely read New York Times article that characterized Amazon as a “bruising” workplace.
GeekWire has not been able to confirm the group's identity, or determine whether it is actually a group of Amazon employees trying to create change from within, as the Amazonian Manifesto blog posts have suggested.
The workers who received the cards didn't appear to respond very strongly one way or another, most just glancing at the cards before walking on.
The woman handing out the flyers said she was hired by Seattle-based i2i Marketing, which in turn said it was hired by the manifesto group. James Devine, president of i2i Marketing, said he didn't know the person who hired his company for the job and hadn't even been told what material they would be passing out until the cards arrived a couple days ago. Devine said his client only communicated via email, and that was from a Gmail account, not an Amazon employee email address.
The distribution of the cards is the latest challenge to Amazon's culture, both internally and externally. Many employees have come forward with their own stories since the New York Times article was published last month. Some have supported the newspaper's characterization while others have disputed it.
The Amazonian Manifesto group, whether or not it's made up of employees, seems intent on keeping the issue front and center. Devine said his company hasn't been hired for any future jobs, but he has no idea what the group may have planned.
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence commissioned a provocative new advertisement called ‘Toddlers Kill' to promote gun control in the run up to election next month.
The ad begins with a series of news reports about young children getting ahold of unattended weapons and then a statistic flashes across the screen claiming Americans are shot by toddlers at least once per week. Several more video clips are shown with children handling weapons as a voiceover suggests America has a problem on its hands.
“We need to lock them up,” the narrator says. “Not the guns. That's just un-American. The toddlers.”
The ad continues with a montage of toddlers posing for mugshots and the narrator concludes by saying, “Guns don't kill people. Toddlers kill people.”
WATCH:
Brendan Kelly, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign, told NBC News the ad was designed to grab the public's attention ahead of the upcoming election.
The statistic cited in the ad about toddlers shooting one American per week does not appear to be independently confirmed. Kelly said it was generated from the Brady Campaign's analysis of data compiled by the Washington Post and Snopes.
National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called the ad “offensive” and an attempt by the Brady Campaign to “sensationalize tragedy to push a gun control agenda.” She further suggested the Brady Campaign “would be spending their resources on safety and training” if they were “truly concerned about safety.”
Baker also credited the NRA's gun safety promotions for the steady decline in accidental firearms deaths over the past several years.

The University of California at Los Angeles has paid at least six professors up to $1,000 each to teach anti-Trump workshops during the Spring semester alone.
In addition, at least two similar workshops are already scheduled for the Winter semester, totaling 8 workshops altogether with $8,000 in taxpayer funds being doled out to their instructors.
"Whitelash or Working Class Revolt? Making Sense of [the] Rise of Trump and New Populism."
[RELATED: Profs pledge to ‘use regular class time' to protest Trump]
While the workshops, sponsored by the “Dean's fund for programs and teaching related to the 2016 presidential election,” purport to discuss “diverse viewpoints about the election and what it portends,” many seem to advocate for a decidedly anti-Trump agenda and none appear to offer a contrasting perspective.
One workshop, for instance, titled “Bullied by Trump's Tweets? University Students on Edge,” will explore the reasons why “some students have come to feel increasingly marginalized and fearful during Trump's presidency.”
[RELATED: Anti-Trump UMich protesters use ‘privileged folx' as shield]
“Who feels endangered by Trump's tweets: people of color, under-served, undocumented, disabled, sexual minorities, older, working-class, and international students navigating changing regulations about personhood, citizenship, and border crossings?” a description for the workshop questions.
According to an advertisement for the workshops obtained by The Daily Bruin, the classes will investigate the “different aspects of [Trump's] administration,” with one workshop called “Communications, Science, and Authoritarianism, Then and Now” examining the “role of communications and science in societies trending toward authoritarianism” and asking students to “track and analyze the new administration.”
There will also be workshop on "Whitelash or Working Class Revolt? Making Sense of [the] Rise of Trump and New Populism," which seeks to cultivate an understanding of the "rise of populism in [the] U.S. resulting in [the] rise of Trump [and] his popularity with white, working class men."
[RELATED: Profs blame Trump win on working class racism, 'spiritual depravity']
Notably, Professor Reynaldo Macias, who served as Dean of Social Sciences after Obama's election in 2008, acknowledged when speaking with The Bruin that he did not offer any workshops at the time on opposing the Obama administration.
Now, however, Professor Laura Gomez, interim dean of social sciences, explained that she developed the aforementioned “dean's fund” in order to persuade professors to participate, since they previously would not be compensated for teaching the seminar-style workshops as part of the Fiat Lux program, which was established in 2001 to facilitate discussions about topics that are not typically discussed in normal classes.
[RELATED: Students get credit for attending anti-Trump teach-in]
“Faculty don't receive teaching credit for teaching Fiat Lux seminars,” explained political science professor Leslie Johns, noting that she hadn't considered participating in the program until hearing about the financial incentive, but is now among the six professors administering seminars this semester.
Campus Reform reached out to the university for comment on the matter, but did not receive a response in time for publication.

The highest court in Europe has laid down its' recommendation in regard to the regulation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The European Court of Justice ruled today that Bitcoin should be exempt from the Value Added Tax (VAT) in Europe. The EU Court of Justice has been hearing the case for numerous months, and has finally come to this recommendation.
The European Union court of Justice stated that Bitcoin transactions “are exempt from VAT under the provision concerning transactions relating to currency, banknotes and coins used as legal tender.” This case was held between the Swedish Tax Authority and the nation's Revenue Law Commission. This case was opened due to a Swedish citizen who asked for further clarification in regard to the VAT and Bitcoin.
The Swedish national, David Hedqvist, has long sought to launch an online Bitcoin exchange. He now operates a Swedish Bitcoin information site called Bitcoin.se. Of interesting note is that several European Bitcoin companies assisted in covering the cost of Hedqvist's lawyers.
This overarching ruling follows recent moves by European governments to make exempt Bitcoin from the VAT, like the United Kingdom or Australia for example.
The European Union has been investigating cryptocurrency for some time now. The European Central Bank (ECB) has previously published an eye opening report that recognizes their fast growth. And with that in regard, the report titled: “Virtual Currency Schemes – A Further Analysis,” also contained 37-pages dedicated to the risk of Bitcoin and what it could be used for.
“Many schemes have appeared, and some have already disappeared again, but around 500 exist at the time of writing,” the EU report stated.
“Bitcoin is used for around 69,000 transactions per day worldwide, compared with a total of 274 million non-cash retail payment transactions per day for the EU alone.”
This landmark ruling made today in the EU comes just one month after the United States ruled Bitcoin to be classified and regulated as a commodity.

Arizona Passes Bill Clarifying State's Religious Freedom Protections
Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin
Correction Appended
State senators in Arizona voted heavily along partisan lines Wednesday in passing a bill that clarifies the state's existing law protecting the religious freedom of its citizens.
With Republicans in the majority, the bill, SB 1062, passed with a 17-13 vote. A companion bill is also expected to pass in the House shortly.
The bill clarifies the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act by, among other things: adding that the government does not have to be a party in the suit for Arizonans to be protected under the law, adding that those protected include, "any individual, association, partnership, corporation, church, religious assembly or institution or other business organization."
While some claimed that the bill is about discriminating against gays, Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough explained that the decision to support the measure is more about protecting people of faith from discrimination.
"This bill is not about discrimination," said Yarbrough who is a sponsor of the bill. "It's about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith."
The Arizona Senate Democratic Caucus responded in a statement that the group opposes the bill because it "conflates discrimination with religious freedom."
"SB 1062 permits discrimination under the guise of religious freedom," said Senate Democratic Leader Anna Tovar in the statement. "With the express consent of Republicans in this Legislature, many Arizonans will find themselves members of a separate and unequal class under this law because of their sexual orientation. This bill may also open the door to discriminate based on race, familial status, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability."
Democratic Sen. Steve Gallardo who represents Phoenix said while everyone has the right to their religious beliefs he doesn't agree with the premise of SB 1062.
"I do not agree that we have the right to discriminate because of our religious beliefs," said Gallardo. "I do not believe we have to throw our religious beliefs to others that don't share our same beliefs."
Correction: February 21, 2014
An article on Thursday, February 20, 2014 stated that the bill would allow business owners to discriminate against gays. That is incorrect. The bill clarifies the conditions in which a person's religious freedom may be infringed. If passed, the bill would actually make it more difficult for a business owner to claim they have a legal right to discriminate against gays due to their religious beliefs because the business owner would have a greater burden of proof under the rewritten law than under existing law.
Georgia State University and its development partners have agreed to a deal to purchase Turner Field, the 20-year-old former Olympic stadium and soon-to-be former home of the Atlanta Braves.
The downtown university and real estate partners Carter and Oakwood Development plan to convert the Ted into a new football stadium for the Panthers and transform surrounding parking lots into a mixed-use community and southern extension of Georgia State's campus.
The deal is worth $30 million and should close by the end of the year.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Georgia State President Mark Becker, Carter President Scott Taylor and Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority chief Keisha Lance Bottoms made the formal deal official at a press conference this morning, bringing a measure of certainty to an area clouded by the Braves' decision nearly three years ago to leave after this season for a new ballpark in Cobb County.
Turner Field may no longer be a baseball stadium, but it will still be a field of dreams,” Reed said.
Governor sends message: don't expect state help
The mayor said the area will say goodbye to “asphalt eyesores” and hello to a walkable district with shops and amenities. He also said the area could eventually see greater MARTA bus service and streetcars to the Atlanta Beltline, if city voters in November approve a half-penny sales tax to fund an expansion of MARTA.
The Braves' move threatened to create a vacuum near the Downtown Connector, one of the South's busiest arteries, leaving local leaders scrambling to find a new buyer ahead of the team's exit.
Reed said this deal fulfills a promise he made when Braves announced their departure to create a vibrant community.
The development plan, which also would include student housing, apartments, single-family homes, classroom space, a grocery store and a Panthers baseball field, would rank among the largest redevelopment projects in the city south of I-20 in recent memory.
In May 2014, the Georgia State team unveiled to the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a $300 million vision for the site. It came months after the shocking announcement in November 2013 that the Braves were leaving downtown to open a new suburban stadium in 2017.
The Georgia State team was named the winning bidder for the 70-acre property last December. At the time, officials with the agency that own the stadium said they hoped to have a deal in place within 30 days, but negotiations stretched for months.
The Georgia State team has been quiet about their plans during negotiations. But in December, university President Mark Becker said “the Turner Field project will be transformational for the surrounding neighborhoods, the city and our university, and we embrace our responsibility to work closely with community and civic leaders in getting it done.”
Georgia State's acquisition of Turner Field must still be approved by the state's Board of Regents, which governs the University System of Georgia.
People familiar with the matter said in recent weeks that they expect a deal to close before the end of the year.
The plan hasn't been without controversy, with some neighbors expressing angst about the plan and concern that community voices would not be heard during planning.
A community-driven master planning session has been underway while the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority, the owner of the stadium, and the Georgia State team were in negotiations on a sale.
Last month, planners working on the Livable Centers Initiative study unveiled concepts of that study, which call for a denser and more walkable community with a street grid much like what was lost decades ago by development of Turner Field and the former Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and downtown freeways. The study incorporated elements of the Georgia State plan and concepts covering five neighborhoods and more than 1,300 acres.
Georgia State and its partners have pledged to incorporate ideas from the plan into their own.
The bidding process also required the winners to honor Atlanta's sports history and preserve landmarks, such as the Hank Aaron statue, on site.
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) has never been a fan of Donald Trump.
And after a hot mic video of Trump making lewd comments about women surfaced Friday, Sasse is urging Trump to step aside as the Republican Party's nominee and let his Vice Presidential pick Mike Pence attempt to salvage the election.
In a tweet Saturday, Sasse asked Trump to honorably exit the race.
Character matters.@realDonaldTrump is obviously not going to win.
But he can still make an honorable move:
Step aside & let Mike Pence try.
— Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) October 8, 2016
Sasse has made his outspoken crusade against Donald Trump's campaign a cornerstone of his time in the Senate so far. Sasse has even faced ire back home from fellow Republicans who wonder why Sasse has spent so much time railing against his party's nominee. But, Sasse has been one of the most consistent members in voicing his concerns. When Sasse announced he wasn't going to go to the Republican convention, his spokesman said in a release that Sasse was going to be spending the month driving around the state showing his children dumpster fires instead.
Op-ed: Two and a Half Men Introduces Trans Character, Manages to Stay Respectful
Showtime and CBS — both owned by CBS Corp. — have rocky track records when it comes to sensitively portraying transgender characters. Shows like How I Met Your Mother, Mike & Molly, Ray Donovan, Californication, House of Lies, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation have frequently used transgender characters as either the punch line to jokes or have limited the roles of transgender characters to murderers or victims of violent crimes.
That's why I approached Two and a Half Men's December 5 episode, "Numero Uno Accidente Lawyer," with some hesitation after learning that the show would be introducing a transgender character named Paula as Alan's (Jon Cryer) new love interest.
To my surprise, Paula (Paula Marshall) was portrayed in a relatively respectful way. Though her status as a transgender woman is the basis of a number of jokes (at one point Alan says, "No guy likes to hear that his girlfriend had a bigger penis than he does"), Alan's acceptance of Paula prevents the show from falling into the many pitfalls so many other CBS and Showtime portrayals have. Not once was she called a man, nor were any transphobic slurs used at any point during the episode.
This marks the second time Two and a Half Men has portrayed transgender individuals in a somewhat positive light. In 2004, the show aired an episode titled "An Old Flame With a New Wick," in which Charlie (Charlie Sheen) meets Bill (Chris O'Donnell), a transgender man he had previously dated. Much like the portrayal of Paula as a transgender woman in "Numero Uno Accidente Lawyer," the show's portrayal of a transgender man was far from perfect but managed to stay respectful.
Near the end of the most recent episode, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn), who happens to be a lesbian, turns to Alan and says, "You're going out with a post-op transgender person without any judgment? Very enlightened."
I'm inclined to agree.
Marshall is slated to appear in at least one more episode, with Diane Farr (Rescue Me, Numb3rs) making a guest appearance as a woman from Paula's past this Friday. Intuition leads me to believe Farr will be portraying an ex-lover of Marshall's, though there's been no official word as to what the connection between the characters will be. My only hope is that the show continues its trajectory of positivity, steering clear of disrespectful and tasteless jokes designed to dehumanize Marshall's character.
Watch Paula and Alan's meet-cute — and what follows — in the clip below.
Because April is National Poetry Month, here's a poem I wrote as a reminder for all of us.
When you gain weight,
you may feel like a failure,
you may be convinced
you've done something wrong
you may think you need
to start counting calories
and cutting out dessert.
When you gain weight,
you may think you
deserve to be punished
to batter yourself at the gym.
You may feel
the need
to call yourself cruel names
to motivate the supposed
sloth you've become.
You may assume
the role of drill sergeant.
You may get out your whip.
You may feel
the chill of disappointment
the heaviness of grief.
You may fear running into anyone you know
Please, don't let them see me until I lose the weight.
Please.
You may feel like staying in.
You may sigh
or frown at the reflection
that you meet.
But here's the truth,
whether you've gained weight
because you ditched your diet
because you take certain meds
because you stopped working out
because you gave birth
because you've been eating more
because your body is naturally changing
because you're healing a disordered relationship
with your body and yourself
because you've healed from a disease
or a painful injury
because you just did.
Yes, simply, you just did.
Whatever the reason,
it doesn't matter.
Take a walk.
Take a break.
Pause.
Breathe.
Pay attention to your legs
as they carry you along the street.
Feel the balmy breeze
of spring against your skin.
Listen to the bits of dialogue
traveling through the air.
Listen to the
birds singing,
kids laughing,
cars honking.
Feel your feet hit the ground
and touch the earth.
And remember,
you are no failure,
no wrong-doer
no judge.
You are a person.
A person whose body
deserves acceptance
kindness,
and thanks.
A person who deserves
to wear whatever you like
and participate in
whatever activities
make you feel alive.
A person who deserves
to nourish your needs,
wants and wishes.
A person who deserves
to smile at yourself.
A person who deserves
compassion
care
respect
and love.
Because no matter
what the voices
or messages may say
The scale is
no barometer
no measure
of any,
any of that.
On Monday a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Reps. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) and Ted Poe (R-Texas) that would end the current policy that requires gun dealers to report information about the race and ethnicity of people who buy firearms.
The Freedom From Intrusive Regulatory Enforcement of Arbitrary Registration Mandates (FIREARM) Act would block the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) from collecting racial data for gun transactions. The bill was originally introduced in the last congress by Rep. Black but did not go anywhere. Supporters of the bill are hopeful the legislation will have better luck in a congress controlled by Republicans.
The bill is only two pages long and does not mince words. The opening states:
A Bill to prohibit the Federal Government from requiring race or ethnicity to be disclosed in connection with the transfer of a firearm.
The requirement to document race and ethnicity is a fairly new change. The Hill reports how these changes came about and the penalties that could be levied for non-compliance.
The ATF made changes to Form 4473 in 2012, requiring gun dealers to submit information about the race and ethnicity of their customers. Gun dealers that fail to comply with the new requirements could face penalties from the ATF, the lawmakers say. Sen. Roy Blunt last fall criticized the controversial policy in a letter to then ATF Director Todd Jones and asked whether the information about a person's race has ever been used to block someone from purchasing a gun. “The constitutional right of a citizen to own a firearm has nothing to do with race or ethnicity,” Blunt wrote at the time. “It is disconcerting that the U.S. government is gathering this type of data on citizens when there is no connection between purchasing a firearm and an individual's race or ethnicity.”
The FIREARM Act is a breath of fresh air. It's hard to imagine anyone openly criticizing this bill, but proponents for government surveillance programs are probably moving behind the scenes to prevent this legislation from gaining steam and coming to a vote.
Government is full of people who cry out for political correctness and many of these same people support the requirement to disclose race to buy a gun. They may not openly support mandating documentation of race for all gun buys, but you won't see people on politically correct cable news shows campaigning for this bill to become law. These PC policemen either do not see the blatant hypocrisy in their ways or they believe the documenting of race is another essential tool to be used by the surveillance state and is a necessary evil utilized to keep the public “safe.”
Sane individuals understand that it is racist to force individuals to document their race in order to buy a gun, not to mention unconstitutional as well. If this information is provided by individuals voluntarily, then that's a different story. For example, if a gun dealer were to require customers to provide their race in order to purchase firearms, then customers would have the option of taking their business elsewhere. When a coercivegovernment mandates this behavior, then it can only be defined as institutionalized racism.

The victory of President-Elect Donald Trump has sent shock waves through Europe as populist parties in Austria and Germany celebrate – while the establishment is far less enthusiastic.
The historic victory for President-Elect Donald Trump in the United States presidential election is being felt globally, but especially in countries most impacted by the migrant crisis like Germany and Austria.
The rising forces of populism and anti-mass migration in the form of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) have celebrated and welcomed the result while the establishment parties and political figures are “hardly thrilled”, reports Kronen Zeitung.
Leader of the FPÖ, and who may become the next Austrian Chancellor if recent polling numbers hold, Heinz-Christian Strache (pictured above right) congratulated Mr. Trump on his election result. Mr. Strache remarked:”The political left and the lofty establishment have been punished by the voters,” adding that the turn to the right has happened because the right represents the voice of the people.
The FPÖ leader also attacked the Austrian media saying: “Various Austrian mainstream media and journalists, who for weeks have come out against Trump and already declared Clinton the winner in the run-up, were once again embarrassed by the voters.”
In Germany, the leader of the AfD, Frauke Petry (pictured above left), took to Twitter to express her opinion on the U.S. presidential election results. “Congratulations to the future President of the United States of America, Donald Trump,” she wrote and posted a picture of Trump with the words: “This night changes the USA, Europe and the world!”
She followed up later tweeting: “Americans have chosen a new beginning free of corruption and sleaze. This is a historic chance.”
The reactions from establishment politicians in the two German-speaking countries were far from enthusiastic. Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern spoke in a somber tone saying: “This is an outcome which certainly few expected. Congratulations to Donald Trump for his victory in the U.S. presidential election,” but then went on to warn: “From the outcome of this election we will have lessons for upcoming elections in Europe.”
Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who has over past months warmed to many of the tougher migrant policies of Strache's FPÖ, called for calm. “An American president, even if he is very powerful, is not the sole ruler,” he said.
Mr. Kurz said, like many others have, that the presidential election reminded him of the Brexit vote in June. “It remains to be seen which of the announcements from the election campaign Donald Trump as American President will take up and implement,” he added.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, congratulated Mr. Trump but reminded him that, according to her, he has a responsibility to defend Western cultural values, combat global terrorism, and aid in global economic development.
The migrant policies of Ms. Merkel have been heavily criticised by both Trump and FPÖ leader Strache who recently referred to her as “the most dangerous woman in Europe”.
A recent CBS News poll found that the single issue that white evangelicals most believed they should be involved in was fighting poverty. The traditional issue of abortion was a distant second, and genocide was third.
Look, I don't agree with evangelicals on theology or on their typically conservative views on taxes, health care or Iraq. Self-righteous zealots like Pat Robertson have been a plague upon our country, and their initial smugness about AIDS (which Jerry Falwell described as “God's judgment against promiscuity”) constituted far grosser immorality than anything that ever happened in a bathhouse. Moralizing blowhards showed more compassion for embryonic stem cells than for the poor or the sick, and as recently as the 1990s, evangelicals were mostly a constituency against foreign aid.
Photo
Yet that has turned almost 180 degrees. Today, many evangelicals are powerful internationalists and humanitarians — and liberals haven't awakened to the transformation. The new face of evangelicals is somebody like the Rev. Rick Warren, the California pastor who wrote “The Purpose Driven Life.”
Mr. Warren acknowledges that for most of his life he wasn't much concerned with issues of poverty or disease. But on a visit to South Africa in 2003, he came across a tiny church operating from a dilapidated tent — yet sheltering 25 children orphaned by AIDS.
“I realized they were doing more for the poor than my entire megachurch,” Mr. Warren said, with cheerful exaggeration. “It was like a knife in the heart.” So Mr. Warren mobilized his vast Saddleback Church to fight AIDS, malaria and poverty in 68 countries. Since then, more than 7,500 members of his church have paid their own way to volunteer in poor countries — and once they see the poverty, they immediately want to do more.

“Almost all of my work is in the third world,” Mr. Warren said. “I couldn't care less about politics, the culture wars. My only interest is to get people to care about Darfurs and Rwandas.”
Helene Gayle, the head of CARE, said evangelicals “have made some incredible contributions” in the struggle against global poverty. “We don't give them credit for the changes they've made,” she added. Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense, said, “Many evangelical leaders have been key to taking the climate issue across the cultural divide.”
It's certainly fair to criticize Catholic leaders and other conservative Christians for their hostility toward condoms, a policy that has gravely undermined the fight against AIDS in Africa. But while robust criticism is fair, scorn is not.
In parts of Africa where bandits and warlords shoot or rape anything that moves, you often find that the only groups still operating are Doctors Without Borders and religious aid workers: crazy doctors and crazy Christians. In the town of Rutshuru in war-ravaged Congo, I found starving children, raped widows and shellshocked survivors. And there was a determined Catholic nun from Poland, serenely running a church clinic.

Unlike the religious right windbags, she was passionately “pro-life” even for those already born — and brave souls like her are increasingly representative of religious conservatives. We can disagree sharply with their politics, but to mock them underscores our own ignorance and prejudice.
Kris Olsson believes the advice he received from Arsenal's first-team midfielders on the Asia tour will have long-term benefits for him.
The 18-year-old was one of a host of young players selected by Arsene Wenger to travel on the pre-season trip to Indonesia, Vietnam and Japan.
Olsson enjoyed his first visit abroad with the senior squad and was thankful for the help he was given by one player in particular.
"You go away and you see the star players and how the fans scream their name. You want to hear your name being sung like that one day" Kris Olsson
“Tomas Rosicky gives me a lot of advice in training and in matches as well,” Olsson told Arsenal.com. “It all helps - Arteta and Wilshere helped me too. They have played at the top level for a long time so they have experience I can learn from.
“The tour was a really good experience. It was different as it was the first time I have travelled with the first team. You go away and you see the star players and how the fans scream their name. You want to hear your name being sung like that one day.
“You see them in training every day. You see how they are off the pitch as well - they are professional and you know that they are good players as well."
Olsson feels going on tour has enhanced his self-belief but acknowledges that he may have to bide his time for another opportunity in the first team.
“I'll take it day by day and then see how close I am to the first team,” he added. “Maybe I'll go on loan but I might stay here to see how it goes and then perhaps go on loan in the winter.
“My confidence is higher on the pitch now. The other guys know that you've been with the first team so if you want the ball, you get it. As a midfielder, that helps you become a better player.”
Nicola Sturgeon, Pat Kane and Elaine C Smith will join the board chaired by Dennis Canavan.

The eight members of the board who will lead the campaign group for Scottish independence have been announced.
The advisory board for Yes Scotland will be chaired by former MP Dennis Canavan, whose appointment was announced last week.
He will be joined by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, property developer Dan Macdonald, solicitor Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, actress Elaine C Smith, socialist politician and former MSP Colin Fox, musician Pat Kane, businesswoman Sarah-Jane Walls and restaurateur Andrew Fairlie.
Sir George Mathewson, former chairman of The Royal Bank of Scotland, is taking up the role of honorary vice-president of Yes Scotland.
Although he will not sit on the board, Sir George will be available to offer advice and guidance.
Yes Scotland was launched with a high-profile event in May, bringing together pro-independence politicians and supporters, including famous faces such as actors Brian Cox and Alan Cumming.
The opposing No campaign held its launch a few weeks later, with former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling heading up the Better Together group.
Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: "This advisory board brings a rich diversity of experience, knowledge and skills to what will be the biggest campaign of its kind ever launched in this country.
"This is a broad church of opinions, ideas and visions, but with one shared goal — to deliver an independent Scotland.
"The advisory board will help to shape the tone and content of the Yes Scotland campaign, and make sure we present a strong and confident case for independence."
Mr Jenkins said that other board members could be added as the campaign goes on.
He hoped this would include a representative from the Scottish Green Party after its conference in October.
The party announced last month that it was delaying signing up to the Yes Scotland group until a formal decision was taken by its members.
There will also be a Yes Scotland advisory council of local and regional representatives of the campaign from all over Scotland.

Dennaton Games, the developers of the audaciously brutal indie Hotline Miami, has recently announced that a sequel to their cult hit title is in the works for a release later this year.
Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number will keep the same gritty, blood-soaked gameplay while incorporating a variety of new characters and weapons–yet it will retain the carnage-inducing mechanics that have made it a memorable title. The sequel takes gamers even farther into the dark underground world of psychotic crime, telling a brand-new tale that's infused with horror, deceit, treachery and sinister malcontent, keeping the traditional vibes and bizarre style associated with Dennaton's original release.
Wrong Number will continue the original story arc set into place by the previous Hotline Miami, featuring a dynamic plot that spawned from the crazed destruction of the first game. The criminal underground has split into various factions, each of which vie for control, and players will take control of several new characters to unleash total chaos with a barrage of new weapons, fueled by frenzied bloodlust and the will to survive.
Below you can find an official description of Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, as well as a gallery of newly released screenshots. Dennaton has also released an official teaser trailer for their upcoming sequel that paints a picture of complete blood-strewn havoc–but we wouldn't have it any other way.
“A brutal conclusion to the gruesome saga, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number follows the escalating level of violence through multiple factions born from the events of the original game and driven by uncertain motivations.
Step into the murderous mind of several distinct characters – each with their own motivations and methods of execution — as storylines intersect and reality slips away into a haze of neon and carnage.
Blistering combat, an unmistakable visual style, and a powerfully intense soundtrack will once again push you to the limit and questioning your own thirst for blood.”
The sequel will also feature a new and improved soundtrack to fuel the chaotic bloodsport that takes place during the game, and Wrong Number will feature the same overhead view and original mechanics that were employed in the original Hotline Miami.
Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is currently scheduled for a release sometime in 2013 for PC and Mac–and maybe Linux. For more information please visit the game's official website.
Stephen Lynch agrees that the twenty-eight pages were buried in order to preserve the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. “Part of the reason it was classified was the fact that it would create a visceral response,” he told me. “There would be a backlash.” But, thirteen years later, is that still a reason to keep the document a secret?
Zelikow and his staff were ultimately unable to prove any official Saudi complicity in the attacks. A former staff member of the 9/11 Commission who is intimately familiar with the material in the twenty-eight pages recommends against their declassification, warning that the release of inflammatory and speculative information could “ramp up passions” and damage U.S.-Saudi relations.
Those advocating declassification present a powerful and oftentimes emotional argument, but others offer compelling reasons that the document should remain buried under the Capitol. Immediately after the Joint Congressional Inquiry finished its report, in late 2002, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States—better known as the 9/11 Commission—began its work, under the leadership of Thomas Kean, the former governor of New Jersey, and Lee Hamilton, a former congressman from Indiana. The questions raised by the twenty-eight pages were an important part of the commission's agenda; indeed, its director, Philip Zelikow, hired staffers who had worked for the Joint Inquiry on that very section to follow up on the material. According to Zelikow, what they found does not substantiate the arguments made by the Joint Inquiry and by the 9/11 families in the lawsuit against the Saudis. He characterized the twenty-eight pages as “an agglomeration of preliminary, unvetted reports” concerning Saudi involvement. “They were wild accusations that needed to be checked out,” he said.
The effort to declassify the document comes at a time when a lawsuit, brought ten years ago on behalf of the victims of the attacks and their families, along with the insurers who paid out claims, is advancing through the American court system. The suit targets Saudi charities, banks, and individuals. In 2005, the government of Saudi Arabia was dismissed from the suit on the ground of sovereign immunity, but in July the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the Kingdom as a defendant. The plaintiffs believe that the withheld twenty-eight pages will support their allegation that the 9/11 hijackers received direct assistance from Saudi government officials in the United States. According to representatives of the families of 9/11 victims, President Obama has twice promised to release the material but so far has failed to do so. “The redaction of the twenty-eight pages has become a coverup by two Presidents, and coverup implies complicity,” Sharon Premoli, who is co-chair of 9/11 Families United for Justice Against Terrorism, said. “The families and survivors have the right to know the whole truth about the brutal murder of three thousand loved ones and the injuries of thousands more.”
The Saudis have also publicly demanded that the material be released. “Twenty-eight blanked-out pages are being used by some to malign our country and our people,” Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who was the Saudi Ambassador to the United States at the time of the 9/11 attacks, has declared. “Saudi Arabia has nothing to hide. We can deal with questions in public, but we cannot respond to blank pages.”
“There's nothing in it about national security,” Walter Jones, a Republican congressman from North Carolina who has read the missing pages, contends. “It's about the Bush Administration and its relationship with the Saudis.” Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat, told me that the document is “stunning in its clarity,” and that it offers direct evidence of complicity on the part of certain Saudi individuals and entities in Al Qaeda's attack on America. “Those twenty-eight pages tell a story that has been completely removed from the 9/11 Report,” Lynch maintains. Another congressman who has read the document said that the evidence of Saudi government support for the 9/11 hijacking is “very disturbing,” and that “the real question is whether it was sanctioned at the royal-family level or beneath that, and whether these leads were followed through.” Now, in a rare example of bipartisanship, Jones and Lynch have co-sponsored a resolution requesting that the Obama Administration declassify the pages.
On the bottom floor of the United States Capitol's new underground visitors' center, there is a secure room where the House Intelligence Committee maintains highly classified files. One of those files is titled “Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters.” It is twenty-eight pages long. In 2002, the Administration of George W. Bush excised those pages from the report of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks. President Bush said then that publication of that section of the report would damage American intelligence operations, revealing “sources and methods that would make it harder for us to win the war on terror.”
The theory behind the lawsuit against the Saudis goes back to the 1991 Gulf War. The presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia was a shattering event in the country's history, calling into question the ancient bargain between the royal family and the Wahhabi clerics, whose blessing allows the Saud family to rule. In 1992, a group of the country's most prominent religious leaders issued the Memorandum of Advice, which implicitly threatened a clerical coup. The royal family, shaken by the threat to its rule, accommodated most of the clerics' demands, giving them more control over Saudi society. One of their directives called for the creation of a Ministry of Islamic Affairs, which would be given offices in Saudi embassies and consulates. As the journalist Philip Shenon writes, citing John Lehman, the former Secretary of the Navy and a 9/11 commissioner, “it was well-known in intelligence circles that the Islamic affairs office functioned as the Saudis' ‘fifth column' in support of Muslim extremists.”
The story told in those twenty-eight pages picks up with the arrival of two young Saudis, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, in Los Angeles in January, 2000. They were the first wave of the 9/11 hijackers. Neither spoke English well, so their mission—to learn how to pilot a Boeing jetliner—seemed crazily improbable, especially if they had no assistance.
Two weeks after Hazmi and Mihdhar got to L.A., a benefactor suddenly appeared. Omar al-Bayoumi, a forty-two-year-old Saudi national, was an employee of the Saudi aviation-services company Dallah Avco. Although he drew a salary, he apparently never did any actual work for the company during the seven years he spent in America. Bayoumi was in frequent contact with the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., and with the consulate in Los Angeles; he was widely considered in the Arab expat community to be a Saudi spy, though the Saudi government has denied that he was.
Bayoumi and a friend drove from San Diego, where they lived, to L.A. Bayoumi then went to the Saudi consulate, where he spent about an hour meeting with an official in the Ministry of Islamic Affairs named Fahad al-Thumairy, whom he considered to be his spiritual adviser. (In 2002, Thumairy was stripped of his diplomatic visa and deported, because of suspected ties to terrorists.) Afterward, Bayoumi and his friend drove to a halal restaurant in Culver City. Bayoumi later told investigators that, while eating there, he happened to overhear two men—Hazmi and Mihdhar—speaking Arabic with Gulf accents. He struck up a conversation with them and soon invited them to move to San Diego. He set them up in the same apartment complex where he lived. Because the hijackers-in-training did not have a checking account, Bayoumi paid their security deposit and first month's rent (for which they immediately reimbursed him). He also introduced them to members of the Arab community, possibly including the imam of a local mosque, Anwar al-Awlaki—later to become the most prominent spokesperson for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
Another Saudi who was in San Diego at the time, Osama Basnan, also befriended Hazmi and Mihdhar. As it happened, Basnan's wife was receiving charitable gifts from Prince Bandar's wife, Princess Haifa. The payments—as much as seventy-three thousand dollars over a period of three years—were supposed to fund the treatment of a medical condition that Basnan's wife suffered from. According to pleadings in the lawsuit against the Saudis, some of that money went to support the hijackers in San Diego. The F.B.I. has not found any evidence that the money got into the hands of the hijackers, however, and the 9/11 Commission found no links to the royal family.
“We assert that purported ‘charities,' established by the government of the Kingdom to propagate radical Wahhabi ideology throughout the world, served as the primary sources of funding and logistical support for Al Qaeda for more than a decade leading up to the 9/11 attacks,” Sean Carter, one of the lead attorneys in the lawsuit, told me. “Not coincidentally, these so-called charities were themselves regulated by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, which from its formation, in 1993, assumed primary responsibility for the Kingdom's efforts to spread Wahhabi Islam.”
Thomas Kean remembers finally having the opportunity to read those twenty-eight pages after he became chairman of the 9/11 Commission—“so secret that I had to get all of my security clearances and go into the bowels of Congress with someone looking over my shoulder.” He also remembers thinking at the time that most of what he was reading should never have been kept secret. But the focus on the twenty-eight pages obscures the fact that many important documents are still classified—“a ton of stuff,” Kean told me, including, for instance, the 9/11 Commission's interviews with George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Bill Clinton. “I don't know of a single thing in our report that should not be public after ten years,” Kean said.
September 11th may be a part of history now, but some of the events that led to that horrible day remain veiled by the political considerations of the present. The intelligence community doesn't want to light up its failures once again, and no doubt the Obama Administration doesn't want to introduce additional strains on its relationship with the Saudis. In the meantime, the forces that led to catastrophe before are gathering strength once again. Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman from Kentucky and a sponsor of the House resolution to declassify the material, told me that the experience of reading those twenty-eight pages caused him to rethink how to handle the rise of ISIS. It has made him much more cautious about a military response. “We have to be careful, when we run the calculations of action, what the repercussions will be,” he said.
“In some ways, it's more dangerous today,” Timothy Roemer, who was a member of both the Joint Inquiry and the 9/11 Commission, observed. “A more complex series of threats are coming together than even before 9/11, involving ISIS, Al Qaeda, and cyber-terrorist capabilities. The more the American people know about what happened thirteen years ago, the more we can have a credible, open debate” about our security needs. Releasing the twenty-eight pages, he said, might be a step forward. “Hopefully, after some initial shock and awe, it would make our process work better. Our government has an obligation to do this.”
(Zero Hedge) – Women's college loses it when Hillary Clinton loses election.
When Republican Donald Trump was elected president last week, the intelligent, determined young women of Converse College – along with their esteemed instructors – lost their minds.
They posted video of themselves crying on Snapchat. They walked around campus in tears, and the administration set up “safe zones” where students weren't allowed to discuss the election results.
One of my professors pushed back a midterm “given recent upsetting events,” and students planned to organize “silent protests” on Thursday.
URGENT: Stop Obama – America's Presidential maniac from screwing over America and stealing our victory on his way out the door!
If this sounds like the typical college reaction to Trump's victory, there's a twist: Converse is a women's liberal arts college.
From President Krista Newkirk on down, the Converse community invested a huge part of its identity in Democrat Hillary Clinton shattering the last remaining glass ceiling in America.
The only acceptable sentiments to express since Wednesday have been grief and outrage. Feelings are so raw that the few contrarians on campus have become targets.
One student even claims she got kicked out of class after she challenged her professor's comparison of Trump's election to the September 11 terrorist attacks.
‘Never been so disgusted in my life'
Before she was ejected from class by her professor, the student wrote a Facebook post scolding those who were “comparing 11/9 to 9/11”:
You are comparing today to a day that killed thousands of people in MY HOME. You are disrespectful, you are unintelligent and you should think before you post things on social media. I am disgusted.
That comparison continued in the student's class, she said. (The student requested anonymity to share her story, so The College Fix is not naming the professor either.)
The professor told the class “I haven't felt this way since 9/11” and called Nov. 9 the second worst day in American history, according to the student. That spurred her to disagree and tell her professor it was disrespectful to those who lost their lives on 9/11.
“I went to her class and got kicked out for expressing my opinion,” the student said. She asked to meet with the dean of the department, who told her the issue would be “rectified in a professional and acceptable manner,” according to the student.
“I have never been so disgusted in my life,” the student told The Fix.
‘All I ask is as I respect them they also respect me'
The principles that Converse stands by are Voice. Value. Vision. With fewer than 1,400 students, the school emphasizes community involvement and sisterhood.
In the wake of Trump's election, civility and sisterhood were thrown out the window.
“I am sad that once again our young girls and women have failed to see the shattering of that glass ceiling and the first female president of the United States,” President Newkirk wrote to the student body. She said it wasn't a “partisan statement.”
Mourning the still-remaining glass ceiling, Converse students took to social media to express their devastation at the election of the “sexist” Trump. Those who weren't devastated have borne the brunt of that sentiment.
“Students have been un-friending one another on Facebook based on political views and responses” since the election, student Heather Jane Clare Hiley told The Fix.
Kathleen Price didn't like either major-party candidate, “but for me, Trump seemed the better of the two” because his “policies lined up with my beliefs and that's why I voted for him.”
She told The Fix she's afraid of sharing her views on campus or even online.
“I have been quiet about my views for fear of being bashed and not wanted at Converse like some of my friends have been, and many of my fellow sisters have been bashed because of what they believe in or who they voted for,” Price said. “All I ask is as I respect them they also respect me.”
“I think there has been a change on campus, if only a slight one,” another student who requested anonymity told The Fix. “The emotions this election has drudged up are entirely valid and it's hard pressed to compare the level of fear and disdain in our nation today as just another presidential election.”
‘We do not tolerate intimidation'
The tension and unrest in the student body was not lost on Converse administrators.
“The election has caused a lot of stress on our student body over the past 48 hours,” the Division of Student Development and Success wrote in a letter to the student body.
It organized an “Election Aftermath Program” that divided “each school of thought into different rooms to talk about fears, hopes, and where to go from here.”
The division also warned students: “We do not tolerate intimidation or bullying for a difference of opinions – regardless of your partisanship.” It did not specify what it considers intimidation or bullying.
It also sent out worksheets instructing students on “ways to cope with election stress,” which included tips like “Limit political debate and argument” and “Unplug from social media.”

Chohreh Feyzdjou was an outsider (or felt like one) all her life. She was the child of secular Jewish parents in Tehran — her family name, changed by her father, was Cohen — and educated in Muslim schools. She converted to Islam to marry, was soon divorced and dived headlong into Sufism, then kabbalah. In 1975, she moved to Paris, where she concentrated on painting until she encountered the archive-based installation art of Christian Boltanski. She spent the last few years of her life — she died of a hereditary blood disease — recycling her work in room-filling ensembles of empty stretchers, packing crates and rolled-up paintings, all covered with black-brown walnut stain.
One such installation has been reconstructed at the Grey. You can see Mr. Boltanski's influence in the insistent gloom, which would look blankly generic were it not for Ms. Feyzdjou's personal touches: drawings in notebooks, identifying labels attached to objects like baggage tags and a purple neon sign reading “Product of Chohreh Feyzdjou.” The sign feels like a joke about art and consumerism; this artist once filled a Paris storefront with funky stained things and called it a boutique. But there's no mistaking the emotional weight of this tomblike self-archive and of the time-haunted politics of experience that it reflects.
Interestingly, the art made by the show's younger artists, Ms. Ahamadi and Mr. Pouyan, while far more political in a literal sense, is much lighter and less personal in tone. Unlike Ms. Feyzdjou, who played down ethnic particulars in her art, both artists spin variations on a specifically Persian style of miniature painting. With references to the royal epic the “Shahnama,” or “Book of Kings,” Ms. Ahmadi depicts blood-oozing court rituals presided over by faceless rulers and bomb-wielding apes. Mr. Pouyan makes digital copies of historical miniatures and edits out the figures, altering history through elimination.
Guy Fawkes burns in effigy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Guy_Fawkes_effigy_by_William_Warby_from_Flickr.jpg
Four hundred and eight years ago, a Catholic plot to blow up the British Houses of Lords and with it the King of England failed completely.
Although a non-event, the attempted bombing had a huge legacy. There was the historical impact, with King James I using it as an excuse to crack down on England's non-conforming Catholics and lay the foundations of a unified British state. There was the cultural impact, with Nov. 5 celebrated ever since with fires and fireworks as Bonfire Night or, in tribute to the plotter caught red-handed, as Guy Fawkes Night. There is a significant linguistic legacy too: the creation of the word "guy."
The word "guy," as used today to indicate a "man, fellow, person, individual, creature," didn't exist in 1605. In fact, even the name Guy, a name with Norman French origins given to poor Guy Fawkes by his parents in 1570, was relatively rare in England at the time, according to the book "Remember, Remember" by James Sharpe— "Guy" himself had actually given up the name in 1603 and went by the name "Guido" instead.
With the arrest of Guy Fawkes shortly after midnight Nov. 5, 1605 (a tip-off to a Catholic member of parliament led to an inspection of the cellars under parliament), however, it soon became an infamous name.
Fawkes originally gave his captors the name "John Johnson," but after a couple of days of horrific torture in the Tower of London, he gave himself and his co-conspirators up. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered, with his remains sent to the four corners of the kingdom as a warning to future plotters.
What's more, Nov. 5 was immediately established as a day of celebration, and while little is known about how exactly it was celebrated then, it gradually evolved into a nationalistic night of fireworks and bonfires, with effigies of Catholic figures such as Fawkes and even the Pope set alight.
Because of this tradition, the word "guy" began to be used in England to mean "effigy" and later came to be used in a pejorative sense to describe a man ("he's a bad guy") or a usually a "weirdly dressed person," according to Parliament's history of Guy Fawkes Night.
At some point it spread to the United States, where, perhaps due to the lack of context, it began to be used in a wide variety of ways, not all negative. That American English usage later returned to the United Kingdom, where it became common to use it to mean "man" or "person."
Indeed, the evolution of the word continues today as people debate whether you can call a group that includes females "guys" or even if you can call an individual woman a "guy."
While the word "guy" has changed, so has the reputation of Guy Fawkes, from a minor player in a Catholic plot, to a symbol of terrorism, to a strange figure in a British celebration, to — following the iconic portrayal of a futuristic Guy Fawkes in the comic book "V For Vendetta" — a global symbol of protest and anonymity.
It revealed that the plan to take over the franchise is now so advanced that it has been given its own codename and a potential interim managing director has been identified.
The Government insisted on Wednesday night that there are “no plans” to strip Govia of the franchise and said the claims were “pure speculation”.
However The Telegraph understands that the options have been drawn up for ministers and will be considered if Southern is found to have breached its contract.
Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, last year refused to rule out stripping Govia of its franchise. Asked on BBC Radio 4 whether Southern could lose its licence, he replied: “Look there are a variety of things we need to think through and I am not going to set out options.”
In 2009 the Government stepped in to take over the East Coast franchise after refusing to give National Express further financial support. It was subsequently passed to Virgin Trains East Coast in March 2015.
Under the terms of the Government's seven-year deal with Govia Thameslink, ministers agreed to bear the financial risk of running the railway because of the significant disruption caused by the redevelopment of London Bridge railway station.
The company is paid more than £1billion a year to run the service and the taxpayer funds the cost of compensating passengers for delays and cancellations. Income from ticket sales is passed directly to the Government.
The terms of the deal mean that the financial costs of industrial action are borne almost entirely by the taxpayer, totaling £53million in lost fare revenue and compensation for passengers over the past year.
It comes as the Government is under growing pressure from Conservative MPs to introduce tougher anti-strike laws to protect commuters.
Sharpeville massacre The row of graves of the 69 people killed by police at the Sharpeville Police Station on 21 March 1960. Location Sharpeville, South Africa Date 21 March 1960 ; 58 years ago ( ) Deaths 69 Non-fatal injuries 180 Victims Unarmed Protestors Assailants South African Police
The Sharpeville massacre was an event which occurred on 21 March 1960, at the police station in the South African township of Sharpeville in Transvaal (today part of Gauteng).
After a day of demonstrations against pass laws, a crowd of about 5,000 to 7,000 protesters went to the police station. The South African Police opened fire on the crowd, killing 69 people and injuring 180 others. Sources disagree as to the behaviour of the crowd; some state that the crowd was peaceful, while others state that the crowd had been hurling stones at the police, and that the shooting started when the crowd started advancing toward the fence around the police station. There were 249 casualties in total, including 29 children. Many sustained back injuries from being shot as they fled.[1]
The massacre was photographed by photographer Ian Berry, who initially believed the police were firing blanks.[2] In present-day South Africa, 21 March is celebrated as a public holiday in honour of human rights and to commemorate the Sharpeville massacre.
Preceding events [ edit ]
Demonstrators discarding their passbooks to protest apartheid, 1960
South African governments since the eighteenth century had enacted measures to restrict the flow of black South Africans into cities. Pass laws intended to control and direct their movement and employment were updated in the 1950s. Under the country's National Party government, black residents in urban districts were subject to influx control measures. Individuals over sixteen were required to carry passbooks, which contained an identity card, employment and influx authorisation from a labour bureau, name of employer and address, and details of personal history.[3] Leading up to the Sharpeville massacre, the National Party administration under the leadership of Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd used these laws to enforce greater racial segregation[4] and, in 1959-1960, extended them to include women.[5]:pp.14,528 From the 1960s, the pass laws were the primary instrument used by the state to detain and harass its political opponents.[5]:p.163
The African National Congress (ANC) prepared to initiate a campaign of protests against pass laws. These protests were to begin on 31 March 1960, but the rival Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), led by Robert Sobukwe, decided to pre-empt the ANC by launching its own campaign ten days earlier, on 21 March, because they believed that the ANC could not win the campaign.[6][7]
Massacre [ edit ]
On March 21, a group of between 5,000 and 10,000 people converged on the local police station in the township of Sharpeville, offering themselves up for arrest for not carrying their passbooks.[8] The Sharpeville police were not completely unprepared for the demonstration, as they had already been forced to drive smaller groups of more militant activists away the previous night.[9]
Many of the civilians present attended to support the protest, but there is evidence that the PAC also used intimidating means to draw the crowd there, including the cutting of telephone lines into Sharpeville, the distribution of pamphlets telling people not to go to work on the day, and coercion of bus drivers and commuters.[5]:p.534
By 10:00, a large crowd had gathered, and the atmosphere was initially peaceful and festive. Fewer than 20 police officers were present in the station at the start of the protest. Later the crowd grew to about 20,000,[4] and the mood was described as "ugly",[4] prompting about 130 police reinforcements, supported by four Saracen armoured personnel carriers, to be rushed in. The police were armed with firearms, including Sten submachine guns and Lee–Enfield rifles. There was no evidence that anyone in the gathering was armed with anything other than rocks.[4]
F-86 Sabre jets and Harvard Trainers approached to within a hundred feet of the ground, flying low over the crowd in an attempt to scatter it. The protesters responded by hurling stones (striking three policemen) and menacing the police barricades. Tear gas proved ineffectual, and policemen elected to repel these advances with their batons.[9] At about 13:00 the police tried to arrest a protestor, resulting in a scuffle, and the crowd surged forward.[4] The shooting began shortly thereafter.[4]
Death and injury toll [ edit ]
The official figure is that 69 people were killed, including 8 women and 10 children, and 180 injured, including 31 women and 19 children. Many were shot in the back as they turned to flee, causing some to be paralyzed.[1]
Pretext for firing [ edit ]
Police reports in 1960 claimed that young and inexperienced police officers panicked and opened fire spontaneously, setting off a chain reaction that lasted about forty seconds. It is likely that the police were nervous as two months before the massacre, nine constables had been assaulted and killed, some disembowelled, during a raid at Cato Manor.[9] In addition, few of the policemen present had received public order training. Some of them had been on duty for over twenty-four hours without respite.[9] Lieutenant Colonel Pienaar, the commanding officer of the police reinforcements at Sharpeville, said in his revealing statement that "the native mentality does not allow them to gather for a peaceful demonstration. For them to gather means violence."[1] He also denied giving any order to fire and stated that he would not have done so.
Other evidence given to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 38 years later in 1998 by two of the victims claimed "a degree of deliberation in the decision to open fire".[5]:p.537
Response [ edit ]
Painting depicting victims of the massacre
The uproar among South Africa's black population was immediate, and the following week saw demonstrations, protest marches, strikes, and riots around the country. On 30 March 1960, the government declared a state of emergency, detaining more than 18,000 people, including prominent anti-apartheid activists who were known as members of the Congress Alliance.[citation needed]
A storm of international protest followed the Sharpeville shootings, including sympathetic demonstrations in many countries[10][11] and condemnation by the United Nations. On 1 April 1960, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 134. Sharpeville marked a turning point in South Africa's history; the country found itself increasingly isolated in the international community. The event also played a role in South Africa's departure from the Commonwealth of Nations in 1961.[citation needed]
The Sharpeville massacre contributed to the banning of the PAC and ANC as illegal organisations. The massacre was one of the catalysts for a shift from passive resistance to armed resistance by these organisations. The foundation of Poqo, the military wing of the PAC, and Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the ANC, followed shortly afterwards.[citation needed]
Not all reactions were negative: embroiled in the Civil Rights Movement, the Mississippi House of Representatives voted a resolution supporting the South African government "for its steadfast policy of segregation and the stanch adherence to their traditions in the face of overwhelming external agitation."[12][13]
Aftermath [ edit ]
Since 1994, 21 March has been commemorated as Human Rights Day in South Africa.[14]
Sharpeville was the site selected by President Nelson Mandela for the signing into law of the Constitution of South Africa on 10 December 1996.[citation needed]
In 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) found that the police actions constituted "gross human rights violations in that excessive force was unnecessarily used to stop a gathering of unarmed people."[5]:p.537
On 21 March 2002, the 42nd anniversary of the massacre, a memorial was opened by former President Nelson Mandela as part of the Sharpeville Human Rights Precinct.[15]
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination [ edit ]
UNESCO marks March 21 as the yearly International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the massacre.

The Real News Now
In April, writer Nay Phone Latt won the 2010 PEN/Barbara Goldsmith “Freedom to Write” award. The award honors world renowned literary figures. (Figures who have been persecuted and imprisoned for defending “freedom of expression”) Unfortunately, Nay Phone Latt was not there to receive the award. The Burmese poet and human rights advocate was in Mynamar, serving a 12-year prison sentence for distributing news and views via his blog.
This is a trend which has been spreading through the interweb quickly. While millions of bloggers all over the world update their sites frequently, there seems to be a team of shadow programmers out there tracking and logging everything they do, and also shutting some of them down in many cases. Now, many bloggers are even starting to be prosecuted.
Nay Phone Latt's case is a symbolic representation of a problem sweeping across the world. The war on bloggers and other social networkers started in the East and has now spread to the West. In Iran, Navid Mohebbi (18yr) was imprisoned. What did he do? He insulted Iran's leader on his blog. He is also an advocate for womens rights. The list of writers, journalists and bloggers in prison in Iran includes some of Iran's most distinguished journalists and bloggers. There are currently 47 journalists in prison in Iran.
Iran is not the only country these events have been taking place in. Egypt has also imprisoned prominent bloggers. Saudi Arabia's most popular blogger, Fouad al-Farhan, has been detained for questioning, an Interior Ministry spokesman confirmed. The Saudi government has waged an all-out battle against “Internet treason” for years. In Iraq, 33-year-old Dr. Hanan Al-Mashhadani was arrested, imprisoned and subjected to torture because of her writing on a blog. Her charges revolved around some comments she made about the countries “terrorism act.”
This happens all over the world on a daily basis. In November, Cuba's most prominent blogger was abducted by three men. “This arrest was made after our investigations showed that he did certain things which could cause unrest among the citizens of various races in this country.” The evidence strongly suggests that the harassment and persecution of bloggers is increasing all over the world.
A Texas blogger was recently jailed for failing to turn his computer over to a judge. The bloggers
grandmother claims her house was broken into and her computer was seized after the courts received a subpoena. The blogger was eventually jailed. A freelance journalist and blogger was jailed in August in California for refusing to turn over video he took at an anti-capitalist protest last summer and after refusing to testify before a grand jury looking into accusations that crimes were committed at the protest.
The list goes on and on and on. In some countries now they just throw away the jail key. Totalitarian, Authoritarian governments will always try to censor the real news. Don't let them. (Live like your free)

Activism in The Age of Tyranny and Terror
"I'm a rabid libertarian," says Greg Glassman, 56-year old founder of the worldwide fitness phenomenon called CrossFit.
Glassman opened the first CrossFit gym (or "box" in CrossFit lingo) in the mid-1990s in Santa Cruz, California. Today, there are more than 7,000 CrossFit affiliates around the world. These affiliates are not franchises, they're independently operated boxes owned by entrepreneurs who pay $1,000 to get certified as a CrossFit trainer and then pay $500-$3000 annually for the right to use the CrossFit brand. Each affiliate is free to innovate, which makes CrossFit a kind of open-source fitness community. Despite - or because of - its unconventional approach, CrossFit is projected to generate $100 million in revenue this year.
As independent in his exercising as he is in his politics, Glassman's relentless focus on results has created an army of athletes who have left conventional gyms for the allure of the "WOD" (CrossFit's "workout of the day").
Every day a new WOD is posted on the CrossFit website, and all around the world people compete against each other to complete a series of constantly varied, high intensity, functional movements (squats, sprints, pull-ups, dead lifts, and more). WODs aren't easy, and it's not uncommon for "CrossFitters" to vomit after a particularly difficult workout (they call it "meeting Pukie," Crossfit's puking clown mascot).
CrossFitting is not just about difficult competitive workouts, though. It's also about being a member of a supportive community. A Green Beret told Glassman that doing CrossFit helped him realize that the secret to developing the camaraderie necessary for special-forces units is to combine agony with laughter.
CrossFitters are also unconventional when it comes to diet. Instead of the grain-based dietary recommendations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, CrossFitters tend to eat a paleo-style diet heavy on meat and unprocessed foods. "Our view," says Glassman, "is that grains are best consumed by livestock, and what Homo sapiens need is a diet of meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar."
CrossFit is not without its critics. Many conventionally minded trainers believe that the intensity of CrossFit workouts increases the chances of injury. Others, noting the paleo diet, the functional movements and the extraordinary enthusiasm common among CrossFitters, liken CrossFit to a kind of caveman cult. Glassman's response? "The caveman thing? Yeah, I'll tell you what. I don't think it's an insult to any CrossFitter."
The 2013 CrossFit Games start today and culminate on Sunday, July 28, when the winners will be crowned. This year, around 140,000 athletes from around the globe entered the open competition. CrossFit fans can watch live streams of the event Monday-Thursday on the CrossFit games site. The games will be covered by ESPN3 and ESPN2 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Two people are dead after a Saturday early morning bar shooting in Wichita.
KAKE-TV reports that the shooting took place around 1:30 early Saturday morning at a bar called “The Place” in 4800 blocks of E. Harry. Police say when they arrived on scene they found three men in the parking lot with gunshot wounds. All three were transported to a local hospital. A fourth victim was taken to a hospital in a private vehicle. That man arrived with a chest wound.
About an hour after the shooting a 25-year-old man was pronounced dead. A second man died about five this morning. The names of the victims are not being released at this time. One victim was treated and released. One victim still remains in serious condition.
Police are still investigating what led up to the shooting. Anyone with information is being asked to call Crime Stoppers at 316-267-2111.
Ladies and gentlemen, it appears the long anticipated moment of peak mainstream media stupidity may have finally arrived.
This is what passes for journalism in America today.
The Intercept reports:
Sen. Rand Paul's expression of opposition to a $1.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia — which has been brutally bombing civilian targets in Yemen using U.S.-made weapons for more than a year now — alarmed CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday afternoon. Blitzer's concern: That stopping the sale could result in fewer jobs for arms manufacturers. “So for you this is a moral issue,” he told Paul during the Kentucky Republican's appearance on CNN. “Because you know, there are a lot of jobs at stake. Certainly if a lot of these defense contractors stop selling war planes, other sophisticated equipment to Saudi Arabia, there's gonna be a significant loss of jobs, of revenue here in the United States. That's secondary from your standpoint?” Paul stayed on message. “Well not only is it a moral question, its a Constitutional question,” Paul said. “Our founding fathers very directly and specifically did not give the president the power to go to war. They gave it to Congress. So Congress needs to step up and this is what I'm doing.” Saudi Arabia began bombing Yemen in March 2015, and has since been responsible for the majority of the 10,000 deaths in the war so far. The U.S.-backed bombing coalition has been accused of intentionally targeting civilians, hospitals, factories, markets, schools, and homes. The situation is so bad that the Red Cross has started donating morgue units to Yemeni hospitals. The Obama administration has sold more weapons to the Saudis than any other administration, pledging more than $115 billion worth of small arms, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft.
But hey, the Saudis aren't really that bad, right. No, they're just one of the most barbaric, inhumane terrorist supporting states on planet earth. Need some proof?
Here you go:

Whilst Usain Bolt and co have been tearing up the track it would appear producers and labels have eased off the gas, consequently leaving those of us who comment on electronic music as apposed to the latest Team GB gold a little short of musical inspiration, sorry Spice Girls, One Direction, Jessie J. However despite the closing ceremony's best efforts to mime us into oblivion we have managed to dig deep and find this little nugget.
Thefft is another in a long line of youthful producers who is already demonstrating finesse beyond his years. His combination of cavernous industrial techno stabs and floor friendly beats is every bit as infectious as a good melody or vocal hook. However this is not say that Thefft is simply following the herd when it comes to accessible techno, you only have to check his track ‘Right Here [No Longer Available]' to realise that he also has a good grasp of mesmerising vocal loops. We have no details on when and where these tracks will be dropping, all we can hope is that we are not left waiting so long we loose interest. Recommended.
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is one of the most influential artworks of all time and a foundational work of Renaissance Art. Painted directly on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, the masterpiece depicts key scenes from the Book of Genesis. The complex narratives and skillfully painted human figures stunned viewers when the painting was first unveiled to the public in 1512 and continues to impress the thousands of pilgrims and tourists from around the world who visit the chapel every day.
Below are seven essential facts about the Sistine Chapel ceiling and its creation.
1. The Paintings Were Commissioned by Pope Julius II
In 1508, Pope Julius II (also known as Giulio II and "Il papa terribile"), asked Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel's ceiling. Julius was determined that Rome should be rebuilt to its former glory, and had embarked on a vigorous campaign to achieve the ambitious task. He felt that such artistic splendor would not only add luster to his own name, but also serve to supersede anything that Pope Alexander VI (a Borgia, and Julius' rival) had accomplished.
2. Michelangelo Painted Over 5,000 Square Feet of Frescoes
The ceiling measures about 40 meters (131 feet) long by 13 meters (43 feet) wide. Although these numbers are rounded, they demonstrate the enormous scale of this nontraditional canvas. In fact, Michelangelo painted well over 5,000 square feet of frescoes.
3. The Panels Depict More Than Just Scenes From the Book of Genesis
The ceiling's well-known central panels depict scenes from the Book of Genesis, from the Creation to the Fall to shortly after Noah's deluge. Adjacent to each of these scenes on either side, however, are immense portraits of prophets and sibyls who foretold the coming of the Messiah. Along the bottoms of these run spandrels and lunettes containing the ancestors of Jesus and stories of tragedy in ancient Israel. Scattered throughout are smaller figures, cherubs and ignudi (nudes). All told, there are more than 300 painted figures on the ceiling.
4. Michelangelo Was a Sculptor, Not a Painter
Michelangelo thought of himself as a sculptor and preferred working with marble to almost any other material. Prior to the ceiling frescoes, the only painting he'd done was during his brief stint as a student in Ghirlandaio's workshop.
Julius, however, was adamant that Michelangelo —and no other— should paint the Chapel's ceiling. To convince him, Julius offered as a reward to Michelangelo the wildly lucrative commission of sculpting 40 massive figures for his tomb, a project that appealed much more to Michelangelo given his artistic style.
5. The Paintings Took Four Years to Finish
It took Michelangelo a little over four years, from July of 1508 to October of 1512, to finish the paintings. Michelangelo had never painted frescoes before and was learning the craft as he worked. What's more, he chose to work in buon fresco, the most difficult method, and one normally reserved for true masters. He also had to learn some wickedly hard techniques in perspective, namely painting figures on curved surfaces that appear "correct" when viewed from nearly 60 feet below.
The work suffered numerous other setbacks, including mold and miserable, damp weather that disallowed plaster curing. The project was further stalled when Julius left to wage war and again when he fell ill. The ceiling project, and any hope Michelangelo had of being paid, were frequently in jeopardy while Julius was absent or near death.
6. Michelangelo Didn't Really Paint Lying Down
Although the classic film "The Agony and the Ecstacy," depicts Michelangelo (played by Charlton Heston) painting the frescoes on his back, the real Michelangelo didn't work in this position. Instead, he conceived and had constructed a unique scaffolding system sturdy enough to hold workers and materials and high enough that mass could still be celebrated below.
The scaffolding curved at its top, mimicking the curvature of the ceiling's vault. Michelangelo often had to bend backward and paint over his head —an awkward position that caused permanent damage to his vision.
7. Michelangelo Had Assistants
Michelangelo gets, and deserves, credit for the entire project. The complete design was his. The sketches and cartoons for the frescoes were all of his hand, and he executed the vast bulk of the actual painting by himself.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says there are now 20 million new STD infections in the U.S. each year. They say young people under the age of 25 account for about half of them even though they represent only 25 percent of the sexually experienced population.
That‘s why Planned Parenthood of Indiana is holding its fifth annual Get Yourself Tested campaign for National STD Awareness Month. PPIN Vice President for Patient Services Liz Carroll says many if not most young people infected with diseases like gonorrhea and chlamydia don‘t know it.
“One of the most significant things about STDs particularly gonnorhea and clamydia is they are frequently without symtoms and they can cause chronic lifelong problems,” Carroll says.
Carroll says PPIN is offering free STD screenings for those ailments at 18 centers in Avon, Bloomington, Columbus, Evansville, Fishers, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis-Eastside, Indianapolis-Midtown, Indianapolis-Southside, Hammond, Lafayette, Madison, Merrillville, Muncie, Richmond, Terre Haute, Valparaiso and Warsaw.
These free tests are made possible by the nonprofit's Women's Health Fund, which provides reproductive health care for low-income women and men around the state this month.
Sen. Al Franken's final day in the Senate will be Jan. 2, a spokesperson for Franken said Wednesday.
Two weeks ago, the Minnesota Democrat announced he would be resigning after multiple women claimed he inappropriately touched or forcibly kissed them. But Franken did not give a date at that time.
"Let me be clear, I may be resigning my seat but I am not giving up my voice," Franken said in a Senate floor speech earlier this month, announcing his resignation. "I will continue to stand up for the things I believe in as a citizen and as an activist."
There was even speculation that Franken could withdraw his intent to resign, as he hadn't submitted any formal letter of resignation in the Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said on CNN's "New Day" earlier this week that Franken "should not resign," and criticized fellow Democrats for not giving their colleague due process.
Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith has been appointed to replace Franken for the time being.
Franken's impending departure is not the only one on Capitol Hill. Now-former Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, was forced to step aside after former staff members accused him of sexual harassment. Rep. Ruben Kihuen D-Nevada, will not seek a second term after he was accused of sexually harassing a campaign staffer. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, also will not run for reelection after he was accused of harassing and berating staff members. Now-former Rep. Trent Franks resigned after a report that he offered a former staff member $5 million to carry his child.

It does seem an interesting story but it loses punch and impact from the details. As a story, it seems quite dark and I'm guessing the main character would be Anu – watching an unempathetic character for 2 hours being macabre and bizarre and then kill someone wouldn't be an enjoyable experience. There also isn't a clear goal in Anu's story. I could imagine the story being very dark and thought-provoking, until the murder. It would not be interesting to follow somebody go mad.”
It does seem an interesting story but it loses punch and impact from the details.
Paul: “This reads more like a very short synopsis than a logline. Way too many unnecessary details clutter the read. But most importantly, I still don't have a good idea of the story. Does the story end with the injection, or is that just the beginning of the journey? Whichever it is you're either telling us too much or too little.”
This reads more like a very short synopsis than a logline.
Karel: “The story is centered around a strong antagonist but we don't know anything about any character we could possibly empathise with. Another problem is that if nobody does anything, we have characters who lack purpose, which makes for poor drama.”
Synchronicity
[box] “Set to the hit music of pop star Kylie Minogue, this musical spectacular follows 17-year-old Kylie Power, who, upon moving to her father's hometown of Sydney, is given one last chance to pursue her dream of becoming a synchronised swimming champion.”[/box]
The judges' verdict:
Geno: “Remove that Kylie Minogue nonsense. Unless you are producing and directing yourself, you'll have zero influence on the music, soundtrack, dance numbers, stunts, etc. If you ARE producing it and directing it yourself, you can write any logline you'd like, since it doesn't matter anyhow. The meat of the logline is the last two thirds.”
The meat of the logline is the last two thirds
James: “Minus the info about Kylie Minogue, this is actually a pretty solid logline. We have the main protagonist, a possible antagonist (the father), and even a goal. My only real issue is that the goal might not be visible enough. When It's something as broad as “achieve her dream” then the movie can appear to drag on a little. It would be better if it actually stated what she had to do to become a synchronized swimming champion. As in stating that she has X amount of weeks until the big tournament that could decide it all.”
The goal might not be visible enough.

SIGNIFICANT quantities of human remains have been discovered at a Galway site excavated by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission.
SIGNIFICANT quantities of human remains have been discovered at a Galway site excavated by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission.
The Commission has described itself as “shocked” by the discovery made in Tuam over recent weeks.
The Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation is currently probing how unmarried mothers and their babies were treated between 1922 and 1998 at 18 State-linked religious institutions.
A small number of the remains discovered in Tuam were recovered for the purpose of analysis.
“These remains involved a number of individuals with age-at-death ranges from approximately 35 foetal weeks to 2-3 years,” the body said.
“Radiocarbon dating of the samples recovered suggest that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the Mother and Baby Home. The homes ran from 1925 to 1961."
Minister Katherine Zappone Photo: Gareth Chaney/Collins
A number of the samples are likely to date from the 1950s. Further scientific tests are being conducted.
“The Commission is shocked by this discovery and is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way,” it added in a statement.
A stratigraphic survey of the site which was conducted in October 2015 identified a particular area of interest and identified a number of sub surface anomalies that were considered worthy of further investigation.
These were further investigated by a test excavation in November/December 2016 and in January/February 2017.
Test trenches were dug revealing two large structures. One structure appears to be a large sewage containment system or septic tank that had been decommissioned and filled with rubble and debris and then covered with top soil.
The second structure is a long structure which is divided into 20 chambers.
The Commission has not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appears to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water. The Commission has also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.
Responding to the development, Children's Minister Katherine Zappone said it was "very sad and disturbing news".
"It was not unexpected as there were claims about human remains on the site over the last number of years.
"Up to now we had rumours. Now we have confirmation that the remains are there, and that they date back to the time of the Mother and Baby Home, which operated in Tuam from 1925 to 1961," she said.
The Minister said that everybody involved must respond sensitively and respectfully to the situation.
Her Department had brought together all of the key Departments and agencies to set out a way forward.
This will include the following:
- The Commission will continue its work under its terms of reference, including such matters as post mortem practices and procedures, reporting and burial arrangements for residents of Mother and Baby Homes.
- The Coroner for North Galway will take the steps he deems necessary under his independent statutory functions.
- Galway County Council will engage with the Commission in relation to the immediate next steps on the site.
- Galway County Council will engage with local residents and other interested parties on what should happen next in relation to the remains.
- There will be an information line for factual information, and a service for those who feel personally affected by the news.
Ms Zappone said:“Today is about remembering and respecting the dignity of the children who lived their short lives in this Home.
"We will honour their memory and make sure that we take the right actions now to treat their remains appropriately.”

A couple of months back, I listed 12 reasons why the positive momentum was with Brexit campaigners, and in closing said I would return to give another 12. Well here we are again and I can tell you that I'm even more upbeat. Here's why the sun is still shining even though the summer is over:
1. Eurozone Greek debt tragedy. Forget the billions involved, what people can see is that, even after a country votes in two elections to end austerity, the EU elite will impose it anyway. This woke up many on the left, like Guardian columnist Owen Jones, to why leaving the EU will strengthen democracy.
2. Migrant crisis. This humanitarian tragedy has been stoked by EU leaders, exposing the conflict between countries like Germany, which desperately needs more working-age people to avoid a demographic cliff, and others experiencing record immigration levels. People now see that regaining control of our borders can only be achieved outside the EU.
Read more: The UK is better off inside Europe than out
3. Jeremy Corbyn elected. The new old-school left-wing leader of the Labour Party may have had his arm twisted to say that he will campaign to stay in the EU, but that's not the point. We all know what he really thinks and his election has made being EU-sceptic in the Labour Party respectable again. Expect many Labour and trade union people to now come out of the closet.
4. Purdah to be enforced. No sooner had MPs returned to Westminster from their summer holidays than they forced a government climb, ensuring the establishment machine of public servants and taxpayers' money cannot give the Prime Minister an unfair advantage during the referendum campaign.
5. Question changed to be more balanced. Then the Electoral Commission showed it had bottle, telling the Prime Minister that the question was not balanced and drafting a new question of “remain” or “leave”. No longer can “Yes2Europe” sound positive at the expense of “No” to the EU campaigners.
6. General Motors and Vauxhall deny the EU matters. We're told by politicians that leaving the EU means leaving the Single Market, and that this equals job losses. Only it doesn't make sense; the UK is the rest of the EU's biggest market, so an agreement to keep trading will be reached. Now General Motors's UK subsidiary Vauxhall has stated that EU membership will not affect its investment decisions and that it is here to stay.
Read more: Business and markets need to start thinking through Brexit risks
7. Prudential threatens to leave the EU. To emphasise the problems stemming from heavy EU regulatory costs, the Pru has let it be known that the threat of EU-led financial regulations has forced the company to consider relocating its HQ outside the UK if we stay inside the EU. And still politicians don't get it.
8. Scottish nationalists are split. Would you believe it, a poll by YouGov into attitudes towards Brexit found that 27 per cent of SNP supporters also back leaving the EU. Once the debate gets going in Scotland, I'm confident we can build on that.
9. The issue of TTIP draws closer. It is received wisdom that trade deals are a good thing, but with the EU's Canadian deal (CETA) – widely seen as the template for the EU-US trade deal (TTIP) – now approaching the European Parliament, watch for demonstrators complaining that Westminster cannot amend anything. Outside the EU, we could have our own deals that suit the UK.
10. Leave.eu and Vote.leave launched. Having two campaigns preparing to convince the British public of the benefits of leaving the EU is an advantage; the competition will generate innovative ideas, they will reach different audiences, and this will widen public involvement. That's double the trouble for Europhiles.
11. Francois Hollande says ever closer union or Brexit. The cat is out of the bag. The French President told us last week that EU members needed to pull closer together and, if the UK didn't like that, we should leave. That's what we've been telling people for years. No opt-out the Prime Minister gets will change this.
12. Major, Blair, Brown to campaign for EU. The announcement that the last three ex-Prime Ministers will campaign for continued EU membership was met with a mixture of hilarity and embarrassment on social media. Let EU supporters rely on the establishment. Leave supporters will be out speaking to real people.
It is still early days in the referendum campaign, but the momentum has definitely shifted towards Brexit supporters, and so much so that Westminster talk is that the Prime Minister will postpone the vote until 2017. Whenever it is held, we are ready and confident that the arguments are mounting to convince a majority why we should leave.
A study commissioned at the request of a First Nation says the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) has not reported accurately on the scale or impact of daily crude oil and salt water spills in the petro province.
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
The regulator has not provided “the public with accurate, credible, complete, unbiased and timely information and fails in its responsibility to protect the environment,” the study concluded.
Kevin Timoney, author of the report and an independent ecologist based in Alberta, called for the province's auditor general to audit “the failure of the regulator.”
Timoney's review of the regulator's spill database found spills that were not recorded in the database at all, or didn't include information on volume spilled.
In addition, he found the regulator routinely reported that 100 per cent of the spilled contaminants had been recovered after pollution events, although scientific studies have found clean-up rates for spills on land typically recover less than half the oil.
Timoney also says that AER spill reporting lacked scientific credibility because it suggested there had been almost no damage to wildlife and animals in Alberta.
The problem is immense. Spillage from the province's well pads, pipelines and batteries onto farmland, forests, muskeg and rivers is extensive and averages 1.7 crude oil spills a day and one salt water spill a day, says the report.
Aging oil wells typically produce more salt water than they do oil, or approximately 10 barrels of toxic water for every barrel of oil produced in North America. Produced water can also contain hydrocarbons and radioactive material.
In Alberta, industry is required to report any release of hydrocarbons into a waterway, or “any unrefined product release” that flows off an industry lease, or spills greater than 12 barrels on an industry lease site such as a well pad.
As part of his research, Timoney examined Alberta's spill database over a 38-year period between 1975 and 2013 and visited major spill sites to gauge the impacts on water, land and plants.
In that time period, industry spilled at least 1.6 million barrels (256,712 cubic metres) of crude oil and more than five million barrels of salt water onto the land and waterways, according to Timoney's analysis of the AER database.
That works out to 42,105 barrels of oil spilled every year across the province, whose landscape has been marked by 400,000 well sites and 415,000 kilometres of pipelines.
In contrast, Enbridge spilled more than 23,809 barrels of diluted bitumen into the Kalamazoo River in 2010. It cost more than $1 billion to clean up the disaster.
But Timoney found that the AER's spillage statistics did not reflect the real scale of the problem because of missing data and other issues.
“There are a lot of spills unaccounted for with no volume specified,” said Timoney. For example, he found many documented spills that appeared in newspapers aren't in the database.
The AER database also does not include thousands of spills prior to 1975; spills from federally regulated pipelines; spills reported to Alberta's environment ministry; or spills that classify oil or salt water as the second or third contaminant.
In addition, the regulator has often reported perfect recovery rates from most spills even though Timoney could find “no scientific studies” that documented total recovery of spilled oil or saline water on land. Saline spills can be more damaging to plants and vegetation because salts don't degrade over time.
The regulator's claim of full recovery is “patently false,” concluded Timoney in an interview.
Scientific studies show that there is impact, large or small, and that the recovery rate for spilled oil on land averages around 43 per cent while the recovery rate for ocean spills averages less than 15 per cent of the hydrocarbons recovered.
“Industry-reported impact rates from outside of Alberta are 30 to 50 times higher than those reported in Alberta,” says the report. “Evidence demonstrates that AER is failing to record animal deaths or injuries in its incident database.”
Timoney found, for example, that AER data indicated harm to habitat in less than one per cent of crude oil spills and even less for saline spills.
Yet a 2005 peer reviewed study in Oklahoma showed that 34 per cent of oil and saline water spills “resulted in reported injury to environmental receptors (surface water, crops or livestock, soil, fish, or wildlife).”
Peter Murchland, a public affairs manager with the AER, told The Tyee that it couldn't verify exactly how Timoney was determining or defining perfect recovery. “As Mr. Timoney's report has not been made publicly available, the AER cannot provide specific responses to the claims made regarding the accuracy of spill reporting data in the province.”
He added that the data set that Timoney used on spill response in the province between 1975 and 2013 “provides only a partial picture of spill clean up and damage to habitat as a result of spills in the province” and doesn't tell the full story.
The regulator's low estimates of damage from spills may be partly explained by the fact that other regulators such as Alberta Environment may have been involved in the process.
Prior to 2013 the board only tracked what was in its mandate and impacts on wildlife and wildlife habitat were not under the board's jurisdiction, added Murchland.
“If the spill caused damage to a sensitive area or wildlife/livestock outside of the regulator's jurisdiction, it may have been marked (for lack of a better option in the system) as not affected,” Murchland said.
The AER is largely funded by industry and chaired by a former energy lobbyist. In 2013, new legislation governing the regulator centralized duties formally carried by three ministries into the AER and dropped the board's original mandate to “provide economic, orderly and efficient development in the public interest of the oil and gas resources in Alberta.”
Its job now is to provide “for the efficient, safe, orderly and environmentally responsible development of energy resources.”
“It is important to note that when the Government of Alberta brought together three regulators to form the AER in 2013, it was about building a regulator capable of ensuring public safety, protecting the environment and managing cumulative effects,” said Murchland.
But landowners who've fought the regulator in recent years say that is nonsense and that the agency is now more unaccountable than ever to the public.
Timoney attributed shortfalls in spill reporting to the board's conflicted mandate: “The AER is there to serve industry and somehow try to protect the environment. But the AER serves their funding source which is industry.”
‘No record' of spill
Timoney also visited 14 former oil spill sites in Alberta to measure the impact over time. At one site in northwestern Alberta where oil was released in 1998, the ecologist found the soil contaminated with 21.7 per cent crude oil (210,000 mg/kg).
“There is either no record of this spill in the AER database or the spill took place in 1998 and was later certified as cleaned up,” he told The Tyee.
Timoney adds that wherever he looked at spill sites, he found “detectable soil, water and vegetation impacts.”
Regulator claims about “cleanup recovery dates, indicating completion of oil spill cleanup, are managerial decisions that are unjustified by the available scientific data,” says the report's abstract.
Dene Tha First Nation requested the spill study, while the Keepers of the Water helped to fund it. It took a year and a half to produce and will soon be published as a 200-page book.
The study reinforces the findings of a Global News investigation in 2013 on pipelines regulated by Alberta from 1975 to 2012. Using the same database it found that pipelines alone were responsible for 28,666 crude oil spills, an average of nearly 775 per year or two oil spills every day for a period of 37 years.
Given that farmland and waterways can take decades to recover from oil spills, “the industry is causing wholesale, long-term damage to ecosystems,” concluded the report.
Contamination of groundwater can take centuries or thousands of years to heal.
Studies by the U.S. Geological Survey on oil spills in Oklahoma “clearly show that significant amounts of salts from produced-water releases and petroleum hydrocarbons still remain in the soils and rocks of the impacted area after more than 60 years of natural attenuation.”
Alberta has a long and dramatic record of large oil spills. In 1970, Suncor spilled 50,000 gallons of synthetic crude into the Athabasca River while Imperial Oil flooded farmland west of Edmonton with 28,000 barrels of oil.
In recent years industry has authored more spectacular spills in Alberta, including an Apache-operated pipeline that dumped 9.5 million litres (60,000 barrels) of industrial wastewater into a muskeg in 2013.
Two years later, a Nexen pipeline released 5 million litres of bitumen wastewater into the boreal forest near Fort McMurray.
Regulators across North America employ a haphazard approach to reporting spills that rarely involves fines or enforcement orders. In North Dakota, industry must report all spills greater than one barrel while Oklahoma doesn't require any notification unless a spill exceeds 10 barrels.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the U.S. petroleum industry spills anywhere from 10 to 25 million gallons of oil a year (793,650 barrels), and that these oil releases contaminate groundwater, damage farmland, harm wildlife, devalue property and threaten public health and safety.
Nigeria may have the worst record in the world for toxic oil spills. The volume of oil spilled in the Niger Delta ranges from 100,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil a year. It is considered one of the most oil spill vulnerable areas in the world.
A 2011 United Nations report warned that oil spills in Ogoniland alone had contaminated groundwater, killed mangrove swamps and exposed the local population to toxic hydrocarbons in the air and water. A billion-dollar clean up began last year.
In 2011 the New York Times reported that the oil pipeline network had spilled 110 million gallons of mostly crude oil since 1990. Most of the contamination occurred in three oil-exporting states: Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
Military authorities have highlighted the threat from the “geotagging” technology built into many smartphones, which can reveal where a photograph was taken.
"Today, in pretty much every single smartphone, there is built-in GPS," said US Army spokesman Steve Warren .
"For every picture you take with that phone, it will automatically embed the latitude and longitude within the photograph."
In 2007, insurgents in Iraq used geotags embedded in images posted to Facebook to pinpoint the location of helicopters within a US base. Four AH-64 Apaches were destroyed in the subsequent attack, the US Army said.
Soldiers should also be aware of the risks of posting photographs to Foursquare, Gowalla and other social media services, it added.
Staff sergeant Dale Sweetnam said Facebook's new Timeline feature, which displays more information about past activity on users' profiles, posed more risks because it offers a map of all the locations a user has tagged.
"Timeline presents some unique security challenges for users who tag location to posts," he said.
"A good rule of thumb when using location-based social networking applications is do not become friends with someone if you haven't met them in person," Sweetnam added.
"Make sure you're careful about who you let into your social media circle."
The US Army's guidance follows warnings from the Ministry of Defence to the British military.
Last year it produced a video (above) saying “it can be simple to collate information from various sources in order to build up a picture of whom a person is” and in 2010 issued a warning that Facebook could serve as a “one-stop shop targeting pack” for terrorists.

The data for 1981 and 1982 has been compiled by KekeTheKing using lap charts and video footage.
The data for the years 1983 to 2003 are as published in Michele Merlino's 2007 Autosport.com article Passing Thoughts: F1 Overtaking Analysis, using Brian Lawrence's methodology of recording passes (as listed below) made from lap charts of those races. We are grateful to Michele and Brian for their permission to include this data.
Data since 2004 has been compiled by Galahad and includes overtaking moves shown on TV coverage as well as from lap charts.
From 2010 to 2012, KekeTheKing has also contributed with additional video footage and analysis.
As such, it is not possible to draw anything other than the broadest conclusions from analysing across all data sets since the methodologies used to collect the data are different.
The overtaking figures for each race (across all data sets) do not include:
Position changes on the first lap of the race
Position changes due to drivers lapping backmarkers
Positions gained in the pits
Positions gained due to drivers yielding
Positions gained when a car has a serious technical problem; e.g. puncture, accident damage, etc.
The final criteria involve subjective judgements and consequently figures can never be regarded as ‘definitive'. Gaps in the available data, such as moves missed by TV cameras or obscured on lap charts by pit stops or retirements, mean that the data do not lend themselves to detailed analysis at the micro level, but are indicative of general trends.

He was 3 years old. He had a twin brother, but the doctor diagnosed him alone with leukemia. He started his ordeal with weekly chemotherapy treatments and seemed in good spirits despite all he would face over the next three years.
After his first chemo session, the doctors let him go home and sleep in his own bed. The next day he asked to go to the end of the driveway to get the mail, as if that were a privilege and wonderful adventure. His mother loaded him into his little red wagon and pulled him to the mailbox.
On the way back, he asked his mother to stop for a moment. When she did, he sat in his wagon and looked all around in silence—taking it in as if seeing it for the first time. He finally spoke and said, “Mommy isn't everything beautiful?”
His words tugged at her heart as she answered, “Yes, honey. Everything sure is beautiful.”
A 3-year-old child, facing the fight of his life, made her realize the wonder of God's creation. Let us take time to enjoy life to its fullest while we can. Let us recognize the sacredness of God's creation around us, as if seeing it for the first time.

Prayer for Peace Compassionate God, when our vision is cloudy, clear our mind to see the love you have for your creation. Clear away jaded judgments that block our childlike wonder. May we be intentional in seeing and appreciative of what we see. May we be intentional as we share Christ's peace.
Spiritual Practice: Listening to Children Sit in your quiet place and center your heart and mind on God's presence. Spend several minutes asking God to bring into your awareness the names and images of children in your life. You may see their faces or hear their voices as you receive these impressions. Listen deeply to the unique gifts and needs of the children who come to mind. Offer a prayer of blessing for each child and the needs you sense. If you feel led, you also may want to write a note or card and give a message of affirmation and love to each child.
Peace Covenant Today, God, I will see your world anew on my way to the mailbox.

San Ramon, California, appears to have broken a new earthquake record over the last two weeks: A total of 408 small quakes have shaken the East Bay city, almost four times the record set in 2003 in half the amount of time. Stephanie Chuang reports. (Published Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2015)
NBC Bay Area's quake map shows all earthquakes recorded near the San Francisco Bay Area over the past 24 hours.
San Ramon, California, appears to have broken a new earthquake record over the last two weeks: A total of 408 small quakes have shaken the East Bay city, almost four times the record set in 2003 in half the amount of time.
"I've not felt so many tremors in decades," Mark Stone said outside a San Ramon Starbucks on Tuesday morning. "My dog, Gimmel, she's the first one to know a couple of seconds before."
And his dog has been extra alert lately.
The U.S. Geological Survey reports that as of Oct. 13, the Northern California Seismic Network had detected 408 earthquakes and counting.
At least a dozen temblors since 10 p.m. on Monday, with other quakes spilling into the early hours of Tuesday. The USGS on Tuesday also reported a magnitude-3.2 quake striking the area at 5:07 p.m.
Most quakes have clocked in with magnitudes ranging from 2.0 to 3.0. San Ramon is about 45 miles east of San Francisco.
In an Oct. 14 interview, Senior U.S. Geological Survey research geologist David Schwartz said the swarm is not all that unusual, noting that San Ramon Valley is at the "center of earthquake swarm activity" in the Bay Area. He recalled a 2003 swarm of 120 earthquakes over 31 days in San Ramon, with the largest clocking in at a magnitude of 4.2.
The biggest swarm on record in the same general area, Schwartz noted, was in 1990 in neighboring Alamo, about 30 miles east of San Francisco. That's when 351 earthquakes struck over 42 days, with the largest recorded at a magnitude of 4.4.
The current swarm of 408 - and counting - tops both those numbers.
Most of the earthquakes are occurring at a depth of about five miles underground and are too small to be felt, the USGS explained. One of the largest earthquakes in the current swarm activity was a 3.6-magnitude quake on Oct. 19.
San Ramon, Danville and Alamo all have a history of earthquake swarms, as they sit on the Calaveras Fault. Based on other swarms, the USGS predicts this swarm may continue for several more weeks and is unlikely to be a foreshock to a larger quake.
The northern Calaveras Fault has not ruptured with a significant earthquake since the 1860s, the USGS reported, and the likelihood of a large earthquake of 6.7-magnitude or larger is just 8 percent.
As for why the swarms occur?
"We just don't understand the structural geology of the swarms, why they turn on and shut off quickly," Schwartz said in a previous interview. "We just don't understand."
The Dutch far right and anti-EU leader Geert Wilders was in Brussels on Tuesday, campaigning for the EU election outside the European parliament.
In front of reporters, Wilders cut out a symbolic Dutch star from an EU flag to symbolise his wish to remove the Netherlands from the EU.
“We don't want Brussels, we don't want the EU” he said, “and I will take this star back to the Netherlands in order to give it back to the Dutch people, in order to show that we don't need this European flag and that we are proud of our own Dutch flag”.
Wilders' Freedom Party (PVV) is leading the polls in the Netherlands.
In the new European Parliament he wants to team up with other eurosceptic parties such as Marine Le Pen's National Front in France to form a common group and in their words “to wreck the EU from within”.
Euronews correspondent in Brussels Olaf Bruns says that although Wilders' party is high up in the Dutch polls, the eurosceptics won't get a Europe-wide majority. However, even without gaining power, one thing they are sure to obtain is more influence.
I came across this creepy looking dude this week at the Modern Day Marine expo in Quantico, Va. The autonomous robot is the latest in targeting tech being used by the U.S. Marine Corps.
Made by the Aussie firm Marathon Targets, the robot is designed to move at human speeds and can be deployed in packs of randomly moving targets -- giving troops experience firing at moving targets before entering combat. The robots can be programmed to scatter or move as if making a counterattack when they are fired at and trainers can even decide how many hits it takes to eliminate one of the robots. The upper half is built of durable plastic designed to absorb small arms fire while the motor and electronic parts sit in the armored boxes at the bottom of the robot.
"The design objective was to fill the existing gap in training in all countries -- the lack of realistic target training," Martahon Targets' co-founder Alex Makarenko told DT yesterday during this year's Modern Day Marine expo in Quantico, Va. "What happens today is a situation where soldiers, for the first time shoot at realistic moving targets [only] once they are in a firefight in a war zone. This is the most realistic target you can buy today. Because it's trackless, we can make it look like, move like and even behave like people."
Marathon is on contract to deliver a set of the targets to the Marines later this year, according to Makarenko.

NORTH BEND, Wash. - An intruder who smashed his way into a home in North Bend was shot and killed Friday night by the homeowner after the suspect broke through the bedroom door, King County sheriff's officials said.
The incident unfolded at about 11:40 p.m. in the 300 block of SE Fifth Street, as deputies responded to a report of someone roaming around the neighborhood acting strangely and banging on the walls and doors of homes.
As officers searched the neighborhood for the suspect, they heard a loud crash at a home down the street, said Sgt. Cindi West of the King County Sheriff's Office. At the same time, they received a 911 call from the owner of the home saying that someone had broken in.
As deputies set up a perimeter around the home, they heard loud noises coming from inside. Deputies then received word from the homeowner -- still on the phone with 911 dispatchers -- saying that he had shot the intruder.
Deputies entered the home and found the suspect dead on the bedroom floor.
The homeowner told deputies that he and his girlfriend heard the intruder smash his way into their home by throwing a propane tank through the rear sliding glass door.
As the couple retreated to another room, they could hear the intruder making his way through the house, trashing it and breaking things.
The homeowner grabbed his pistol and yelled to the intruder to get out, warning that he was armed.
According to West, the intruder yelled back and said, "Where are you? I will mess you up."
The couple then retreated to the bedroom and locked the door, but the intruder followed them and broke through the bedroom door.
As the suspect entered the bedroom, the homeowner shot and killed him.
The homeowner and his girlfriend were uninjured. They told deputies they didn't know the intruder and had never seen him before.
West said the intruder may have been the same person who reportedly was harassing customers at a nearby Shell station about 45 minutes earlier.
Bad news for balancing in Asia
Nine months ago I visited South Korea for a conference on security issues, and I posted a summary of my conference paper here on this site. Among the main points I made (and not for the first time) was that creating and managing balancing coalitions in Asia was going to be tricky, and require some adroit diplomacy and skillful U.S. leadership. As I said back then:
"For starters, a balancing coalition in Asia will face serious dilemmas of collective action. Although many Asian states may worry about a rising threat from China, each will also be tempted to get others to bear most of the burden and to free-ride on their efforts. These incentives may lead some states to simultaneously balance against China (at least somewhat) while at the same time trying cultivating close economic relations with China. Indeed, one could argue that this is precisely what South Korea has tried to do over the past decade or more. This problem may be compounded by lingering historical divisions between potential alliance partners (e.g., Japan and South Korea), and by adroit Chinese efforts to play "divide-and-rule."
The past several weeks provide some instructive support for this view. First, a May 2012 agreement to increase security cooperation and intelligence sharing between South Korea and Japan (a move that the United States clearly supported) has foundered in recent weeks, in good part due to domestic opposition in South Korea. Some of the opposition was merely opportunistic (the agreement provided President Lee's opponents with an issue to exploit), but the controversy also stemmed from Korea's bitter experience as a Japanese colony during the first half of the 20th century. Second, the recent ASEAN summit failed to issue a closing communiqué fo the first time in the organization's forty-five year history, largely because there was no consensus on how to respond to China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.
Both events highlight some of the key obstacles to effective balancing behavior in Asia: 1) the temptation to free-ride, 2) lingering historical tensions between key members, and 3) China's ability to cultivate certain regional states (in this case, Cambodia) and block a coordinated regional response.
States do tend to balance against threats, and it is no surprise that the United States has begun to focus more attention on Asia and that many Asian states welcome the enhanced attention. But creating effective balancing coalitions is neither easy nor automatic, and it's going to require more time and skill to pull it off, especially if the United States wants to make sure that other states pull their weight and don't leave Uncle Sucker doing all of the heavy lifting. And my guess is that managing intra-alliance diplomacy in Asia is going to make the history of NATO look like child's play.
“Why don't you come around to the other side of the counter?” sushi chef Junichi Onuki chirped from behind the bar. He laid down the sharp yanagi-ba knife he'd been using to slice fillets of sea bream and beckoned in a gesture of welcome.
I'd asked Onuki, owner and chef of Isana Sushi Bar in Tokyo's Nishi-Azabu district, to teach me about cutlery and other kitchen utensils in the sushi chef's toolbox. Although I'd toured many professional kitchens before, no one had ever invited me behind the bar at a sushi restaurant. After years of sitting at sushi counters as a customer, it felt both thrilling and mildly transgressive.
Onuki had arranged his workstation for me exactly as he would during dinner service. On the immaculate white cutting board sat a yanagi-ba — the long, thin knife used for slicing fish — alongside a fine-grained sharkskin wasabi grater and ceramic pots filled with homemade nikiri soy sauce and ana-tsume sauce for eel. In another jar were tweezers for removing pin bones, a perforated spoon for scooping up ikura (salmon roe), a small grater for zesting yuzu citrus, and a tiny wooden brush used to sprinkle the fragrant yuzu rind onto pieces of sashimi.
“This is the knife everyone sees,” he said, pointing to the yanagi-ba. It is the blade that junior chefs graduate to, a sign that one has become a fully-fledged sushi chef. Apprentices commonly spend years scaling and gutting fish before being allowed to fillet them, but slicing the fish in front of guests is done exclusively by the head chef. Onuki reckons that the job requires a minimum of five years' training in order to “learn the anatomy of each type of fish.”
The knife for filleting fish is called a deba, which has a wider blade and a pointed tip. A smaller version of the deba is the kodeba, used for filleting small fish such as sardines, while the thicker ōdeba is used to cut through bones. Japanese chefs peel and julienne vegetables with the exceptionally thin, flat-edged usuba knife. A long, sword-like knife called a maguro-bōchō is used especially for cutting up whole tuna.
Onuki stores his cutlery on a wooden rack according to size, with the largest knives on the bottom. In the light, the angled edges of the blades gleamed brightly, reminding me of the silver-white underbellies of sharks. Most Japanese knives are made of carbon steel and single-beveled, and therefore thinner than Western chefs' knives, allowing more precise control to help preserve the delicate texture of fresh fish.
Although Masamoto is one of the best-known brands, Onuki recommends a number of manufacturers, such as Hide, Nenohi, Yasuyuki and Sugimoto. The next day, I felt inspired to run out to buy a deba from the knife shop Tsubaya in Kappabashi, the area of Taito Ward near Ueno and Asakusa that specializes in kitchen apparatus. But first, I remembered, I would have to learn how to fillet a fish. Maybe I'll be ready in another five years.

I just learned about a new and very interesting study on why people hunt by Alena Ebeling-Schuld and Chris Darimont called "Online hunting forums identify achievement as prominent among multiple satisfactions." Because hunting plays a role in wildlife practices and is related to the integrity of diverse ecosystems, their results have significant practical applications.
The entire essay is available online, so here are a few snippets to whet your for more. In the abstract were read:
hunter satisfactions can lead to improved wildlife management policy and practice. Whereas previous work has suggested that hunters often seek multiple satisfactions (achievement, affiliation, appreciation), little is known about how satisfactions might vary with target species. ... We used directed qualitative content analysis to analyze hunting narratives for satisfactions by coding 2,864 phrases across 455 hunting “stories,” and compared patterns of dominant (most frequent) and multiple satisfactions between target species type (ungulates and carnivores) using forums from 3 regions: British Columbia, Canada; Texas, USA; and North America-wide. We found that achievement was the dominant satisfaction in 81% of ungulate and 86% of carnivore stories. Appreciation was nearly absent as a dominant satisfaction in carnivore stories. We found that 62% of ungulate and 53% of carnivore stories had multiple satisfactions present, indicating that appreciation and affiliation play important secondary satisfaction roles even when achievement is dominant.
As pointed out in this essay, previous research on why people hunt are limited because they focus on a particular geographical region or on a single or only a few different species. The present study was much broader in scope. It's also significant that the comprehensive data set was carefully analyzed statistically, and achievement, rather than affiliation and appreciation, emerged as the dominant satisfaction factor. The authors write, "The 3-way combination of achievement, affiliation, and appreciation satisfactions was the most common multiple-satisfaction grouping, occurring in 46% of multiple-satisfaction ungulate stories (n = 107 of 235) and 35% of multiple-satisfaction carnivore stories (n = 14 of 40)."
Hunting and wildlife management
All in all, the present results are consistent with other research projects. And, there is an important practical side to this research. If the data collected in this study represent the general hunting population, the authors conclude, "ignoring achievement in wildlife management would have significant consequences." They also note that future research needs to concentrate on the nuances of how the three satisfactions—achievement, affiliation, and appreciation—co-occur.
"Pleasure" smiles are greater when hunters pose with dangerous corpses
Consistent with this conclusion, in an earlier study called "Hunting for Trophies: Online Hunting Photographs Reveal Achievement Satisfaction with Large and Dangerous Prey," researchers K. R. Child and C. T. Darimont with the Raincoast Conservation Foundation and Applied Conservation Science Lab concluded, "that the odds of true 'pleasure' smiles are greater when hunters pose: (a) with versus without prey, (b) with large versus small prey and, (c) with carnivores versus herbivores (among older men)." They go on to write, "We emerge with a generalizable achievement-oriented hypothesis to propose that the prospect of displaying large and/or dangerous prey at least in part underlies the behavior of many contemporary hunters." All in all, "pleasure smiles" are greater when hunters pose with dangerous corpses. For more details about this study please see "Trophy Hunters' Smiles Show How Much They Like to Kill."
While there most likely are a number of different tenable explanations of why people hunt, I highly recommend "Online hunting forums identify achievement as prominent among multiple satisfactions" to people interested in the psychology of why people go out and kill other animals on hunting forays. This is because of the researchers' comprehensive review of available data from a large number of other studies, the careful statistical analyses of the data they collected, and because their large data set comes from a broad array of hunters in different geographical areas.
I look forward to more research on human hunting behavior. Studies such as Alena Ebeling-Schuld and Chris Darimont's are sorely needed.

HOUSTON - Tucked away in the corner at a flea market in Hemphill, Texas, about a 170 miles away from Houston, Lanie and Walter Brown found a flag with writing on it.
There are about two dozen messages written on it, one said, "We'll always remember the sacrifice you made," and another read, "Thank you for being who you were...Rest in peace."
"We realized it was a flag intended for a fallen Marine," said Lanie Brown. "We knew we had to take it home with us."
All of the other flags for sale were selling for $15 to $30, but this one didn't have a price on it.
"She said because it had writing on it we could have it for $5," Brown told Local 2. "We'd have paid whatever she asked for it. It's priceless."
The Browns knew it was a tribute flag and from the messages on it, they could tell the fallen Marine's name was Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel. They used the Internet to search for his family and thanks to Facebook, they located his mother near Houston. The Browns live near Beaumont, about two hours away.
"I never knew it existed and here is this flag, in a flea market over two hours away from me," Patsy Maciel said. "Nobody knows how it got there."
Patsy Maciel and the Browns have spoked on the phone a few times but have never met in person. All that is about to change. On Saturday, the two families are going to meet at Maciel's gravesite in Humble. His mom will finally get the tribute flag she should have gotten almost a decade ago.
"I can't wait to read what they wrote," said Maciel. That's my son and I'm proud of my son."
Fred Maciel died in a helicopter crash in Fallujah in 2005. He was only 20 years old.
"He told me he was born to be a Marine," Maciel said. "He died doing what he loved. I finally had to accept that."
The Browns feel a special connection to the Maciels. Lanie and Walter's son and son-in-law are both Marines. Coincidentally, their son-in-law was in Iraq the same time Maciel was.
"When you're a Marine mom or Marine dad, all other Marine moms and dads are your brothers and sisters, and all Marine kids are your kids, too," Brown said.
Both families are looking forward to finally meeting face to face Saturday.
"We felt an immediate need and responsibility to get this flag back to them," Brown said. "It's kind of like a piece of my son. I don't know if that sounds crazy but it's a piece of my son coming back to me."

Martin Ferguson labelled a 'traitor' by MUA branch over Fair Work comments
Updated
Martin Ferguson's push for industrial relations reform has sparked an angry outburst from his brother and a call for the former minister to be kicked out of the Labor Party.
Mr Ferguson, who was the resources minister in the Rudd-Gillard governments and retired from politics at the last election, has highlighted the behaviour of the West Australian branch of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA).
He says the MUA is a "job-killing" and "rogue" union, and is making a case for a review of Labor's workplace laws and tougher action on unions.
But the MUA has hit back, calling him a "traitor" who should be kicked out of the Labor Party.
Mr Ferguson, who now chairs an advisory board for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), spoke in Perth on Friday calling for both unions and workplace laws to change in order to address rising unemployment and boost productivity.
Mr Ferguson said unless the unions were tackled and excessive wages reduced, more Australian jobs would go offshore.
He also said the MUA's WA branch had blocked equipment from reaching the massive Gorgon gas project, which had blown out the project's costs and timelines.
"I think the Maritime Union WA branch is a rogue union," he said.
"I think they are not only potentially going to kill jobs for their own members, children and grandchildren in the future in the way they've conducted themselves, I think it's about time the rest of the union movement fronted up to the fact that they are now killing jobs in manufacturing."
Martin Ferguson's brother angered by comments
Christy Cain from the MUA's WA branch says Mr Ferguson has sold out to the gas and oil companies.
"My personal view is that he should be expelled from the ALP and he is a traitor to the working class people of this country," he said.
Mr Ferguson's brother, Laurie Ferguson, who is the federal member for the outer Sydney seat of Werriwa, says he is "diametrically opposed" to his brother's views on a wide variety of issues.
Laurie Ferguson says he does not want to air the family's internal conflicts in public but was angered by his brother's decision to invoke his father's legacy during his speech.
Laurie Ferguson says his father was a lifelong member of the building union and would never have supported wage repression or associated himself with calls to restrict the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
"This whole slant from the big end of town that every sacking in this country is justified by a failure of the Australian workers to go down to Vietnamese and Cambodian levels of wages is totally incorrect," Laurie Ferguson told News Radio.
Abbott praises Martin Ferguson, but rules out changes
Martin Ferguson wants Prime Minister Tony Abbott to go further than his planned changes in industrial relations because he says they are only "modest".
But Mr Abbott said he would not seek to change any industrial laws outside of his pre-election commitments.
"I have a high regard for Martin Ferguson. Martin Ferguson was one of the very serious people for the Labor Party in the Parliament," he said.
Mr Abbott said he was personally "very disappointed" when Martin Ferguson decided to leave the Parliament in 2013 and welcomed his latest comments.
"I think he's made a very important and valuable contribution to the debate, but what we will be doing is implementing the policies that we took to the election," he told reporters in Darwin.
One of the Government's policies is to restore the construction industry watchdog - the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) - which was established by the Howard government but abolished by Labor.
The Greens and Labor are blocking the legislation to reinstate the ABCC in the Senate.
Mr Ferguson says it did act as a "policeman on the beat" and had an impact on cleaning up corruption within the construction industry.
But he said unions also benefited from the Commission.
"[It's] a mechanism that holds both sides to account and which can help deliver projects on time and on budget," he said.

Super Mario Run Nintendo Last December, Nintendo brought Super Mario to the iPhone in a big way: "Super Mario Run" debuted simultaneously in 150 countries, and rapidly racked up 25 million downloads in its first four days.
Notably, everything went smoothly: While the game requires an internet connection to work, the massive crush of players from all around the world barely even slowed down the "Super Mario Run" servers. Months later, the game's Android launch would go off without a hitch, too.
In a new blog entry, DeNA — Nintendo's preferred smartphone app development partner — credits the success of the "Super Mario Run" launch to its decision to use Google's cloud services as the backend platform.
It's another feather in Google's cap as it rushes to chip away at the absolute cloud dominance of Amazon Web Services.
Mario engine
Google App Engine, the particular service chosen to power "Super Mario Run," allows applications to literally run on the same servers that power Google search and the rest of the Google empire — and then automatically add more server capacity as your application reaches more users.
It turns out that the decision to use the cloud in the first place was the result of hard-won experience. Earlier in 2016, Nintendo and DeNA had teamed up for Miitomo, the Japanese games giant's first-ever smartphone title.
For that game, the companies had decided to run it almost entirely from their own servers, which worked for the most part, but presented all kinds of technical headaches as the game caught on. For "Super Mario Run," DeNA and Nintendo knew they would have to up their game.
"We learned that projected traffic for 'Super Mario Run' would be massive — even by our standards as experienced smartphone app developers," says Kenta Sugahara, team leader for DeNA's System Development Division, in that blog entry. Super Mario Run Nintendo
Plus, DeNA liked Google's approach to cloud customer service. And so, Nintendo and DeNA went with App Engine to power the game, with plans to use Google's BigQuery data analytics service to draw out fresh insight from player behavior. "Fire Emblem Heroes," Nintendo's follow-up mobile game, also went with Google Cloud.
It's also worth noting that while "Pokémon Go" also uses Google Cloud, that's not actually a Nintendo game: Pokémon is property of The Pokémon Company, a joint venture between Nintendo, original game developer Game Freak, and toy-maker Creatures. Still, the positive experience with "Pokémon Go" could have emboldened DeNA.
Generally speaking, too, Google Cloud is finding a niche with game makers, as "Angry Birds" maker Rovio, "Assassin's Creed" publisher Ubisoft, and "Clash of Kings" developer Elex all use Google for some or all of their back-end infrastructure. As the cloud wars with Amazon escalate, it's a positive sign for Google.
fuksas reveals images of its music theater and exhibition hall in tbilisi's rhike park
image by joel rookwood
italian architecture studio fuksas has revealed images of a new cultural complex it is working on in the georgian capital of tbilisi. located within the city's rhike park, the building is composed of two sculptural tubular elements that both open up onto the adjacent green space. connected via a shared retaining wall, the two volumes house a musical theater and an exhibition hall respectively. the former is a 566-seat auditorium that also contains a cafeteria, storage areas, and technical facilities. its funneled form has been conceived as ‘a periscope to the city' — framing views of the river, and the historic town beyond. positioned to the south, the exhibition hall presents an open staircase to the public realm, welcoming visitors inside.
the complex is located in close proximity to a public service hall, which fuksas completed in 2012. the building is topped with 11 sculptural petals that rise to a total height of 35 meters. see more of the project on designboom here.

“It's not essential for me to have big radio records,” Frank Ocean told The New York Times last fall. But that doesn't mean he's necessarily against the idea, or incapable of pulling it off; remember, this is a guy who came up writing songs for Justin Bieber. He just wants to do it his way, to employ what he's called “the luxury of choice.” So it goes on “Slide,” produced by Billboard fave Calvin Harris and featuring two thirds of the most popular rap group in America right now. If this isn't a big radio record, the radio as it currently exists should probably cease to be.
Things start off breezy enough, with Harris dialing down his jackhammer house throb for sleek California funk. At first blush, it could be a Daft Punk song, or a Katy Perry song. But then Frank Ocean starts singing, and “Slide” becomes nothing but a Frank Ocean song. His deadpan instantly adds shade and nuance to the dayglo surroundings, suggesting a weariness big pop rarely allows. The effect is magnetic and a little startling, like Jeff Tweedy rasping over a Dr. Dre beat. Frank's infatuation with all things blurred and melancholy remains, with clarity only coming when it's too late. Migos' Quavo and Offset, known for twisting tongues over dank trap, come off like a winning insurance plan as they adapt to this more traditional pop showcase with ease. They can't match Frank's subtle radicalism, though. At this point, nobody can.
Minetest 0.4.10 was released yesterday. It's been half a year since the previous release, 0.4.9 and thus this one contains a lot of stuff compared to it.
This release also marks the first stable(ish…) (well, more stable than the non-stable ones anyway) version of the official Android port of Minetest.
The subgames
We were supposed to be putting multiple subgames in this release while keeping minetest_game frozen, but that didn't happen.
I set out to figure out the situation with subgames a few days ago. By testing the games, it seemed to me that Carbone had a lot to it compared to minetest_next. Also, I really like nodetopia, which sadly currently is too broken, according to the author. Most other subgames seem to be in a similar state.
Most of the community really wanted minetest_next to be included and I wanted to know more about it as I didn't really see exactly what its point is. This produced these two documents. I wanted to know about gameplay direction, but couldn't pull it out of them. It turns out _next was actually an undead version of _game which hadn't changed practically at all – it really has a lot of momentum. Given that minetest_next had to be selected, Carbone didn't make much sense as it is basically the same thing polished a bit and with extra mods. So, here we are, with _game continuing to be included and continuing development.
The future of subgames
As for subgames, I would *really* encourage you to make smaller polished ones, with interesting goals, limitations and which take new players well into account. With minetest_game continuing development and not being able to take it out, bundling a subgame largely based on it simply does not make sense.
Meanwhile, go download and try out Carbone, it does do many things better than minetest_next/game. You may also want to be following nodetest/voxelgarden. And all the other things happening here.

The following tutorial will teach Linux users how to install the Diablo 3 game on their open source operating system.
The third installment in the Diablo franchise, Diablo III, is a dark horror/fantasy-themed role-playing game (RPG) developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
The game features elements of the hack and slash, action RPG and dungeon crawl genres. For more details about Diablo 3, you can check out the official home page or the Wikipedia article.
Editor's note: For this guide, we have used the PlayOnLinux application. We've tested the tutorial on the current 32-bit release of the Ubuntu OS, 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin). Apparently, 64-bit users will not be able to play the game, as there are some 32-bit OpenGL libraries missing.
As a side note, make sure you meet the minimum system requirements (especially the graphics card and CPU/RAM) for playing Diablo III before going through the tutorial!
To install Diablo 3 on your Linux system, follow the next step-by-step (with screenshots) tutorial.
Step 1 – Install PlayOnLinux
The PlayOnLinux developers provide binary packages and repositories for many Linux operating systems, including Fedora, Debian, ArchLinux, Frugalware and Ubuntu, as well as an universal binary package.
We can't write instructions for all these Linux distributions here, therefore if you use one of the aforementioned OSes, go HERE for detailed installation instructions.
Step 2 – Download Diablo 3
If you have bought the Diablo III DVD Edition, skip to the next step. If you don't have the money to buy the DVD version and you only have a Battle.net account with Diablo 3 registered to you, grab the installer from HERE or from your Battle.net account.
Make sure you have Wine installed on your system. Save the exe file on your desktop, right click on it and select the "Open With Wine Windows Program Loader" option...
The Blizzard Downloader window will appear and the setup files will be downloaded to a location of your choice. It's a big file, about 8 GB so it will take a while, depending on your Internet connection speed. Also make sure you have enough free space on the selected hard drive!
Step 3 – Install Diablo 3
Open PlayOnLinux and follow the first time instructions to setup the application. Once these are finished, you'll see the PlayOnLinux interface. Click the "Install" button and search Diablo on the new opened window.
An installation window will appear. Click the "Next" button...
Select the installation method (the setup file – see Step 2 above, or the DVD disc you have bought). Click Next...
We've used the downloadable setup file (see Step 2 above for details). Click Next...
Let the application download and install everything it needs for the Diablo 3 game. Click Next...
After it finishes installing the requirements, you will notice a small "Diablo III Setup" dialog pop-up, updating the setup files...
In a few seconds the small "Diablo III Setup" dialog will disappear and the Diablo 3 installer will appear. Click the big "Install" button...
Wait for the installation for finish. It will take a about 15-20 minutes.
Once the installation is over, you can click the big "Play" button to play the Diablo 3 game.
That's it! A shortcut icon of Diablo 3 will appear on your desktop and you can always start the game by double-clicking it. Happy dungeon crawling!

Clients of the travel company that took Otto Warmbier to his tragic fate in North Korea are now speaking out on the volatile culture that may have played a part in the events leading up to Warmbier's arrest and subsequent death.
Gareth Johnson is the founder of Young Pioneer Tours (YPT), the China-based tourist company used by Otto Warmbier, which promises clients an “unparalleled experience, fun way of doing things”, according to their website.
One glance at Johnson and one may assume how he defines fun — women, booze, and mischief.
Former YPT clients, who are now stepping forward after Warmbier's passing, reveal how the founder and its company are doing business.
Since the company's inception in 2008, it has developed a party culture of being rowdy, rude, and drunk. This culture “trickles down” to YPT guests, according to Alex Hoban.
Earlier this week, Alex Hoban spoke about his previous experiences with YPT in The Guardian.
“Young Pioneer Tours has developed a reputation for gungho and unruly alcohol-fueled youths, propagating an unreal idea of North Korea where safety is an afterthought,” he said.
Safety should be a number one concern for any tourist company traveling into an isolated third-world country ruled by a totalitarian regime.
Reports of North Korean launching nuclear weapons appear every month — barbed wire, fences, and soldiers serve as a constant reminder of the realities of an unstable dictator.
YPT's website and Instagram evem dismisses the rules. The words “no rules apply on this tour” shows YPT's cocky attitude to North Korea's conservative regulations.
Last year, Johnson told Vice that soju is the best weapon to make friends with North Koreans. Bribes and booze — this is how Johnson built the “excellent relations” he boasts about on his website.
Another traveler, Adam Pitt, reported once on the trip, North Korean soldiers at the border ordered tourists off the train.
Johnson was so drunk at the time that he was “almost unable to stand and barely understandable when he did speak”, that he placed the group in danger.
Johnson, in his drunken state, paid off the guards with wads of cash.
“The boozy logic of the company and its trips was fuelled by a bizarre, maladaptive nihilism that, much like the panopticon-like nature of North Korea itself, we were all to some degree forced to engage with. This wasn't always completely bad. There was a lot of leeway with what we felt we could get away with in the supposedly “hermit” kingdom – and in truth most of the time we had a lot of fun feeling like we were flouting the rules and proving the world wrong. Warmbier's dash along the “secret floor” of the Yanggakdo International Hotel in Pyongyang was a rite of passage for misbehaving twenty somethings looking for thrills, spills and stories to brag about back home. These games were never discouraged by YPT – and several of us had a go. Warmbier's simple mistake was to unwittingly overstep the ambiguous boundaries by trying to bring back a forbidden trophy.”
Hoban admits that YPT's unreal version of North Korea is what attracted him.
“At the age of 23 I drank down the sales pitch of ‘budget trips to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from', and its logic of intrigue, adventure and daring – with no real sense of the risks.”
Warmbier's tale serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of traveling into a terrorist regime, no matter how appealing it may seem.
In an interview with The Telegraph, Warmbier's father strongly criticizes YPT for what they are doing. “This Chinese company has slick ads on the internet, claiming no American ever gets detained,” he said. “Otto is a young adventure-seeking kid. They lure Americans. And that's what happened to my son. He was trying to leave the country and he was taken hostage. They advertise it as the safest tour ever. But they provide fodder for the North Koreans. They took him hostage. And the outcome is self-evident.”
An unparalleled experience of fun with the wrong company might lead you to a life sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in a despotic regime.
Mashable has conducted an interesting interview with Tim Cook on the eve of WWDC, one of Apple's largest events of the year. Although WWDC is known for its product announcements, Apple will announce the next versions of iOS and OS X as well as a streaming music service, the interview revolved around Apple's efforts on company employee diversity.
Asked about the lack of women at keynotes, Cook says “you'll see a change tomorrow”. This suggests that women will indeed feature more prominently at Apple's presentation. In the last ten years, the number of women at Apple's events comes in at the low single digits, most recently Christy Turlington Burns. Apple's developer sessions have better gender diversity in their speakers but these are viewable only by registered developers, not the general public.

I'm incredibly impressed by these talented student scholarship winners. See you all tomorrow at #WWDC15 pic.twitter.com/LN1ZXmCqGf — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 8, 2015
Cook says improvements in diversity are the ‘future of our company'. He says that diverse groups of employees produce better products.
And that future, according to Cook, should be diverse: “I think the most diverse group will produce the best product, I firmly believe that,” he says. Even without taking its values into account, Apple is a “better company” by being more diverse.
Apple is working on outreach programs to high schools and colleges to find talented women. For WWDC, Apple expanded the scholarship program to target groups like the National Society of Black Engineers, App Camp for Girls and La TechLa. It's latest diversity report was not stellar and it is clear Cook wants to change this. Apple's own software features more diverse emoji since iOS 8.3.
As has become customary with WWDC, Tim Cook met the scholarship winners a day before the show kicks off, for photos and signatures. In the interview, Cook says “I view these people that I talk to today as the future generations of the company”.

Thousands of people have come together to mark one week since the Westminster attack, in which four victims and the attacker died.
Police officers, doctors and hundreds of members of a Muslim youth association were among those walking across Westminster Bridge in memory.
Leeds, Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester and Birmingham also had events.
Earlier, inquests into the victims' deaths were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court.
Khalid Masood killed three people when he drove his hire car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge last Wednesday.
Aysha Frade, 44, who worked at a London sixth-form college; US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah; and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London died.
After crashing, Masood then fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer outside Parliament, before being shot dead by police.
In a statement, Ms Frade's family said: "Our beloved Aysha; caring daughter, loving sister, amazing wife, irreplaceable aunt, thoughtful, supportive friend and the best and coolest of mummies.
"You were ripped away from our lives in the cruellest and most cowardly of ways. We now pray that you guide and protect not only us, but all of London, from further evil.
"You will always be remembered as our guardian angel who never shied away from facing up to bullies. There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and eternal void left in our hearts."

In Westminster on Wednesday, acting commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Craig Mackey said: "This afternoon is about remembering the victims of last week's events.
"Our thoughts, our prayers, go out to everyone who was affected by the events last week."
Zafir Malik, an imam from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, said his members were "here to show that we are united with our fellow countrymen and remembering those who have fallen, especially PC Keith Palmer".
As the vigil reached Parliament, dozens of people laid flowers on the side of the bridge, among them a man who was hurt in the attack.
At the scene
By Alex Therrien, BBC News
There was an atmosphere of solidarity as the silence was held on Westminster Bridge.
Just before the clock struck 14:40 BST, a group including police, children and faith leaders walked across the bridge, led by the banner "love for all, hatred for none".
When the silence finished, children and other members of the procession laid flowers near to where three pedestrians were killed by Masood.
Earlier, people held hands across the bridge in a symbol of unity.
Among those paying tribute was Danyal Ahmad, a trainee imam at the Baitul Futuh Mosque in south-west London.
The 21-year-old said his group, Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, wanted to show that Islam was about "love, peace and compassion".
His brother, Zishan Ahmad, a 25-year-old imam, who also attended the memorial, added: "You can't divide London - we stand together.
"It doesn't matter if you are Muslim, Christian or Jew, or black, brown or any other race. London will never be divided."
Brendan O'Connor, from Holborn, central London, said the memorial service sent a message that those seeking to divide London are "not going to stop us".
The 59-year-old added: "There's love here. You can't kill love with hate. Love always conquers."
Silence falls on packed bridge
Speaking as the inquests into the deaths of the four victims opened earlier on Wednesday, senior coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said it was a "tragic incident".
Senior investigating officer Det Supt John Crossley told the court Masood was armed with two knives and caused grave wounds when he attacked PC Palmer.
The father-of-two was wearing a stab vest, issued as routine to Metropolitan Police officers, but it was not enough to save him and he died at the scene.
Officers are examining a "large amount" of CCTV and footage taken by bystanders, which gives a "clear visual chronology" of how the 82-second incident unfolded.

He said: "Currently there are in excess of 1,500 potential witnesses, with accounts being taken from those who are deemed significant. This is currently in excess of 140."
The inquest heard details of how each of the victims had died.

Det Supt Crossley described how Masood, driving across Westminster Bridge, mounted the pavement twice in an apparently deliberate attempt to target pedestrians.
He crashed the car into the east perimeter railings of the Palace of Westminster, before going into the grounds to attack PC Palmer.
More than 35 people were injured in the attack. Twelve are still being treated in hospital, one of whom is in a coma.

The inquest into Masood's death will be opened and adjourned on Thursday.
In other developments:
Commons Speaker John Bercow told MPs that two reviews of the incident will be held
A preliminary report into how the perimeter of the parliamentary estate is secured and protected will be published by the end of April
A review into the "lessons learned" from the response will report back by the end of June
Earlier, acting Met Police commissioner Craig Mackey told London Assembly members last Wednesday was a "terrible" day but the capital's response had brought about "hope"
He said the force had an "extraordinary" level of firearms capability and it was quickly made available after the attack
The Met has announced that the funeral of PC Palmer will take place at Southwark Cathedral on 10 April
He will receive a full police service funeral, which will be followed by a private cremation
Earlier, the family of a Romanian woman who fell into the Thames during the attack said they had been overwhelmed by "love, support and respect" for her.
Andreea Cristea, 29, was on holiday with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz.

In a statement, the couple's families said Ms Cristea was still in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Mr Burnaz sustained a broken foot but has been discharged.
They added: "Our family is so grateful for the first responders, the medical personnel and the assistance of the UK government agencies."
Further questioning
The so-called Islamic State group has said it was behind Masood's attack, but police say they have so far found no evidence of an association with the group or al-Qaeda.
Two men were arrested in Birmingham under the Terrorism Act by police investigating the attack. One remains in custody after officers were granted warrants for further detention, while the other was released with no further action.

You may have read about the giant CNN screw-up over a #FakeNews story concerning Donald Trump Jr. in which the network claimed two sources both happened to misread the date on an email and accidentally concluded that Wikileaks was passing information to the Trump campaign before it was made public - when in fact the emails had been published days before.
The network issued an embarassing correction, both in print and on air:
Washington (CNN)Correction: This story has been corrected to say the date of the email was September 14, 2016, not September 4, 2016. The story also changed the headline and removed a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who posted a message about WikiLeaks on September 4, 2016.
In the wake of all that, George Takei tried to launch his own follow-up 'gotcha' at Trump Jr., tweeting 'Uh-oh, Donnie' - with a link to a new article from a left-leaning news outlet with a mixed reputation for factual reporting, which claims that a Russian social media executive emailed Jr. and campaign aide Dan Scavino, inviting them to create an account. OH MY GOD, EVEN IF TRUE. (............crickets...........)
In response, Trump Jr. launched a quantum torpedo and blasted Mr. Sulu into deep space...
Wrong again Georgie... I guess you have a bit more free time to read #fakenews now that it's a bit tougher to ply kids with alcohol to assault them??? You know with all the added scrutiny. https://t.co/xUbvbfhMxN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) December 10, 2017
Trump Jr. was, of course, referring to the accusation lodged against Takei by a former model who says that in 1981 he was invited to the 'Star Trek' icon's house when he was 23, plied with possibly spiked alcohol, and woke up to Mr. Sulu fondling his balls.
Takei denied the assault, saying the encounter "simply did not occur," however the actor's frequent appearances on the Howard Stern show where he admitted to 'grabbing men to persuade them' for sex and jerked off a guest didn't help his case.
I think it's safe to say, once again: Sulu down

A large collection of photos from the 19th and early 20th century is fraught with faces of doom and gloom — and occasionally a literal dead face. There are several theories for why people in early photographs were so solemn in front of a camera. One has to do with the camera itself.
Daguerreotype — the first commercially successful photographic process invented by Louis Daguerre in 1839 — had long exposure times. Moving objects were rendered blurry or not captured at all because of the time it took to record an image on a sheet of silver-plated copper. In portraiture, most thought it would be easier to hold a somber expression rather than a smile during the exposure time.
Watch the video above to learn more about why most early portraits were all business and no smiles.
Researchers from the University of Tokyo in Japan have created a new type of polymer glass that can heal itself from breaks and cracks at room temperature.
The new material was discovered by chance when Yu Yanagisawa, a graduate student at the Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology in the University of Tokyo, was carrying out some experiments under the guidance of Professor Takuzo Aida.
According to Yanagisawa, he actually intended to use the material as glue in an experiment. However, he found that he had actually created a sheet of glass able to heal itself at room temperature after being pressed together by hand.
“I hope the repairable glass becomes a new environment-friendly material that avoids the need to be thrown away if broken,” Yanagisawa told the local media.
This self-healing glass is made from a “polyether-thioureas”—a low weight polymer—which uses compound thiourea to enhance the ability of hydrogen bonding. Experiments revealed that the new polymer could regain its original strength after a couple of hours.
Yanagisawa also said that it took him some time and repeated experiments to believe that he had actually discovered a self-healing glass.
It is not the first time that a self-healing material has been found by researchers, but what makes the new material different from the earlier ones is its structurally robustness and self-healing properties at the same time. According to researchers, healing ability and high mechanical robustness have been found to be mutually exclusive. In the past some hard, healable materials were invented by researchers, but most of them were found to demand heating to high temperatures (120°C or more) for repairing of broken portions.
Researchers at the University of California had also proposed using a polymer able to stretch up to 50 times its original size and heal the cracks itself. This material took 24 hours for self-healing.
According to some experts, the new polymer glass has potential to be used in creating healable screen for smartphones and other fragile devices, which pose significant challenges for sustainable societies. Medicine is another field where this new material could find its application and be used to strengthen bones inside the human body.
The findings of the research were published in Science.
Datin Seri Paduka Rosmah Mansor says ‘you have to nip it [homosexuality] in the bud'
The wife of the Malaysian prime minister has defended the exclusion of protecting the rights of LGBT people in the controversial ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) declaration of human rights that was signed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia last week.
Datin Seri Paduka Rosmah Mansor said in an interview with Phnom Penh Post:
‘You know why HIV and AIDS occur… how it is being spread. Now the number of people suffering from HIV is alarming. What is it you want? Do you want to allow this… or do you want to contain it.
‘You have to nip [homosexuality] in the bud. If you don't, when the time comes and you have to stop [homosexuality], you will find it's too late.'
President of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, Ou Virak, described Rosmah's comments as ‘bogus and extremely homophobic'.
‘Come on, it's 2012,' Virak told Claire Knox of Phnom Penh Post. ‘The world knows this is not true. This confirms our fears about the declaration – that these clauses were included to give governments excuses to not uphold universal principles of human rights.'
Rosmah described human rights as ‘the rights of an individual based on what you believe in, based on your culture and your religion'. She said it was ‘fine' for other countries to recognize LGBT rights, they wanted to run Malaysia based on ‘high morality'.
In June Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammed Najib Abdul Razak described LGBT people as ‘deviant aspects' who do not ‘have a place in the country' in a statement about the economic and spiritual development of the country.
Over 60 human rights groups described the ASEAN declaration of human rights as ‘not worthy of its name'.
Republicans jumped on the report by the State Department watchdog accusing Hillary Clinton of flouting federal records rules and cybersecurity guidelines with her use of personal email while secretary of state, saying it showed she was in clear violation of the Federal Records Act and endangered national security.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement Wednesday that the “detailed inquiry by an Obama appointee makes clear Hillary Clinton hasn't been telling the truth since day one and her and her aides' refusal to cooperate with this probe only underscores that fact.”
The forthcoming inspector general audit, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by FoxNews.com, faults Clinton and her predecessors for poorly managing email and other computer information.
The report says the department was "slow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications." It cites "longstanding, systemic weaknesses" related to communications that started before Clinton's tenure.
But the report singles out Clinton's failures as more serious. The report includes numerous revelations, including that her server was at one point “attacked,” that Clinton declined to be interviewed for the audit and that Clinton never sought approval to use her personal account for government work.
“Although Clinton has long claimed her practices were like those of other Secretaries of State and allowed, the report states she was in clear violation of the Federal Records Act,” Priebus said.
“This report underscores what we already know about Hillary Clinton: she simply cannot be trusted,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. “Think about this, the highest ranking diplomat in the United States – the Secretary of State – deliberately broke agency policy to serve her own interests. Her use of a private email server not only violated department policies, but it was also a clear security risk.”
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump brought up the report during a campaign event Wednesday in Anaheim, Calif., saying, “She had a little bad news today,” and suggesting that she might not make it to the Democratic nomination.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the chairman of the congressional committee probing the Benghazi terror attacks said the only reason the records were available was due to “thorough congressional oversight.”
“While the emails have never been the focus of our investigation, it was necessary to obtain them, and this committee is the first and only one to do so,” Gowdy said. “If anyone wonders why the investigation is not yet complete, the malfeasance and numerous problems identified in this report are Exhibit A, and prove the committee has faced serial delays from day one at the hands of public officials who sought to avoid transparency and accountability."
Congressional Democrats spent most of the day on Wednesday playing down the State Department audit.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Clinton had acted "in good conscience" and that her email practices were "consistent" with what past secretaries of state had done.
The audit did not name any other secretaries who had done so.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, accused Republicans of attacking Clinton only because she is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“While Secretary Clinton preserved and returned tens of thousands of pages of her emails to the Department for public release, Secretary (Colin) Powell returned none,” he said in a statement. “Republicans need to stop wasting taxpayer dollars singling out Secretary Clinton just because she is running for President.”
