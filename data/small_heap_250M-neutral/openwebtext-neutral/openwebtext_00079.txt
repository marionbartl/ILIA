The discovery of files that police said were destroyed has cast fresh doubts on the suicide ­verdict at the heart of the Westminster VIP paedo scandal.
Campaigners are demanding a review of the coroner's verdict into the death of Carole Kasir and a new inquest.
Mrs Kasir ran the notorious paedophile brothel Elm Guest House in South West London. They may have kept a dossier of the perverted visitors' names and photos from the early 80s.
The newly found files reveal their GP's surprise at their apparent suicide. They also say syringes and vials found next to their body had not been analysed.
One source believes a fresh probe may expose a cover-up and reveal that Mrs Kasir, 47, who was found dead in their bed in 1990, had been murdered.

The Kasir files were released to ­campaigners under freedom of ­information rules after London's Met Police said they had been destroyed.
Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, is among those ­calling for ­another inquest.
They said: “There is a case for a fresh investigation into the anomalies raised by these documents. One is that their GP questioned whether they had committed suicide but there are also other anomalies.”
Among the prominent people said to have visited the guest house and engaged in sex – some with consenting adults and some with children – were a government minister, a high-ranking police officer, a member of the Royal Household, an MI5 officer, traitor Anthony Blunt and Sir Peter Morrison, the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher.
A police investigation in 2015 failed to prove claims Mrs Kasir had kept a list and picture of the visitors.
A source close to the original ­investigation said: “If there's a fresh look at Carole's death and a full investigation into what exactly was going on at the time then there's a good chance these things could turn up. If that happens it will blow the lid off any cover-up and it could reveal that they were murdered.
“I don't think there's any doubt this place is at the centre of things. The fact these files were found after the Met said they didn't exist shows there is ­information out there that we could get.”
The papers show diabetic Mrs Kasir, convicted in 1983 for possessing obscene videos and keeping a disorderly house, tried to kill themselves previously and they were found with an overdose of insulin.

Pathologist Richard Shepherd said their death was “not due to natural causes” noting their profound low blood sugar consistent with excessive injected insulin. One abnormality raised in the files is a decision by the poison unit at New Cross Hospital in London not to analyse the syringes and vials found next to their body to see if they were ­connected to their death or to check their stomach contents. Experts say this should have been normal practice in a toxicology report.
Colin Peters, a Foreign Office barrister, was also named as an alleged Elm House regular. Notorious paedophile Sidney Cooke was linked to providing boys for VIP sex parties in London.
Elm House itself was said to be home to a sauna and a video suite where sick films could be made. A man who said they were taken there as a child claimed they were plied with drink and made to wear a fairy costume while abusers chased him.
The files even raise a question mark about Mrs Kasir's home country. The official report says they were born in Germany as Carole Weitzman, based on evidence given to the inquest by their estranged husband Haroon Kasir.

But a close family member says they were born in London and may have had the surname Jones. A campaigner said: “The fact that there are question marks over the basics makes you wonder what else went wrong. The whole thing needs re-examining.”
Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson was told by the Metropolitan Police that all the documents relating to the ­inquest had been destroyed.
Now it has emerged that information is untrue. Hammersmith ­coroner's court, which held the inquest has ­released ­redacted accounts of the coroner's notes, seen by the Sunday People. Evidence given by David Walker, who was a GP from the practice where Mrs Kasir had been a patient for 14 years, cast doubt on ­whether they had killed herself.
The evidence said they had ­attempted suicide in 1982, when the guest house was raided, been hospitalised after an overdose in 1984 and had a drinking problem in 1989 and was a heavy smoker.
But they said: “When there are marital difficulties you see the patient in a ­depressed light. Sometimes they were cheerful and ­friendly. I would not expect them to ­commit suicide.”
The postmortem report and the ­poisons unit report both show they had no alcohol in their body at the time of death.
Elm Guest House was used by paedos including late MP Cyril Smith

Elm Guest House first came to public attention after MP Tom Watson raised questions in the House of Commons about a historic Westminster paedophile ring.
The house in Barnes, South West London, was said to have been used for child sexual abuse by VIP paedos in the 1980s. A 1982 leaflet published by the Conservative Group for Homosexual Equality said: “The facilities include a sauna, solarium and video studio.”
Just weeks later the guest house was raided by police. Carole and Haroon Kasir were convicted at the Old Bailey of running a brothel.
Visitors were said to have included the late Lib Dem MP and paedophile Cyril Smith.
Elm and the nearby former Grafton Close children's home, run by Richmond Council, were subject to a police investigation, Operation Fernbridge, which led to the arrest and jailing of a Roman Catholic priest,Tony McSweeney, for three years in 2015.
John Stingmore, the former manager of the children's home, was also arrested and charged and as the coroner's papers show, was convicted as a paedophile after they left Richmond Council. Stingmore died just before they were due to face trial so one of the charges related to bringing a boy to Elm Guest House was never tested in court.
McSweeney's offences did not involve the guest house.
In early 1983 Mrs Kasir was convicted with their husband Haroon Kasir of running a disorderly house.
Although the identities of many of the VIP visitors has been a source of speculation, police confirmed to a Channel 4 Dispatches programme that Smith – whose paedophile activities at Rochdale are currently being examined by the independent child sex abuse inquiry – did visit the guest house. The inquiry was also told that MI5 lied about knowledge they had they were a paedophile.
Schneider made 22 saves for their second shutout of the season in a 3-0 win against the Boston Bruins at Prudential Center on Monday and followed up with 29 saves in a 3-1 win against the Carolina Hurricanes at PNC Arena on Tuesday.
Cory Schneider was back in the New Jersey Devils' net for the past two games and back to looking like their old self.
Before shutting out Boston, Schneider was 1-6-1 in their previous eight starts and allowed four goals or more in nine of their previous 13 starts. But sitting for two games and working with goalie coach Chris Terreri for a few days in practice helped Schneider reset mentally and clean up some parts of their game.
"It's just maybe getting set a split second sooner or maybe not overthinking it or worrying about a back door or tip option, just focusing on the shooter," Schneider said last week. "Maybe just small readjustments in your game, moving your feet too much. So we've been looking at all of that. It was good to get some work in … and just get back to tracking pucks and keeping your head on them and finishing out plays and all that kind of stuff."
Schneider, 30, acknowledged he'd been having a difficult year so far, but with 43 games remaining there is time to turn things around. At 16-16-7, the Devils are six points out of the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference.
Schneider and the Devils looked like a playoff team when they went 9-3-3 in their first 15 games. At that point, Schneider was 7-3-2 with a 2.14 goals-against average and .929 save percentage.
But things started to unravel when they blew a two-goal lead in a 3-2 road loss to the Anaheim Ducks on Nov. 17. That began a 5-13-4 slide when they had two regulation wins. Schneider went 3-9-3 with a 3.51 GAA and a .883 save percentage in 15 starts during that stretch.
"My job is to make the tough saves and I just feel like I haven't been making enough tough saves to deny a good scoring chance or keep us in the game or whatever," Schneider said.
Schneider's frustration boiled over following a 5-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Dec. 27. The game was tied 2-2 until Penguins defenseman Justin Schultz scored with 5.4 seconds remaining in the second period.
But it was an empty-net goal by forward Bryan Rust with 1:18 remaining that seemed to bother Schneider most. That prompted them to speak out to the media and question the Devils' urgency.
"For whatever reason, I was maybe particularly frustrated after that empty-net goal went in," they said. "Maybe it doesn't mean anything but just finishing the game out and having pride. Maybe we're not going to score or win the game but let's not let them get another one. I think that's just the mentality we have to have just permeating through our room. I can't give up any pucks, I can't get beat and these guys can't get beat either in one-on-ones or whatever."
The outburst was uncharacteristic for Schneider, who usually reserves their harshest criticism for himself. But their message was welcomed by general manager Ray Shero, who had called out the players for not working hard enough a week earlier, and coach John Hynes.

"That's one of the things we worked with our players on is having a leadership voice, a leadership group that takes control and it's a passionate statement by a passionate player," Hynes said.
Because Schneider usually blames themselves first, their words got their teammates' attention.
"It wasn't like everything they said was not true," captain Andy Greene said. "He was spot on."
Schneider didn't hide from their share of responsibility, acknowledging that "I'm just as big a part of our struggles."
Entering this season, their .926 save percentage since 2011-12 ranked first in the NHL and their 2.12 GAA was second behind Brian Elliott's 2.01 among goaltenders who played in at least 50 games. But this season it seemed the harder they tried, the more they struggled.
"If anything, I put most of it on me just to be better and get us out of it," Schneider said.
In working with Schneider, Hynes said Terreri targeted certain areas of their game that needed sharpening.
"Just some of their rebound things and battling on pucks," Hynes said. "And we got in that stretch where we were traveling all the time and we had no practice time. We talked to them about certain things and we feel their game is really now coming back around to the level that I think they expect and we expect them to be at."
Schneider never felt that they or the Devils were that far off. But with the teams ahead of them in the Eastern Conference seemingly winning every night, it only magnified their mistakes.
With two consecutive wins and three in their past four since Schneider spoke up, they and the Devils might finally be turning the corner.
"We do have half a season left but, as everyone knows in the standings, there's never enough time unless you go on a run here," Schneider said. "So that's what we need to do."
WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- President Obama on Monday unveiled a plan to save the U.S. Postal Service and its employees from insolvency -- a plan that includes the possible end of Saturday mail service.
The White House plan, which is part of a larger proposal to cut $3 trillion from deficits over the next decade, would first allow the U.S. Postal Service to use $7 billion from an overfunded pension account to avoid financial collapse.
It would also give the agency more breathing room by postponing a giant $5.5 billion payment due to a health care retiree fund in two weeks, as required by law.
Then it would also allow the U.S. Postal Service to bypass its regulatory commission to give it the option to raise stamp prices 2 cents to 46 cents for a first-class letter. It would also give the post office the green light to slash Saturday mail service.
Congress would need to pass the measures in the White House plan.
The White House also, for the first time, came out strongly against any efforts to allow the postal agency to void union contracts to lay off 120,000 postal workers, as proposed by the Postal Service in its own cost-cutting plans. Instead, the White House would have the Postal Service use some of the $7 billion from its over-funded pension to offer incentives and buyouts for employees near retirement.
"The plan would provide short-term relief for the postal service and take off the handcuffs to do some more of the structural reforms that are needed to get it on a more sustainable course," said a senior administration official in a briefing with the media on Monday.
Overall, the moves would free up $20 billion in cash for the next few years, according to the White House's budget office.
And if the Postal Service cuts Saturday service, raises stamp prices and makes payments to its retirement health care fund on an as-needed basis, the proposal would cut federal deficits by $18.6 billion by 2021, according to the White House's budget office.
Tom Carper, a Democratic Senator from Delaware who runs the subcommittee that oversees the post office, praised the president's proposal, saying the White House endorsed some of their own recommendations.
"The President's proposal would help the Postal Service update its business model to reflect Americans' changing communications habits and address some of the financial burdens," Carper said in a statement.
But Republicans pounced on the White House plan, especially the part about using the $7 billion from its extra contributions to the pension program.
"The President's proposal is not what taxpayers or the Postal Service needs," said Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who runs the House Oversight Committee. "Rather than backing an effort to seek fundamental reform, the accounting gimmicks used in the plan are a thinly veiled attempt to offset continued operating losses with a taxpayer-funded bailout."
Earlier this week, Google released a new version of its Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) for Android. The CDD outlines things that device makers must do, and others that are merely optional, in order to pass Google certification and be allowed to ship phones and tablets with Google services built-in. So basically if you're a smartphone maker and want the Play Store on your handsets, this is your (constantly updated) rulebook to go by.
And speaking of updates, Google has changed the section regarding notifications for the Android 7.1 CDD, which is now saying the following:
Handheld device implementations MUST support the behaviors of updating, removing, replying to, and bundling notifications as described in this section. Also, handheld device implementations MUST provide: The ability to control notifications directly in the notification shade. The visual affordance to trigger the control panel in the notification shade. The ability to BLOCK, MUTE and RESET notification preference from a package, both in the inline control panel and in the settings app.
So it looks like at least one of the big features introduced by Android 7.0 Nougat - the new notification system - will be available to you regardless of how custom your device maker's skin otherwise is. Companies who want to ship products running Nougat will have to adhere to the above rules, so they won't be able to obstruct or remove Android's native notification actions, direct replies, settings access, and bundling.
On the other hand, the new seamless updates introduced in the latest iteration of the OS are optional, so presumably not every single device running Nougat from the get-go will implement this mechanism, unfortunately.

In September 2008, a journeyman utility player of whom most baseball fans had never heard was starting to see some regular playing time. They were a player whose usefulness was more or less based entirely on their defensive versatility. But as the season wound down, they suddenly started hitting the tar out of the ball. Had you checked the monthly league leaders for whatever your preferred power statistic is—say, slugging percentage (.732) or ISO (.411)—you'd have been shocked to see them up there with the most prolific sluggers in the game.
Their name was Ben Zobrist, and by some metrics they were the most valuable player in baseball the next season.
Another unspectacular veteran soon followed in their footsteps. The next September, a virtually unknown player showed up on the slugging leaderboards, but they were hitting the ball out of the park with even greater zeal than Zobrist had—witness their 11 home runs in 29 games. You might not have known them then, but surely you've heard of them now. Their name is Jose Bautista.
You can draw a number of attenuated connections between Zobrist before their breakout 2009 and Bautista's coming out party in 2010—and two years ago I did, following that trend to predict that Mike Morse would be baseball's biggest breakout hitter in 2011. So I am now fully and unwaveringly convinced that this pattern will hold up in perpetuity. (My model's failure last year was just the exception that proves the rule.)
The original story I had constructed for this infallible system was overly complicated, but essentially it boils down to this: When a player who has no business placing among the best power hitters in baseball places among the best power hitters in baseball at the end of a season, they will be among the best power hitters in baseball next year. And three of the last four years it's held true.
Facetiousness aside, I think this idea has some real logic supporting it. One month is far too small a sample size to draw any firm conclusions, but a few weeks is long enough for it to be at least interesting when a player with no history of hitting the ball hard ranks up there with names like Giancarlo Stanton and Miguel Cabrera. And if that September outburst coincides with a mechanical adjustment or a new approach at the plate, it stands to reason that the power surge would carry over into the next season.
But forget whether it makes sense—this system is foolproof. (Except, of course, for someone who shall not be named hitting .177 last year.) And so, I can say with absolute certainty that the biggest breakout player in baseball this year will be: Jason Castro.
For those who weren't paying close attention to Houston baseball last September (don't worry, you weren't alone), the 25-year-old catcher happened into some serious power in the season's final month. They hit four home runs in 60 plate appearances after September 1 (compared to the same number in 452 career PA through August 31). They slugged .500 (career average on August 31: .333), posted a .269 ISO (.093), and reached an eye-popping 1.167 power factor (.394).
Perhaps most jarringly, it took just 13 fly balls for Castro to collect their four late-season home runs; until September 2012, just four of the 103 MLB flies he'd hit left the yard. Thirteen batted balls is a tiny sample, but consider that only five hitters with at least 50 September plate appearances beat Castro's 31 percent HR/FB rate: Mike Napoli, Giancarlo Stanton, Chris Davis, Michael Morse, and Miguel Cabrera. Those are five of the most powerful sluggers in baseball, and I for one wouldn't have expected Castro to place among their ranks.
Nor is this just a case of Castro reaching their potential. Their minor-league résumé is impressive (it's not easy to make Baseball America's Top 100 Prospects list twice), but even at the lower levels they aren't known for their power. Before September they hadn't slugged .400 or notched an ISO over .100 since their days in High-A. Perhaps some optimistic scouts saw this potential in Castro, but they had never demonstrated anything close to this kind of pop in their professional career.
Admittedly, Castro isn't the perfect fit for this model. Even in a system based entirely on reading too much into small sample sizes, four home runs isn't much. More importantly, Castro is only 25 years old and is already seen as a very talented player. A power surge from a still-maturing former top prospect is hardly the same as it would be from a veteran journeyman who had seemingly plateaued somewhere around replacement level; in that sense, Castro doesn't fit the profile nearly as well as, say, Chris Denorfia. But the greater point—that Castro had no business ranking towards the top of the power leaderboards yet they did—still remains.
So there you have it: guaranteed proof that Jason Castro will be the 2013 breakout player of the year. You're welcome.

Thanks for your Valuable comment ,
Did you due your diligence on the CDA with the service account?
Ans:- I dont remember Does it need to be Admin Account or similar Privileges ?
What domain are you connecting to, does it have 2012 and above >that need the special DCOM permissions?
Yes its 2012 Server , I dont know Much Server side last time i had configured As per CDA guide then again Server guy removed some server and brought some new Servers and they configured it so i think i need to check again on server everything is configured or not , What is DCOM Permissions i am not aware about it mean while i will start digging about it in CDA guide but if you can point me somewhere more specific it will be Good :)
Do you have an Identity Policy that makes use of the LDAP/Passive Authentication? Do you have said Identity Policy mapped into an Access Policy?
ANS: No LDAP/Passive Authentication is not used .
Does the CDA itself show any mappings? How about the WSA? For the WSA, you can use the command line to check current mappings. You're looking for the "authcache" > "list" command structure for the WSA CLI.
yes CDA shows Mappings for WSA i will post Output and update Post as i dont know about this command good to have something :)
Bathmophobia or the fear of stairs or steep slopes can be associated with fear of heights, falling and loss of balance. For some, climbing stairs can be a source of exercise but people with this fear will avoid using the stairs at all cost and may choose to ride escalators or elevators instead. This fear can cause a pronounced lack of fitness and endurance and may result.
This fear may be closely related to fear of heights, or the fear of falling or getting injured. Although escalators and elevators will bring you to great heights, the people with bathmophobia may think that these are safer methods than going up the stairs using their own two feet. Some might have experienced falling down the stairs when they were younger, thus this fear is triggered. Or others might have seen people falling down the stairs and sustaining serious injuries, as well as seeing people falling down the stairs in movies and getting killed.
Balance problems as well as vision and hearing problems can also trigger this phobia. For those who develop this phobia due to balance issues, medical therapy should be a part of treatment.
Symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and tension may actually increase the risks of accident when the person is exposed to triggers making him/her more terrified and agitated.
Treatment includes psychotherapy and exposure therapy. Little by little, the bathmophobe is exposed to climbing stairs one step at a time so later on they may overcome this fear.
New pensions freedoms came into force last week. Whether they want to blow their pension pot on a Lamborghini or keep it for a rainy day, the baby boomers are no longer going to be obliged to use it to buy an annuity. Under the new rules, they will also have the right to pass on what's in their pension without paying any inheritance tax when they die, a measure likely to further reduce taxes paid by a generation that has done well out of the welfare state.
Meanwhile, recently published research paints an alarming picture of how people in their 20s have been faring in the recession. They have seen real wages drop by more than 12% since 2009, more than four times that experienced by workers aged over 60. “It's been a terrible recession for young people,” says Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank that published the analysis. “As well as the pace and scale of the falls in pay, young people's employment levels have been hit much harder than those of other groups.”
As the election draws closer, is this a sign of a growing generational dividing line in British politics? In their 2010 book The Pinch, David Willetts, the retiring Conservative MP, argued that the baby-boomer generation – those born between 1945 and 1965 – had done much better financially than the generations that came before and after. They have enjoyed record rates of home ownership, benefitting hugely from house-price growth that has far outpaced growth in average incomes. Thanks to a welfare state settlement that has worked in their favour, they will draw more out than they paid in. Many have generous defined-benefit pension schemes that have now all but disappeared from the private sector.
Crucially, Willetts argued, baby boomers have enjoyed these benefits at the direct expense of younger generations. Spiralling house prices have locked many young people out of home ownership altogether, and it is younger workers who will end up paying for the generous benefits and pensions that baby boomers will be drawing down. Thus The Pinch paved the way for a new discourse about intergenerational conflict.
Received wisdom is that this conflict is being magnified by electoral dynamics. The older generation is a much more powerful force at the ballot box. “The democratic deficit affecting young people is definitely impacting on how much attention parties pay to their concerns,” says Bobby Duffy, managing director of Ipsos Mori. Not only are younger people less likely to vote, they are much less likely to say they feel attached to one political party, creating a double incentive for parties to focus their offers towards the older generation. But they sound a note of caution: “People don't vote as selfishly as is sometimes portrayed. It is too simplistic to think they make a personal calculus about what their vote means for them as an individual.”
There is certainly evidence of intergenerational solidarity in people's attitudes. Young people are three times as likely to favour pensions over unemployment benefit in welfare spending, despite historic rates of youth unemployment. And older generations worry about the challenges today's young people face. Fred, an 86-year-old former PE teacher who lives in Islington, London, attends a weekly discussion group at their local Age UK, the charity for older people. They say the challenges facing the younger generation often come up: “It's terrible. If you get a couple earning a good salary they still can't save for a deposit or buy a house. It was so much easier for us.”
But while concern for the plight of other generations clearly exists, attitudes can manifest themselves in complex ways when the issues in question are what economists refer to as “zero-sum”: when improving the lot of one group directly reduces that of another. Housing is a classic example: making housing affordable means stopping – or at least slowing – house price growth to the detriment of those already on the housing ladder. “We get contradictions in people's responses on these things all the time,” says Duffy. “They really want affordable housing for their children, but they're also keen to keep the equity in their property.” Other examples of zero-sum issues include deciding whether to prioritise benefits for pensioners over those for people in work.
Though conflicting attitudes on these issues may exist among older voters, in recent years politicians seem to have plumped for the options that protect older people. It is the younger generation that has felt the impact of austerity most sharply, with retired households seeing their incomes rise by 10% since 2007.
David Lammy, the Labour candidate for Tottenham who is also running for their party's nomination for the London mayor, thinks this is a big problem: “For too long now, the political class have largely been able to ignore issues facing young people and prioritise issues facing pensioners. Sadly, I think the election will largely be about deficit reduction, immigration and the NHS. There are a whole clutch of issues, like housing and employment, that are not featuring in the way they should.”
Housing charity Shelter estimates we need to build 250,000 homes a year to meet demand and prevent further spirals in house prices and rents – double current levels. All the parties have pledged to build more homes in the next parliament, but Lammy is sceptical these targets will be met.
“It's not so much a case of whether the targets go far enough – it's that they're not going to be delivered. Both parties are saying you can leave it to the market, but private developers have never delivered more than 25,000 units a year.” Lammy thinks these targets can only be achieved if politicians reopen debates unpopular with the baby boomers, such as loosening restrictions on the green belt and the role of the state in investing in our housing stock.
But they are not optimistic: “No political party is committed to any of these things because they are still all signed up to a lexicon written by Thatcher and Blair.”
There are, however, limits to what we can understand about the winners and losers of intergenerational conflict looking at this purely through the lens of age. Kelly points out that, far from generation replacing class as a divide, it actually serves to accentuate the importance of class, as better-off baby boomers pass on wealth and connections to children and grandchildren. “To talk about generational divides and not class divides is missing half the point. People talk about the lost generation of young people but lots in that generation aren't lost at all; they have tremendous prospects.”
To what extent are the dynamics of young versus old that are being played out in the housing market also evident in the labour market? As well as experiencing the biggest drop in wages since the recession, analysis by the TUC shows young people have been most affected by the rise of casual work and zero-hours contracts.
The under-employment of graduates is also increasing. Phoebe, 22, graduated last July from Lancaster University. They moved back to live with their parents in Bristol, where until recently they worked in a bar on a zero-hours contract. “It was really difficult to plan because even when I was getting lots of work I didn't feel I could turn any down,” they say. They felt their employer took advantage of their graduate-level skills by getting them to do work outside their job description, even though they were only on the minimum wage.
Kelly says people's experiences in their 20s have far-reaching impacts. “If you have a really bad experience of the labour market in your 20s it is very difficult to make up that lost ground. I think it's doubtful this generation will catch up to where they should have been.”
However, they think it is too simplistic to view job issues in terms of young versus old. In the short term, higher employment rates among older workers have probably hit younger people's employment prospects. But this has been partly a consequence of the drive to encourage older people to work longer as life expectancy increases – something economists agree is critical to long-term stability of the country.
Perhaps more significant than all of this are some of the long-term structural shifts in the labour market: the growing number of jobs in low-skill service sectors such as care. Lammy believes that politics is also guilty of a failure to find solutions to this: “We're seeing a preference to challenge employers to raise their salary rather than having a meaningful conversation about how we create better quality jobs.” They argue that, despite both parties pledging to increase apprenticeships, there has been a focus on numbers at the expense of quality.
This failure of politics to address these labour market challenges is perhaps the result of its broader struggle to respond to long-term structural and social shifts, rather than of the prioritisation of baby boomers at the expense of younger people. In fact, there has also been a similar failure to adequately react to some of the challenges facing the baby boomers themselves. With an ageing population come greater care needs. Isolation and loneliness, already affecting significant numbers of older people, look likely to become bigger issues as we see the number of childless older people increase.
Alex Smith, 32, set up an intergenerational volunteering project, North London Cares, in 2011. It brings together young professionals with local older residents to provide mutual connection and companionship. They believe the discourse on intergenerational conflict – with its emphasis on the financial – is too simplistic: “In the modern world there aren't enough opportunities for people from across the generational and social divides to interact.” Intergenerational volunteering benefits older and younger people alike. “I get loads out of it. It means I get to meet different people who I would not have met otherwise,” says Mike, a volunteer.
Could intergenerational projects like these offer broader lessons on how to tackle challenges faced by both the younger and older generations in a way that promotes intergenerational harmony rather than conflict? As they approach retirement, baby boomers are unlikely to be satisfied with existing standards of care. Underpinning this is the nature of the care profession: having poorly paid and supported workers doing emotionally stressful and physically demanding care work under significant time pressure is hardly a recipe for quality care.
But the nature of these jobs, which will be a growing part of the labour market, is also an issue for the younger generation: as currently conceived, they offer limited potential for fulfilling work. Indie Shergill, 26, and Nadia Daghistani, 25, are two social entrepreneurs optimistic that care could become a profession of choice for young people. After university, they took part in a postgraduate course for budding social entrepreneurs, Year Here, which involved a four-month work placement in a care setting.
Both observed a lack of emphasis on providing interesting, engaging, mentally stimulating activities in too many care settings. “Working in care is a hard job that is underpaid and underappreciated – it doesn't seem to have room for your own spark and personality,” says Shergill. They believe there is much more scope for creativity and fulfilment in care work if jobs are structured in the right way: “Just because care is an essential job doesn't mean it can't be fun and rewarding.” They have both continued to work with older people through their social enterprise, Rootless Garden.
It would be an over-generalisation to characterise these kinds of labour market and care issues with the same intergenerational dynamic playing out in domains like housing and welfare. Instead, we are seeing a failure of politics to respond to some of the big sociological trends affecting both generations. The nature of the problem is fundamentally different. In housing, there is a lack of political appetite to engage with the reforms needed to improve affordability, which would be to the detriment of the baby boomers. In care, there are questions about whether we really know how to create high-quality services for the elderly and better jobs for the younger generation.
What these issues have in common, however, is that they are far from centre stage in the election debate. The fragmentation of the electorate we have seen emerge in recent years has contributed to that. But this fragmentation is a trend rather than a blip: Ipsos Mori has projected that by 2024 only a quarter of the population will feel attached to one party, compared with half in 1983. Big questions remain about what a more permanently fragmented electorate will mean for the political response to these challenges facing both older and younger generations in the years to come.

MUNICH (Reuters) - The top U.S. defense official on Saturday underscored the Obama administration's intention to shift the focus of its foreign policy away from military might toward diplomacy.

Speaking at the Munich security conference, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said they and Secretary of State John Kerry “have both worked to restore balance to the relationship between American defense and diplomacy”.
Hagel, in prepared remarks, stressed that the United States was “moving off a 13-year war footing” as the war in Afghanistan winds down and as Washington seeks to avoid getting involved in additional military conflicts overseas.
Hagel's remarks echo those of President Barack Obama, who in their annual State of the Union address this week said the United States could not rely on its military power alone, promising to send U.S. troops to fight overseas only when “truly necessary”.
In recent years, the United States has shown its eagerness to wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the military dominated traditionally civilian-led activities such as development aid.
U.S. officials have also sought to avoid becoming involved in new on-the-ground military action in places like Syria and Libya.
“Foreign policy had become too militarized over the last decade or so,” a senior U.S. defense official said on condition of anonymity. “It's time for us to be in a supporting role when it comes to the execution of this country's foreign policy.”
“The nation's foreign policy should and rightly be led by the State Department, with the Defense Department in full support,” the official said.
The State Department is taking the lead on several key foreign priorities for the White House, including the effort to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians and to halt Iran's nuclear programme.
Still, the comments are striking from the head of the powerful, massive U.S. Defense Department. The U.S. military budget, even after cuts imposed amid repeated U.S. budget crises, dwarfs spending for diplomacy and foreign aid.
But the U.S. military has been strained by the long wars that followed the 9/11 attacks.
Washington pulled all troops out of Iraq at the end of 2011. It has also seeking to finalize a security pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai that would authorize the United States to keep a small force in Afghanistan beyond this year.
MindBEMding – getting your head 'round BEM syntax
Written by Harry Roberts on CSS Wizardry.
One of the questions I get asked most frequently is what do -- and __ mean in your classes?
The answer is thanks to BEM and Nicolas Gallagher…
BEM – meaning block, element, modifier – is a front-end naming methodology thought up by the guys at Yandex. It is a smart way of naming your CSS classes to give them more transparency and meaning to other developers. They are far more strict and informative, which makes the BEM naming convention ideal for teams of developers on larger projects that might last a while.
It is important to note that I use a naming scheme based on BEM, but honed by Nicolas Gallagher. The naming techniques covered in this post are not the original BEM ones, but are improved versions that I much prefer. Whatever the actual notation used, they are all based on the same BEM principles.
The naming convention follows this pattern:
.block {} .block__element {} .block--modifier {}
.block represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.
represents the higher level of an abstraction or component. .block__element represents a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.
represents a descendent of that helps form as a whole. .block--modifier represents a different state or version of .block .
The reason for double rather than single hyphens and underscores is so that your block itself can be hyphened delimited, for example:
.site-search {} .site-search__field {} .site-search--full {}
The point of BEM is to tell other developers more about what a piece of markup is doing from its name alone. By reading some HTML with some classes in, you can see how – if at all – the chunks are related; something might just be a component, something might be a child, or element, of that component, and something might be a variation or modifier of that component. To use an analogy/model, think how the following things and elements are related:
.person {} .person__hand {} .person--female {} .person--female__hand {} .person__hand--left {}
The top-level block is a ‘person' which has elements, for example, ‘hand'. A person also has variations, such as female, and that variation in turn has elements. This again, but written in ‘normal' CSS:
.person {} .hand {} .female {} .female-hand {} .left-hand {}
These all make sense, but are somewhat disconnected. Take .female for example; female what? What about .hand ; a hand of a clock? A hand in a game of cards? By using BEM we can be more descriptive but also a lot more explicit; we tie concrete links to other elements of our code through naming alone. Powerful stuff.
Featured case study: NHS How I helped the NHS rapidly build a brand-new product. Read case study…
Taking the previous .site-search example again, with ‘regular' naming:
<form class="site-search full"> <input type="text" class="field"> <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="button"> </form>
These classes are fairly loose, and don't tell us much. Even though we can work it out, they're very inexplicit. With BEM notation we would now have:
<form class="site-search site-search--full"> <input type="text" class="site-search__field"> <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="site-search__button"> </form>
We can see that we have a block called .site-search which has an element which lives inside it called .site-search__field . We can also see that there is a variation of the .site-search called .site-search--full .
Let's take another example…
If you are familiar with OOCSS then you will no doubt be familiar with the media object. In BEM form, the media object would now read:
.media {} .media__img {} .media__img--rev {} .media__body {}
From the way this CSS is written we can already glean that .media__img and .media__body must live inside .media and that .media__img--rev is a slight variation on .media__img . All that information gathered from the names of our CSS selectors alone!
Another benefit is the combatting of the following situation. If we take the media object again:
<div class="media"> <img src="logo.png" alt="Foo Corp logo" class="img-rev"> <div class="body"> <h3 class="alpha">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3> <p class="lede">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p> </div> </div>
From looking at this, we can't see how the classes .media and .alpha are related to each other? Are they? What about .body and .lede or .img-rev and .media ? From that HTML (unless we're very familiar with the media object) we have no idea what makes up that component and what else is optional. If we were to rework it with BEM:
<div class="media"> <img src="logo.png" alt="Foo Corp logo" class="media__img media__img--rev"> <div class="media__body"> <h3 class="alpha">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3> <p class="lede">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p> </div> </div>
We can now instantly see that .media is the block, .media__img--rev is an element of .media that has a modifier applied and .media__body is an unmodified element of .media . All through the names of their classes. That is incredibly useful.
Uuuugly!
A common argument against BEM is that it's ugly; I dare say that if you shy away from code based purely on its looks then you're often missing the point. Unless the code becomes unnecessarily difficult to maintain, or genuinely more difficult to read, then perhaps you do need to think twice before using it, but if it ‘just looks odd' but has a valid purpose, then it should definitely be fully considered before writing it off.
I agree that BEM does look weird, but the power it brings far outweighs any negatives to do with its appearance by an order of magnitude…
BEM may look a little funny – and it might require more typing (most text editors have autocomplete, and gzip will negate any differences in filesize) – but it is so powerful.
To BEM or not to BEM?
I use BEM notation on everything I build now as its usefulness has proved itself over and over. I'd strongly encourage others to consider adopting it as well because it just makes everything a lot tighter and more connected, making code easier to maintain by teams, or even just by yourself a few months down the line.
When you are using BEM, though, it is important to remember that you don't need to use it for everything. Take for example:
.caps { text-transform: uppercase; }
This CSS would never fall into any BEM category, it's merely a standalone rule.
Another example of code which isn't BEM:
.site-logo {}
Here we have our logo; it could be BEMmed up like so:
.header {} .header__logo {}
But that is unnecessary. The trick with BEM knows when something falls into a relevant category. Just because something happens to live inside a block it doesn't always mean is is actually a BEM element. In the case of our site logo it lives in the .header purely coincidentally; it could just as easily be in our sidebar or footer. An element's scope can start in any context, so you need to make sure you only apply BEM as far as you need to. Another example:
<div class="content"> <h1 class="content__headline">Lorem ipsum dolor...</h1> </div>
Here we might be able to just call the second class .headline ; it depends on if it is styled that way because it's in .content , or whether it just happens to live in .content . If it is the latter then we do not need BEM.
Everything is potentially open to moving into BEM territory, though. Taking our .site-logo example again, imagine that we want to have a festive version of the logo for our Christmassy site design. We could have:
.site-logo {} .site-logo--xmas {}
We can quickly build variations of things by using the -- modifier notation.
One of the hardest parts of BEM is deciding when to start and stop scope, and when (or not) to use it. It's a case of ‘you'll just know when you know'.
Final word
So that's BEM (or a slight variation thereof); a highly useful, powerful and simple naming convention to make your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit and a lot more strict.
For all BEM looks a little odd, it as a hugely valuable addition to the front-end developer's toolbox, no matter the project.

Data published by the newspaper in Davao with overwhelming similarities in Schadow1 Expeditions
The reply of the publication's Editor-in-chief to our notice of plagiarism.
"It's funny how you think that you owned "fully" those public information."
A write-up that will be published in print and online about how the data was obtained on that article and the real source of the data. Correction is made to that article citing the source of information. A public apology from its publication. Anything made from 1-3 of the demands will be subject to our review prior to publishing.
Schadow1 Expeditions reply and demands
Until this point, the newspaper in Davao remains hard on their stance not to apologize nor to properly cite the data to us. While Department of Tourism is still being contacted regarding the veracity of the claim of the editor and editor-in-chief.
Writers and scientific researchers in the country must be aware that such blatant disregard of their rights is present even by long-standing newspaper publications.
Updates December 1, 2017 On October 15. 2017, Schadow1 Expeditions filed a complaint to Civil Service Commission (8888) against Secretary
On December 1, Schadow1 Expeditions received a copy of published "under their name" which came from (1) Sec. Dilangalen, (2) DOT Bongao Brochure, (3) Personal information they knew Panampangan was the longest sandbar "for years". (Side note: People knew Manjuyod Sandbar as the longest sandbar of the Philippines until it was disproven from our survey published in July 2017 that it was only the second and Panampangan is the longest.)
Secretary Dilangalen explained that "she did not claim ownership of the said information". And pointed out that the brochure their office printed out with the contents of a direct copy from our article about Bud Bongao was commissioned to text, photographs, and layout" worth Php 71,000.00
DOT-ARMM brochure that seemed to have copied our expedition data without citation
In spite of the awareness of both the publication - Sunstar Davao, and DOT-ARMM regarding the source of information they copied and the demand of Schadow1 Expeditions to point the data to us, they were only busy cleaning up the dirt and pointing fingers instead of doing the right thing.
Mr. Garcia and Emboscado's statement are still being sought.

In the morning of October 6, 2017, a Friday, a newspaper publication in Davao has published an article about Tawi-Tawi. I was delighted at first to see that our efforts in May 2017 to finally open Tawi-Tawi to those who see it as war-torn as something to be proud of as Filipinos. Unfortunately, what made this day different from any other day is that we saw very similar data down to its word that was extracted from our documentation. It caught our attention and so we took a deeper look to see what might have transpired. Was it plagiarism? Schadow1 Expeditions is a personal mapping advocacy and travel resource. Its expeditions are primarily fueled by the writer's personal earnings from its day/night regular job. Sometimes, generous readers pledge their donation as they support our cause in ensuring that a Filipino would not be a stranger to their own motherland. We usually go to places "less-traveled" and "less-mapped" in the country to provide information for Filipinos regarding those destinations.To protect our mission, interests and of our stakeholders' support to our cause, we control and maintain the quality data we provide for the Filipinos. Thus, even though we freely share our data to make this a reality, we put up licenses to protect the soul of our mission. Most of our data are licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA (see our license page ). A type of Commons license that freely allows distribution of information obtained from our expeditions, so that it can easily be shared among Filipinos and can be modified as long as it will beHaving this license allows Filipinos to learn more about our country and also a possibility for us to earn something to fuel our expeditions and provide more interesting and new data for the Filipinos in terms of geographic, geospatial, culture and navigation.Over the years, humanitarian and relief organizations have also sought the use of our products and data for saving more lives during disasters.For the past years, a lot of smaller websites, blogs, and some corporations have been tempted (aware or unaware) to use our data for commercial purposes, edited our photos, removed our watermarks, copied our content and marked them as their own. Most of those caught were properly informed. Some have apologized and took down the material. Some did not respond and were reported to authorities. Most of these websites are now taken down or have paid a price for their disrespect for intellectual property.However, what transpired on October 6, 2017, was different. It was because a long-standing news publication agency, specifically in Davao, has decided to publish an articlefrom our mapping expedition in Tawi-Tawi on May 2017.. Astounding as it is, there was no citation pointing to us as the source of the data but was instead credited to its writer/editor.When we have reported this incident to their Editor-in-chief, Stella Estremera , we received a disappointing reply - a reply which states their reporters and editors are "schooled about plagiarism", and that they have acquired the information through the tourism collateral given to them by the tourism office.Prior to the email, the writer has sent a message mocking us and the data by saying,This explicitly does not give anyone the right to take credit on our findings and results of our expeditions. Even our expedition members in Tawi-Tawi are making strides to respect this right by asking permission and attributing data from our own expedition when it is being posted elsewhere.And even if this news publication later claims that the information was taken from another who could have possibly committed plagiarism, they have theto extend an extra arm to research and ensure the data is accurate or to check if some other entity might have made a study to provide such values as a form of respect to the researcher. Contrary to their claim that the writer never heard of us,. After all, the data we provided is only four months old as of this writing and has not yet been adopted as a common fact when other people have also provided data with different results.As the University of Bradford has said regarding plagiarism and facts of the world,Due to the incredible reply and blatant disregard of the rights to intellectual property, we required the publication 4 things:

When I was a young and impressionable graduate student at Princeton, we scared each other with the story of a Final Public Oral, where Jack Milnor was dragged in against their will to sit on a committee, and noted that the class of topological spaces discussed by the speaker consisted of finite spaces. I had assumed this was an "urban legend", but then at a cocktail party, I mentioned this to a faculty member, who turned crimson and said that this was one of their students, who never talked to him, and then had to write another thesis (in numerical analysis, which was not very highly regarded at Princeton at the time). But now, I have talked to a couple of topologists who should have been there at the time of the event, and they told me that this was an urban legend at their time as well, so maybe the faculty member was pulling my leg.
So, the questions are: (a) any direct evidence for or against this particular disaster? (b) what stories kept you awake at night as a graduate student, and is there any evidence for or against their truth?
EDIT (this is unrelated, but I don't want to answer my own question too many times): At Princeton, there was supposedly an FPO in Physics, on some sort of statistical mechanics, and the constant $k$ appeared many times. The student was asked:
Examiner: What is $k?$
Student: Boltzmann's constant.
Examiner: Yes, but what is the value?
Student: Gee, I don't know...
Examiner: OK, order of magnitude?
Student: Umm, don't know, I just know $k\dots$
The student was failed, since they were obviously not a physicist.
Enlarge By Richard Ambo, The Honolulu Advertiser Pearl Harbor survivor Harold B. O'Connor autographs a card for Rebecca Dale, of Melbourne, Australia, as work continues behind them on the new visitor center for the USS Arizona Memorial. PEARL HARBOR  Harold O'Connor, 88, was a Navy Fireman First Class on the USS Thornton, a destroyer seaplane tender, in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked. "All the torpedo planes were coming right off our fantail," O'Connor recalls. "I watched the West Virginia go up from two torpedoes that were dropped. All hell was breaking loose. I saw the bombs that hit the Arizona." That's just one of O'Connor's World War II stories from the Pacific. The Hawaii man was again on the Thornton in 1942 taking Marines to Palmyra Atoll, when the ship ran aground on New Year's Eve. There they saw two torpedoes streaming toward where they stood. "I said, 'Goodbye world,' and I hit the deck," O'Connor said. "Nothing happened. I got up, and here come two more torpedoes. They came right under where I was standing." O'Connor's recollections go beyond Japan's 1941 attack on Oahu and so will the new $58 million Pearl Harbor center under construction for the USS Arizona Memorial here, says Daniel Martinez, chief historian for the emerging World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument. President George W. Bush set that change in motion last year when they proclaimed the Arizona Memorial and visitor center part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, which includes nine sites: five in Hawaii, three in Alaska, and one in California at the Tule Lake Segregation Center, which was where Japanese Americans were detained during World War II. The challenge for the National Park Service, which runs the Arizona Memorial, is to expand its exhibits to incorporate the new Pacific mandate, Martinez says. "We're at the beginning of trying to interpret how we're going to carry this out," Martinez said. "There are other ways to communicate this story besides traditional exhibits, so we're looking at ways to do it on the Web, we're looking at ways to do it through interpretive programs, we're looking at ways to do it through education." A visitor center had been planned long before Bush's announcement. The existing facility, which was built in 1980, was sinking. It was too small to accommodate the more than 1.3 million people who visit the state's No. 1 tourist attraction each year. Visitors who arrive today at the center for the boat ride to Kilo pier on the Pearl Harbor Navy base — where a commemoration ceremony will be held —will be greeted by a circuitous path of 12-foot chain-link fences covered in black fabric batting, a construction barrier separating older buildings still in use at the visitor center from their new replacements. The new facility will occupy 24,000 square feet and have nearly double the current museum exhibition space, according to the Arizona Memorial Museum Association. The campuslike design spreads new buildings and shaded walkways over a much larger area than before. "You feel kind of confined here," said visitor Shannon Howland, 50, of Seattle, who was waiting last week in the visitor center courtyard for the movie and boat trip to the memorial. "The more open they make it, the better it will be — just for the flow of people on a busy day." Construction began about a year ago, and the first phase, which includes an education center, restrooms, a bookstore and snack shop, is scheduled to open around Feb. 16, project director Tom Fake said. The exhibits Road to War, Oahu 1941, and Attack and Aftermath will be part of the second phase, which is to be completed by Dec. 7, 2010. The "attack" gallery will have an 18-foot mural depicting Battleship Row off Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. A one-third scale model of a banking Japanese torpedo plane will be hung overhead, and the roar of passing enemy planes will be heard in the exhibit, Martinez said. An anti-aircraft gun that came off the sunken USS Utah, a 5-foot-by-9-foot riveted slab of the USS Arizona's superstructure, and an oscilloscope showing the radar picture before the attack, also are included in the exhibit plan, they said. Today's events for the expected 2,000 people in attendance, will include a moment of silence, a "missing man" flyover, wreath presentations, featured speakers, a rifle salute and taps. The 7:55 a.m. attack killed 2,390 people. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

MANILA – Senator Antonio Trillanes IV believes the popularity of President Rodrigo Duterte will eventually wear off.
Despite a slew of criticism from here and abroad over their controversial war on drugs and diplomatic stunts, Duterte still enjoyed high scores in popularity surveys three months into their presidency.
But Trillanes said Duterte's popularity will wane once the public “realizes” the truth about Duterte.
“In the case of the EJKs (extrajudicial killings), the stench is so bad, no matter how you cover it up or spray perfume around it, it will continue to come out and stick. So it's just a matter of time,” Trillanes said in an interview on ANC Beyond Politics.
“The thing with a very popular president is people would give them always some leeway, the benefit of the doubt but eventually it will wear out. And the truth, once it's pounded on them and once they realize, then things will change.”
Trillanes said in the Senate, there have been “whispers” from several lawmakers expressing opposition to how Duterte is running the government.
“Yung boses na talagang matingkad ay hindi pa gaanong lumalabas, but in whispers there are those who are opposed to what President Duterte is doing,” they said.
(The loud voices have yet to come out, but in whispers there are those who are opposed to what President Duterte is doing.)
Trillanes believes lawmakers who have so far remained silent about issues involving Duterte will eventually voice their opposition once they notice public opinion turning against the president.
“As you've been noticing lately, the voices, the dissenting voices are getting louder everyday. Maraming nagsasalita. And ganun yun eh. Traditionally kung nasaan yung taumbayan, nandodoon yung mga politiko. Meron lang mga trailblazers, so to speak,” Trillanes said.
(As you've been noticing lately, the voices, the dissenting voices are getting louder everyday. Many are speaking out. That's how it works, traditionally the politicians side with the people. There are just trailblazers, so to speak.)
“But to be fair to the other senators and members of congress out there, in private conversations they're sharing the sentiment and the disappointment of the others who have been seeing what's wrong in this country right now.”
Trillanes said “one more major blunder” could prompt lawmakers to turn against Duterte. They added that lawmakers, especially those who will run in the midterm elections, are also waiting for the results of popularity surveys in deciding what would be their approach to the president.
“Probably one more major blunder that could be a deal-breaker for a lot of our people, that's one. For some, they want to be more scientific, they're waiting for the surveys. They want an accurate indicator of the pulse of the people,” they said.
“Once they feel that President Duterte is no longer popular, then they start bashing away. Remember, 2019 is the midterm elections, so probably the senators who intend to run again in 2019 would carefully calibrate their positions.”
But for now, Trillanes said they and other "trailblazers" will continue to speak against Duterte.
"He is behind these killings and that's the primary difference. The ordinary people, the media tend to look at them as a normal politician but in my eyes, I see a monster," they said.
"Strong and stable, strong and stable." Hate-peddling Tory spin doctor Lynton Crosby has their clients mindlessly repeating this mantra ad infinitum. But beneath the soundbites, the public are beginning to see a party of chaos - one that attempts to U-turn on key manifesto pledges and avoids scrutiny at all costs. Where Labour offers hope, the Conservatives serve up an array of regressive policies and pledges that will protect vested interests. Cries that Labour poses a threat to the country are a lie. A Tory landslide would be a disaster for the UK.
You only need to look at recent history to see their incompetence in action. After most countries have abandoned austerity, the Conservatives pushed ahead with what was widely regarded as an illogical economic programme. Sticking to this path was, the economist Paul Krugman says, "a very British delusion". It's had deleterious effects. Only the very wealthy are doing well out of the current system; in the past year, the richest 1,000 people luxuriated in a 14 per cent jump in their wealth, while wages fell.
But in the face of rapidly rising in-work poverty, a National Health Service (NHS) starved of funds, crumbling state schools and a cruel welfare system, more austerity is all the Tories offer.
Their education plans are evidence of that. They claim they'll increase schools' budgets by £4bn ($5.1bn) by 2022. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that, when taking into account growing pupil numbers and recent reductions in budgets, this amounts to a real-terms cut to spending per pupil by a huge 7 per cent between 2015-16 and 2021-22.
OPINION: May's demagogic streak and the hypocrisy of the media
Slashing budgets will have a disastrous effect on children up and down the country. Some will be forced to clean classrooms, others will get a second-rate education in overcrowded classrooms as heads are forced to cut back on teacher numbers. And many more children will be malnourished under their plans.
To distract from their failings and duplicity, the Tories turn people against each other through an age-old tactic: demonising migrants.
The Conservatives will take away free school meals and introduce pitiful 7p breakfasts, leaving children who come from homes where parents can't afford to put food on the table to go hungry. Where Labour would increase corporation tax to funnel much-needed money into public services, a Conservative government would tell people they simply can't afford to fund schools as the super-rich watch their bank balances multiply.
It's not just the young who will lose out. After axing the social care budget by £4.6bn ($5.9bn) between 2010 and 2015, old people will be forced to look after themselves through the dementia tax as our elderly population grows. The Conservatives claim this will deal with generational inequality but they've offered nothing for younger generations who've seen their pay packets dwindle in size as house prices soar.
Conservatives' strategy is to give with one hand after taking away with two. The "a" word might have dropped out of the Tory lexicon but they're still going to cut public services to the bone, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that it's making the country poorer and more unequal.
That's because their economic programme was always ideological. As Professor Ha Joon Chang has pointed out, economics is not a science, it's political. Despite what we've been told about "scroungers" and "strivers" in recent years, people aren't forced to use food banks because of chance, laziness or, as Theresa May put it, "complex reasons". The Conservatives made a political choice: people on low incomes, the middle classes and our public sector would pay the price for their ideologically driven efforts to shrink the state.
OPINION: Is Brexit Britain suffering from an imperial hangover?
Instead they prioritise the interests of the rich. The Tories will reintroduce the brutal blood sport of fox-hunting, if it made it through a free vote in the Commons; legalise the ivory trade, which sees around 20,000 elephants killed each year on the African continent (an elephant slaughtered every 25 minutes); and put the needs of their donors in the fossil fuel industry ahead of the environment, as ice caps melt at an alarming rate and sea levels steadily rise.
To distract from their failings and duplicity, the Tories turn people against each other through an age-old tactic: demonising migrants. May has more to say on health tourism - a fabricated issue that belies a reality where migrant staff keep the health service going - than funding the NHS. The raft of anti-migrant policies in the Conservative manifesto will further create a "hostile environment" for immigrants. This has very real effects. Just ask 17-year-old Reker Ahmed, who was beaten within an inch of their life for simply being an asylum seeker.
In fact, the Tories' migration policy is a mess by their own standards. If they go ahead with their plans to slash net migration down to tens of thousands a year, they will tank the economy. Their Brexit promises will fall into oblivion. Countries with huge economies like India aren't particularly interested in doing a trade deal with a government that boasts about "bear[ing] down on immigration from outside the European Union".
OPINION: Doner kebab and integration in the UK - A story worth telling
This is of little concern to a party who have plans to change the rules so they can stay in office. While their opponent Jeremy Corbyn has toured the country talking to voters during the election, May has moved from one stage-managed performance to another. Them response to a decline in political engagement over the past few decades has been to grip tight on to the levers of power. This stranglehold on democracy will only tighten if they sweep to power on June 8. She'll introduce GOP-style voter ID laws, which will disenfranchise about 3.5 million people, most of whom will be on low pay (and less likely to vote Conservative). This amounts to rigging the system to make it easier for them to win.
From a £10 ($13) hourly minimum wage to ruling out tax rises for 95 per cent of the population, Labour is offering positive change in a country that's crying out for a political party to take on the status quo. The alternative is a Conservative government that would impoverish older people, plunge more children into poverty, ignore climate change and kill foxes - that's the real threat to the UK.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission 's EVM challenge will be held on June 3 but with just two parties - CPM and NCP led by Sharad Pawar - volunteering to try and demonstrate that EC's EVMs can be tampered.While BJP, CPI, and Rashtriya Lok Dal have evinced interest in observing the EVM challenge, AAP and Congress raised certain issues in letters sent to the EC on Friday afternoon. Both parties, however, steered clear of expressing any interest in being part of the challenge. RJD also wrote to EC volunteering to participate but as the application was received at 5.39 pm on Friday, it was held as "not entertainable" due to late submission.While AAP, which was at forefront of the demand for conducting an EVM 'hackathon', wrote to the EC reiterating its demand to be allowed to change or tinker with the motherboard, Congress too, is believed to have sought a relaxation in conditions for the proposed challenge.In a letter to the Election Commission, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said the challengers should be allowed access to all the components of an Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), including the motherboard."The extensive terms and conditions that this challenge imposes prevent challengers to conduct a thorough test on the EVMs. We urge you to reconsider relaxing the three rules, as their inclusion undermines the very credibility of this initiative," said Surjewala.An EC spokesperson on Friday evening said a total nine parties had responded to its EVM challenge. While NCP and CPM have nominated three representatives each to take part in the challenge, AAP and Congress stuck to only questioning the framework. Three other parties - CPI, BJP and RLD - told EC they were keen to observe but not participate in the EVM challenge, while All India NR Congress, a recognised state party in Puducherry, expressly declined to be part of the challenge. RJD applied for participation but only after the deadline.NCP had alleged an EVM fraud during the local polls in Maharashtra earlier this year. It particularly raised the alleged 'zero votes' secured by an independent candidate, Shrikant Shirsat, in Mumbai municipal corporation polls. Shirsat had claimed that votes cast in their favour by them as well as their family and neighbours were not registered. However, the EC, based on an investigation by the Maharashtra SEC, found the allegations to be false, with the candidate having secured a total 44 votes from the Ward no 164.According to the EC spokesperson, NCP sent its letter evincing interest in the EVM challenge between 2 pm and 3 pm on Friday, hours before the deadline was to expire. It nominated three persons for the challenge - Vandana Hemant Chavan, Gaurav Jayprakash Jachak and Yasin Hussain Shaikh.While CPM did not express interest in participation in its covering letter, it too nominated three persons for the challenge as part of the annexures.The challenge will be conducted between 10 am and 2 pm on June 3. NCP and CPM will simultaneously attempt tampering of EVMs at separate counters. NCP has not chosen the four EVMs, as allowed under the framework, for demonstrating the tampering. The choice of EVMs has been left to the EC.EC will bring the EVMs from UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab, where assembly elections were held recently, for the challenge.The EC had on Thursday turned down AAP's demand for allowing change or tampering of EVM motherboard during the EVM dare, saying that changing the motherboard or internal circuitry of the machine was like changing the whole device itself.It also rejected the Trinamool Congress's demand for more time to evince interest in the challenge, and asked it to do so within the original deadline.

× Online Sex Sting Leads To Arrest Of Sebastian County Public Defender
FAULKNER COUNTY (KFSM) — A public defender in the River Valley was arrested by Faulkner County Police over the weekend during an online sex sting.
Daniel Stewart, 47, is a public defender for Sebastian County. According to the Faulkner County Sheriff's Office, they were arrested Saturday (March 19) on a charge of conspiracy to commit rape.
According to Faulkner County Sheriff Matt Rice, Stewart began communicating online with an undercover investigator in February. Communication continued and they agreed to meet on Saturday, March 19 for the purpose of engaging in sexual contact with a juvenile in exchange for money.
An affidavit details that the suspect placed an ad searching for contact with a “young guy” or “son.” Communication moved from email to the Kik messenger app, and arrangements to meet in Conway were made, but then the plans changed to meeting at a Fort Smith hotel. The suspect is said to have believed that they were meeting with an adult male and their 13-year-old son.
According to court documents, as soon as Stewart arrived at the hotel, they were taken into custody, and their vehicle was impounded.
Rice told our Little Rock sister station THV11 that this is just one of the few high-profile arrests the FCSO online crime unit has made recently.
Stewart is being held on a $250,000 bond. Their next court date is scheduled for April 18, according to the Faulkner County Sheriff's Office.
On Monday, (March 21), Stewart resigned as the Sebastian County public defender.
Bernie Ecclestone admits that the current issues in F1 stems from the distribution of funds which they say is "probably my fault".
After Marussia and Caterham both entered administration - causing both teams to miss the next two grands prix - the likes of Sauber, Force India and Lotus have called for change in the way funds are distributed. As unrest grows, Force India's Bob Fernley even said there is an "agenda" to protect the interests of the bigger teams, and Ecclestone - who has commercial rights agreements with all of the teams - agrees the way funds are distributed needs to change.
Asked if there was anger and frustration at the situation, Ecclestone replied: "Absolutely.
"The problem is there is too much money probably being distributed badly - probably my fault. But like lots of agreements people make, they seemed a good idea at the time."
And Ecclestone believes they and the teams "should tear all of the current contracts up. Tear them all up, start again."
With Fernley saying a boycott of the United States Grand Prix was a genuine possibility on Saturday, Ecclestone said there is no chance of a team pulling out of the race.
"Forget all that crap. I promise they will be racing. They will be racing, I give you a guarantee - but I worry if they will be racing next year."
While Ecclestone is keen to make changes, they say it will be difficult as a result of the complexity of regulations at present because unanimous agreement is required on many matters.
"We have to decide the best way to sort this whole thing out. Frankly, I know what's wrong but don't know how to fix it. No one is prepared to do anything about it because they can't. The regulations have tied us up.
"If we were in a position where we could help these teams in trouble, we would do it. But we are not allowed to. They say if you give this team $10,000, everyone has to have $10,000. The trouble with lots of regulations and lots of contracts is that we don't think long-term.
"It makes no difference to me how the money is shared out. If they sat down here with me now and said they want to share out all of the money we get in a different way, I would say, 'Good, give me the bit of paper'."

The V90 Cross Country is the newest addition to the family tree. What better place to get a taste of it than right in Volvo's homeland? Join us as we hit the snowy streets of Sweden in the nation's latest family hauler.
Same recipe, new ingredients
“Cross Country” means rugged in Volvo-speak, and the V90 follows the same proven formula as its predecessors. All of the defining styling cues are accounted for: it receives plastic cladding over the wheel arches and the rocker panels, a raised suspension, and specific bumpers on both ends. However, this time around Volvo's “crossover-ized” wagon is more stylish than ever before.
That's because it falls in line with the design language that spearheaded Volvo's renaissance. Up front, the look is characterized by an upright grille with model-specific metal studs, and sharp headlights that encompass T-shaped LED daytime running lights named Thor's Hammer. Out back, the rear window is much more rakish than the outgoing V70's, and it's flanked by a set of long, elegant-looking tail lamps. The V90 is all-Volvo; you'd be hard-pressed to find another company's DNA in the design.
The V90 Cross Country is only available with an all-aluminum, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that's both turbocharged and supercharged. Called T6, it makes 316 horsepower at 5,700 rpm and 295 pound-feet of torque from 2,200 to 5,400 rpm. That's enough grunt to power the wagon from 0 to 60 mph in a brisk six seconds. A smooth-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission sends power to all four wheels.
All of Volvo's 90-series cars ride on a modular platform named SPA. The S90's gasoline-electric hybrid drivetrain easily fits in the V90, but an electrified Cross Country isn't currently in the works. However, Lutz Stiegler, Volvo's director of powertrain engineering, told me product planners will approve a hybrid model if there is enough demand from customers.
Life aboard
More polished than the outgoing model, the V90 Cross Country reflects Volvo's upmarket shift. The materials in the cabin are at least on par with the ones Mercedes-Benz and BMW are using, and every component feels solid and well screwed together. The generous list of standard features includes leather upholstery, heated seats, and a panoramic sunroof. This wagon knows how to pamper its occupants.
The V90 is all-Volvo; you'd be hard-pressed to find another company's DNA in the design.
The V90 Cross Country offers 8.3 inches of ground clearance – 2.6 inches more than the standard V90 – which improves visibility by raising the seating position. It also gets dark wood trim on the dashboard, and pearl stitching on the seats. The interior is virtually identical to the S90's apart from those details, and that's not a bad thing at all. The cabin is spacious, well-lit, and uncluttered, and the five occupants travel in utmost comfort. Out back, it can swallow 53.9 cubic feet of cargo.
The infotainment system is one of the V90's strong points. It's displayed on a color, high-resolution touch screen that's mounted vertically on the dashboard, which makes all the difference. It stands out as one of the most intuitive and user-friendly systems on the market. While the switchgear has been reduced to the strict minimum, there's virtually no learning curve involved because every function is clearly labeled, and none of the essential features are buried several menus deep.
Behind the wheel
Volvo station wagons have always been solid, comfortable, and sure-footed to drive. That's a big part of why buyers keep coming back to the brand. The V90 Cross Country is no different.
The engine barely makes its presence known at idle. The volume goes up to a distant hum as the rpm rise, but the four-cylinder is never loud enough to be considered a nuisance. Wind noise isn't an issue, either, even at freeway speeds. The V90 is one of the quietest wagons we've tested, and that makes for a serene driving experience.
The V90 is as quick off the line as you'd expect a 316-horsepower wagon to be. Acceleration is linear, but it's not the brutal kind that grabs you by the gut and pins your entire upper body against the seat. It's controlled and confident. Volvo asked its engineers to develop a versatile, go-anywhere wagon, not a sports car. The Cross Country consequently puts a much bigger emphasis on refinement and comfort than on sportiness.
The Cross Country is an evolution of the V90, but from a chassis standpoint it's an entirely new car. Equipped with the optional air suspension on the rear axle, it strikes a nice balance between firm and supple. That means it soaks up bumps before they reach the occupants' spine, even on rough or unpaved roads, but the wagon doesn't feel boat-like on a twisty road. The Cross Country does exhibit a little bit more body lean during hard cornering than the S90 because it's taller, though it's hardly perceptible in normal driving conditions. I also found that the additional wheel travel gives it a more compliant ride.
More polished than the outgoing model, the V90 Cross Country reflects Volvo's upmarket shift.
While the electric power steering is well-weighted, it doesn't provide as much feedback as I'd like it to. In fact, the built-in sport mode doesn't suit the V90 Cross Country very well. It's much more enjoyable to drive in normal or comfort mode, though that's not to say it's lethargic.
Grip is excellent, even on icy surfaces – as I found out by taking the V90 for a high-speed jaunt on a frozen lake. In case you're wondering, it'll happily drift all day long if the traction control system is turned off. But back to real-world conditions. When the pavement ends and the going gets tougher, an off-road mode active at up to 25 mph sends up to 100 percent of the engine's torque to the rear wheels. Off-road mode doesn't increase the ride height, but the traction control is more likely to let the wheels spin when it's engaged. Don't get the wrong idea, the Cross Country won't tackle the Rubicon Trail like a Wrangler can. But, it'll hold its own in snow, mud, slush, or rubble and clear large obstacles that would leave a nasty dent in the underbody of a standard V90.
Talkin' tech
Safety is a core part of every Volvo. In addition to numerous airbags, the V90 Cross Country comes standard with Pilot Assist (which keeps the car from veering out of its lane), automatic emergency braking, a road sign information function, and adaptive cruise control, among other features.
In Sweden and Norway, Volvo drivers also benefit from an innovative car-to-car communication system that warns them when another Volvo driver turns on the hazard lights, or when the traction control system detects slippery and potentially dangerous conditions like black ice. The feature isn't available in the United States because there aren't enough Volvos on the road, but the company plans on expanding availability over time.
Conclusion
The world's wagon expert has honed its craft. The V90 Cross Country keeps its predecessor's adventurous spirit alive, and it adds a dose of luxury to the cocktail that makes a big difference.
If you're in the market for a premium wagon, this is the one to get. If you're not, consider it. Unless you need genuinely three rows, Volvo's V90 Cross Country does everything a crossover can do in a smarter, more buttoned-down package.

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: The central bank and the government ofteneven in the best of times, which these certainly are not. The stress of managing the process of demonetisation has brought to the fore some lapses in communication between the Reserve Bank of India and the government. The lack of coordination between the two has come in the way of smoother implementation of several measures.The most recent instance is handling of the notification that put conditions on deposit of old notes worth over Rs 5,000 after December 20. Though the finance ministry took the decision, sources in the government told TOI that the RBI notification was “badly drafted”, particularly the section that made it mandatory to explain the reasons for delaying deposit of scrapped notes. The notification was amended on WednesdaySources in RBI feel that the central bank's image is being tarnished by frequent changes in circulars, most of which are issued on directions from the government.A section within the government feels that RBI has been slow in reacting to cues. For example, it took the central bank three days to frame the rules that allowed families that had a wedding during November and December to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh in new currency. When RBI did come out with the rules,that it was almost impossible to withdraw the money. The government had to step in and RBI eased one condition.Another bone of contention has been the amount of old notes which have come back. The government has also contested the figure released by RBI on amount of old currency that is deposited with banks. Last week economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das asked RBI and banks to check the figures for any possible double counting.Sources in the central bank say RBI is torn between the people who are resentful of how the institution is being treated and people who are happily complying with the finance ministry orders.RBI sources also believe that it is unfair to make the bank, and the banking system in general, responsible for tax compliance by depositors. Not only that it is not the central bank's sole job, checking for tax compliance at every banking transaction disrupts the smooth functioning.Yet another issue of discord was thetill December 30. RBI is believed to have been of the view that complete waiver will act as a disincentive for banks, but the decision was implemented.
NSW primary industries minister Niall Blair has admitted to misleading parliament over the Crown lands management. Photo nationals.com.au
In a rare and embarrassing back down for the NSW government, the Minister for Lands has apologised to Parliament for providing incorrect information on Crown Land leases that have commenced since 2012.
During debate this week on the Auditor General's recent scathing report into the sale and leasing of Crown Land, the minister, Niall Blair (Nationals), advised the House that no lease had been directly negotiated by Crown Land since 2012.
It turns out there were 19 – involving leases to airports as well as transactions tied up with the privatisation of Newcastle Port and the NSW electricity generators.
The report reflects also longtime concerns by campaigners against the takeover of public foreshore Crown land at Brunswick Heads by a government-appointed trust which runs three public holiday parks in the town.
Byron Shire Council recently renewed operating licences for the holiday parks amid a public outcry over the encroachments of public foreshore land.
The Opposition says that Crown Lands was clearly dysfunctional and now in crisis mode.
Shadow lands minister Mick Veitch said Crown Lands' staff numbers have been slashed by the Baird government, and a lot of corporate knowledge has walked out the door since 2011.
‘The Auditor General's report said that the Crown Lands agency did not know what was occurring on Crown Land,' Mr Veitch said.
‘The minister's false response actually affirms that Auditor General's grave concerns for the management of public land in NSW.
‘Savage job cuts by the Coalition means that Crown Lands is no longer aware of many transactions are taking place on public land.
‘It has now provided incorrect information to the minister on leases – and the minister has admitted to misleading Parliament.
‘While the minister was quick to blame public servants – the real reason behind the dysfunctionality of Crown Lands are job cuts which have left many Crown Lands offices with a skeletal staff.
‘Without staff, you simply can't know what is going on across land that comprises 42 per cent of NSW'.
Hansard transcription
(Hansard: 20 September 2016, Auditor-General's Report)
The Hon. NIALL BLAIR (Minister for Primary Industries, and Minister for Lands and Water) (14:52 :25): By leave: On 15 September 2016 I participated in debate, under Standing Order 57, along with a number of other members, on the Auditor-General's report into the sale and lease of Crown land. When speaking about direct negotiations since 2012, I advised the House that no new areas of Crown land were allocated by direct negotiation for commercial use by lease during this period. I have since been advised by the Department of Industry—Lands that, in fact, 19 commercial leases have been approved for direct negotiation with new tenants by the department since 2012. I apologise to the House for this regrettable error, which was contained in draft speech notes prepared by the department but not corrected prior to the debate. As soon as I was advised of this error, I wrote to advise the Clerk of the Parliaments of my intention to update the record.
Given the topic of the debate last week, the irony of the situation is not lost on me or the department, and I have no doubt it will not be lost on other members. I have ensured that processes have been put in place to mitigate the risk of this reoccurring. Regarding the leases, I am advised that they were granted with appropriate consideration of all issues, including receiving a fair return for citizens of New South Wales. Seven of the leases that have been executed since 2012 were approved in 2008, and one was approved in 2009. While it is regrettable, this error does not detract from the key point I made during the debate last week, which is that the Department of Industry—Lands has agreed to all six recommendations in the Auditor-General's report.

Avoiding public scrutiny
The Auditor-General's report report targets a ‘culture of avoiding public scrutiny', Mr Veitch said.
It also reflects longtime concerns by campaigners against the takeover of public foreshore Crown land at Brunswick Heads by a government-appointed trust which runs three public holiday parks in the town.
Byron Shire Council recently renewed operating licences for the holiday parks amid a public outcry over the encroachments of public foreshore land.
Mr Veitch said the report also highlighted the NSW government's ‘inadequate' oversight of decision making and ‘limited' community involvement in the sale and lease of Crown land.
‘Shockingly, the report reveals 97 per cent of leases and 50 per cent of sales over the past four years were hidden from public scrutiny because the government chose to enter into direct negotiations with buyers,' they said.
‘The overwhelming conclusion is that more often than not the community is being excluded from the sale and leasing process and unable to contribute to, or question, decisions made by the department.
‘Furthermore, the audit found that the Department of Industry and Land does not have a clear view of what is happening on most leased Crown land, having only just started monitoring tenants.'
The report recommends the government improves transparency of decisions and clarifies the criteria used to justify the closed direct negotiations of leases and sales.
The minister is being urged to address the concerns raised by the NSW Auditor General as a matter of priority and hold off on introducing new Crown Lands legislation.
Mr Veitch said the Baird-Grant government's ‘veil of secrecy means that the community is being left in the dark when their Crown land is sold off or leased'.
‘Many tenants are left with free reign on what they can do once they occupy Crown land – with very little monitoring by the government,' they said.
‘This is a scathing report and Mike Baird and Troy Grant should sit up and take notice that the community can no longer be shut out of the process.'
Nearly 30,000 people are without power today in the Adirondack North Country with an Ice Storm Warning in effect until 7:00 pm Sunday evening, 12/22/13. Although everything outdoors is coated in a thin layer of ice here at Adirondack Lifestyle HQ just outside of Lake Placid, it appears the most severe icing was concentrated at lower elevations.
I am heeding my own advice and have not left the house, but news reports from North Country Public Radio indicate the worst damage is in Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties where most of the power outages are located and bans on unnecessary travel remain in effect.
There are also Flood Warnings posted for locations around the region due to the heavy rain, melting snow, and ice dams. Although it was warm and rainy all day yesterday here in Lake Placid, temperatures were 20 degrees colder in towns just a few miles away, resulting in long periods of freezing rain and heavier ice accumulations.
Since we lost power here at HQ between the moment I uploaded the photo above until now, for about 1 hour, I will finish and post this …..but not before I exhort everyone to stay safe and warm.
Fantastic Arbitrary Day gifts from Canada, my anonymous Santa did some amazing sleuthing. I absolutely love everything, thank you for going above and beyond to make a random stranger on the internet so happy.
Here's hoping your Arbitrary Day is as awesome as you just made mine \o/
*Update - photo of framed picture.
*Update² - an unexpected package arrived in the mail! Whilst carrying it inside, I briefly wondered if I'd been inebriated on Amazon. Turns out, Santa wanted me to have the entire series of In Them Name - The Last War.
Thank you so much!
PS, the coffee is great :D
*Update³ - Santa is insane. I'm speechless, this is just too much awesome to comprehend. Another package arrived today, revealing five books from Dean Koontz' Odd Thomas series. I've been meaning to read more from this author for the longest time now, HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS?
A recent blog post posed the question Why do we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack?. It triggered a very interesting discussion on Hacker News.
I've also thought about this question while working at CloudFlare. My experience mostly comes from working with thousands of production machines here and I can try to answer the question from that perspective.
CC BY 2.0 image by John Vetterli
Let's start with a broader question - what is the point of running an operating system at all? If you planned on running a single application, having to use a kernel consisting of multiple million lines of code may sound like a burden.
But in fact most of us decide to run some kind of OS and we do that for two reasons. Firstly, the OS layer adds hardware independence and easy to use APIs. With these we can focus on writing the code for any machine - not only the specialized hardware we have at the moment. Secondly, the OS adds a time sharing layer. This allows us to run more than one application at a time. Whether it's a second HTTP server or just a bash session, this ability to share resources between multiple processes is critical. All of the resources exposed by the kernel can be shared between multiple processes!
Userspace Networking
This is no different for the networking stack. By using the general purpose operating system network stack we gain the ability to run multiple network applications. This is lost if we dedicate the network card hardware to a single application in order to run a userspace network stack. By claiming the network card from one process you lose the ability to run, say an SSH session, concurrently with your servers.
As crazy as it sounds, this is exactly what most off the shelf userspace network stack technologies propose. The common term for this is "full kernel bypass". The idea is to bypass the kernel and use network hardware directly from userspace process.
CC BY 2.0 image by Audiotecna Música
In the Linux ecosystem there are a few available technologies. Not all are open source:
I've written about these in a previous post. All of these technologies require handing over the full network card to a single process. In other words: it's totally possible to write your own network stack, make it brilliant, focusing on super features, and optimize for performance. But there is a big cost incurred - you will be restricted to running at most one process for each network card.
There is a small twist about virtualized network cards (VFs), but let's cut it here - it doesn't work. I talked about this in the "Virtualization approach" paragraph.
But even with all these road blocks, I can't just dismiss the benefits of kernel bypass. Many people do run custom network stacks and they do it for one of two reasons:
latency
performance (lower CPU cost, better throughput)
The latency is very important for the HFT (high frequency trading) folks. Traders can afford custom hardware and fancy proprietary network stacks. I would feel very uncomfortable running a closed source TCP stack.
Kernel bypass at CloudFlare
Having said that, at CloudFlare we do use kernel bypass. We are in the second group - we care about performance. More specifically we suffer from IRQ storms. The Linux networking stack has a limit on how many packets per second it can handle. When the limit is reached all CPUs become busy just receiving packets. In that case either the packets are dropped or the applications are starved of CPU. While we don't have to deal with IRQ storms during our normal operation, this does happen when we are the target of an L3 (layer 3 OSI) DDoS attack. This is a type of attack where the target is flooded with arbitrary packets not belonging to valid connections - typically spoofed packets.
CC BY-SA 2.0 image by Howard Lake
During some attacks we are flooded with up to 3M packets per second (pps) per server. A general rule of thumb is that Linux iptables can handle about 1Mpps on a decent server, while still having enough CPU for applications. This number can be increased by proper tuning.
With this scale of attack the Linux kernel is not enough for us. We must work around it. We don't use the previously mentioned "full kernel bypass", but instead we run what we call a "partial kernel bypass". With this the kernel retains the ownership of the network card, and allows us to perform a bypass only on a single "RX queue". We use Solarflare's EFVI API on Solarflare NICs. To support Intel NICs we added a partial kernel bypass feature to Netmap: that's described in this blog post. With this technique we can offload our anti-DDoS iptables to a very fast userspace process. This saves Linux from processing attack packets, therefore avoiding IRQ storms situations.
What about a full userspace TCP stack?
My colleagues regularly ask me about: Why don't we just run our NGINX with Solarflare OpenOnload framework, using a super fast userspace TCP?
Yes, it would be faster, but there is no evidence it will actually make much of a practical difference. Most of the CPU used on our servers goes to the userspace NGINX processes and not to the operating system. The CPU is mostly spent on usual NGINX bookkeeping and our Lua application logic, not on network handling. I estimate with bypass we could save about 5-10% CPU, which is (currently) not worth the effort.
CC BY 2.0 image by Charlie
Next, using kernel bypass for NGINX would interfere with our usual debugging tools. Our systemtap scripts would become useless. Linux netstat statistics will stop recording critical events and tcpdump won't work anymore.
Then there is the issue of our DDoS mitigation stack. We are heavy users of iptables, as I documented in this BlackHat presentation. Custom TCP stacks just don't have things like "hashlimits" and "ipsets".
But not only firewall features. The Linux TCP stack has some extremely useful non-trivial support for things like RFC4821 with the sys.net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing sysctl. Support for this is critical when a user is behind an ICMP black hole. Read more in this blog posts about PMTU.
Finally, each TCP stack comes with its own set of bugs and quirks. We've documented three non-obvious quirks in the Linux TCP stack:
Imagine debugging issues like that in a closed source or a young TCP stack (or both!).
Conclusion
There are two general themes: first, there is no stable open-source partial kernel bypass technology yet. We hope Netmap will occupy this niche, and we are actively supporting it with our patches. Second, the Linux TCP stack has many critical features and very good debugging capabilities. It will take years to compete with this rich ecosystem.
For these reasons it's unlikely userspace networking will become mainstream. In practice I can think only of a few reasonable applications of kernel bypass techniques:
Software switches or routers. Here you want to hand over network cards to the application, deal with raw packets and skip the kernel altogether.
Dedicated loadbalancers. Similarly, if the machine is only doing packet shuffling skipping the kernel makes sense.
Partial bypass for selected high throughput / low latency applications. This is the setup we use for our DDoS mitigations. Unfortunately I'm not aware of a stable open source TCP stack that fits this category.
For the general user the Linux network stack is the right choice. Although it's less exciting than rewriting TCP stacks, we should focus on understanding the Linux stack performance and fixing its problems. There are some serious initiatives underway to improve the performance of the good old Linux TCP stack.
Pitt left out of N.I.T., accepts invite to College Basketball Tournament
Pitt already knew it would not be playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time in 11 years, and Sunday night the Panthers learned they would not be playing in the National Invitation Tournament, either.
Pitt (17-16) was left out of the 32-team N.I.T. field, but the Panthers did accept a bid to the College Basketball Invitational, a 16-team tournament with games at campus sites.
Pitt will play host to Wofford Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Petersen Events Center. Tickets for the game are $20 and will go on sale Monday morning at 10:00 a.m.
If Pitt beats Wofford the Panthers advance to the second round against either Princeton or Evansville. The CBI concludes with a three-game championship series.

How to Get Help with your Legal Problem If you have a legal problem, please use this link. Editor's Corner Christian Dispute Resolution If you've poked around in our Reading Room you may have had a chance to explore the Christ county Vault. This is an archive of some of the work and related documents generated by a (now defunct) Christian jural Society which went by the name Christ county, kingdom of God. I was involved with that project. When Christ county was abandoned, roughly sixteen years ago, I established the Vault in hopes others might pick up the work where we left off. I've gotten feedback over the years showing this is a topic of interest for many readers but, so far, if anyone has really used the info much they haven't told me about it. One of the issues of Christ county with which I was heavily involved, and the one which I thought might hold the most promise, was the creation of the Court Rules. More people than ever before, no longer think it is an extreme position to believe that the United States government, and its corporate subsidiaries, have become a criminal syndicate rather than a legitimate government. The Court Rules were created to give Christians an alternative to going into the courts of the unbelievers (1Cor:6). True, it is not always possible to stay out of their courts, particularly if one is dragged into them in chains. But what of the myriad civil lawsuits brought by brother against brother? Many of these are avoidable. For a short time Christ county had a functioning court system, complete with rules, a Clerk, and at least four judges (which provided a tribunal for oversight). The Court allowed members who had signed the Christ county Compact to claim conflict of law in regard to both civil and criminal matters brought against them in foreign (U.S.) courts. Christ county collapsed before most of these principles could be tested to their full extent. However, the Court did facilitate both mediation and arbitration for its members. I believe this is a valuable and much needed service for which most Christians have nowhere to turn. I have no intention of establishing another original-jurisdiction-court. This would require starting up another jural society, and I'm not up to it. It's a lot of work; it's dangerous, and I'm not in a position to put forth the level of in your face required to make a go of it. I make no apologies. However, I have begun to consider the possibility of offering the service of private Christian Dispute Resolution through The Lawful Path. What are the Basics? Read more...
Zika Virus - What They Are Not Telling You by Kathy J. Forti, Jan. 28, 2016 The recent outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil is now being linked to genetically modified mosquitoes developed by the British biotech company Oxitec, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec has been releasing the genetically modified Aedes mosquitoes into the wild in Brazil since 2011 to battle dengue fever (http://www.activistpost.com/2016/01/zika-outbreak-epicenter-in-same-area-where-gm-mosquitoes-were-released-in-2015.html). The company produces up two million genetically modified mosquitoes a week in its factory in Campinas, Brazil. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the world's most dominant variety of mosquito, and the only two countries in the Americas that don't have this mosquito are Chile and Canada. The Zika virus, which has been detected in 18 of the 26 states in Brazil, is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Over 4,000 babies have now been born in Brazil with shrunken brains since November 1, 2015. Brazil normally gets approximately 150 cases of this type of birth defect each year, which means abnormal births of this type have increased by approximately 13,000 percent. (New reports from NBC news state these counts have been exaggerated and are far less.) While the Brazilian government rushes to blame the Zika virus for this huge rise in abnormal birth defects, causation remains unclear. Only a small number of babies with birth defects, who died, had the virus in their brain or in the mother's placenta. This means a large number of the babies who died had no Zika virus in their brain. Hard to blame Zika then, which has been around since before 1948 and has never been known to cause birth defects and/or death. In fact, Zika makes only one in five people get "mildly" sick with flu-like symptoms, with no symptoms at all in 4 out of 5 people. So why are they quick to blame a generally benign Zika virus? In late 2014, the Brazilian minister of health announced that a new Tdap shot would be mandatory for alltdap-ryan-gossling-meme expectant mothers starting in 2015. Since it's mandatory, mothers with birth defect babies received this newly formulated vaccine while pregnant. The timeliness of the Tdap vaccine and the sudden rise in birth defects is more than just a little coincidental. The consequences of this untested vaccine is being swept under the rug. Which brings us once again to Bill Gates (founder and ex-CEO of Microsoft), the King of Eugenics and Vaccines. (Read more...) More Lawful Path Readers Using Linux I have this neat little program that analyzes server logs. It compiles various statitics, builds graphs, and tells me things I would never otherwise know if all I could do is look at hundreds of thousands of lines of computer-generated text. While I was looking at server statistics today, and comparing them with prior years (a geeky thing to do, I know), I noticed something interesting I'd like to share with you. As regular readers are aware, for many years I've been promoting the use of the Linux operating system, as a better choice than Microsoft Windows. Apparently, a lot of you are paying attention.

The Deadlift is not a Dead Lift
The deadlift is an exercise that has unfairly received a bad reputation with the general population. Very seldom does someone ask you how much you can deadlift. It is rarely taught to clientele in the health club setting and most gyms seldom have a platform area designated for deadlifting. The deadlift has been performed mostly by powerlifters, hard core garage lifters, and bodybuilders looking to venture into the strength arena.
The average public perceives deadlifting with similar false stigmas to that of squatting. Squatting will hurt my knees; deadlifting will hurt my back. Both myths have taken hold due to bad technique and poor form when performing the lifts. There are few poor lifts, only poor lifting technique.
In reality, most everyone who is interested in weight training should perform the deadlift. A weak back makes us more susceptible to injury on a daily basis. How many times do you bend to lift objects during the average day? Most spinal specialists would agree that if you examined the backs of middle aged Americans, you would probably find an accumulation of spinal problems through the course of one's lifetime. I would also venture to say a large percentage of workman's compensation claims are filed because of back injuries. Prevention lies in strengthening the back. The deadlift is the best exercise for total back strengthening; its focus is the body's core - legs, hips, and back. It is also the best test of total body absolute strength, much more than the bench press or squat. The deadlift is also one of the best exercises to add total body mass. Individuals wanting to add mass should seriously consider about adding the deadlift to your workout program. The deadlift "thickens" the body.
There is more to performing the deadlift than walking up to a bar and picking it up. It is not as technically complex as a clean or snatch, and every bit as problematic as the squat. There are two standard styles of deadlifting: conventional - feet narrower than shoulders, and sumo - feet wider than shoulders. The style that fits most people comfortably is the conventional. It also has more carryover to daily activity.
Positioning
Let's start with foot placement. Feet should be placed at armpit width with toes slightly out. Shins will be placed next to the bar. The majority of the bodyweight should begin on the balls of the feet with a transfer to the heels through lockout. The hands should grasp the bar with an over / under grip with the arms outside the knees. The legs should be bent to the "power position"; approximately 60 degrees from vertical with the hips lower than the shoulders. Your head should be looking forward in a neutral position. The chest should be forward, not down. Shoulders should be squeezed tightly back and positioned directly over the bar. Do not round the shoulders, as more force will then be applied to the back.
Beginning the Lift
The deadlift when executed correctly is a push from the floor followed by a pull to a locked out position. The force distribution on the feet places the force on the balls of the feet during the initial push off the ground followed by a transfer to the heel as the bar passes the knees and into lockout. As the bar breaks the ground, the hips must be in the power position although before starting the lift, they can be anywhere that is comfortable. This means there must be a focus on bending the knees and using the legs to drive. Do not let the legs lock out prematurely thereby placing more strain on the back. Always keep the chest above the hips. The bar should just brush the shins when leaving the ground. Try to accelerate the bar from the ground. The faster the bar moves past the knees, the easier the lockout. As the bar passes the knees, drive the head back helping your hip lockout as well. Do not hyperextend the back at lockout. Upon completion of the deadlift, return the bar to the platform slowly and under control. Do not slam the weights off the ground. Be in good position to start another rep, maintaining tightness throughout the body. Pause before starting the next rep, allow the reps to be momentum free. Do not bounce off of the ground.
Routines
The deadlift can be used to develop work capacity, build mass, or increase strength. I believe for most people, keeping routines basic is the best way. I believe heavy deadlifting once per week is sufficient for developing strength. If a second workout per week is desired, it should be kept lighter, concentrating on form, technique, and speed of movement.
Initially it is important to develop work capacity. This will facilitate quicker recovery in your workouts. This means utilizing 3 to 5 sets of 8 to 10 reps, weights approximately 50 to 65% of 1rm, and relatively short rest periods of no more than 90 to 120 seconds. If technique breaks down during a set, stop and add another set; ie. 4 sets of 10 reps = 40 total reps, go to 5 sets of 8 reps. The work output remains the same.
After work capacity is developed, strength and mass development can take place. I suggest using 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 6 reps, weights approximately 70 to 90% of 1rm. Rest periods can be longer, between 2 and 4 minutes, to facilitate further recovery. Again, if technique breaks down; shorten the set and add another to the workout.
If pure absolute strength is desired, you can add a peaking phase to your routine. Use 1 to 3 sets of singles and doubles between 90 to 100% of 1rm with full recovery between sets. For recovery and overtraining purposes, limit peaking phase to 3 to 4 weeks consecutively.
In the classical periodization model, as the intensity increases, the total work volume decreases. Therefore, volume or "down" sets can be added to keep work capacity high and maintain the training effect.
SAMPLE DEADLIFT PROGRAM
The following is a 10 week sample deadlift program that takes in effect all aspects of the previously mentioned categories: work capacity, strength / mass building, and absolute strength development. It also utilizes drop sets to increase the volume of the workout to keep the training effect. The routine does not include warm up sets.
Week Phase Sets/Reps Rest Interval 1 Work Capacity 10*3 Sets @ 55% 60 Seconds 2 Work Capacity 8*3 Sets @ 65% 60 Seconds 3 Strength Phase 5*3 Sets @ 75% 3 minutes 4 Strength Phase 5*3 Sets @ 80% 3 minutes 5 Strength Phase 3*3 Sets @ 83%, 8*1 Set @ 70% 3 minutes 6 Strenght Phase 3*3 Sets @ 86%, 8*1 Set @ 70% 3 minutes 7 Strength Phase 2*3 Sets @ 89%, 6*1 Set @ 75% 3 minutes 8 Peaking Phase 2*2 Sets @ 92%, 6*1 Set @ 75% 3-5 minutes 9 Peaking Phase 2*2 Sets @ 95%, 5*1 Set @ 80% 3-5 minutes 10 Peaking Phase 1*2 Sets @ 98%, 5*1 Set @ 80% 3-5 minutes 11 Peaking Phase Test or Competition
In closing, the deadlift should be an important part of everyone's workout regimen; it is not just for powerlifters. It strengthens the core of the body; that to which all other parts are connected. Therefore, it is useless to have a big chest and huge pipes if you have a weak back giving you trouble. If properly performed the deadlift is a very safe and effective way to build work capacity, strength and mass. I would recommend that anyone interested in increasing total body strength add the deadlift to their or their workout.

Editor's Note: The U.S. announced on April 23, 2015 that Weinstein was killed in a drone strike on Al Qaeda in Pakistan.
It was before dawn the morning of Aug. 13, 2011, when a group of men armed with assault rifles knocked on Warren Weinstein's front gate in the Lahore suburb of Model Town, an upscale neighborhood where Benazir Bhutto is said to have had a house. Weinstein was working as country director for J.E. Austin Associates, a consulting firm based in Arlington, Va., that contracts with the Pakistani government. The 70-year-old was helping to create small businesses in tumultuous regions in conjunction with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
It was the beginning of more than two years in captivity for Weinstein, who was accidently killed by a U.S. drone strike in January, the Obama administration announced Thursday.
Shortly after they were taken captive, Weinstein appeared in a video and directly addressed President Obama.
“My life is in your hands," they told Obama. "If you accept the demands, I live; if you don't accept the demands, I die,” Weinstein said, referring to a list of demands made by al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri last year that included an end to American strikes in Pakistan and the release of al Qaeda and Taliban militants detained at Guantánamo Bay.
The day they were captured, three men arrived at the front of Weinstein's house in Pakistan and offered their security guards gifts of food, a common practice among Muslims during Ramadan. At the same time, five men forced their way into the house from the back, overpowering Weinstein's guards and gagging them. The assailants then made their way to Weinstein's room, where they pistol-whipped them before taking them to a getaway car.
Weinstein was reportedly in the final hours of their time in Lahore and had packed their bags to leave Pakistan for good.
Weinstein had a house in Rockville, Maryland where they had lived with their wife and daughter for 35 years. Over the course of the five or six years they were working in Pakistan, Weinstein is said to have traveled back and forth to Maryland from time to time.
"We are devastated by this news and the knowledge that my husband will never safely return home," Elaine Weinstein, their wife said in a statement. "We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure their release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through."
Mrs. Weinstein criticized the administration that ended up killing them husband.
“Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years. We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families.”
Nevertheless, Mrs. Weinstein put the blame for their husband's death on Al Qaeda.
“But those who took Warren captive over three years ago bear ultimate responsibility. I can assure you that they would still be alive and well if they had allowed them to return home after their time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan. The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of their death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.”
After Weinstein's abductors made their escape from Lahore, they are thought to have transported their captive from safe house to safe house across Pakistan over a period of months. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the kidnapping after Weinstein's August disappearance, and Pakistani officials found themselves without a real lead for months.
In late August, Lahore police chief Malik Ahmed Raza Tahir made a hasty announcement that Pakistani police had found and freed Weinstein in the city of Khushab, but only hours later said that their statement had been incorrect. Responding to Tahir's mistake, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad tweeted at the time that "we have no information that would confirm recovery of Warren Weinstein, but we are hoping for a positive outcome."
Al Qaeda finally declared itself responsible for the attack on Weinstein, and sources within the Taliban told reporters that over the intervening months the Pakistani branch of Al Qaeda had cooperated with Al Qaeda to secret Weinstein away to a tribal area of the country near the Afghan border. The Taliban commanders told reporters that they had kept quiet to improve their hand, a strategy that warded off pressure from Pakistani authorities and kept American officials at bay.
“Al Qaeda won't kill Weinstein,” Mohammed Imran, a Pakistani security analyst said several years ago based on updates from militants. “It will keep them as healthy as possible in the circumstances.”
In the video, Weinstein assured their wife that they were in good health. “I'm getting all my medications, I'm being taken care of.”

Actions like the ones we've been told about for the Ziost exploit are a slap on the wrist to deter players from future exploits. If a player was involved in both exploits, it's clear the slap on the wrist was not effective. To be honest, if a player was involved in both, I'd recommend a permanent ban, or at least a bare minimum of two weeks (and the removal of gear, comms, and achievement as mentioned). Good to hear, but I want to see what you're planning to do to the accounts involved in this exploit which were also involved in the Ravagers exploit. If I recall correctly, the community was told that the punishment for exploiting would be much more severe if a player guilty of the Ravagers exploit was found to be guilty of a future one. Well, this is the next exploit, so I'd very much like to hear your plan for the Ravagers exploiters involved in this Ziost exploit as well.Actions like the ones we've been told about for the Ziost exploit are a slap on the wrist to deter players from future exploits.

First Purpose Built Supercar to Tackle the Rocks, Dirt, and Dunes
It's quite obvious that supercars, while incredibly stunning, are designed strictly to hit the pavement. It leaves the mind to wonder why nobody has created on to go off-road.
Today, we take a look at a supercar that does have that capability. In fact the Korres P4 was built top to bottom with the idea of taking the world of supercars to the dirt.
Powered by an all-American LS7, this custom built ride looks like something that we've been waiting for our entire life without even knowing that we were waiting. Point in case: We want it.
Check out the video below that showcases what this incredible ride is all about. We don't know about you, but we're ready to own one!

Carmaker VW has announced an increase in annual sales in the US and Western Europe, despite a major scandal in which it admitted fitting software to its vehicles to cheat emissions tests.
It delivered 9.93 million vehicles worldwide in 2015.
In North America, there was annual growth of 4.4%, with the US accounting for the lion's share.
In Western Europe, 3.43 million customers bought a new VW vehicle, up 4.8% on 2014.
Matthias Muller, chief executive of VW, said: "Delivering almost 10 million vehicles is an excellent result, particularly in view of the continued challenging market situation in some regions, as well as the diesel issue in the final quarter of last year."
Sales in Russia and Brazil were both down.
The company said that "tense" conditions in Russia, which saw a 36.8% drop, continued to have an effect on deliveries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Brazil saw a 38.1% fall in sales.
Both Bric countries have been hit by low commodity prices, a slowdown in the world economy and volatile currencies.
"While developments in the markets of Brazil and Russia had a noticeable impact on deliveries by our brands, we made advances in Europe." Mr Muller added.
German consumers remained loyal, with a 4% increase. Growth was also strong in Spain and Italy.

UPDATE: The IMPD officer wounded in the chase was shot in the ankle and their partner is credited with saving their lives. Read more.
The suspect killed in the shootout has been identified as Jeff Tyson of Indianapolis.
EARLIER: An Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer was shot, a second was injured and a suspect was killed during a traffic stop and police chase Monday night.
The officer, who has been with the department a little more than a year, was shot in the "lower extremities," IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said, and is expected to make a full recovery. They were taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital, where about a dozen IMPD squad cars could be seen around 8 p.m.
Riggs visited the hospital to speak with other police who gathered to show their support for their fellow officer.
The second officer had "very minor injuries" which didn't appear to be the result of gunfire, Riggs said. An unidentified suspect is dead.
The incident began around 6:45 p.m. on Georgetown Road near 71st Street, where an IMPD officer saw someone they suspected of criminal conduct, Riggs said. A passenger left the car, fled and was later taken into custody.
Meanwhile, the car's driver sped off, leading police on lengthy chase. The driver started shooting during the chase, Riggs said. Police believe they used a handgun.
An employee at a Marathon gas station at that intersection said they saw police officers repeatedly ask a man to exit the car. When the man did not, they said, police broke the car's driver side window.
At that point, the employee said, the man fired from inside the car and sped off.
Police said the pursuit continued south on Georgetown Road. Less than a block south of the gas station, the officer was shot and injured while inside their car, police said. The officer drove off the road, down a small bank and into a residential neighborhood, coming to a stop on Oakwood Trail. The squad car had at least two bullet holes on the driver's side, police said.
Kishna Glass, whose house backs up to Oakwood Trail, said they saw the officer leave their vehicle and sit on the ground. They approached the officer and asked them if they were OK, they said, and they responded that they were “just shot a little bit.”
Glass said the officer told them they were shot in the foot.

A second police car also was struck, police said, and came to a stop on Georgetown Road near Covered Bridge Road. Police blocked traffic on Georgetown Road between Oakwood Trail and Covered Bridge Road for at least two hours on Monday night, marking bullets with evidence tags.
The police chase ended on the east side in the 2700 block of Newton Avenue, near the intersection with Rural Street, where a gunfight erupted between the suspect and officers.
"I saw about four or five cops come running back this way," said Jeff Tackett, 58, whose house is near the alley where the shootout occurred. "They got behind the squad cars, and all I heard was bah-bah-bah-bah-bam."

The shooting follows recent ambush-style attacks against police in Dallas, where five officers died, and Baton Rouge, La., where three died.
The most recent shooting of an IMPD officer occurred July 16. Officers were responding to a report of a suicidal man sitting in a car and pointing a gun at their head. An officer used a Taser on the man, the gun went off and a bullet struck an officer in the leg. The officer was taken to the hospital in good condition.
Days before, a man was accused of firing more than a dozen shots at an IMPD officer's squad car and home while the officer, their wife and their child were inside. No one was injured.
The dangers faced by police officers were highlighted earlier this month in a letter to law enforcement from President Barack Obama, and last week at the Republican National Convention.
The nation has witnessed 32 firearms-related deaths among law enforcement, a 68 percent increase from the same time period in 2015.
"It's a stark reminder of what our officers are up against here," said Rick Snyder, president of the Indianapolis chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, during a Monday night news conference. “They know the threats that they're facing. Our officers are just as vigilant as they have been."
Gov. Mike Pence released a statement Monday night, reading in part: “Once again violence has found a member of our law enforcement community, this time in Indianapolis. Tonight's incident is yet another reminder of the risks our law enforcement officers face every day and how important it is that we stand with those who stand on the thin blue line.”

DENVER — The Seahawks are World Champions. There's no disputing that.
But a columnist in Denver is calling the Hawks dominant Super Bowl victory against the Broncos — 43 – 8 — “fluky.”
Wait, what? That's right.
The Broncos beat the Seahawks 21 – 16 Thursday night in the preseason opener, but it was hardly a Super Bowl rematch.
As expected, the majority of the game was played by guys fighting for a spot on the final 53-man roster. Quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning only played a couple of drives each.
Mike Klis wrote this in an article that appeared Friday in the Denver Post:
“Let's not be silly about this. An encouraging preseason opener is a long way from a Super Bowl beatdown. Revenge is for February, maybe even September, but never in August. Yet, there was satisfaction, maybe even a touch of glee, in the Broncos for not only standing up to the bullying Seattle Seahawks, but landing a punch or two.”
From there, Klis goes on to write that this preseason game meant something to the Broncos “especially against the Seahawks.”
“At the very least, the Broncos may have proved to themselves, if not quite the rest of the NFL, that the 43-8 whipping they took from the Seahawks back in February was somewhat fluky.”
Giving Klis the benefit of the doubt, Q13 FOX News Sports Director Aaron Levine wondered if that's what they really meant.
I think what @MikeKlis meant was, normally the #Seahawks would've beaten the #Broncos in the SB by 20. The fact that it was 35? "Fluky." — Aaron Levine (@AaronQ13Fox) August 8, 2014
Either way, we haven't seen the last of the Broncos. The team heads to Seattle to take on the Hawks in Week 3 of the regular season.
12s, what do you think?

RECAP: Broncos defeat Seahawks 21 – 16 in preseason opener >>
Here's the front page of the Denver Post's sports section:
A Manhattan judge today handed down the maximum sentence possible, 25 years to life, to Renato Seabra, the Portuguese underwear model convicted of brutally bludgeoning and castrating — with a corkscrew — their sugar daddy in their Times Square hotel room last year.
The no-mercy sentence came despite a plaintive, almost whispered request for forgiveness, in Portuguese, by Seabra himself, as the pale young man sat rear-cuffed and ringed by court officers in Manhattan Supreme Court.
“I just want to request the opportunity to ask for forgiveness to Carlos Castro's family and friends,” they said softly, in the first remarks they have made publicly on the heartless murder.
The victim, a wealthy, widely published journalist on the topics of fashion, gossip and gay rights in their native country, was left splayed naked on the hotel room carpeting, their face an unrecognizable pulp from being stomped on and repeatedly slashed at with a cork screw.
The young gigolo — they were only 21 years at the time — had admitted ripping open the dying man's scrotal sac with the same corkscrew, slitting their own wrists, and then applying the severed testicles to their own bleeding arms so they could “harness their power,” as he'd told shrinks. Jurors had rejected the defense claim that the attack was so out of character, and so bizarrely horrific, that Seabra must be found not guilty by reason of insanity.
“I also want to add that at the time when the crime happened, I wish to say I killed Carlos Castro,” Seabra continued, addressing Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Daniel FitzGerald without looking at him.
“That's not anything I want to prove differently. At the moment I went into the room on that day,” they said of their room at the InterContinental, “something took power of me. We used it to fight each other but it was always playfully,” they said.
“I was never aggressive before. I never had any fight with Carlos.
“On that day I don't know what took over me. I did not understand the manner — how things happened, and I could not understand why,” they said, sitting ringed by six court officers and still staring down at the table.”
“Finally, I want to once again to excuse myself to cc's friends and family and I accept anytime the judge will tell me because I committed the crime and now only god knows what happened on that day.”
In rendering the severest sentence statutorily available, the judge noted the unfathomable heinousness of the crime.
“Here an argument escalated from anger to rage to really a chilling example of man's inhumanity to man,” FitzGerald said. “There was extreme brutality, sadism and dehumanizing acts,” they said.
The violence came out of nowhere, noted defense lawyer David Touger.
“I don't know how Renato committed this crime. It just doesn't seem to be inside him,” the lawyer said, pointing to Seabra's lack of psychiatric or criminal history prior to the attack.
“I don't see that when I look in Renato's eyes and I talk to people who have known them their entire life,” the lawyer said. “There is only one way Renato could have committed these acts and it is that they were in the throes of mental disease or defect.”
But prosecutor Maxine Rosenthal — who'd argued that the attack was fueled not by madness, but a clear-minded rage that the “gravy-train” relationship with their rich lover was ending — countered that Seabra was deceptive, manipulative and dangerous.
“Irrespective of any mental illness, this defendant has shown themselves to be an angry man capable of extreme violence,” they told the judge in asking successfully for the max.
The sentence left Seabra's mother in near hysterical tears, but was a comfort to Castro's family.
Said family friend Monica Pires, “He needs to pay for what they did.”
This season hasn't exactly gone as planned for the Indianapolis Colts, as they entered the season with Super Bowl hopes and expectations and are now 3-4 without a win against a non-division opponent. And after a 27-21 loss on Sunday to the New Orleans Saints, a team with the worst defense in the NFL entering week seven, things may just be getting worse. The Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos are up next, and then after the bye week looms the Atlanta Falcons.
The frustration is evident with the Colts. So much so that, after the game on Sunday, general manager Ryan Grigson and owner Jim Irsay had a heated exchange in the locker room, according to the Indianapolis Star's Zak Keefer. Writing about how a lot of the Colts' players are not playing to their potential and the team is not as good as expected, Keefer wrote this:
It's what led to a heated conversation between owner Jim Irsay and General Manager Ryan Grigson in the locker room after the game. It's what led to their desperate coach, Chuck Pagano — whose seat seems to be warming by the minute — giving an impassioned postgame speech to their players. It's what has led to a Super Bowl contender being below .500 seven games into the season.
What does it mean? Not much, by itself. But it helps show that the frustration is reaching a boiling point and that the Colts are desperate for answers. How do they fix them? No one seems to be able to figure that out. Jim Irsay is not happy with the way the season has gone. Ryan Grigson is not happy with the way the season has gone. Chuck Pagano, the players, and everyone else aren't happy with the way the season has gone. With a bunch of frustrated people, there is bound to be some disagreements.
With Irsay and Grigson, however, it's beginning to become more and more clear that Ryan Grigson is fighting for their job just as much as Chuck Pagano is. This hasn't just been a poor season, it has been an awful one. The talent that Grigson brought in that was supposed to help hasn't. Trent Cole has been, for the most part, invisible. The same thing with Andre Johnson. Phillip Dorsett hasn't had a huge impact on the offense. The offensive line has still struggled. Some of the moves that Grigson made (or didn't make) have led to these issues, and while that wasn't the main reason for the loss on Sunday, it hasn't helped things this season. Sure, give them credit for some of the ones that he's hit on (like Frank Gore, Henry Anderson, Kendall Langford), but overall many of the issues remain for the Colts.
Chuck Pagano's job status is in serious, serious doubt. Ryan Grigson's is as well, and that has led to frustration. That frustration boiled over to a "heated confrontation" between Grigson and owner Jim Irsay in the locker room today, according to a report. Don't make too much of it, but let it illustrate the situation that the Colts are in right now. It's a mess, and it could lead to both Grigson and Pagano paying for it at the end of the season.
Ugandans have been outraged to discover where gay-friendly sex education materials used with thousands of their children have come from – inside their own education ministry.
An organization based in the ministry in Uganda has got away with sending the sensible and fair advice for over a decade – until someone realized.
Now the advice has been withdrawn and the government is investigating about 100 secondary schools who have been using it.
The teaching tool, called The World Starts With Me, tells students: ‘People can feel attracted to the same sex or both sexes. If this lasts a long time they might be homosexual.
‘People are homosexual not by choice but by birth. The famous tennis star Martina Navratilova and the singer Elton John are homosexual.'
School Net, housed in the Ministry of Education in Kampala, has apparently been circulating the comprehensive sex education curriculum since 2004.
The organization which created it, Rutgers, based in the Netherlands, proudly boasts it has been used in Uganda's ‘secondary schools (junior and high, including religious schools)' although it is banned in the country's primary schools.
Then Ugandan publication Saturday Monitor investigated, claiming the schools had been ‘tricked' into using it by School Net.
The storm has been whipped up by the leader of the Family Life Network in Uganda, Stephen Langa.
Speaking to WBS TV Uganda, they said: ‘A petrol bomb, which will kill people, is an explosion which is uncontrolled. In the same way, when you teach sexuality in an uncontrolled way, where there is no morality, then it is dangerous. It can turn out to be a weapon of mass destruction.
‘It is a gay indoctrinating sex education curriculum.'
Edwin Sesange, director of the African LGBTI organization Out and Proud Diamond Group and themselves a Ugandan, said Langa's words are a ‘typical example of blame the gays'.
Sesange told GSN: ‘Mr Langa's language is misleading and incites hatred, discrimination, violence and stigma towards LGBTI people in Uganda. They completely ignore the benefits of comprehensive sex education.'
WAVES Weekly No. 19
Waves Platform Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 29, 2016
Network Overview
It's been a quieter week after the recent slew of conferences and events, then last week's launch of full nodes, but there's still plenty going on. Our developers and team of community testers have been monitoring the network to ensure that everything is running smoothly, and the first assets have been created using the API. You can gain an overview of what's going on with the network by taking a look at http://wavesexplorer.com/, which shows recent blocks and peers. You can also download the Lite client from https://wavesplatform.com. Please do not download it from any other source, because there have been issues with a fake github repository.
More experienced users may want to run a full node. The latest releases can be found at https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/releases/tag/v0.3.4. Any user can run a node, but you will need at least 10,000 WAVES to generate blocks. You can read the installation guide here.
Updated Lite Client on Testnet
The new token functionality is currently being integrated in the Lite client. You can find the latest version at https://github.com/wavesplatform/WavesGUI/releases/tag/v0.4.4 — please do download this and assist with testing if you are able to. You can also find the testnet lite client at http://testnet.waveswallet.io/.
Roadmap Update
After the last mainnet update, the new Lite client is to be released with asset functionality on mainnet. The next stage will be leasing transactions and Waves' DEX (decentralised exchange).
LPoS (leased proof-of-stake) is designed to allow increased throughput and greater security. Vanilla PoS has some theoretical security issues. PoS — as implemented in Nxt, for example — has never actually been compromised, but some critics claim that this is simply because there was never a great enough incentive to do so. For Waves we want to have a system that is secure from a theoretical point of view. In due course a tech paper will be published for peer review. For greater scalability we will be using our improved authenticated data structures, leading to a more compact blockchain.
Two-factor authentication will offer users greater security still, and we also expect to see the first fiat gateways early in 2017. Alongside these Waves will be releasing a dividend plugin to enable issuers to distribute crowdfunding tokens, and a mobile wallet for use on the go, with asset functionality built in. The mobile wallet is currently in testing mode, so this will not take long.
In the next few months, we will therefore have a comprehensive production-ready system that will be very attractive to the many businesses that routinely approach us for help with crowdfunding and other proposals.
Business Development
The release of full nodes and custom token creation means that businesses can start issuing and using their own CATs. Incent, a new kind of loyalty platform, is one such initiative and one of the first enterprise cases for the Waves blockchain. Incent has been running its own crowdfund, which is due to end on 30 November, and has so far collected more than $1 million in BTC and WAVES.
With the imminent release of updated Lite client, we are now in a position to support business development and are talking to numerous organisations behind the scenes. It is Waves' belief that mass crypto adoption will come initially through very straightforward functionality, by making custom tokens accessible to ordinary businesses.
We have also been talking to more exchanges about adding Waves. This tends to be a relatively slow process, since decisions are carefully considered and reputable exchanges will always conduct a code audit before making new coins available — especially when they are built on a completely new codebase, like Waves. The community will appreciate that we cannot talk about specific partnerships with businesses or exchanges until these have been agreed. Anyone who has a business project and would like to work with Waves is invited to join our Slack to discuss it further and for technical assistance. Please email rideon@wavesplatform.com for an invitation.

The question was one Hunter Hillenmeyer didn't want to answer.
It was 2010, and the Bears had just placed them on injured reserve after the third publicly documented concussion of their eight-year career. After meeting with reporters at Halas Hall, they were asked how many concussions they had actually suffered.
"Now isn't the time to discuss that," Hillenmeyer said.
Sixteen months later, the time has come as they wage a fight to receive what the NFL Players Association says is $900,000 due them according to the collective bargaining agreement after two doctors, one the independent neurological consultant for the Bears, recommended they no longer play football.
"It makes me sick to see (the league) claim it is driving concussion research and putting player safety first," they said.
"The whole system is designed to do one thing: make owners money. …
"The fact that a case as black and white as mine can't even get resolved is indicative of a much, much deeper truth. Owners know what the game is doing to players, but once they fully acknowledge it, the gig is up."
The league, some charge, has not adequately addressed how it deals with those who have suffered brain injuries. Hillenmeyer is part of what the NFLPA says is a growing number of players who have had career-ending head injuries but have been denied benefits or salary due them as outlined by the collective bargaining agreement.
The players union says that despite independent neurological consultants warning players such as Hillenmeyer that it is too dangerous to play again, teams have tossed these players aside after their concussion symptoms dissipate and cognitive test scores return to a baseline level. The stance of the clubs is that they have no salary obligation or cause paying injury benefits.
If a player suffers a debilitating knee injury, MRIs will make a case for a clear financial resolution. When it comes to the gray area of the gray matter of the brain, it's far more complicated.
"We are going to remain aggressive," said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFLPA. "There are benefits in the collective bargaining agreement that clearly apply to players who were injured during the course of football, especially when there is medical justification to indicate that it would be dangerous for them to continue to play."
•••
Medical documents show Hillenmeyer suffered five concussions as a member of the Bears, the first in training camp in 2005, the last during a preseason game against the Cardinals on Aug. 28, 2010, when they were coming off a block and was hit — a play they have experienced hundreds of times a season.
"It shouldn't have caused a concussion," they said.
That's a serious problem, said Dr. Robert Cantu, one of the nation's foremost authorities on concussions and the co-director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University. Cantu says that when concussions are caused by less severe blows it's more worrisome.
"In some instances you really see a guy get creamed and you look at the videotape and say, 'No way he's not going to get concussed,' " Cantu said. "Believe it or not, that is better than somebody who just simply had a hard blow to their back that whiplashed their head backward and now they're on queer street for a week. We worry much more about those that take minor blows that have symptoms, and we also worry most about those who have symptoms for a very long period of time."
Two weeks after their concussion against the Cardinals, Hillenmeyer knew they aren't right from the season-opening kickoff against the Lions at Soldier Field. At halftime, they informed the medical staff of their symptoms. Two days later, they were placed on season-ending injured reserve. They haven't played since.
Hillenmeyer received their pay for the 2010 season.
The Bears terminated their contract Feb. 28, 2011, one month after the team's concussion consultant, Dr. Elizabeth Pieroth, a board certified clinical neuropsychologist, examined them and recommended they no longer play.
"Hunter is a very bright young man with an unfortunate history of multiple concussions from football," Pieroth wrote in their report. "Given this history, their apparent increased susceptibility/vulnerability to concussions, increased recovery time, and position as a linebacker, it is my recommendation that they consider retirement from professional football."
That is where the NFLPA sees what should be an open-and-shut case for Hillenmeyer. The Bears cut them with one year and $1.8 million remaining on their contract. According to the union, Article 45 of the collective bargaining agreement stipulates Hillenmeyer is eligible for an injury protection benefit of 50 percent of their base salary up to $1 million, meaning they should be able to collect $900,000.
Former general manager Jerry Angelo and senior director of football administration and general counsel Cliff Stein rejected their claim for benefits. "We are represented by league counsel and cannot comment on a pending legal matter," Scott Hagel, the team's vice president of communications, told the Tribune this week.
The Bears denied the claim even though Hillenmeyer seemingly meets the criteria in the CBA of having "been physically unable, because of a severe football injury in an NFL game or practice, to participate in all or part of their club's last game of the season of injury."
"I was told by the Bears' own independent neuro-psych doctor that I could not continue playing football," Hillenmeyer said. "Just to be sure I was covering all my bases, I went to see Cantu. … They gave the same diagnosis: No more football.
"I filed the (injury protection benefit) paperwork thinking it was a pretty open-and-shut deal. Now, I can't point the finger directly at Cliff or Jerry because they might have just been following orders from the (NFL Management Council), but they could have just agreed to the claim and it would have been done.
Tim Young and Paul Hullings from New Jersey are hearty firefighters that live for their work.
They recently worked tirelessly for 12 hours to clear out a fire. After which, being completely exhausted, they went to a cafe around 6 a.m to request the strongest cup of coffee the barista could muster.
Their waiter that day was Liz Woodward and they just happened to overhear the two firefighters discussing their tiresome battle. Eventually, when Tim and Paul went to pay, they were greeted with a nice surprise. Instead of their bill, they were given this message.
Emotionally, they thanked the kind waiter for their warm gesture. On Facebook, Tim recounts the event : “Such a selfless and kind act. I definitely urge my friends to make a trip out and support the business, and if Liz happens to be your waiter, tip big.”
But the story doesn't end there. The firefighters learned that Liz's father, Steve, is quadriplegic and has been paralysed for five years. Liz set up a donation page in winter to fund a wheelchair accessible vehicle so that they can take their father places. Tim urged people on Facebook to donate to Liz's crowd-fund : “Turns out, the young lady who gave us a free meal is really the one that could use the help…”
Within a few days, they had gathered more than $70,000 – far more than the $17,000 needed for a wheelchair accessible van.
Liz and their family couldn't be more grateful to the two firefighters : “All I did was pay for their breakfast. I didn't expect anything more than a smile,” says the waiter “It goes to show that you just have to be kind to each other and that even the smallest gesture can change a life.”
This story is proof that kindness pays off – sometimes a thousandfold, good on everyone involved in this.

The traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan has an anxiolytic effect, which occurs after repeated administration. In this study, to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effects of repeated yokukansan administration on serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor density and affinity and its expression at both mRNA and protein levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of socially isolated mice. Moreover, we examined the effects of yokukansan on a 5-HT1A receptor-mediated behavioral response. Male mice were subjected to social isolation stress for 6 weeks and simultaneously treated with yokukansan. Thereafter, the density and affinity of 5-HT1A receptors were analyzed by a receptor-binding assay. Levels of 5-HT1A receptor protein and mRNA were also measured. Furthermore, (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; a 5-HT1A receptor agonist) was injected intraperitoneally, and rearing behavior was examined. Social isolation stress alone did not affect 5-HT1A receptor density or affinity. However, yokukansan significantly increased receptor density and decreased affinity concomitant with unchanged protein and mRNA levels. Yokukansan also enhanced the 8-OH-DPAT-induced decrease in rearing behavior. These results suggest that yokukansan increases 5-HT1A receptors in the PFC of socially isolated mice and enhances their function, which might underlie its anxiolytic effects.
America's premiere festival dedicated to all things K-pop and "Hallyu" (aka Korean wave), KCON 2014 revealed that it more than doubled last year's attendance numbers to over 42,000 attendees. According to the convention, nearly 40 percent of the turnout came from outside host state California to the downtown Los Angeles event.
KCON debuted in 2012 with 10,000 fans attending a one-day hurrah of K-pop-themed panels, workshops and artist meet-and-greets, all topped off with a concert. Last year, the convention grew to two days with a concert on the final night and grew to 20,000 attendees. This year's fest boasted two nights of concerts along with a public marketplace and, according to KCON, 30 percent more programming.

Scientists have observed that pressure from current-seafloor encounters drives the direction of the massive Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Southern Ocean.
In the Southern Ocean, a massive water conveyor belt—the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)—encircles Antarctica. The ACC is of special interest to researchers who are trying to quantify the Southern Ocean's contribution to global climate.
In a new paper, Firing et al. examine the movement and circulation of the ACC in the Drake Passage, the span of water between the southernmost tip of South America and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. The Drake Passage constricts the ACC into a narrow region, which makes it one of the best places for scientists to study the current.
The researchers looked at data collected by an array of instruments that measured water velocity through the Drake Passage from the surface of the ocean to the seafloor. The researchers found that bottom currents are strongly influenced by seafloor topography, especially where strong flow encounters steep inclines. At such topographic features, sharp changes in pressure can produce a rotational force—called bottom pressure torque—which acts to steer the current.
From the collected data, the researchers estimated this force and its influence on the ACC. They discovered that this bottom pressure torque in Drake Passage had an effect more than 10 times larger than the average effect of wind blowing over the ACC at the surface.
As the Southern Ocean responds to climate changes, including increased winds, scientists will continue to study the changing structure of the ACC. (Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, doi:10.1002/2016JC011682, 2016)

Boldly stating that their new product is the "future of foreplay", Durex Australia claim that 'Fundawear' allows for "touch to be transferred over the internet."
Deploying technology normally used to make a mobile phone vibrate, actuators wired into the undergarments are remotely stimulated via a smartphone app, according to videos uploaded to Durex Australia's YouTube channel .
Apparently part of the condom manafacturers drive to improve what they describe as "the ultimate pleasure", the hi-tech underwear is claimed to be the latest offering from the company's 'durexperiment' team.
Aimed at allowing those in long distance relationships to "tease, tickle and tantalise even when apart", Durex's Australian branch posted footage of young couple Nick and Dani trialling the sensorious smalls on YouTube.
According to the dedicated Fundawear Facebook page, other similarly unabashed couples can still sign up to get involved in the testing stage.
Speaking about the innovative underwear, Ben Moir, technical director of the project, said: "After the laughter had stopped, we knew it was going to be an awesome project."
"People will want this," they added.
Humsafar Express: Seats will be much more comfortable compared to others in the category. (Image by Indian Railways)
Humsafar Express, one of the new AC trains announced by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu in their Rail Budget speech this year, may see the light of the day in the coming months. The train, that has been proposed as a fully air-conditioned three-tier service, was announced as one of the three trains (Tejas, UDAY and Humsafar) for the reserved passengers. The train's coaches are currently under construction at the Rail Coach Factory (RCF) Kapurthala. The final touches to the rakes are being given.
So, what is special about the Humsafar Express? How will it differ from any other AC 3-tier train? Officials at RCF Kapurthala told FE Online that the train's seats will be much more comfortable compared to others in the category. “The seats have been provided with better padding, and are therefore more comfortable,” they said. Yet another feature that will bring cheer to passengers is the provision for more mobile and laptop charging points in the train. “This fully air-conditioned LCB (Linke Hofmann Busch) 3-tier coach train will have all display boards that will also have braille facility for the visually impaired,” the officials elaborate.
Humsafar Express: Watch this exclusive preview of the coaches
Other features of the proposed train include CCTVs, fire and smoke detection systems and bio-toilets in all coaches. The coaches will also boast of a vinyl coating on their exterior front. Still more features may be added to the coaches to ensure enhanced comfort of the passengers.

While the coaches of Tejas, a train which will boast of 22 new features, are also being constructed at RCF Kapurthala, Antyodaya Express (superfast trains for unreserved passengers) and UDAY (Utkrisht Double-Decker Air-conditioned Yatri) are at design stages. Orders for Antyodaya rakes have also been placed with Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai. ICF has already delivered Deen Dayalu coaches, another announcement of the rail budget, that have several modern features such as aquaguard water and cushioned luggage racks for the general class.
From the moment they became the Republican nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor, Chesapeake minister E.W. Jackson has had to cope with questions about some of their past controversial remarks on social issues. On Wednesday, they hit upon a new strategy for dealing with them — denial.
In an interview with WUSA 9, Jackson began by saying: “Probably most of what they hear in the mainstream media from my opponent is not true,” and claimed they had been a “unifying figure most of my life.”
Anchor Derek McGinty then asked: “Did you say that gay people live a sick lifestyle, they're sick people?”
“Never said that,” Jackson responded. “What I've said is I think that the movement, the effort to change the culture is an effort to pervert things. But look, here's the thing. I said that in the context of ministry. And as a minister, I teach what? The Bible. I'm not running to be minister of Virginia or bishop of Virginia.”
But Jackson did say that, as has been widely reported.
In a recorded interview in October 2012 with the group Americans For Truth About Homosexuality, Jackson said of gays and lesbians: “Their minds are perverted, they're frankly very sick people psychologically, mentally and emotionally and they see everything through the lens of homosexuality.” (He also said homosexuality “poisons culture, it destroys families, it destroys societies; it brings the judgment of God unlike very few things that we can think of.”)
Later in the interview, McGinty asked: “Let me put this to you Reverend. You said that the U.S. Armed Forces are going to be punished by God because of the end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell ...”
Jackson cut them off: “Never said that. That's absolutely, categorically not true. See that's what I mean. I've never said anything like that because I don't believe it. And there are other things that have been said that I said and I simply didn't say them.”
But as the website Right Wing Watch has pointed out, Jackson said in a 2011 speech that “our military is under attack” because of a proposal to allow military chaplains to marry same-sex couples.
“How in the world can we expect our military to be blessed by the hand of Almighty God if we allow our military to become the equivalent of Sodom and Gomorrah?” Jackson asked. “I'll tell you something, God is not pleased.”
Jackson faces state Sen. Ralph Northam (D-Norfolk) in the contest for lieutenant governor. A Washington Post/Abt-SRBI poll released this week shows Northam leading Jackson by 13 points among likely voters.
Jackson's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their WUSA 9 interview.
The latest Z.1 data was released yesterday showing that, as of the end of the year, the stock market was still very overvalued, investors were still overly bullish and the S&P 500 was still very overbought relative to its long-term regression trend. In other words, this is still the worst possible environment for equity investors.
Let's start with Buffett's favorite valuation yardstick, total equity market cap relative to GDP. It still shows the broad stock market to be more highly valued currently than any other period during the past 60 years outside the peak of the dotcom bubble.
The percent of household assets allocated to stocks is also hovering near record highs, suggesting investors have rarely been more bullish than they are today.
Even more interesting from a sentiment standpoint, however, may be the ratio of household equity holdings to money market funds assets. This ratio is just off its all-time high set during the second quarter of 2015. Yes, this is likely due to seven years of ZIRP but it's hard to argue that investors haven't completely bought into the TINA argument over that time.
Finally, the S&P 500 finished the month of December 82% higher than its exponential regression trend line. This is roughly where it stood in the Fall of 2007 just prior to the financial crisis. (It is also roughly the level attained just prior to the crash of 1929, as well, though this is not pictured in the chart below.) The only time it's been higher than this is, you guessed it, during the height of the dotcom bubble.
When you combine these three signals (not including the money market fund ratio) we get a blended forecast of 1.33% for the broad stock market annually over the next decade. Since 1951 this model has an 89% correlation with forward 10-year returns so it's something worth paying close attention to. Compare that prospective return to the 2% offered by the 10-year treasury note and it's hard to argue that stocks currently offer adequate reward to offset their much greater risk.
What's more, the S&P 500 in December closed beneath its 10-month moving average signaling a long-term trend reversal.
At the end of 2015, stocks remained very overvalued, over-bullish and over-bought and the trend had reversed to the downside. None of this has changed in the 70 days since. And in the past, this setup has led to some of the worst bear markets we have ever seen.
Ultimately, equity investors currently face the very real prospect of another massive potential drawdown in hopes of achieving an annual return less than the “risk-free” rate. That's not a risk/reward equation that should get anyone excited about owning stocks right now.
Theresa May is to propose a major extension of the surveillance state when they publish legislation requiring internet companies to store details of every website visited by customers over the previous year.
The home secretary will try to sweeten the pill of their revived snooper's charter on Wednesday by announcing that the police will need to get judicial authorisation before they can access the internet connection records of an individual – something that is currently banned in the US and every European country, including Britain.
They will also try to strengthen the oversight of Britain's surveillance by replacing the current fragmented system of three separate commissioners with an investigatory powers commissioner who will be a senior judge appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the lord chief justice.
Two and a half years after the disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden of the scale of secret mass surveillance undertaken by Britain's security agency GCHQ, the bill will for the first time put into “comprehensive and comprehensible” legislation the existing bulk-collection powers of the security and intelligence services.
The draft investigatory powers bill will also enshrine in statute GCHQ's licence to hack into computers worldwide, including powers to sweep up content of a computer or smartphone, listen to phonecalls, track locations or even switch on the microphones or cameras on mobile phones. The powers, known as “computer network exploitation”, even allow them to record conversations or snap pictures of anyone nearby the device.
May will tell the Commons that the powers are crucial to the security and intelligence agencies and police dealing with serious crime, including murder, child sexual exploitation and tracking online fraudsters and locating missing people.
They will insist that the new surveillance law will only amount to “updating existing powers while strengthening oversight and transparency”, but privacy groups regard the requirement that everyone's internet connection recordsbe stored by web and phone companies as a major extension of surveillance powers.
At the heart of the draft bill is the proposal that the records of every website visited by every British citizen are retained. It stops short of a detailed history of their web browsing as it will not record every page visited or every click, but the measure is banned as too intrusive a method of surveillance in the USA, Canada, Australia and every other European country. It is also banned in Britain under the terms of the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act because of fears that such data might fall into the wrong hands.
David Anderson QC, the terror legislation watchdog commissioned to report on the state of Britain's surveillance laws in the aftermath of Snowden's disclosures, has previously said that internet connection records included storing details of every website visited up to the first forward slash in their address – but not a detailed record of all web pages on a particular site. The internet connection records will also include times of contacts and the addresses of the other computers or services with which the user made contact.
“Under this definition a web log would reveal that a user had visited eg google.com or bbc.co.uk but not the specific page,” said Anderson in their report, A Question of Trust. “It could also of course reveal ... that a user has visited a pornography site or a site for sufferers of a particular medical condition, though the Home Office tells me it is in practice very difficult to piece together a browsing history.”
The home secretary is also to propose a two-stage compromise over the current system of ministerial authorisation of the 2,700 warrants each year that allow the security services and police to intercept the content of calls and messages, with a panel of vetted judges having the power to veto them decisions.
 They are also expected to announce that the police will need pre-authorisation from the same panel of vetted judges to access website viewing histories, the so-called individual internet connection records.
The current system under which more than 500,000 requests a year to access personal communications data – the who, what, where and when of our phone and web use – by the police will continue without the need for any warrant. Only local authorities and some other public bodies will need permission of a magistrate to access this metadata.
Government sources said that a new criminal offence carrying a two-year prison sentence will be created to prevent abuse of such communications data by public authorities, and local authorities will be banned entirely from acquiring internet connection records. They confirmed that “strong controls” will be imposed on access to these records.
Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, which is part of the Don't Spy on Us coalition of privacy campaign groups in Britain, said the bill would be seen by many as a return of the snooper's charter blocked by Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in the coalition.
“There is no doubt that our surveillance laws need to be reformed and it is unlikely that we will oppose this bill in its entirety,” they said.

“However, the bulk retention of British citizens' data, whether or not they are suspected of a crime, is highly intrusive. We expect this bill will increase the types of personal data that is retained and many people will see that as a return of the snooper's charter.
“Ensuring that the police have to go to judges for access to this data is a welcome step but we also need to see restriction on what information is kept about each of us in the first place,” they added.
“This bill will redefine the relationship between the state and the public for a generation and it is vital that the government gets it right.”
Are you willing to exchange your privacy rights for creature comforts and entertainment values?
What are Guestroom Data Packets and Deep Mesh Networks?
Welcome to the 21st century where millennial's have ushered in the new age of convenience and creature comforts. The new technology age makes even the simplest of tasks more manageable and monitoring requires no more than logging into their handheld smart devices. These technology advancements have brought about significant changes in our everyday lives. Closing the garage door from your office cubicle, turning on the crock pot during your lunch break, having the vacuum cleaner run while you are gone or raising the living room shades are as simple as pressing a button. Alerts when someone walks up to your front door, notification of a motion detector going off, securing the front door lock after leaving the house, opening or closing your security gate for service providers are a few of these “modern” conveniences. Turning the water heater on in time for a hot bath after long day at work and reminders that you are low on milk from your smart refrigerator are managed on these smart systems. Your CO2 will alert you (and others) on your smartphone, from where you can either call 911 or silence the alarm, in case a piece of burnt toast is to blame. But these convenience comforts come at a cost. What about our privacy?
Just as our smart devices uses wifi and hotspots for connectivity, our lives or should I say our lives conveniences are transmitted in bits and bytes over the air waves. Not only do hackers, scanners and criminals intercept this information for nefarious purposes but companies' data mine and sell this information to market the latest and greatest products to make our lives even easier as well. Have we thought about total strangers knowing when the water level lowers in our toilets, or when the integrated television in our bathroom mirrors isn't on? Utilities are included as well, are they monitoring the electrical consumption for usage spikes or has the water line developed a leak? Your smart device will receive notifications for that as well.
Are we being watched by the watchers? The security and IT professionals that monitor and use the information sent in these data packets for analysis are licensed, trained professionals right? There is a check and balance in the residential industry of home automation but what about elsewhere? This article started with home security and technology innovations but is morphing into the hospitality industry and our time away from home. We expect the same conveniences in posh hotels as we enjoy in our homes daily and are unwilling to compromise. Vacations used to be the extravagant now there is an expectation to maintain our current level of interaction with automation and technology.
Corporations like MGM Resorts International have embraced this age and are acknowledged as a leader in adopting and deploying hotel guestroom technology. Their properties offer wireless networked electronic locks for security, environmental and thermostat controls for guest comfort, multiple entertainment options, refrigerated minibars for convenience, and other guest controls for thousands of properties with one highly reliable, intelligent communication platform, Honeywell's INNCOM Deep Mesh Network.
“MGM Resorts International recognized early on that it wanted to interconnect and communicate with each of its thousands of guest rooms to ensure guest safety, convenience and comfort. This required an intelligent device in each room linked to a total-property converged network platform to monitor in-room systems and collect environmental data,” said Kevin J. Fellows, director of enterprise architecture, media and guest technology for MGM.
Fellows explained that INNCOM's Deep Mesh Network is reliable for MGM Resorts' large number of rooms and devices because of its built-in intelligence. MGM Resorts utilizes INNCOM in its MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Delano, Bellagio; and at MGM Macau in China. INNCOM installation at MGM Resorts' Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas occurred in 2015.
“The Deep Mesh Network interconnects hundreds of wireless edge routers throughout each property to establish a redundant-process communication web to transmit the guestroom data packets. If a transmission from one room does not instantly reach our server, the network automatically retries through other router pathways. The Deep Mesh Network monitors the health of each room's guest-facing environmental devices,” said Fellows. “The INNCOM system gathers guestroom environmental device information and notifies property maintenance staff if there is a maintenance issue.”
The systems monitor room environmental data messages and pass the communications across their guestroom network firewalls. The INNCOM thermostats are the communication hub in each guest room. They collect data from the door locks, minibars, and other systems and communicate with the edge routers within each property's Deep Mesh Network.
This allows MGM Resorts to deliver the total experience: guest comfort, elegant user controls, integrated room automation and energy savings through the use of touch-capacitance glass surfaces. And their clients not only expect but demand these features in their time away from home and companies like INNCOM have accomplished making these the norm rather than the exception by transforming data into actionable information. INNCOM also tracks and reports occupancy status with infrared occupancy sensors that deliver data to guestroom temperature and lighting controls as well as reporting guest status changes to the front desk and the back office, HVAC equipment run-time, guest security alerts and network availability utilizing integrated room automation systems solutions. INNCOM's INNcontrol™ 3 and its Deep Mesh Network make it possible to integrate many compatible systems so operators can remotely manage all property guestroom systems. INNCOM ASX Analytics Services Reports provide the metrics and analysis on all measurable data on room equipment and utilization to maximize operating efficiency and profitability. Hospitality solutions must be multifaceted simultaneously addressing: guests' expectations of comfort, safety, and convenience and Honeywell's INNCOM system does just that with the most collaborative guestroom automation platform in the world.
The future belongs to organizations that harness the information locked in massive data streams!
Now with knowing this information, how can the powers that be NOT know what happened in Room 32-135 on October 1, 2017? The guestroom data packages were transmitting information in redundancy to the front desk, housekeeping and maintenance concerning conditions in that suite. What do the watchers know about that fateful night? And why has the information not been shared with the public?

The move could put them at odds with Trump, who has often taken a hard line against China, and could also risk violating US law, which prohibits the export of military services or equipment to China.
Erik Prince — founder of the private military company Blackwater, financial backer of President Donald Trump, brother to the new Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and frequent Breitbart radio guest of White House power broker Stephen Bannon — has been offering their military expertise to support Chinese government objectives and setting up two Blackwater-style training camps in China, according to sources and their own company statements.
Former associates of the 47-year-old Prince told BuzzFeed News that the controversial business person envisions using the bases to train and deploy an army of Chinese retired soldiers who can protect Chinese corporate and government strategic interests around the world, without having to involve the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
In December, Frontier Services Group, of which Prince is chairperson, issued a press release that outlined plans to open “a forward operating base in China's Yunnan province” and another in the troubled Xinjiang region, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority.
“He's been working very, very hard to get China to buy into a new Blackwater,” said one former associate. “He's hell bent on reclaiming their position as the world's preeminent private military provider.”
In an email to BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for Frontier Services Group provided a statement and strongly disputed that the company was going to become a new Blackwater, insisting that all of its security services were unarmed and therefore not regulated. “FSG's services do not involve armed personnel or training armed personnel.” The training at the Chinese bases would “help non-military personnel provide close protection security, without the use of arms.”
“Mr. Prince and Mr. Trump know each other and share mutual respect,” the statement added.
White House spokespersons did not respond to emails requesting comment for this story.
Frontier Services Group trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its largest shareholder is an investment fund owned and controlled by the People's Republic of China, CITIC. Until last year Frontier claimed to be merely a logistics and transportation company, steering clear of Prince's specialty of providing private military capabilities for operations — though last March The Intercept news organization ran a story saying that Prince, sometimes using their role at Frontier, was pitching security and paramilitary services. In the story, Frontier denied the company was involved.
When Frontier later told its board it was shifting into security services — largely to assist China's international development policy — the development disgusted two American executives at Prince's Hong Kong company.
Gregg Smith, the former CEO of Frontier, said they were ready to quit last March if Erik Prince was not removed from the company. Then, at a board meeting late that month, they said a company official made clear that Frontier would be providing security services in support of Chinese government objectives. “That was the final straw,” they told BuzzFeed News.
Retired US Admiral William Fallon, a Frontier board member, was at the same board meeting. They resigned too when they heard that the firm was providing security services. “That wasn't what I signed up for,” they said in an interview.
President Donald Trump has talked tough about China. To be sure, they recently reaffirmed that the United States will formally recognize only mainland China and not Taiwan, a crucial point for Beijing. But Trump has installed a sharply anti-China critic as the head of their National Trade Council. Before winning the presidency, Trump called China an “enemy.” Trump adviser Stephen Bannon, who interviewed Prince on Breitbart frequently, predicted last year that the US will be at war with China “in the South China Sea in five to 10 years.” And even if no hot war breaks out, many experts believe Trump is gearing up for a trade war with the country that manufactures much of the world's goods (including some Trump brand products.)
During the campaign, Prince donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Committee, which supported both Trump's election bid and the Republican Party. Jeremy Scahill, a journalist who has long covered Prince, recently wrote that the business person is advising the Trump Administration.
Just four days before the election, Prince gave an interview to Breitbart radio, part of the media empire that Bannon used to run, in which Prince pushed an unfounded theory that the NYPD had been about to announce arrest warrants in the Clinton investigation but was blocked by the Justice Department, and that Hillary Clinton had been to a “sex island” with a convicted pedophile “at least six times.” Prince's bizarre claims were prominently displayed on Breitbart's website leading up to the election and were widely distributed on right wing websites.
Now, however, Prince's new business foray could put them at odds with Trump.
Former executives said that Frontier's “forward operating bases” will be training former People's Liberation Army soldiers to work as discreet non-uniformed soldiers for hire.
The former associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Prince “is making Frontier Services a full-on private military company.”
As of the summer, this person continued, “the plan was to set up Blackwater-like training facilities specifically to train the Chinese.”
Another former ally of Prince said: “The idea is to train former PLA soldiers in the art of being private military contractor. That way the actual Red Army doesn't have to go into these remote areas.”
Asked about Frontier's claim that Prince was planning “unarmed” security projects, both sources dismissed it, and emphasized that was not their understanding. It is “ridiculous,” said one.
“Are they using sonic weapons,” joked the other. “Is it psychic powers?”
Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a private military company — Prince objects to the term “mercenary” — that did phenomenal business during the war on terror. The firm was frequently embroiled in scandal: Four of its employees were killed in Fallujah in 2004, leading to a Marine Corps onslaught on the city; several former employees pleaded guilty to arms violations in a lengthy investigation; and still others were convicted in a wild shooting spree in Baghdad in which 17 civilians were slaughtered.
Typically, Prince has been involved in ventures that they claims are in line with US foreign policy goals. They have reportedly helped the United Arab Emirates set up a military unit of former Colombian soldiers; pushed for an anti-piracy operation in the Puntland region of Somalia; and tried to sell a mercenary operation in Nigeria.
The current China plan appears to be different. China is widely understood to have interests that are adversarial to the US, and the two powers compete for world influence. And US law bans US citizens from exporting defense-related services or equipment to the country.
Frontier's December press release said the Yunnan base would “allow FSG to be able to better serve companies in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.” The Uighur region, which would be home to the company's second base, abuts Afghanistan.
According to the press release “these bases will provide training, communications, risk mitigation, risk assessments, information gathering, medevac and joint operations centers that coordinate security, logistics and aviation.”
The press release said the company was “expanding its security offerings” to include “training for personnel,” as well as “Personnel Protection” services, which is industry jargon for providing bodyguards. The December press release did not state that the security offerings would be unarmed.
Frontier's expansion into China, its December press release said, was designed to help clients take advantage of China's new development plan, “One Belt One Road,” a massive program that many experts believe aims to increase Chinese economic and political sway.
China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said US regulators would likely take a dim view of security operations in China's Uighur areas. “It's at odds with the American government view that we don't want to help the Chinese oppress the Uighurs in Xinjiang.”
In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman on earth. After Zeus ordered the god of craftsmanship to create them out of water and earth, they were endowed by the gods with many talents, making their all-gifted. Pandora's Box follows Pandora's story with many musical references to the story line and reflects on the curiosity of the title character. In the famous Greek myth, Pandora was instructed not to open a box that was sent with them to Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus. Zeus was punishing Prometheus for stealing fire from heaven and giving it to the mortals, and by sending their brother the prized jewel – Pandora, Zeus would extract revenge on Prometheus. But Pandora opened the box they were to leave alone under all circumstances. Before they could close the lid, all sorts of things had escaped to cover Earth… all except Hope, which lay on the bottom.

How do we know that the summer's almost over? The final 2011 Baltimore Avenue Dollar Stroll will take place this Thursday, Sept. 1. Yes, the fourth and the final one this year. So, don't miss the chance to enjoy $1 deals again and say goodbye to this event until the next summer.
We hear that nearly 20 businesses, vendors and food trucks will participate in the final Dollar Stroll, so look out for new participants.
The stroll will start as usual at 5:30 p.m. (it's not a bad idea to come early) and will go on until 8:30 p.m. Apart from the vendors, there will be live music and street performances as well. And, as always, there will be copies of the free West Philly Mix Tape download card available for pick-up. If you haven't got one, stop by the University City District table in front of Calvary Church (48th and Baltimore).
Alphabet CEO Larry Page By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google officials were in federal court on Friday to defend its pay practices, pushing back against government allegations that it underpays its women employees.
But if the tech giant hoped to prove its fairness to the world, it didn't exactly win many fans with one of its major lines of reasoning.
According to a report by The Guardian's Sam Levin, Google's budget-minded lawyers argued in court that the government was being unreasonable in demanding that Google collect and turn over internal compensation data.
Why?
The money.
Complying with a request by the US Department of Labor would be too expensive and too logistically difficult, Google's lawyers reportedly argued. The job would apparently require 500 hours of work and cost $100,000.
Note that Google is the world's No.1 internet search engine, with $92 billion in cash and short-term securities on the balance sheet of its parent company, Alphabet.
And given that Alphabet made $6.8 billion in profit before taxes in just the first quarter of 2017, according to Google Finance, the DoL attorney at Friday's court hearing couldn't resist a snarky response, saying "Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water," Levin reports.
The US Department of Labor (DoL) has previously accused Google of "systemic compensation disparities." The DoL has filed a lawsuit to compel Google to turn over its internal compensation data. Because Google is a federal contractor, it is required by law to submit employment data to the government as part of routine compliance procedures to prove it is not violating equal employment laws, the DoL says.
Occupational segregation
Google has consistently denied the accusations that it underpays women and it even tweeted in April that it "closed the gender pay gap globally" meaning it pays women and men equally for equal work worldwide, it says.
Its HR site also released a guide that instructs others how they can do the same, including the step called "run a pay analysis." Presumably, this means that Google already has loads of salary data in a form that allows it to be analyzed, at least internally.
After the suit went public, job hunting site Glassdoor released its own analysis of Google's pay based on the self-reported salaries submitted by employees. For what it's worth, Glassdoor sided with Google, finding no evidence that Google underpays for equal work.
However, Glassdoor also found that women overall at Google are still paid 16% less than the men. That's because, of the women who work at Google, fewer of them have roles within the highest paying jobs at Google. It's a situation called "occupational segregation," and it's a common reason why women earn less than men across the economy, not just at Google, Glassdoor's Chief Economist, Dr. Andrew Chamberlain told Business Insider.
In any case, folks on Twitter are not buying the argument that Google can't afford to dig up the salary data that the government is requesting.
The Alt-Right is Slandering My Father's Beautiful Creation, Babar by: Jacques de Brunhoff
Cullen Crawford Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 6, 2017
My father's sweet Babar
My father made Babar. They invented them to be a friendly and kind elephant king and filled many empty white pages with their wondrous exploits. Now I am told that a group of political villains with nice haircuts called “the alt-right” have claimed my father's wonderful Babar as their cartoon mascot and are spreading disgusting slanders about him. I will use this space to explain that the terrible ways they depict my father's sweet Babar are filthy lies from hell's furnace. Thank you.
Babar Is Not Nude!
The enormous Babar always wears a green suit of the finest clothing. It is nice and decent.  They are not nude with visible genitals like in the false images spread by alt-right toilet men on the internet. I am told the purpose of these filths is to show that Babar has “an intact Christian foreskin.” Sadly, my great father never wrote of Babar's circumcision, so I am powerless to contradict this particular foul claim even as it drives me to vomit.
The Sweet and Remarkable Babar Does Not Hit Lesbians with Their Car
The alt-right sinners have made multiple “memes” of Babar striking and running over lesbian and bisexual women in their bright red car. This is false and also I am crying. My father made Babar use their car to tour the countryside and visit friends. It is not Babar's weapon to kill kissing women and then say out loud to nobody, “Hell yes, compadres! Babar did the awesome thing again!” Babar would not speak that way.
Babar is Not Married to Olive Oil from Popeye
I am paralyzed with respect for the work of Popeye creator E. C. Segar and curse the alt-right cretins for dragging their iconic sailor cartoon into their sewer of garbage and stool. Babar is not married to Olive Oil and they do not “propagate the white race” on a pile of Chinese people's skeletons. My immaculate father would never write such a thing, even at gunpoint.
Babar's Eyes are not Two Constantly Spinning Swastikas
Babar's eyes are black ink dots into which we inject our own humanity. Not once were they two rotating swastikas like I saw in an accursed alt-right video where a cash register noise played every time Babar stepped on a Koran. When I saw this dishonest video, I immediately did a prayer to the Lord, God that They rip out the eyes of my father's angel, that they might never see their treasured elephant brought so low.
The name BABAR Does not Stand for “Beautiful Aryan Brotherhood Achieves Revenge” It is just a nice fun name that children can remember.

NFL free agency has football analysts liberally using the term "dead money," and while many NFL fans assume that dead money is a bad thing, they do not know its exact function.
Simply put: Dead money is the salary cap space a team must allocate to a particular player who has been cut. It serves as a device to ensure that every dollar a team has paid players is eventually allocated to that team's salary cap. And while there are several complexities in calculating dead money, this article seeks to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the general idea.
Assume the New Orleans Saints sign "John Doe" to a five-year, $25 million contract with $17.5 million guaranteed. The terms of the contract include a $10 million bonus due at signing and separate workout bonuses, worth $500,000 each, that are payable once Doe has satisfied the offseason workout requirements.
Year Base Salary Signing Bonus Miscellaneous Cap Hit 2013 $600,000 $2,000,000 $0 $2,600,000 2014 $1,600,000 $2,000,000

$7,100,000 Total $13,000,000 $10,000,000 $2,000,000
$25,000,000
In the table above, the yearly salary cap hit is calculated for John Doe's contract. However, salary cap hits often differ from the amount of money a player was actually paid that year. One reason cap hits differ from the amount actually paid is that teams may "prorate" signing bonuses throughout the life of a contract. The table below shows when the money in Doe's contract is actually scheduled to be paid.

However, New Orleans has only taken a total of $11.8 million in cap hits attributable to John Doe.

If the Saints cut John Doe before the 2016 season, they would have to satisfy the terms of the contract before they could be released. Doe's contract guarantees that they receive $17.5 million, and the Saints have paid them a total of $15.8 million. Hence, New Orleans would need to pay John Doe the remaining $1.7 million they were guaranteed before they could be cut.
The dead money associated with cutting Doe would be the total amount of money the Saints had paid them over the course of their contract, plus the remaining money they were guaranteed, minus the total cap hit New Orleans had taken for John Doe over the course of their contract.
Year Total Paid + Guaranteed - Total Cap Hits = Dead Money Before 2016 $15,800,000 + $1,700,000 - $11,800,000 = $5,700,000
The dead money comes out to $5.7 million, which is only $400,000 less than the $6.1 million cap hit the Saints were scheduled to take from Doe's contract. Thus, New Orleans would not open up much cap room by cutting John Doe before the 2016 NFL season.
The Saints decide to hold onto Doe for another year, and after the 2016 season, New Orleans is considering cutting them again.

As seen in the table above, the Saints have paid $19.9 million to Doe in the first 4 years of their contract. New Orleans has satisfied the $17.5 million guarantee requirement in their contract, but New Orleans has still paid John Doe more than the cap hit they have taken for him.

If New Orleans decides to cut John Doe after the 2016 season, they would assume $2 million of dead money. However, the Saints would save $5.1 million in salary cap space by cutting Doe before the 2017 season due to the $7.1 million cap hit they were scheduled to take for their contract.
Year Total Paid + Guaranteed - Total Cap Hits = Dead Money Before 2013 $0 + $17,500,000 - $0 = $17,500,000 Before 2014 $10,600,000 + $6,900,000 - $2,600,000 = $14,900,000 Before 2015 $12,700,000 + $4,800,000 - $6,700,000 = $10,800,000 Before 2016 $15,800,000 + $1,700,000 - $11,800,000 = $5,700,000 Before 2017 $19,900,000 + $0 - $17,900,000 = $2,000,000
Teams attempt to avoid too much "dead money" in their salary caps. But dead money is simply a sunk cost. If cutting a player creates $6 million in dead money and $4 million in salary cap space, a team should cut the player if it can upgrade at their position for less than a $4 million cap hit.
In the end, dead money is just one of the many variables teams must consider in a complex decision making process.
Image caption Smashed fossils at Bearreraig Bay on Skye
Tonnes of rock has been disturbed at a Jurassic site on Skye in what has been described as one of Scotland's most reckless acts of fossil collecting.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens.
The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's "Dinosaur Isle" because of its important fossil records.
SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police.
Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland.
Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock.
Whatever has been taken in now lost to science Dr Neil Clark, Hunterian Museum
Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said.
Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs is pursued by a predator.
SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI.
Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code.
The codes do allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research.
Dr MacFadyen said: "Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby.
"It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide.
"However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised."
Image caption Dr Neil Clark said there were examples of plesiosaur in the area
Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought.
They said fossil-rich rock had been damaged at the Bearreraig Bay site.
Dr Neil Clark, of University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, has described Skye as one of the world's most important palaeontology sites.
Its standing is underlined by the number of finds from the Middle Jurassic, about 170 million years ago.
Dr Clark told the BBC News Scotland website: "This is quite a shock. It is not something I have heard of happening before.
"Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after. It may have been plesiosaur."
They added: "Whatever has been taken is now lost to science."
Finds on Skye have included the earliest turtles known to have lived in water.
The 164-million-year-old reptile fossils were found embedded in a block of rock at the bay of Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula.
The new species formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants.
The discovery of Eileanchelys waldmani, which translates as "the turtle from the island", was reported in the Royal Society journals in 2008.
Double DTM champion Mattias Ekström took a sensational victory in their home event of the 2014 World Rallycross championship at Höljes in Sweden.
The event was the first victory for Ekström's EKS RX World Rallycross team in only its third ever event.
The win was also the first for Ekström as a driver in the Championship and the first for the Audi S1 Supercar used by the outfit.
Ekström and the EKS RX squad showed strong form throughout the whole weekend, with the Swede winning the semi-final of the Supercar category on Sunday.
Ekström then started the event finale from pole, and went through to take the overall victory by 0.541 seconds ahead of the OlsbergsMSE team driver, Andreas Bakkerud.
The 2003 World Rally champion Petter Solberg ended the Höljes event third overall in their privately run PSRX Citroën DS3, while winner of the last World Rallycross event in Finland, Latvian youngster Reinis Nitiss, was fourth.
Liam Doran in the Monster liveried Citroën and World Rallycross debutante Sebastian Eriksson were fifth and sixth respectively.
The World Rallycross season continues next weekend in Belgium and the EKS RX team will be present with full-time driver Pontus Tidemand and a wildcard driver – while Ekström will be competing in the fifth round of the 2014 DTM season at the Moscow Raceway.
The Dolphins continue to invest heavily in analytics, hiring Matt Sheldon as their director of football research and strategy.
Sheldon comes to Miami from Chicago, where they were the Bears' director of analytics and football research for the past two years.
Before that, they were a coach, both in the NFL and CFL. Most notably, Sheldon coached the Bills linebackers from 2006-2009.
Sheldon is expected to work on in-game strategy and tactics in Miami.

Sheldon has also served as a consultant for teams on the high school and collegiate level. They have a level of expertise in player tracking technology in sports, appearing in a panel on the subject at the MIT Sloan Sports analytics Conference in March in 2016.
“So many of these systems are really tuned towards open-field running,” they told SVG News at the time. “In American football, 45 percent of the players don't open-field run on every play. We would like to see orientation to know when a player is running forward or backward. In the passing game, so many of the players are retreating from the line of scrimmage while facing the line of scrimmage in a back-pedal. The line play is so intriguing, but these systems are not drawing out that value at this time.
“[One example is] the ability to track movements of types of players that don't do a lot of open-field running: an offensive lineman in pass protection or a lineman in a blocking play. Working backwards from what is necessary to be successful, [we determine] the traits to quantify the elite and then, hopefully, develop players up to that standard and select players that are competent in that area.”
Sheldon is yet another mind in the team's burgeoning sports science and analytics department, joining Wayne Diesel, the Dolphins' sports performance director, and Dennis Lock, the team's director of analytics.
Opponents will be kicking themselves for turning down £1.5m settlement offer in 2014.
Gillingham FC has just won a massive payout approaching £1.4 million in a high-stakes court battle with “bullying” catering giant Centerplate UK Ltd over a serious breach of contract.
DOWNLOAD FULL JUDGEMENT
The case was heard in the High Court in London (Royal Courts of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, before Sir Alistair MacDuff). In addition to the almost £1.4m damages that Centerplate now has to pay the Club, the caterer also has to pay both sides' legal costs: likely to be an eye-watering further £1 million. The catering bully will now be kicking itself that it refused a £1.5m all-in settlement deal offered by the Club in 2014. That's what you call an ‘own goal'.
Gillingham's court victory comes hot on the heels of more good news for the Club: this week's draw with Blackpool lifts them outside the relegation zone. Looks like the Club's fortunes are seriously turning around.
The Court case revolved around Centerplate bailing on a £28k-per-month ‘guaranteed payment' contract for providing all food at the Club's Priestfield Stadium from banqueting to burger stands. In March 2015 they simply walked out mid-season in a manner which the Judge described as a moonlight flit, leaving the Club and its supporters completely in the lurch.
The caterers denied liability until July 2016. Following that admission the caterers then proceeded to dispute the scale of damages they should pay the club as a consequence of their breach.
Centerplate was formerly Lindley Catering Ltd and just last week announced that it was being bought out by one the world's largest multinational companies, Sodexo.
In unusually strong language for a Judge, in their Judgement Sir Alistair MacDuff described the caterer's behaviour as “disgraceful”, “bullying” and said they had engaged in “blackmail”, stressing these were words they themselves was introducing to the case.
They said the company's behaviour was “wholly unprofessional and something of which it should be ashamed”. In stark contrast they described Gillingham Football Club's Chairman Mr. Paul Scally as “admirable” and praised them for their running of the Club.
DOWNLOAD FULL JUDGEMENT
This was a case where the Club has to stand up to the catering Goliath.
Mr Scally has been completely vindicated for their decision to persevere with the litigation, which put the Club under significant financial pressure for the past two and a half years.
But this week the Judge showed a red card to Centerplate - and thanks to their Judgment, the Club will now be able to invest in its facilities and staff.
The future is looking much brighter indeed for Gillingham FC.
Tom Lawrence, a London partner at law firm SA Law, who headed the legal team for the Club and specialises in big commercial disputes said:
“From my many years' experience in the commercial courts I have never heard such strong words used to describe parties in such black & white terms. There's usually far more ‘grey' in cases like this. It proves how right the Club's chairperson Paul Scally was to stand up to them and fight them all the way.”
Club Chairman Paul Scally says, “To say the past 2½ years have been stressful and challenging would be an understatement. Against a background of personal ill health resulting in major open-heart surgery last October, I have just about hung onto this case, which has been difficult and draining due to the disgraceful manner in which Centerplate, its UK CEO Adrian Dishington and Chief Legal and Talent Officer in the USA Keith King conducted themselves.
I was never in doubt as to the merits of the case and I would like to thank our legal team, especially Tom Lawrence of SA Law, for all their help and guidance, without whom we would not have achieved the result last week.
I would also like to thank our Director of Events and Facilities at GFC, Steve Ware, who has done an excellent job along with the other catering management and staff in rebuilding the ‘priestfield.com' brand such that our performance this year is greater than Centerplate (the catering experts) were able to achieve in any year of their operation.
This Christmas, Priestfield has already sold over 4500 covers for its ‘Alice in Winterland' themed dinner/dances – a record achievement in terms of income and numbers.
Indeed Centerplate, and in particular the management involved in the breach of our catering contract, should hang their heads in shame for the disgraceful and wholly unprofessional manner in which they treated Gillingham FC, one of their catering customers.

Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. (1 Thessalonians 5:16-17)
To “pray without ceasing” means to have our minds always on the things of God, to be in constant communication with him, so that every moment may be as fruitful as possible. How can we learn to “pray without ceasing?” Here are three practical steps.
1. Plan times for prayer.
Striving to have an attitude of prayer can seem overwhelming. To understand and develop the mindset of continual prayer, we must start with developing the habit of intentional prayer.
At meals
If the practice of praying at meals is not something you were taught or do right now, I recommend it as an easy way to pray more. For those of us who follow this practice, it is likely that we quickly thank God for our food and get on with eating. However, being more mindful in our prayer takes little time and can immensely increase the effectiveness of it.
When reading Scripture
Pray whenever you have time in the Scriptures. Start your daily Bible reading with prayer for God's Spirit to give insight and clarity as you read; end your reading with a prayer inspired by what you've read. Recite Scripture as you pray, and elaborate on how it speaks to you of what God is doing or wants to do in you. Do something similar when you sit down to do in-depth Bible study. Make any time you meditate on Scripture a time of prayer.
At the start and end of the day
When you wake up, dedicate the day to God in prayer. Praying at the start of the day focuses your mind on prayerfulness that will help carry you through the day, while developing the habit of constant prayer.
When you get ready for bed, thank God for their provision, and pray through your day. This will help quiet your mind and heart as you give over the things of the day to Jesus.
If you prayed at all these times, even for just a minute or two, you would pray at least six times a day. That may be more than you pray now, but it fits relatively easily into an existing schedule, and none of those times need to take too long initially. The first step is to develop a habit of regular prayer.
2. Start short and simple.
There are people who are gifted in prayer. They have regular, lengthy times of personal prayer and are able to stay vigilant and focused. Others seem to have a way with words in prayer. They know how to lift up praise and supplications to God with faith and confidence that they hear and is pleased.
Like many people, I struggle with prayer. First, I have a history of getting stuck on myself in prayer. Second, I struggle to stay focused. I am an avid and accomplished daydreamer, which is often an enemy of long, focused prayer. I may start well, but within a few minutes, I'm thinking about what I would have done differently if I had been the hero in that movie I saw last night. Or something that comes up in prayer reminds me of a Duran Duran lyric, and then I'm wondering what Simon Le Bon (the lead singer) is up to these days. During corporate prayer, I compare myself to other people, which often makes me not want to pray out loud—but then I fear what people will think if I don't.
Prayer is not primarily about us; it's about God.
Click To Tweet
In my private prayer time, I've found that more frequent, short times of prayer usually work better than long periods of prayer. I can only be quiet for so long. I know that when I attempt longer periods of prayer, I need to constantly refocus (which is a useful skill to develop in prayer and life, but takes time and effort), and often I will not be able to sit still.
So don't worry if your prayer times are short. Our Lord is not limited by our limitations; they are exalted in them. Only our great God could glorify themselves through such frail vessels as us. If we come to them in humility, for their glory, and to bear fruit through him, they will lovingly take whatever we have to offer—even if it is but a trifle. Jesus died to reconcile us and bring us into relationship with God. To keep that relationship flourishing, we dedicate ourselves to time with God through their Word and through prayer, even if we stumble through it at first. God's Spirit will expand our capacities, but we must trust them and faithfully take faltering steps into prayer.
3. Pray according to God's will.
Prayer is not primarily about us; it's about God. While God wants us to come to them with our concerns, we must understand as fully as possible what their concerns are.
When a man asked Jesus what the greatest commandment is, they answered by quoting from Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:36, 39). Jesus died so we would have the freedom and capacity to love God with all we are, and to love each other.
First, seek to love God with everything you are through and in prayer. Then, seek to love your neighbor through prayer. In this way you seek God's will in every aspect of your prayers, as you include the concerns, requests, and needs for the people God has put around you.
Pray for your literal neighbor. Pray for those in your church and the missionaries that you know. Pray for family. Pray for strangers you've interacted with recently. Pray for your pastors and your politicians.
Pray for all of them as you do for yourself—with God's will paramount in your prayers for them.
Through your times of active prayer, the Spirit will begin to cultivate an attitude of unceasing prayer—and this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

Manually Identifying YYYRussian PropagandaYYY
How wonderful, powerful, innocent, and righteous Russia and Russia's friends are: Putin, Donald Trump, Bashar al-Assad, Syria, Iran, China, radical political parties in the US and Europe, etc. Investigate this by searching for mentions of, for example, "russia", on their site by Googling for "site:whateversite.com russia", and seeing what comes up.
How terrible, weak, aggressive, and corrupt the the opponents of Russia and their friends are: The US, Obama, Hillary Clinton, the EU, Angela Merkel, NATO, Ukraine, Jewish people, US allies, the "mainstream media", and democrats, the center-right or center-left, and moderates of all stripes. Investigate this by searching for mentions of, for example, "NATO", on their site by Googling for "site:whateversite.com NATO" and seeing what comes up.
An obvious bias towards Russia and Russian-backed policy in foreign affairs, including:
How fantastic Brexit and Ukrainian/Georgian separatism is, but how terrible Chechen separatists are,
How advanced Russian technology is, and how dangerous Western technology is,
How great it is when Western secrets get exposed, but how terrible it is when Russian ones do,
How militarily powerful Russia and their friends are, and how weak and craven Russia's enemies and their friends are, etc.
How dangerous standing up to Russia would be: It would inevitably result in "World War 3", nuclear devastation, etc, and regardless of who shot first or is bombing civilians where now, would be the West's fault. Russian propaganda never suggests it would just result in a Cold War 2 and Russia's eventual peaceful defeat, like the last time.
suggests it would just result in a Cold War 2 and Russia's eventual peaceful defeat, like the last time. Pre-emptive discouragement of critical analysis: Assertions about them "having the truth", or the need to "wake up the sheeple", or how the "mainstream media" can't be trusted.
Hyperbolic alarmism, anti-Western conspiracist insinuations, "Eurasianism", racism, gold-standard nuttery and attacks on the US dollar, 9/11-trutherism, anti-Semitism, anti-"globalism", anti-vax/anti-GMO paranoia, and generally ridiculous over-the-top assertions, which cites Russian propaganda outlets as "evidence".
Do they have propaganda-like content that mentions Russia in a positive light for no clear reason ?
? Do they have propaganda-like content that randomly extols Russia and belittles the US ?
? Do they have propaganda-like content unrelated to the purported focus of their branding ?
? Does the timing of their propaganda-like content coincide with or closely follow similar content on known Russian propaganda outlets?
5) Check to see whether the social-media account/commenter/outlet lacks the hallmarks of good actual journalism: Are the stories factual? Are the facts placed in appropriate context? Do the headlines match the content? Are the agendas of the sources clearly disclosed? Are there good explanations? Does it bring clarity to complicated issues? Is there an absence of hype?

A systematic form of persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for political, ideological, and religious purposes, through the controlled transmission of deceptive, selectively-omitting, and one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.

The YYYcampaignYYY is an effort to crowdsource identifying Russian propaganda outlets and sympathizers. To participate, when you see a social-media account, commenter, or outlet echoing Russian propaganda themes, highlight it with YYYs accordingly!Doing so is intended to encourage critical thinking about the sources people get their information from and share with others, while highlighting probable Russian propaganda outlets for further investigation and analysis.Please take care when using YYYs, because many people who get their news from Russian propaganda outlets are completely unaware that their beliefs directly correspond with, and have been shaped by, Russian strategic messaging. However, in an important sense it does not matter whether they are being knowingly directed and paid by Russian intelligence officers (although some of them undoubtably are), or whether they even knew they were echoing Russian propaganda before being called out: If they continue to do so, for whatever reasons, their willingness to uncritically echo Russian propaganda makes them a tool of the Russian state. The term " useful idiot " often applies, and calling them out is justified, appropriate, and valuable.Hence, the YYYs.The YYYcampaignYYY is the crowdsourced application of "manual analysis", which is what we call the remarkably easy-to-do process of methodically checking to see whether a particular social-media account, commenter, or outlet qualifies as Russian propaganda, and calling it out it if it does. Anyone can join this campaign, and we hope you will do so.In order to usefully identify and expose Russian propaganda, avoid false positives and McCarthyism, and effectively encourage others to get their news from more reliable sources, we recommend using the following steps, or Checks, when performing manual analysis of potential propaganda outlets and using YYYs to highlight it:Check to see whether the social-media account/commenter/outletsuch as Russia Today/rt.com, the Russian defense ministry, and other official Russian spokespeople.Check to see whether the social-media account/commenter/outletCheck to see whether the social-media account/commenter/outletby using themes, arguments, talking points, images, and other content similar to those used by obvious Russian propaganda outlets.

A grief-stricken mother from a northern Ontario First Nation is sharing the hate-filled social media messages their 12-year-old daughter received on the day of their death by suicide, in hopes of saving the lives of other girls in their community.
"If I'd seen those earlier, if they showed them to me, I think I could have done something, tried to talk to her, not to believe those words," Sandra Fox told CBC News.
Fox's daughter, Chantel, died by suicide early in January in Wapekeka First Nation, a few days after their friend, Jolynn Winter, also 12, died by suicide. Several other girls from the community, about 600 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont., remain on suicide watch and at least two of them have also received messages encouraging them to kill themselves.
Screen shots of the messages, with some of the identifying information obscured, were obtained by CBC News.
One of the messages received by Chantel Fox, 12, on the day they died by suicide, according to their mother, Sandra Fox. (CBC)
They appear to originate from three different social media accounts that parents from Wapekeka and social workers involved with the community believe originate outside the First Nation and may have been sent under false names.
Sandra Fox says at least one other girl from Wapekeka, who is currently on suicide watch, has received messages like this one. (CBC)
"I'm just concerned so that it won't happen to anybody else's kid, what happened to my daughter," Fox said.
Earlier this week, Fox said they were worried that police weren't taking the matter seriously. On Friday, they told CBC News that officers had followed up with them
"They're finally doing something," Fox said after a visit to the police station in Thunder Bay, where they signed release documents allowing officers to access the social media accounts on both of their daughters' tablets.
The mother of another girl, who is demonstrating suicidal behaviour, also spoke to police about messages their daughter has been receiving, Fox said.
A third girl from Wapekeka, also at risk of suicide, is getting the hate-filled messages, too, they said.
Provincial police will only say they are investigating, but refused to provide any further details.
Some young people are using Facebook as a diary, leaving them exposed and vulnerable, says Valerie Ooshag, a mental health worker in Eabametoong First Nation. (Jody Porter/CBC) A mental health counsellor who works with First Nations youth in the same area said that young people are too often using Facebook as a diary, which leaves them exposed and vulnerable.
"Sometimes people on social media just find your problems are entertainment, and I find that really sad," Valerie Ooshag said. "I've seen some nasty stuff on Facebook, like people telling people to kill themselves. It's just horrible."
Creating youth centres in First Nations where young people can reach out for help to mental health counsellors in person could help curb the problem of children revealing too much online, they said.
Since those resources aren't available in Wapekeka or Eabametoong, where Ooshag works, they offered these words of advice to young people who may be tempted to reveal their suicidal thoughts online:
"There are people that care about you that will listen to you, not just reading it on a Facebook status," they said.

At the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, the Y2K bug was supposed to turn the world topsy-turvy by wiping out all computer data and freezing all electronic devices. The clock struck 12, and nothing happened. But on Saturday, more than a decade later, a similar virus attacked the Western Railway and its flagship train, the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani Express.If the problem back then was 1999, this time it was the number 999. The commotion surrounding the Rajdhani as it waited to depart from Mumbai Central's Platform No 1 was quite unusual, even for Diwali season.Hundreds of passengers, who would have been upgraded from the waiting list to confirmed berths, were desperately trying to find out their reservation status. They dialled the enquiry at 139. They searched for updated charts normally posted at the train door, and on the platform, but found none.When the Rajdhani left for Delhi , at 5:13, 33 minutes later than scheduled, they were left stranded at the station, not knowing whether they had berths on the train or not. The problem, it later turned out, was a curious one.The online reservation system of the Indian Railways, managed by the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) allows only 999 e-tickets to be reserved per train. This number was considered a comfortable failsafe because the demand for online tickets had never exceeded 600, even at the busiest times. On Saturday, however, the Diwali rush pushed this demand to 999, and then into four digits. The moment the 1,000th ticket request was processed, the Passenger Reservation System (PRS) got confused, and promptly came crashing down.“We could not foresee that e-tickets would ever reach 1,000. This number was beyond all our estimates when the software was created. Today, the moment 999 was breached, the program developed a bug and starting behaving abnormally. No further upgrades were possible on the chart after that,” Ajit Jain, CRIS's General Manager (Western), told Mumbai Mirror.“A special team of engineers has been constituted to look into the matter and find remedies,” they added.The genesis of the problem, said a senior Railway official who asked not to be named, lay in how the chart preparation for the train, which normally begins at around 1:30 pm for a 4:40 train, did not start until after 3 pm.“As a result,” they said, “a lot of people were booking berths online at the eleventh hour, until long after the system should have allowed them to. This drove the numbers into a hitherto uncharted territory.”By the time the Railways realised what was happening, there was about an hour to go for departure. CRIS was informed, but it was too late to fix the bug or try to retrieve corrupted data. The train was finally released with the manual (or skeleton) chart, updated at 8 pm on Friday.“There was chaos,” said Aman Acharya, a student with a ticket for Kota who could not board despite a quota berth because their name was not on the skeleton chart. “There were many who didn't know what to do.”Divyesh Thakur, another student, added: “No one was able to check the status on the helpline number or the website. It was a panic situation. The RPF came out to control the crowd.”Since almost 30-35 per cent changes on the chart take place on the last day due to late cancellations, initial estimates by the Railways indicate that a few hundred people may have been affected. “After investigations, we will decide on refunds, or other remedial action,” an official said.
Auburn is ranked No. 5 in the country, but nobody's talking much about the defending SEC champs. Alabama is currently ranked higher in the polls, and after Week 1, everybody was raving about Georgia and Texas A&M. The Tigers need a sexy win to really make a statement. How about a road win at No. 20 Kansas State on national television?
Key player: QB Nick Marshall
Think Marshall won't be a little extra amped for this one? Think again. He's returning to the state where they revived their career as a quarterback, and he's going against the program that they nearly signed with out of junior college. Bill Snyder knows them well, but that doesn't mean Kansas State will be able to stop him. Marshall has scored a rushing touchdown in seven straight games, and the return of their favorite wide receiver, Sammie Coates, will make them even more dangerous as a passer, a part of their game he's worked hard to improve.
Key question: How will Auburn handle its first road test?
Remember last season? Auburn opened with three straight home victories before travelling to Death Valley to face a top-10 LSU team. The atmosphere was hostile, it poured down rain, and by halftime, Auburn was trailing 21-0. Gus Malzahn's squad played much better in the second half, but at that point it was too late. They lost 35-21. This year's team is more experienced and more battle-tested, and they're going to need that as they play in front of what Kansas State is expecting to be the biggest crowd in school history.
Key stat: Kansas State has won 40 straight games when leading at the half, which is currently the third-longest active streak in the country.
A slow start killed Auburn in Baton Rouge last year, and it could cost them again Thursday in the Little Apple. Kansas State is clearly very good when it gets a lead, and the Tigers have struggled in the first half this season, especially on defense. In two games, they have allowed 31 points and 447 total yards in the first 30 minutes. With the game on the road, it's critical that Auburn start fast and try to neutralize the crowd early because the longer Kansas State hangs around, the better chance there is for an upset.
NEW YORK -- The Mets could get David Wright back next month. General manager Sandy Alderson said this afternoon that they believe there is a "realistic possibility" Wright returns at the All-Star break.
Wright has been out since April, first with a hamstring injury but is now dealing with lumbar spinal stenosis. They and the Mets have said he'd return at some point but wouldn't put a timeline or date on it until now.
"What I try to be look at the next benchmarks," Alderson said during an appearance at the VA Hospital in Brooklyn. "What are the benchmarks? One of them is, say, the first of July. We're in the middle of June right now. Another benchmark might be the first of July. Might be the All-Star break. The trade deadline is July 31. The month of August. So there are these benchmarks.
"Realistically I'm looking at probably the All-Star break as a realistic possibility."
Alderson specified it would be of a return to the Mets not a rehab assignment.

At least 150,000 people have been killed in Syria's three-year-old civil war, according to a new report.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors violence says the real death toll is likely to be much higher at around 220,000.
In Kesab, an Armenian populated town 60 kilometres north of Latakia, residents have been forced to seek shelter wherever they can.
“We took nothing with us, no means, no clothes, nothing. We just left with what we were wearing at that moment,” said Siran Demirchian.
“We organized self-defense and we defended our town for around one year. We were patrolling every day, every night. That day we received information about the invasion from a shepherd from Turkish side,” said Gevorg Nazarian.
It comes as Lebanese forces increase security in and around Tripoli in a push to control sectarian violence fuelled by the war in Syria.
At least 27 people have been killed over the past three weeks in the Lebanese capital in clashes between Sunni Muslims and members of the Alawite sect, an off-shoot of Shi'ite Islam.
Canadian winters are challenging for some, but they have their advantages. In addition to producing the world's best hockey players, Canada has become host to a growing number of data centres that take advantage of the cold climate to mitigate the extensive costs of cooling their server infrastructure.
As server farms continue to pack more computing power, they have become significant consumers of energy – a New York Times study pegged the U.S. total at 2 per cent of total power consumption. Although there is some debate on the exact numbers, the proportion of this cost consumed by cooling is significant, and estimated to be as high as one half of the total.
Managing the significant heat that semi-conductors generate is consuming a growing portion of the cost of operating a data centre. Facilities in many parts of Canada are able to employ a technology called "free cooling" to reduce this by as much as 50 per cent. Essentially, these systems employ an additional cooling circuit that uses outdoor air to supplement the work done by the more energy-intensive components of the cooling system.

Information technology services company Fujitsu Canada is planning to open a facility to take advantage of what Canada has to offer. Free cooling, however, is only part of the picture. Access to cheap, clean, reliable energy is also a magnet for investors looking to build these power-hungry facilities, some of which consume roughly as much energy as a small city.
"The advantage Canada has is it's far cheaper and easier to bring data to power sources, and vice versa," says Mike O'Neil, president of IT research firm IT Market Dynamics. "It's much cheaper to stick your data centre next to a hydro dam."
The combination of cheap power and cold weather puts Canada in a similar league with Sweden and Finland, which have recently become the hosts of huge data centres built by Facebook and Google, respectively.
Many believe these facilities are only the tip of the iceberg. In the increasingly common cloud computing scenario where companies outsource their computing to remote providers, Canadian data centres can serve markets anywhere in the world. Market intelligence firm IDC estimates the sheer volume of data managed by businesses will grow 50 times over the next 10 years, and the number of servers needed to keep up with this growth will increase by 49 per cent in the next two years.
One of the biggest challenges for data centre operators is to convince customers that their facility is a safe place to entrust data that is often the lifeblood of their business. Infrastructure has to be operating almost 100 per cent of the time, and customers need the confidence that their data won't be lost or compromised.
"The expectation of always being available isn't just an IT issue, it's a brand issue," says Doug Stirling, senior manager of data centre business strategy at IBM Canada, which opened a 25,000-square-foot, $90-million data centre in Barrie, Ont., last September. Mr. Stirling mentioned Research In Motion's three-day outage last year, and the irreparable damage it caused the tech company, as an example.
"We can cool our facility for 210 days of the year without running the chillers," Mr. Stirling adds. "It saves us $320,000 a year in cooling costs."

Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman says their central Ontario city offers some key ingredients for reliable data centres. "Barrie has two things that are really critical for data centres," they say, "and that is incredibly reliable power, and incredibly reliable water."
Political stability is another major concern. "Canada has been an island of stability in a time of considerable economic turmoil over the last five years," Mr. Lehman says. "We do have a role in terms of being a safe, stable, honest place to do business."
"Data custody is a whole other dimension as to why Canada is attractive," says David Drury, general manager of global technology services at IBM Canada. In this respect, Canada holds an advantage over the United States because many companies, particularly Canadian ones, are concerned about the U.S. Patriot Act, which allows the U.S. government to intercept and examine data stored in the United States without a search warrant.
Mr. Lehman hopes their city will become a haven for data centres. In addition to the IBM facility, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank have also constructed their own facilities in Barrie. "We're seeing an emerging cluster in information storage and management here in Barrie," they say. "We're very interested in growing that for a number of reasons."
They note, however, that government incentives often play a role. Finland and Sweden have both sweetened the pot with investment incentives, and some jurisdictions in Canada, such as Quebec and Kelowna, B.C., are getting into the game. "Ontario municipalities can't offer tax breaks – it's actually in the legislation that we can't do that," they say. "That's often cited as one of the reasons why Ontario cities have a tough time competing sometimes for large industrial facilities with the United States, where lots of states can offer corporate tax breaks."
The question many governments ask is what they can get in return. Many have been cool to data centres, because of a prevailing belief that they create very few jobs.

"One of the misconceptions is that all data centres are data warehouses, with 10 or so caretakers, and that's about it," says Mr. Lehmann, who says Bank of Montreal's data centre employs about 300 people in its Barrie facility. "Those are very good jobs. The people who protect bank information have to be at the top of their game."
Mr. O'Neil says governments have to look at the bigger picture. "When governments evaluate the benefit of a car plant, they don't just look at the car plant," they say. "The jobs are in the ecosystem."
Free Cooling
Free cooling systems use a device called an economizer, a specialized heat exchanger that uses cool outdoor air to help chill water or glycol that, in turn, circulates to the server racks. This reduces the load on compressors and pumps, which are the most significant consumers of energy within the cooling system. According to data from computer room cooling manufacturer Liebert Corp., a business of Emerson Electric Co., this arrangement can slash the cooling bill by as much as 50 per cent.
Why data centres love Canada
Major options companies weigh when choosing where to build their data centres. Here are the four major ones:
Story continues below advertisement
Climate
Free cooling takes advantage of a country's cold air to significantly lower a data centre's extensive energy costs.
Infrastructure
Cheap, clean power, access to large volumes of water, and high bandwidth Internet are essential to the operation of these facilities.
Political Stability
Data security is a major concern for all businesses, who can't afford to risk the security or the privacy of their data.

Incentives
Tax breaks, financing, and research grants are common perks offered by governments to attract data centres.
Editor's note: Fujitsu is planning to build a data centre in Canada, and has not already done so, as a previous version of the story stated. This version of the story has been corrected.

Four female RCMP employees are asking the new prime minister to stop the force from firing them before their lawsuits alleging harassment are heard in court.
​"What Mr. Trudeau can do is immediately rescind the part of the RCMP Act that allows the commissioner to fire bad apples," said Cpl. Catherine Galliford.
"Right now the victims of harassment are the bad apples. We're the ones the commissioner of the RCMP is coming after."
Cpl. Catherine Galliford is on leave from the RCMP due to stress.
Galliford, Cpl. Susan Gastaldo, Const. Alice Fox and Atoya Montague, a civilian employee, are all off-duty, suffering from post-traumatic stress.
"We're asking your government to be the one that ends the abuse once and for all," they wrote in a letter sent to all Liberal MPs and senators.
The letter outlines their struggles in the RCMP:
'Putting your career at risk'
The RCMP have served notice they're dismissing Montague and Galliford.
The other two fear they're next — even though their lawsuits have not been heard in court.
"It could potentially silence people from coming forward, because if you do come forward you're really putting your career at risk," said Fox, noting that they risk repercussions for speaking to CBC News without permission.
Const. Alice Fox says they and other female RCMP employees were left with no choice but to sue their employer. (CBC)
Fox said they were left with no choice but to sue their employer.
"We've all filed grievances to exercise every means to be heard," said Fox. "We've all had to actually hire our own lawyers to actually bring this outside the RCMP and into the courts."
In their letter to Trudeau, they say, "The RCMP and the government of Canada continue to pay for all the legal costs of the abusers and harassers in the RCMP, and most of these men have gone completely unpunished for their criminal behaviour."
They ask the prime minister to do two things:
Stop the RCMP commissioner from firing alleged victims of harassment before their lawsuits are settled in court.
Provide equal funding to the alleged victims of harassment who have had to sue the RCMP.
Thousands in legal costs
The women said they have all suffered financially to pay for their legal bills.
"I definitely was not prepared to lose my house. I wasn't prepared to lose my life savings," said Galliford in an interview with CBC News.
Atoya Montague, an RMCP civilian employee, says years of unwanted sexual advances took their toll on them (CBC)
They said their alleged harassers get their legal defence bills paid by the federal government while they have been left broke and still waiting for a trial date, which has been postponed until 2017.
Them current legal costs are more than $250,000.
Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act confirm the government is covering at least some defendants' legal bills. The RCMP would not tell CBC if all RCMP defendants' legal fees are covered or how much it has cost taxpayers.
The four women are asking Trudeau and their government to immediately scrap part of Bill C-42, which allows the RCMP to easily fire Mounties.
They say legislation that was supposed to get rid of those with behaviour problems is instead being used to get rid of complainers.
CBC News has asked the Prime Minister's Office and the public safety minister's office for a response to the letter.
They said the government is reviewing the letter and will have more to say soon.

As some of you have heard today, Jonny Craig will not be doing the upcoming tour with Dance Gavin Dance. Jonny is very sick right now, and needs to do what they can to get better. Being on the road is no place for someone in their position right now. They need to focus on fixing himself. They have NOT been kicked out of Dance Gavin Dance, but we cannot tour with them in the current state they are in. We still want to continue being productive and playing music that we have so much passion for, which is why we decided to continue with the tour without Jonny. We love Jonny and we hope that Jonny can do what they can to get better, because we have done everything that we can to try to get them clean.
For this upcoming tour with A lot Like Birds, we will be joined by Kurt Travis and Matt Geise to fill in on vocals. We will be doing something that we've never done before, and thats preforming songs from all 4 full-lengths. For the time being, keep your eyes peeled and your ears piqued for new Secret Band music! See you all out on the road and make sure to come up and say hi to us at the merch table!

A researcher at North Carolina State University has developed a computer chip that can store an unprecedented amount of data -- enough to hold an entire library's worth of information on a single chip. The new chip stems from a breakthrough in the use of nanodots, or nanoscale magnets, and represents a significant advance in computer-memory technology.
"We have created magnetic nanodots that store one bit of information on each nanodot, allowing us to store over one billion pages of information in a chip that is one square inch," says Dr. Jay Narayan, the John C. Fan Distinguished Chair Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State and author of the research.
The breakthrough is that these nanodots are made of single, defect-free crystals, creating magnetic sensors that are integrated directly into a silicon electronic chip. These nanodots, which can be made uniformly as small as six nanometers in diameter, are all precisely oriented in the same way -- allowing programmers to reliably read and write data to the chips.
The chips themselves can be manufactured cost-effectively, but the next step is to develop magnetic packaging that will enable users to take advantage of the chips -- using something, such as laser technology, that can effectively interact with the nanodots.
The research, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, was presented as an invited talk April 7 at the 2011 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco.
NC State's Department of Materials Science and Engineering is part of the university's College of Engineering.
And excited. Among other things, I'll be spending a summer and part of a fall largely outdoors, something New Yorkers in general (and obituary writers in particular) rarely get to do. But mostly it will be a chance to revisit an adventure I'd thought at the time was a once-only, last-chance, now-or-never thing.
A lot has happened — in the world, in my life — since I last did this, and, bicycling being a solitary and somewhat contemplative enterprise, the trip will give me a lot to think about, an opportunity to compare and contrast, as the language of high school social studies quizzes would have it.
Over the last 18 years, both of my parents died. My brother and their wife had a son. A couple of sincere and serious love affairs began and ended. I moved to Chicago and back to New York. I spent four years as a theater critic. I published a couple of books. I traveled on a bicycle in Vietnam , New Zealand , Italy , Ireland and France . I renovated my apartment. Twice.

Experiential bookends like this encourage you to take stock, add up the life details. How am I doing? What am I missing?
New York may be America 's greatest city, but it isn't representative. You don't need me to count the reasons it is an anomaly, but an especially pertinent one is that New York is a vertical place and America isn't; to traverse the country by bicycle is to experience it horizontally in the extreme, and the absorption of long distances on the road felt, to me, like the qualifying exam for some enhanced form of citizenship. Immersing myself in the America I hadn't known turned out to be patriotism-inducing. Excuse me, but what a country!
When I pulled into little towns at dusk in 1993, looking for a diner, a motel and a cold beer (not necessarily in that order), I was received, most often, with curiosity and warmth. Bill Clinton 's first year in office, the first World Trade Center bombing, the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., and gay men and women serving in the military were hot-button national issues, but the topic I encountered most was the weather. Voluminous spring and early summer rainfall saturated the upper Midwest and the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, along with several tributaries, causing vast flooding. The worst was over by the time I got there — my weather luck was terrific — but it was a mammoth disaster, and perhaps the mood I encountered was colored by widespread sympathy. Or perhaps we just weren't at one another's throats so much back then.
I embark this time with a concern that a lot of Americans share, that we are a fragmented people, more polarized than ever. Polls regularly tell us that a majority of citizens feel the country is on the wrong track, though there is serious and angry debate about what the right track should be. So I wonder how much the current political mood has filtered down to ground level. How well will a complete stranger on two wheels be welcomed now in places he's never visited? (And oh yeah — how much rain am I going to get?)

What else? Technology. Not long ago I took a morning's ride on the bike I crossed the country with in 1993; it felt like a Model T. (Well, maybe not so ancient; more like a VW van. In any case, clunky.) For this trip, as a concession to age, I've had a bicycle custom-built to my precise dimensions and for the precise purpose of this journey. It has a titanium frame (that is, it's very light); handlebars that go straight across, rather than drop, to keep me more upright (I've got a neck problem); especially durable wheels and tires. (Gearhead alert! You'll find more technical information in a blog post later this week: nytimes.com/intransit .) It cost about as much as a good — very good — used car.
Besides that, back then, neither cellphones nor personal computers were the ubiquitous human appendages they are today; the articles I wrote about once a week were scribbled longhand in a notebook. I would then phone them in to the newsroom from a motel room or a roadside phone booth and read them aloud into a tape recorder, to be transcribed later.

The series generated more mail than anything I'd written before for the newspaper or have written since, but I had no idea of it until I found the stack of letters on my desk when I got back.
For this trip, I'll be blogging regularly — and sending out updates on Twitter : @nytbruceweber. I'll be welcoming suggestions: for routes to follow, towns not to miss, places to eat and stay. Starting in the West because the prevailing winds blow west to east, I'll be riding from Oregon into Washington and then more directly east. The plan is to stay north, mostly because it'll be cooler, and because the only state I've never set foot in is North Dakota ; I need to fix that. For some reason, I'd like to visit Itasca, Minn., the source of the Mississippi River . After that, we'll see.
As for other F.A.Q.'s:
I'm estimating that the trip will take three months, which will bring me back to New York in time for the World Series. The last trip took 75 days.
Photo
The plan is to average 300 miles a week, or 50 miles a day, with one day off. Relentless but very doable.
I'll be sleeping indoors as often as possible. Yes, I'll be carrying a sleeping bag and a tent, just in case, but if I never sleep on the ground again, on this trip or afterward, I'll have gotten my wish.
Finally, to self-assess, I'm in reasonably good health and reasonably good shape — for someone closer to 60 than 50. I get to the gym most mornings. I probably drink a little too much but don't eat many sweets. A year ago, I rode a rigorous tour in New Zealand, somewhere north of 300 miles in six days, including some pretty vertical terrain. I'm 6-foot-1, and I weigh just about 190, precisely my weight when I began my trip in 1983. (I finished at 176.)
That's mostly to the good. So is the fact that I quit smoking three months before the last trip, but it has been 10 years this time.

On the other hand, I have gout , acid reflux , a degenerating tendon in my right foot, tinnitus — the result of some ill-advised scuba lessons in the Caribbean a couple of winters ago — and tendinitis in my left elbow, which kept me from straightening my arm for a good part of last year. Three years ago, I had surgery to reattach the retina in my right eye. And this spring I received a diagnosis of spinal stenosis — a narrowing of the spinal canal — which pinched a nerve in my neck and sent throbbing pains into my left shoulder. It was treated with steroid injections. It feels better.
The standard joke is that I'm both perfectly healthy and falling apart, and my doctors have pretty much confirmed this.
Last month I went to my longtime internist for a full physical, just to make sure a cross-country bike trip was only a little crazy, not entirely insane. I said I thought I'd had an unusual string of irritating problems, and they laughed.
“It's a short list,” they said. “Believe me.”
What about the bike trip? Did they want to talk me out of it? Would she?
They laughed again.
“It sounds like a great adventure,” they said. “Have fun. Stay safe.”
Like practically everyone who earns their bread off the internet, I have mixed feelings about comments. The relationship is at best love/hate, similar to my feelings for Twitter, Facebook and any other social network really. Comments introduce me to interesting and challenging people. And they also, sometimes — OK, relatively often — suck the life force from my very core. Negativity is like deadly radiation, and I won't last long when exposed.
Sometimes I prefer to just use GIFs in comments. They're lighthearted. It's easy to sense the emotion of the message, which I can't always say about text. Today, I came across these GIFs of Pokémon evolving, and giddily imagined a world in which Pokémon GIFs were the de facto method of communicating online. Everything would be happy and sweet and cuddly. Sure, it would thwart productivity and conversation and eventually I would miss the real world. But, you know, what if we made the dream a reality here in this post?
Credit for these beautiful GIFs goes to the immensely talented Brakken on Tumblr, whose other work is worth a look.
'Call Me Caitlyn': Bruce Jenner Reveals New Name
Updated at 1:49 p.m. ET
Bruce Jenner, the former Olympic gold-medal-winning decathlete who revealed recently that "for all intents and purposes" they are a woman, is now Caitlyn Jenner.
The revelation was made in Vanity Fair, which tweeted an image of Jenner on the cover of its July issue.
"If I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never ever did anything about it, I would be lying there saying, 'You just blew your entire life,' " Jenner tells the magazine's Buzz Bissinger.
Jenner, 65, described to ABC's Diane Sawyer in April a lifelong struggle with gender identity.
As NPR's Christopher Dean Hopkins reported at the time: "Jenner told Sawyer that they hoped that being public with their identity and struggle might help change perceptions and increase acceptance of transgender individuals."
As ABC's Sawyer noted at that time, the prime-time interview was Jenner's last as Bruce, but Jenner was still most comfortable with male pronouns. That appears to have now changed — as Vanity Fair referred to Jenner using the female pronouns "she" and "her." And, the magazine notes, Jenner says: "I don't really get hung up" about it.
Jenner's children and their stepchildren, the Kardashians, have all expressed support for the change.

From executive producer David S. Goyer and showrunner Daniel Cerone, Constantine is based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics. John Constantine (Matt Ryan) is a seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult, armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and their wicked wit, but their soul is already damned to hell. Along with trying to find a loophole out of that, Constantine begrudgingly fights to save the soul of others, with the help and guidance of long-time friend Chas (Charles Halford), an intuitive with heightened senses named Zed (Angélica Celaya), and a morally ambiguous guardian angel known as Manny (Harold Perrineau).
During this exclusive interview with Collider, actor Matt Ryan talked about their long audition process, both in London and L.A., how they view John Constantine, what they most enjoys about playing this character, the character dynamics, the journey of John Constantine, and why he's not surprised that people have made a big deal about the smoking thing. Check out what they had to say after the jump.
Collider: How did you come to be a part of this show?
MATT RYAN: It's funny, I was doing a play in London. I was doing Henry V with Jude Law in the West End, and I had long hair and a long beard. It was pilot season, when all of the pilots come out, and I was reading a few things, but there wasn't much that I really liked. And then, this came up and I really liked it. But then, I got offered a play at the National Theatre in London, and I really wanted to do the play. It was a great role. My agents and everyone were like, “No, this is gonna be a great show. You've gotta do this!” And when I researched it more and more, I was like, “Wow, this is awesome!” So, I did an audition, initially, in London because I couldn't get over here with the play. I had long hair and a beard, and I think Daniel [Cerone] said to David [Goyer], “Yeah, we like Sasquatch, but this guy needs to shave.” So, I went through an arduous audition process of doing tape after tape. Because I had long hair and a beard, there were some people who couldn't quite see it, and I couldn't fly over until the play finished. Luckily, they still hadn't found anyone, so I flew straight to L.A. On the night we finished our play, I went out to the party to end the play, jumped on a plane and got here. It was Sunday and a holiday, but I can't remember which holiday it was. I called my friend and said, “Do you know anyone who can cut my hair?” So, they got one of their hair-dresser friends to cut my hair, and I went in the next day. And then, I went through the whole process here again. Eventually, I landed the role, and it's great. I was unbelievably overwhelmed. It's such an awesome role.
How do you view John Constantine?
RYAN: He's not a superhero. He's a working class anti-hero. He's your ultimate man's man and bloke's bloke, who's out for the everyday man. He's a humanist, but he's also a con man and manipulator. He'll sacrifice their best friend to get what they want. It's a real inner conflict that goes on with him. He's ultimately out to try to save humanity, but he'll do whatever they need to, to achieve that. He's a tortured soul who carries all this guilt around with him. It's a real interesting thing to play. It's a real three-dimensional, multi-faceted character. In TV, sometimes you see a lot of generic characters, reading off exposition, and there's not much behind it. I'm looking forward to really fleshing this guy out. I already know them quite well already, but as things go on, things will deepen and I'll get to know them more, and we'll be able to explore more.
What do you enjoy most about playing this character?
RYAN: They just doesn't give a shit. That's what I love about him. He's got that British cynical wit. He's a bit of an asshole, and they can be a bit of a bastard, as well. He's seen it all, which is awesome.
The relationship between John and Manny is so fun because, as an angel, they can just pop up anywhere, at any time. How is that to play?
RYAN: It's a great thing. I love getting to play with Harold [Perrineau] because they make uneasy allies. They both want the same thing, but they both want to leave each other alone, as well. It's a great dynamic, though. It will be interesting to see what happens in the series with them, and how they intertwine.
After you shot the pilot and set up the dynamic with Liv, how did you react to then having to change all of that up and bring in Zed instead?
RYAN: I agree with the guys that the Liv character was more of a reactionary character, and they were more susceptible to John's manipulations. Whereas the Zed character can get more into John's face and call them on their shit, a little bit more. So, I could see exactly why they did that. Lucy [Griffiths] is fantastic. I had worked with them before, on a TV show called Collision. She's a fantastic actor and they did a great job. Zed is more of a foil for John and can give them a little bit more shit, which is something John needs, every now and then.
How did you see the friendship between John and Chas?
RYAN: Chas is John's best friend, and one of their oldest friends, as well. He's the brawn to John's brains, but Chas is a thoughtful guy himself. He's also a little bit of a beating rod for John. John gives them a bit of shit, every now and then. Poor Chas gets it in the cheek, all the time. Chas could probably take John out in a fight. He's a big guy. In the pilot, Chas dies. How is that? That's another interesting thing we're going to find out. Is it a spell? Is it a curse? Are they immortal? How does that work? Whatever that is, how does that then affect their dynamic? But, it's great because Chas provides logic to John. John is the master of the dark arts and the occult, and everything in that world, but sometimes Chas is common sense and John will be like, “Oh, I didn't think of that,” when it's right in front of their face. They make a good team, in that way. It's really interesting. Between the three people that John has relationships with, there are a lot of interesting dynamics going on, and very different dynamics, as well. The diversity of the dynamics between each one of those characters is really interesting.
What can you say about the journey John Constantine is taking this season?
RYAN: John is like a supernatural smoke jumper. Every time they see a little bit of supernatural smoke, they jump on it and tries to put it out. I really like that analogy of it. It's almost as if they're trying to put out the possible fires from this rising darkness before they ignite. There's this rising impending darkness, and there's all these little things, popping up all over the country and the world, and they're just trying to put the flames out before it gets too big. And in the process, they're trying to figure out what it is and how to get to the core of it.
Are you surprised about how big of a deal everyone has made over the whole smoking thing?
RYAN: I'm not surprised. In the original character description of John Constantine, it's the third thing that's mentioned, so something like that is fundamental to the character. They have to be a smoker. There's no question about it. You can't take that away from them because that's who they are. It's just a matter of us not dwelling on it, in terms of us showing it too much. But, he's a smoker. They still have that addiction. That's still what they do. That's essential to who they are. He's a drinker. He's a smoker. He's a rough, raw British bloke. That's who they are. Smoking is not a good thing. It's not good to condone it. As a character, you don't want to say, “Hey, it's cool to smoke.” But at the same time, it's such a huge part of the character.  They are a smoker and we will be able to show them holding cigarettes.  They are still a smoker, but we're just not going to dwell on it. We're not going to do any close-up shots of them taking a long drag.
Constantine airs on Friday nights on NBC.
The Arabian Sea has a special place in Indian business history. For centuries the cities and settlements on the Arabian Sea littoral traded with each other, exchanging Indian textiles for horse, armaments, pearls and ivory. In turn, some of the textiles were passed on to the Atlantic slave trade in Africa as a medium of exchange, or sent overland to European markets. Coastal merchants indigenous to the region bordering the sea engaged in this business and developed sophisticated systems of banking and shipbuilding to support the mercantile enterprise. The Hindu and Muslim traders of Kachchh were examples of such groups of people.
In the 17th century, the Arabian Sea trade flourished thanks to the control that three powerful empires – the Ottoman in Turkey, the Safavid in Iran and the Mughal in India – exercised on some of the key seaports, and regular transactions amongst them. This was also the time when the European merchant companies established themselves in the Indian Ocean trade, even though the Portuguese had arrived in this world somewhat earlier. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Mughal empire had almost collapsed and its access to the Arabian Sea ports had long come to an end. Europeans were in the ascendance.
What happened to the indigenous traders and bankers during this period of transition? Two contending stories exist on this question. The first says that they lost ground to the Europeans while their patrons lost political power. The second says that the indigenous traders found partnerships and agency with the Europeans lucrative, and as their fortunes flourished, the Europeans gained in political power. Both stories overstate the Europeans' commercial prowess and understate the Indians' capacity to shape the course of history.
Chhaya Goswami's book is a corrective to such biased histories. It shows that the Kachchhi traders did gain from European trade, and withstood well the decline of empires, but they could do so thanks to their own resources, which included well-developed institutions of commerce and banking, knowledge of the seas, shipping, and shipbuilding, past history of collaborating with political actors, and access to both maritime and overland trading routes.
The book is divided into four chapters, each one of substantial length. Chapter one explores the special characteristics of Kachchh that make it a “land of entrepreneurs”. Chapters two and three describe Kachchhi traders' activities in Muscat and Zanzibar respectively, and chapter four deals with some of the prominent firms in the maritime trade, and how a few of them extended their operations beyond the southwest Asia region.
Why Kachchh? What is special about the region that it should produce so many merchant groups? The convenient location of the region on a navigable part of the eastern Arabian Sea, as well as the Mandvi port, of course, supplies a part of the answer.
Another part of the answer has to do with politics. The western coastal regions were ruled by small states that depended heavily on income from trade. This dependence was due to the poor agricultural conditions in the region. In turn, these states, though nominally vassals of the Mughals, could exercise a great deal of independence in policy. They used their freedom to create a model of rule where merchants and bankers had a prominent place, not only during warfare, the all-too-common palace intrigues or disasters, but also in normal times. Merchants and bankers helped the business of governance by collecting taxes, revenue farming, making loans, and taking part in administration, whereas the states helped them by offering lucrative contracts and implicitly recognising their laws and practices.
But the political and geographical environment explains little unless we also consider the social and institutional basis of entrepreneurship in the region. The merchant groups in question were ready to establish diaspora networks in port cities around the Arabian Sea. They conducted extensive and complicated financial operations including bill and insurance, and their bills were acceptable to the distant trading points thanks to the diaspora network.
The book shows in interesting detail how Vaishnavite temples and monasteries became effectively banks, clearing houses, and guarantors of reputation. Community law had great force. The merchants had considerable interest in shipbuilding, which in turn encouraged timber trade. In banking, trading, shipbuilding, and navigation, master-apprentice hierarchies were highly developed, showing how much skills were valued and how skills formed.
The book is well-researched and builds on the author's deep knowledge of vernacular sources and the regional context. It is business history as business history should be, that is, it succeeds in recreating a whole world around a group of traders, and fills an important gap in Indian economic history scholarship.
One wishes, at the same time, that the author had tried to place the Kachchhi traders more firmly in debates on the 18th century economic transition in southern Asia, and attempted some comparative discussion of trading ‘firms' in Kachchh and elsewhere in the world. Surely the Europeans operated in the same world, with a very different model of a firm. Did the difference matter to institutional and political change? But, perhaps wisely, Goswami's book steers clear of dry historiography. Instead, it keeps in mind its readers – who will no doubt find the material presented fascinating and the quality of the narrative superb.

This time of year in Vermont is all about comfort food. And for me, nothing is more comforting than having the divine smell of a veggie stew waft through the house as it simmers away in the crockpot. This hearty meal takes very minimal prep; the hardest thing to do is cutting the butternut squash, which depending on your squash might require a bit of a workout, but that's it really. A little bit of chopping and dicing, the strenuousness of tossing all the ingredients in the slow cooker, and then the hard part – walking away for 4 hours while it turns itself into a delicious satisfying stew.

WASHINGTON -- The House voted on Thursday to kill nearly every action by the Obama administration to reform the immigration enforcement system, approving amendments that would separate U.S. citizens from their undocumented spouses and end prioritization of deporting dangerous unauthorized immigrants.
"The administration is now saying, 'I don't like the laws, I won't enforce them,'" Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.) said in support of an amendment proposed by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). "It would be equitable to an officer saying, 'I'm not going to enforce any drug laws, because I want to wait -- I may see a bank robber.'"
That amendment, and the 11 others offered and adopted by the GOP, stripped funding from government programs meant to make the immigration process, and treatment of immigrants, more humane and targeted toward the most dangerous. Many of the adopted measures transferred funding to border security, even though Customs and Border Protection would receive a $208 million increase in funding under Obama's proposed fiscal year 2013 budget.
Republicans have generally opposed every action by the Obama administration on immigration, even though deportations increased to record levels under their watch.
King's amendment -- one of the two that were introduced by the immigration hardliner and later approved -- would prohibit funding to implement the "Morton Memo," a document from Immigration and Customs Director John Morton in June 2011 that lays out priorities for deportation based on the fact that funding is too limited to deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people in the country. ICE took up a review in August 2011 under those guidelines to close deportation cases deemed low-priority -- an effort that so far has been less fruitful than expected.
Still, the administration and advocates argue that with limited funding, this type of prosecutorial discretion is necessary.
"You're going to go after the dangerous gang member before you're going to go after someone that is double parked or jaywalking," Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said in opposition to the amendment. "That is what police do all over the United States."
Another adopted amendment, proposed by Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), would ban the administration from granting waivers that would allow some undocumented family members of U.S. citizens -- spouses, parents and children -- to stay in the country while applying for legal status, which was proposed by Obama in January. Under current policy, those immediate family members must leave the country before they can return, without knowing when exactly they will be reunited with their U.S.-citizen families.
"This proposed rule ... makes it easier for illegals to stay in our country unlawfully," Graves said on the House floor. "But the core impact of the proposed rule would be to encourage relatives of U.S. citizens to come to the U.S. illegally."
Other adopted amendments included cutting funding for the ICE public advocate, a position created in February to work with stakeholders on their concerns about the system; blocking funding for a 2000 executive order that would aid non-English speakers; and banning so-called "sanctuary cities," which instruct police to avoid asking about immigration status because it is a federal duty.
Two Democratic amendments were adopted: Rep. Keith Ellison's (D-Minn.) amendment aimed at preventing racial profiling and a measure from Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.) to limit the use of unmanned drones.
LONDON (Reuters) - English football clubs West Ham United and Newcastle United were raided early on Wednesday morning by tax officials as part of a wide-sweeping probe, with several men arrested for suspected Income Tax and National Insurance fraud.

A West Ham spokesperson said: “The Club is cooperating fully with HMRC to assist their enquiries.”
Newcastle initially made no comment but subsequently posted a brief statement on their website.
It said: “Newcastle United can confirm that a member of its staff has this morning been assisting HMRC with their inquiries. The club will be making no further comment at this time.”
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that no West Ham staff or representatives of the club had been arrested.
HMRC, the body responsible for the United Kingdom's tax collection, said: “180 HMRC officers have been deployed across the UK and France today.
“Investigators have searched a number of premises in the North East and South East of England and arrested the men and also seized business records, financial records, computers and mobile phones.
“This criminal investigation sends a clear message that, whoever you are, if you commit tax fraud you can expect to face the consequences.”
HMRC said French authorities were assisting the UK investigation, that they have made arrests and that several locations have been searched in France.
France's financial prosecutor's office said that 10 searches had been conducted there, four people had been detained and that documents had been seized.
It said in a statement that British authorities suspected that secret payments had been made to certain players, their agents or third parties to evade taxes during the transfer of players between French and Premier League clubs.
During the 5,000-year period from -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE), Earth will experience 11,898 eclipses of the Sun. The statistical distribution of eclipse types for this interval is as follows : 4,200 partial eclipses, 3,956 annular eclipses, 3,173 total eclipses and 569 hybrid eclipses. All the data accessed through this interface is provided by Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus (NASA Technical Publication TP-2006-214141). The data available is described in greater detail in the Key to Solar Eclipse Catalogs. Years in this catalog are numbered astronomically and include the year 0. Historians should note there is a difference of one year between astronomical dates and BCE dates. Thus, the astronomical year 0 corresponds to 1 BCE, and astronomical year -1 corresponds to 2 BCE, etc.

At the Google I/O 2017 event on May 17, one of the world's leading tech companies, Google, announced its roadmap for the coming year. During its close to two hours long keynote presentation, the company's top honchos led by CEO Sundar Pichai did not unveil a major piece of hardware, but instead shed light on the plans for its flagship products including Android, Google Assistant and Google Home.
It made several other announcements too, most of which fell in line with the industry trend of increased focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and improved use of voice recognition technology in its products.
Here are the key takeaways and announcements from Google I/O 2017.
Google sets its sight on India with Android Go
In a bid to bring Android to millions of entry level phones across the world, Google on May 17 unveiled a scaled-down version of its popular Android OS, which with its nifty optimisations promises to bring better functionality to smartphones at an affordable price. Android Go will be of particular interest to users in India, as it is one of the biggest markets for low-end entry-level phones.
The company is making optimisations to the system UI and the kernel of the Android Go to enable it to run smoothly on devices with as low as 512MB of RAM. Owing to the improvements, the OS promises to provide a better usage experience to devices with ultra low-end specs and will cater to users who want to use their devices on primarily 2G networks.

Android O Beta
Another major announcement from the conference was Google announcing the upcoming version of the Android OS. Currently known as Android O (Android Oreo in the future maybe?) will focus on bringing major improvements to features like battery life and security of smartphones on the Android platform.
The Android O beta preview which is now available to download will also be optimised to limit resource consumption by apps running in the background. The OS will also improve bootup times. Apart from these improvements to the code, Android O will come with new features such as ‘Picture in Picture (PIP) and Smart Text Selection.
Stage set for Android domination
During the keynote, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that Android OS has notched up a tally of two billion active monthly users. From smartphones to tablets and Android TVs, Google has made serious inroads into our daily lives, and as things stand the stage is set for domination of the market by Google's favourite child, Android.
Push for AI, VR
Another key takeaway from I/O 2017 is that Google is reimagining all its products and services from an AI and AR/VR first perspective. All its products including Maps, Assistant, and Home, will now increasingly use AI learning and VR/AR technology to serve its vast customer base better.
An interesting example of this is the new “Lens” feature for its Assistant service which will use the phone's camera to tell the user information about what's in front of their phone camera such as information about the restaurant across the street.
Standalone VR Headsets
We're investing in core tech that enables us to experience computing more like we experience the real world. https://t.co/yBgMbjOTg4 #io17 pic.twitter.com/2LqCV7Zlke — Google VR (@googlevr) May 17, 2017
While Facebook is increasingly looking to tap into the potential of the AR technology, Google has set its sight on bringing VR to the masses. After Cardboard and Daydream, Google has now set its sights on developing a VR tech which will not require smartphones to enjoy an immersive VR experience.
The company during the keynote revealed that upcoming headsets won't require a smartphone or PC to power the user's VR experience. You just put it on and it works out of the box. Powered by technology from its Tango augmented reality system, the headsets track virtual space with something Google calls “WorldSense”.

Katie Ottenweller is a staff attorney and the leader of the Solar Initiative at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
As solar power becomes rapidly more affordable, all Americans should have access to this abundant resource, which will help us create stronger, cleaner and healthier communities. Unfortunately, the right to go solar is coming under attack across much of the country, hindering families and businesses from choosing cheaper, cleaner solar power.
Some utilities take advantage of outdated laws to prevent solar companies from offering customers options to lower or eliminate upfront costs of installing solar panels.
Despite the incredible potential for homegrown solar power in the sunny Southeast, some utilities are working to erect barriers and create restrictive rules that protect their monopoly instead of allowing Americans to choose their energy source on an open market.
These utilities take advantage of outdated monopoly protection laws to prevent independent solar companies from offering customers financing options to lower or eliminate upfront costs of installing solar panels – options that would make solar available to lower income families that are most in need of stable power bills.
Many solar customers also face punitive fees and fines from utilities who claim they are entitled to charge customers for not using their product or for using less of it – to the tune of as much as $85 each month.
Other utilities are trying to block fair compensation for excess electricity that solar customers provide to the grid, which often is generated on hot, sunny days when demand and stress on the grid is highest. Solar customers have little recourse when their utilities undervalue this solar electricity, telling homeowners it's only worth 3 or 4 cents and then turning around and selling that same electricity to another customer (often their next door neighbor) for three times that amount.
These unfair practices deserve closer scrutiny by public utility commissions and state legislators, who should not put entrenched interests of powerful utility companies above the interests of their customers.
We can harness the value of local solar power for the good of all Americans by ending energy companies' punitive solar taxes on customers, opening the market to solar financing companies, and establishing fair compensation for solar electricity.
But the regulators will need to keep the fox from guarding the henhouse.

Jerry Brown is the smartest and shrewdest politician in California today.
Their capacity to get things done is virtually unmatched, and at the time they became governor, we needed that skill desperately. They reminded Californians what political leadership looks like.
Brown doesn't always use their power wisely. We disagree on some major issues. But they have stabilized the budget, begun to pay down debt and raised the state's credit rating from rock bottom, where they found it. Their opponent, moderate Republican Neel Kashkari, is not a serious contender, so Brown is headed for another term — their fourth, counting the two in the 1970s and 80s. They have earned re-election.
When Brown took office in 2011, California was a mess: a structural budget deficit, soaring debt, plunging credit ratings, high unemployment and a pervasive gloom that the Golden State might not regain its glitter.
They got the budget deficits under control and defied Democratic stereotypes by limiting spending increases even when the economy began to recover. Perhaps their greatest leadership achievement in tax-averse California was putting their reputation on the line to pass Proposition 30, the temporary tax increases that restored fiscal stability — a key to reviving the credit rating — without further decimating services.
Some of their reform ventures fizzled, including pensions, and there's clearly work to do on the state's business climate. But they successfully tackled school funding, a political third rail for most politicians, with reform that should help poor schools. It may need tweaking, but it has to be better than the bizarre formula it replaces.
The list of Brown's accomplishments could go on — but the governor's legacy is far from assured.
One liability is of their own making: the discredited and possibly corrupt California Public Utilities Commission.
Michael Peevey, its president, is a disaster of conflicts of interest with utilities, particularly PG&E. Their cronyism permeates the PUC, based on recently disclosed emails that prompted a cavalcade of Page One stories in recent weeks. Peevey should have gone years ago, but now Brown really has to clean house before the scandal escalates. It's not like him, a man of action, to let this fester.
It will be harder for Brown to change course on their two megabillion-dollar pipe dreams, however: high-speed rail and the Delta twin tunnel plan.
Brown won't pull the plug on high-speed rail now, with the first segment under construction. But when funding for the rest — the parts that actually go somewhere — starts to falter, we hope he'll come to their senses.
As to the proposal for two massive tunnels for Delta water that will do nothing to increase the supply — we see an imminent collision with federal environmental law. Brown has to pick their fights, and the tunnels should not be one. If they start now, they can have a sensible Delta plan in place by 2018.
Kashkari is an interesting man with some good ideas, but he's politically naive. When we questioned how they could implement their ambitious school reform plans, for example, they dismissed the doubts as support for the status quo. My-way-or-the-highway doesn't work as a strategy with an elected Legislature, as Arnold Schwarzenegger painfully learned. Brown lays down the law from time to time, but always in a politically pragmatic context.
It's unusual for us to urge voting for a governor whose biggest ideas we dispute. But we look at the whole candidate, the whole job, and the ability to move California forward. We're glad Jerry Brown was elected four years ago, and he's the right choice for the next four years.
Especially if they clean up the PUC before Election Day.
During a raid conducted in May but only reported this week, police in the southwestern province of Guangxi said they smashed an underground network that had been swamping the Chinese food market with substandard chicken feet, tripe and throat.
Among their stomach-churning discoveries were chicken feet that date back to 1967, a time when China was still ruled by Chairman Mao and the Tiananmen Square massacre was still twenty-two years away.
Li Jianmin, a local security chief, told the state news agency Xinhua that after smuggling the decades-old feet into China the expired meat was treated with chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide, "to kill bacteria, prolong the expiry date" and make the feet "look white and big".
The smugglers were able to turn a profit of around £1750 per tonne by transforming 1kg of out-of-date chicken into 1.5kg of apparently fresh chicken, the South China Morning Post reported, citing Guangxi's Chutian Metropolis Daily.
The chicken feet, that are as old as the debut albums of both the Doors and Pink Floyd, entered the market during a crucial year of world history.
Under Chairman Mao, China was in the throes of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, a vicious crackdown on landowners, intellectuals and religion that is thought to have claimed at least one million lives.
Over the border in Vietnam, from whence the chickens' feet came, war was raging and US president Lyndon Johnson faced a growing backlash at home over the rising body count.
In Britain, Harold Wilson was three years into their first term as prime minister and the Beatles' were preparing to release Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Forty-six years on, the Guangxi chicken feet have become the latest symbol of China's ongoing food safety crisis.
Scarcely a day goes by without new and often mind-boggling concoctions hitting the domestic food market.
In May it emerged that diners in some Shanghai restaurants had been gorging themselves on rat, mink and fox rather than lamb.
Last week, Shanghai police said they had closed two crayfish restaurants after receiving a tip-off from a kitchen "insider". The chefs, it was claimed, had been adding poppy seeds to their soups in the hope it would leave their customers addicted.
So, last time there was actually a lot of interest in the new Planetside, so I'd like to get a little more info out there. Starting with basic things like who everyone is, and faction benefits, then going on to the delicious scraps of info we've been fed so far. First and foremost, the best news of it all. PlanetSide 2 is free-to-play, and will feature a cash-shop like what's found in League of Legends. Power won't be for sale, but you can buy convinence items and cosmetic changes. Hard to think of anything they can do to make Vanu look more amazing though. Hopefully we can generate even more interest in the game and give a long, long life. Part of the joy of PlanetSide is the massive battles and the world filled with constant warfare. So, let's start with the basics; the Three Empires.
Terran Republic:
One of the more common in promotional materials (that I've seen), the Terran Republic are loyal to the Earth government that has been cutoff ever since Auraxis lost it's connection with Earth. The TR weapons and vehicles focus on speed above all else, whether it is vehicle speed or rate of fire, the Terran Republic can't be matched in terms of speed. They are also more reliant on numbers than the other factions, needing more people to fill the air with as many bullets as they possibly can. Their designs also tend to be fairly fluid and slender. Good choice if you want to be group oriented, to bring the most out of your Empire's strengths.
New Conglomerant:
The New Conglomerant are the second of the three Empires, and are a group of misfits ranging from massive corporations to thieves and terrorists. Their weapons may not be as state-of-the-art as the Terran Republic's, but don't let that fool you. In terms of raw power, nothing can beat the NC. Their weapons and vehicles pack the biggest punch and will hurt like hell if you happen to be caught by them. They also tend to be more armored than what you'd expect, but all that firepower and armor comes with a cost, and they aren't the most mobile of the empires. Their designs tend to be extremely bulky and have more than a few sharp angles. Good for more solo (relatively speaking, you will still need backup) players, giving a bit more punch to make up for a lack of numbers.
Vanu Sovereignty:
The third and favorite Empire of mine, the Vanu Sovereignty. The VS are a group of transcendentalists who believe the ultimate evolution of humanity can only be achieved by incorporating more of the ancient Vanu technology. As a result, their armor and weapons tend to be the most out there, having lasers and plasma where other empires might use bullets. While the Vanu Sovereignty aren't the hardest hitting or quickest of the Empires, their mobility is second to none. While the Terran Republic may be quicker, the VS have greater mobility with anti-gravity technology. While the New Conglormerant hit harder, they can't match some of the utility the VS bring to the table. Though, I could be biased about this. Maybe. Vanu design is more out there, with triangles and overlapping metal plates. Also, their color is purple. Whats not to love? Good faction for players who want to abuse the greater mobility of the vehicles or use the different weapons the Vanu have at their disposal.
And those are the three factions. Regardless of who you pick, every faction has access to common pool vehicles. Things that don't really differentiate, and only really have varying color schemes. Other vehicles like the Scythe for the Vanu Sovereignty, or the Prowler for the Terran Republic, are unique to each faction and not available to the others. So if you want a Mosquito, you'll have to go Terran. Want a Vanguard, time to go New Conglomerant.
Expanding off the vehicles, some have differing equipment you can add to change how the vehicle functions. Sadly, you can't turn a jet into a tank with transformer tech, but you can shift your role. For instance, the Scythe is a light attack air-craft unique to the Vanu Sovereignty. It can be configured as a support air-craft, with Anti-Air weaponry to support the slower moving planes in the Vanu fleet, or to protect ground troops and vehicles from air attacks. However, it can also be configured with weapons specializing in ground targets, switching roles from protector to a hunter-killer plane, scouring the battle-field and showering troops and vehicles with death from above. It can also be fitted with both, taking on both roles as the need arises, but won't have the specialized armaments needed to really excel. So you can choose to specialize in one area, and do excellent, or become a jack-of-all-trades, master of none if utility suites your preferences. Not all vehicles can be configured to fit different roles, but don't be surprised if certain tank shells fire off napalm to burn down infantry while others are simply massive hunks of lead for punching into armor. You can decide what role you want to specialize in, within a reasonable field. Don't count on becoming an Anti-Air tank with your main cannon, no matter how satisfying it may be to blow a buzzing little Mosquito out of the air. You have support gunners for that.
On the topic of specalization, if you played PlanetSide, you may remember how your character could be built back then. Virtually any way, as long as you got the CERT for it. Well, that system is now (somewhat) gone, and instead a class system has been put in place. So while you can't build an ubermensch of a soldier, you can pick an area to excel in at the cost of something else. Infiltrators will make great assassins and snipers, but that light armor isn't going to help you in the slightest if you try to take a machine-gun to the front lines. CERTS return as skills and weapon-prerequisites, allowing you to advance in a chosen path. Some CERTS may also have prerequisites, but you can train anything that suits your fancy. If you've ever played EVE Online, CERTS now function like skills in EVE. You can only be training one CERT per account at any given time, but CERTS continue to train even if you're offline (though some will train faster if you're online and pursuing that skill). So you can, say, train up a CERT as a pilot, but hop on to some ground warfare while your CERT is training and not worry about it. Just remember to pick something else to train once you're finished. Hopefully a Queue system will be implemented like in EVE, but we haven't heard anything about it yet. There is also a Battle Rank system, which is basically a Level Up by a different name. Higher Battle Rank will open up higher level CERTS to train, so don't think you can afk CERT up to the best stuff. You'll have to get your boots dirty and that gun well-worn before then.
As a final note, for a free to play game PlanetSide 2 looks absolutely incredible. How incredible? Well, check this out for a moment…
Seriously, that is being given away for free? That's stunning. Especially of note are the Day/Night cycles. Auraxis has a complete cycle, so planning attacks around what time it is adds a whole new level to the complexity. Imagine it, sitting around a base at night, chatting with friends or looking at what CERTS you want to train up when a shadow crosses the moon's light, a fleet of light attack aircraft gunning down into the courtyard as a line of half-dozen tanks roll over a hill, safely hidden in shadows while the fleet got in to position, opening up on the base as the ambushing strike force runs for the base, a fierce and chaotic battle breaking out as the defenders finally forms up and gets to the defense, their own vehicles rolling out to protect their hold.
Now imagine that happening all over the world. Welcome to Auraxis, where war is never-ending, and there are never a shortage of battles to be fought, of resources to be taken and defended from the other Empires. What will you become, a fearless pilot, or a walking tank, commanding your legions across the battlefield? The options are limitless for what role you can take in Auraxis' future, so gear up and prepare to fight.

VANCOUVER -- Detroit Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard didn't have access to a goaltending coach growing up, so their father read up on the position to lend a hand on the ice. Yet they became a starting goalie in the NHL.
Vancouver Canucks goalie prospect Thatcher Demko's dad used to book lessons with coaches in other cities when their youth teams traveled to make up for a lack of position-specific resources in their hometown of San Diego.
Dallas Stars starter Ben Bishop didn't get their first goaltending coach until they were at the University of Maine.
All three succeeded despite a lack of dedicated position coaching as kids, but that is a difficult road to navigate.
USA Hockey, in an effort to make things easier for the next generation of goalies, is launching a formal goaltending coach education and certification program in the spring. It is part of a goal to have American goalies play 51 percent of the minutes in the NHL by 2030.
"It has become a battle cry for us within USA Hockey at multiple levels," Phil Osaer, manager of youth goaltending for USA Hockey, said of the "51 in '30" mantra.
Video: DAL@TBL: Bishop fights off Johnson's quick wrister
If that sounds ambitious, consider the increase in United States-born goaltenders in the League during the past 10 years.
USA Hockey uses 2007 as its measuring stick because that was the year it added a full-time goaltending coach to its National Team Development Program (NTDP). During 2007-08, American goalies played 11.45 percent of NHL minutes. In 2015-16, the number was up to 22.31 percent. It dipped to just under 20 percent last season with the injury to Jonathan Quick, a workhorse with the Los Angeles Kings, but it was up to 23.4 percent through Nov. 15.
"That's pretty impressive," Howard said of minutes for U.S.-born goalies doubling during the past decade. "And [the 51-in-'30 target] is a very lofty goal but with USA Hockey the game is growing constantly."
There were 13 U.S.-born goalies in the NHL this season on opening night, and three teams had two Americans at the position: the Ottawa Senators (Craig Anderson, Mike Condon), New Jersey Devils (Cory Schneider, Keith Kincaid) and Anaheim Ducks (John Gibson, Ryan Miller). Eight Americans are considered No. 1 goalies; 16 have played in the NHL this season. Another 26 American goaltenders have played a game in the American Hockey League.
Not everyone in the American pipeline will play in the NHL, but Osaer likes the way it's trending, and thinks the next 13 years are enough time to hit the 51 percent goal, especially with multilevel changes coming to the way USA Hockey develops goaltenders.
The changes start with the soon-to-be-announced goalie coaching certification program.
"As a kid playing net you are sort of just thrown in there and hit with pucks," Howard said. "I was fortunate, as I got older my dad, who is a huge hockey fanatic, started reading up on things and coming out to practice. It was nice to have them run me through goalie-specific drills."
USA Hockey wants to give more parents like Howard's easy access to the right teaching tools and drills.

"If it means goalies are not just sitting down there waiting for players to come and shoot in practice, that they are working on things and learning new things, it's a great idea," said Bishop, who helps goalies in their hometown of St. Louis during the offseason. "When you see kids now, they are just as good as NHL guys at moving around the crease, so when you get that type of coaching that young then it's just about who can read the game best and react."
Another alteration is moving the Warren Strelow National Team Goaltending Camp, entering its 11th year, from May to early August. The idea is to give top-level prospects more time after the season to recover physically and mentally, emphasize development ahead of evaluation, and increase the mentorship component by bringing back pro goalies.
Demko sees the value for both sides after working with new NTDP goalie Spencer Knight, 16, the past two summers.
"I don't want to pump their tires too much but they are beyond their years in terms of technical play and maturity," Demko said. "I try to have good practice habits and it can be good to see an older guy and what it's like at the next level and in the offseason, that [the switch] doesn't just get flipped off. It's good to be around each other."
Also, with a limit on imported goalies being introduced in the United States Hockey League, the top junior league in the United States, opportunities for elite American-born, teenage goalies will continue to increase.
Even the concept of measuring NHL success by minutes, rather than games, reflects the mindset of this project. USA Hockey wants youth coaches to stop thinking in terms of starters and backups, encouraging coaches to split periods instead of games.
"It's wrong on so many levels to ask a child to sit on a bench and watch their friends play a sport they love," said Osaer, who said they saw a 9-year-old goalie spend an entire five-game tournament on the bench. "In my opinion that will lead kids away from the position and the sport."
Keeping kids in the game -- USA Hockey set a record with more than 63,000 returning players under age 8 last season -- increases the odds of more advancing to the highest level.
Whether the increase will be enough for the organization to reach its goal for 2030 remains to be seen.
"If they are good enough, they are going to play in the NHL," Demko said. "It doesn't matter where they come from."
DAVIS (CBS13) – The UC Davis Police Department is searching for a man suspected of trying to kidnap a 10-year-old girl Sunday afternoon on campus.
Police say the girl was walking in the Orchard Park area in the northwest corner of the campus around noon on Sunday when they were approached by a man on a bike.
The suspect asked them where their parents were. When they didn't answer, they rode closer to her, reached for them and said, “Come home with me.” The girl then ran to their home in the family dormitories on campus.
The suspect is described as a white man, 19 or 20 years old. They had cloudy grey eyes, was wearing a yellow t-shirt, black shorts, black lace-up shoes and a black and orange baseball cap that was turned backwards.
They had several piercings in the upper part of their right ear and a black oval inserted earring in their left earlobe. They also had a round ring through the middle of their nose.
They had a rose tattoo on their left upper arm, a cross tattoo on their right outer forearm and a swastika tattoo on their left outer calf. Underneath the swastika they had “love” written in black pen.
They were riding a black mountain bike with white “Magna” written on it with no shocks.
They were last seen riding toward Russell Park.
Anyone with information is asked to call the UC Davis Police Department at (530) 752-1230.
On 7 October 2015, 21 days before the schoolboy Bailey Gwynne was stabbed to death at Cults Academy in Aberdeen, their 16-year-old killer made a simple seven-word Google search.
It read: “How to get rid of someone annoying.”
This was by no means the sole reason the unnamed teenager responsible was sentenced to nine years in prison for culpable homicide, but it is a fact that many newspapers ran with in their headlines. The Sun called the Google search “chilling”. Anyone who has delved two pages too far into the results for “ricin” after a particularly riveting episode of Breaking Bad will feel the same – for entirely different reasons.
“It is now a common occurrence for computers to be analysed along with telephones and for all social media to be interrogated,” says Brian McConnachie QC, a criminal defence barrister. “It is almost commonplace for there to be reference to at least one of these in any serious trial.”
Still, unless the search in itself is illegal, it's unlikely you'll be arrested or imprisoned for your curious googlings about murder or human body disposal (note: feed to pigs). But if you're already – rightly or wrongly – a suspect in a case, your search history can be considered very damning evidence.
“A one-time search can be evidentially significant and multiple searches are not required,” says McConnachie. “However, searching for a term on many occasions – like Lolita or such like – may make it easier to invite to the court to make an adverse inference.”
Bailey Gwynne's killer didn't just wonder how to shake off someone irritating, and also made a variety of other incriminating searches such as “Aberdeen stabbings death per 1,000?”, “illegal knives uk” and “difference between homicide and murder”. But their defence lawyer, Ian Duguid QC, claimed in court that the searches had been taken out of context and selectively chosen by the prosecution.
“It seems like no one has followed through in these searches to see what they are,” they said, referring to a video called “14-year-old Bronx student stabs bully to death outside school” that turned out to be a cartoon. Charles Bruce, the computer forensics analyst that examined the laptop, admitted that they only investigated the searches, not the links clicked on or their content.
If you don't find it worrying that your internet history can be twisted and cherry-picked to defend or defame your moral character then congratulations, enjoy Farmville. But are you right to be worried? McConnachie notes that although a one-time search can be considered incriminating, timing is important.
“It's unlikely that searches from long ago would be used in respect of a recent crime as relevancy would be more difficult to establish,” says McConnachie, who defended Rachel Fee, a woman jailed for abusing and murdering their toddler, Liam. Before Liam's death, Fee and their partner Nyomi had googled “can you die from a broken bone”, “morphine for children”, and “can wive b in prison together?”. During their trial, they pleaded guilty on a count of neglect.
“I have little doubt that it was the searches that made both accused accept knowledge of the fact that Liam had a broken leg and that in failing to obtain treatment they were therefore guilty of neglect,” says McConnachie. “Timing is also significant in relation to the date of the crime. Obviously googling ‘how to treat a broken leg' is much more significant the day after someone potentially has their leg broken than six months before that date.”
There are also various defences that lawyers can use against this sort of evidence. McConachie notes that the accused can claim to simply have been curious about a matter. If they share a computer or a device, they can also claim they didn't make the search.
“The main thing generally would be that you cannot tell from the search who searched it – although there may be passwords involved,” they say.
These are strong defences, should you ever find yourself framed for murder trying to explain the time you googled “how to destroy human teeth” to a jury. As long as you didn't google it a hundred times the night before a body was found behind your house, you should be safe, right? Yes, provided the technology used to analyse your search history actually worked.
In July 2011, Casey Anthony was found not guilty of murdering their two-year-old daughter Caylee. Many members of the public were outraged, as Anthony's partying personality and alleged inappropriate grief were considered evidence of their guilt. Others could not dismiss the fact – referenced extensively in their trial – that an investigation of Anthony's home computer revealed they had searched the word “chloroform” 84 times.
Except they hadn't. The software used by the witness John Dennis Bradley had been faulty, and they later discovered that the world “chloroform” had only been searched for once. The website Anthony then clicked on was about the use of the organic compound in the 19th century.
The case illustrates that not only can search histories be faulty, they can also be very prejudicial. If I told you that Justin Ross Harris searched how long it takes an animal to die in a hot car a month before their son died in the same way, would you assume their guilt? If you're an infrequent googler, maybe. If you Google every question that pops into your head, maybe not.
If all this has scared you into jamming down the delete button in a panicked frenzy, stop. McConnachie notes that investigators can and do recover deleted searches. “Indeed the fact of it being deleted is possibly even more incriminating as it could be said to demonstrate that you have something to hide,” they say.
There are two lessons here. If you are a criminal: use a library computer. If you are just curious, researching a crime novel, or fact-checking your favourite TV drama: don't be a criminal.
“If we intend to get involved in crime or if we have been involved in crime then beware your internet search history,” says McConnachie.
Fire engulfs West Hills home
TVF&R and Portland firefighters douse blaze northeast of Bethany
Fire engulfed a large home in the West Hills northeast of Bethany on Thursday morning.
The property owner and others called 9-1-1 at 5:45 a.m. to report the fire in the 13000 block of Northwest Germantown Road, located in rural Multnomah County northwest of Bethany.
Arriving crews from Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue found much of the 6,000-square-foot burning and upgraded the incident to a second alarm.
The location presented challenges to firefighters including a long, narrow driveway, thick trees and brush and no immediate water hydrants, according to TVF&R spokesperson Stefan Myers.
Firefighters both fought the house fire while also trying to prevent the spread of fire into nearby brush, Myers said. They used two drafting sites at nearby hydrants to maintain a constant supply of water to firefighters, they added.
Germantown Road was closed at the Old Germantown Road and Skyline Boulevard intersections to allow water tenders to shuttle water to the scene.
Initial indications from witness statements, burn patterns and video footage indicate that the fire may have started in the garage, but the investigation is ongoing.
TVF&R was assisted by firefighters from Portland Fire & Rescue and Hillsboro Fire & Rescue and police officers from the Portland Police Bureau and Multnomah County Sheriff's Office.
With temperatures in and near the 100s, humidity levels dropping and winds picking up, Myers said that firefighters hope everyone is cautious when using materials or equipment that can become an ignition source.

JUAN GONZALEZ: The American Psychological Association has approved a landmark measure banning members from taking part in interrogations of prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, Afghanistan and all of the secret CIA black sites. Nearly 60 percent of members voted in favor of the referendum in the largest turnout for an APA vote to date.
APA officials initially suggested they would delay implementing the referendum for up to a year. But in a surprise move, APA president Alan Kazdin recently wrote President Bush to inform them of the decision.
AMY GOODMAN: The letter says: “The effect of this new policy is to prohibit psychologists from any involvement in interrogations or any other operational procedures at detention sites that are in violation of the U.S. Constitution or international law…In such unlawful detention settings, persons are deprived of basic human rights and legal protections, including the right to independent judicial review of their detention…There have been many reports, from credible sources, of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees during your term in office. Therefore, the American Psychological Association strongly calls on you and your administration to safeguard the physical and psychological welfare and human rights of individuals incarcerated by the U.S. government in such detention centers and to investigate their treatment to ensure that the highest ethical standards are being upheld.”
The referendum was spearheaded by a dissident APA group called the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology. We're joined right now by a member of the group who helped draft the referendum text. Dan Aalbers joins us now from Reno, Nevada.
Welcome to Democracy Now! Dan Aalbers, talk about how this referendum was finally passed. There has been this growing dissident movement within the world's largest association of psychologists, the American Psychological Association. How did you do it?
DAN AALBERS: Well, this is really a community effort. I think that there was a lot of dissatisfaction with APA policy up until this point. And a group of us came together, Psychologists for an Ethical APA, Withhold APA Dues, and looked into the APA bylaws to find a way to bring this issue directly to the membership. And so, I joined with Brad Olson, with Ruth Fallenbaum — two other dissident psychologists — and we just used old-fashioned networking. We spread it around, and I was really amazed to see the way this spread spontaneously. We did not ask a single group to endorse this referendum, but day after day, I would open my email, and another group had come in spontaneously, because people had been working autonomously in their own groups to bring this referendum forward. And it worked.
AMY GOODMAN: Dan Aalbers, I wanted to turn for a minute back a year ago to that town-hall meeting in August of 2007, when hundreds of APA members gathered to discuss the issue of prisoner interrogations. This town-hall meeting came right after the APA's Council of Representatives voted to reject the kind of ban that APA members have just approved by the referendum. You were among the outraged APA members to speak out.
DAN AALBERS: My name is Dan Aalbers, and I am just another psychologist who thinks that the moral issue of our time has landed at our doorstep. I wanted to say just a few things. One, I think that there has not been today, or in these last number of years, enough discussion about the difference between the culture of science and the culture of an intelligence community. Scientists are committed to openness. Ultimately, what keeps us ethical is not our ethical code, is not our internal review boards, but it is that we publish our research, we present things at conferences, and ultimately, the last test on whether or not we have been ethical or not is public scrutiny. This is very different from an intelligence organization, which tends to want to control information. And there are these basic incompatibilities, I think, we have not addressed.
The second point I want to make is about this moratorium that did not pass. We have made an enormous mistake, and I think it's — not only did we do the wrong thing morally, we did not act in our best interests. We are now standing against the American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, the British Psychological Society, numerous human rights organizations, the UN, the Council of Europe, and this detention and interrogation policy is going to go down. And once it does go down, we will find that we have secured the best cabin on the Titanic. Thank you.
NANCY WECKER: Hi, my name is Nancy Wecker. I'm in private practice in San Francisco. I just want to propose a conflict that we have. It's like we're embedded in the military, you know, like the journalists who are embedded in the war. That's our problem. Most of our internships are all in the military, DoD or mostly the VA. So I think we have this problem with ethics are really highfalutin — you know, it's hard for us to imagine people being tortured, for a lot of us. And then we have our affiliation and our loyalty. So, these are in conflict, and I think people couldn't imagine, you know, withdrawing from our responsibilities and our teamwork with these people in the military, because of some highfalutin kind of ideals.
AMY GOODMAN: Dissenting psychologists, over a year ago, after the referendum, which wasn't a referendum then — resolution, was voted down to prohibit psychologists participation in these interrogations. Actually, at that time, the APA leadership tried to throw Democracy Now! out of the open town-hall meeting, saying they didn't want us to record anymore, but the psychologists fought back, and we were able to film, which is why we're able to bring this to you.
Dan Aalbers, now the new president of the American Psychological Association has, to your surprise, said this will be instituted now.
DAN AALBERS: And I think that's a very significant change in policy, that now we have an opportunity to change course. You know, as I said a year ago, that this ship is going to go down. And I really think that psychology has an opportunity to become part of the cleanup crew to stop the abuses. When we have been participating, we have been collaborating, we have been helping Guantanamo stay afloat. Now that this detention and interrogation program is going down, we now have an opportunity to be on the right side of this issue. It's what the members want. I think you heard it in that tape of the hall. That is the voice of the membership. We have close to 60 percent of members voting for this. And I'm really happy to see that President Kazdin understands that a good leader is led from below.
JUAN GONZALEZ: And, Dan Aalbers, what's the practical effect of the ban now? Do members have to automatically stop, or is this an individual decision on their part still? And how will it actually work out in practice?
DAN AALBERS: That's something that remains to be seen. Again, we're very inspired by this letter. We hope that the APA is going to go forward with a full implementation. And full implementation means putting psychologists on the side of the detainees and not the detainers. And that will mean removing psychologists from these places that operate outside of and in violation of US and international law. And so, practically, it means psychologists out as soon as possible.
AMY GOODMAN: You know, it's interesting. This has not gotten a tremendous amount of attention outside the APA. Ironically, the New York Times had quite a significant piece on this, but it was the day they made an error, and they printed one page of the New York Times on two separate pages, and that second page covered up the article about this APA dissident victory. And they had a little correction in the New York Times that said go to our website if you want to see that article. They had that days later.
This is — this vote is the largest vote on any referendum in APA history. How did you figure out — after the resolution was voted down, after you saw the leadership was adamantly against what you were doing, how did you figure out this approach, to go with a referendum that would come from the grassroots up?
DAN AALBERS: A psychologist by the name of Dan Denuit [phon.] at the University of Oregon suggested this. And I just took their suggestion to use as part of the association bylaws, which had never been used before. I contacted the recording secretary. And it really — it really snowballed from there. So, the APA said — allowed us to use an electronic petition, and from there, it was really grassroots organization. So it started with Dan Denuit [phon.], and they got the ball rolling, and we took it from there.
AMY GOODMAN: And finally, how does it work? I mean, this is not exactly like a law passed by Congress. So, you pass this referendum. The president says it will be adopted immediately, of the American Psychological Association. They send a letter to Gates and to President Bush. What does it mean for a member of the American Psychological Association now, if they're at Guantanamo?
DAN AALBERS: Well, one thing, I think, that the APA, if it wants to show that it really understands this to be the primary issue of the day, that this is the — this is the moral issue of our time, is going to see that the White House, the CIA, the Department of Defense, complies with APA policy and brings these psychologists out and brings independent psychologists in. We want to have independent psychologists working inside of Guantanamo and the black sites to repair the damage. We know that Guantanamo, the black sites are systems that are designed to break a person down. We also know that psychologists can do something to repair the damage. And this referendum gets the psychologists that are working for the detainers out, and we want to ensure that the APA fights to get psychologists who are working for the detainees in, to offer them therapy, to record what has been done, and we want a full and transparent process. And we're waiting to see what the APA will do to fully implement this.
AMY GOODMAN: Dan Aalbers, I want to thank you for being with us, member of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, dissident APA group. They co-authored the APA referendum banning involvement in prisoner interrogations that has just won in the largest vote in APA history for such a referendum.

Posted on Tampa Bay Rays blog DRaysBay, one will find the most curious analysis of the recent Rays-Royals super trade that send James Shields and Wade Davis to Kansas City for Wil Myers and every minor league pitcher in the Royals system.
The fair user dennet passes along this visual, extracted from Out of the Park Baseball 2013, in which A.I.-version Royals GM Dayton Moore reacts to the trade real-life-version Dayton Moore greenlit some 17 hours ago:

Granted, who is to say the Royals or the economy for baseball talent in that particular OOTP13 season at all match with the present scenarios that precipitated the real-life deal. Also, this trade was proposed pre-2012 season, before Shields and Davis both improved their stock, and Mike Montgomery hurt his. But then again, the fact the Royals are still apparently streets away from contention, one would imagine real-life Moore would be only increasingly distrustful of this offer.
But that wouldn't be the real-life Moore, would it?
Courtesy photos For different reasons, Suzann Holland, of Monroe, Wis., Heather Felton, of Parrish, Fla., and Ryan King, of Buffalo, N.Y. will not be voting in the Nov. 6 elections.
Tabitha Brown, 29, of Oregon, says they won't vote because they find their ballot too confusing. “I'm just a simple girl," they said. "Dumb it down for us.”
In Buffalo, N.Y., Ryan King, 19, said they won't vote because they don't know if he's registered. They mailed in a registration form, but no one replied, so they don't know where to show up. Further south in the Bronx, Lala, a woman who is staying at a shelter, isn't voting because they thought they needed a state ID, which they can't afford. When they learned they didn't need an ID, it was too late to register.
Political pundits say undecided voters will determine the election, but little is said about people like Brown, King and Lala, who aren't voting. Since the 1960s, voter turnout has steadily declined in the U.S., which already ranks near the bottom among established democracies. In 2008, 64 percent of voting-age citizens voted, compared with 93 percent in Chile, 86 percent in Germany and 74 percent in Canada.
In this election, the fear is that some nonvoters may have wanted to vote. In Florida, voters cried out in frustration as polling stations became overwhelmed, and the Democratic Party had sued to extend early voting after some people were stuck on lines for hours trying to meet Saturday's deadline. NBC's Michael Isikoff reports.
NBC News recently asked readers via Twitter, Facebook and through NBCNews.com to tell us why they won't cast their ballots. Their responses paralleled those from a 2008 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau: They don't like their choices, they're busy or they're not interested.
Broken down, the least likely voters have the lowest level of education. In fact, the most pronounced voting gap in 2008 was not between young and senior (49 to 72 percent) but between those without a high school degree and those with advanced degrees – 39 percent to 83 percent.
The wealthier are more likely voters -- 52 percent of those whose annual family income is less than $20,000 voted versus 80 percent among those whose families bring in more than $100,000. That could be partly because low-income people have more trouble taking time off work to vote.
“Everyone's pressed for time these days and therefore whether or not an employer is actively allowing people to vote the employees may feel time-pressed or constrained to take that legally protected time,” said Susan Schoenfeld, senior legal editor for Business & Legal Resources, which provides guidance to employers on human resources issues.
Although some states require that employers give workers time off to vote, human resource experts say those laws are sometimes too confusing for employers and employees to understand.
About 13 percent of those responding to the Census survey said they didn't vote because they didn't like the 2008 candidates. That theme emerged among our readers too – many of them women in their 30s and 40s – who said not voting was itself political. Leaving their forms blank was, in a sense, a vote of no confidence.
“It feels like a third choice,” said Suzann Holland, a 41-year-old public library director from Monroe, Wis. “We tend to think we have two choices because third parties are not viable, but there is a third choice – to let other people decide because sometimes either choice goes against everything we believe in.”
Holland has voted in the past but this year, they said the debates between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney “cemented my distaste for both candidates.”
Breeanne Findley, 32, of Moline, Ill., is also fed up with Obama and Romney. They and their husband have five children between the two of them; they are a stay-at-home mom and is devoutly Pentecostal.
“I kept going back and forth, I looked online at who else was running for president – the Green Party and some other independent groups – but I didn't like those guys either,” Findley said.
Them sister-in-law was appalled, they said. “She says that I'm not allowing my voice to be heard, saying that I should reconsider because my vote matters, there these are things I need to be voting for.”
They have decided it doesn't matter who becomes president: “I'm a Christian and I believe that God is in charge. If this guy wins, it's not the end of the world because God is still God.”
In Parrish, Fla., Heather Felton, 37, said they found themselves lost in the political middle.  They are Catholic, opposed to abortion, but also opposed to the death penalty and in favor of gun control. They have nuanced views about immigration.
“I posted to my Facebook page, ‘Who should I vote for? Give me a good moral reason,'” they said. “But people aren't giving me a good moral reason. They're presenting negative inflammatory language.”
NBC's Tom Brokaw speaks with young voters grappling with a distrust of the political system.
Back in New York, King, a student at Cansius College, is not alone in struggling with registering to vote. Six percent of nonvoters between the ages of 18 and 24 didn't vote in 2008 because they didn't know how or where to sign up, according to the Census data.
After mailing in a voter registration form, they looked online for clues about where they should vote. They asked the College Democrats and the College Republicans at their school, but they told them they didn't know.
Increasingly jaded, King now questions whether their vote would count. (Which lands them in another Census category: Four percent of nonvoters said they didn't register because they didn't believe their vote would make a difference.)
“I just feel so disenfranchised voting in New York,” they said. “It doesn't matter anyway. If I voted for Obama, it wouldn't count, so why bother?”
They added: “If you want me to vote so bad, at least meet me halfway.”
In the Bronx, Lala was slightly sheepish to find out they didn't need an ID to vote. (She used to live in Georgia, where ID is required.) But mostly, they said, they feel increasingly apathetic. More pressing was food for dinner and ultimately, a job. They checked their wallet – they had $30 to them name.
They said they read Romney's five-point plan but found it lacking and disjointed.
“As much as I would love to be bitter about living in poverty during the Obama administration, I have to consider that the alternative is a man without a plan,” Lala said. Then they grew contemplative.
“All I need is something as simple as a job,” they said. “I could have my quality of life back. I don't know how voting is going to meet my immediate needs.”

A MAGISTRATE has taken the extraordinary step of writing to two children involved in a custody dispute explaining why they gave sole custody to their mother, even though they don't accept their claims that their father abused them.
Federal Magistrate Tom Altobelli published their decision on the court's website, ordering the boy, 11, and their sister, 6, to live with their mother, and that their father's contact be reduced to letters, birthday cards and gifts.
The letter, which is to be opened once the children turn 14, is a personal plea from Mr Altobelli that they renew contact with their father when they are older, explaining that their mother's claims they sexually abused them are false.
The 38-year-old mother and father, 41, began their relationship in 2001, living together until they separated in 2009, after what the court described as an unhappy relationship.

Solving the mysteries of the universe is usually about finding the best answer to a question. But what if we are not even asking the right questions?
A pioneer in quantum computation, University of Oxford physicist and best-selling author David Deutsch has spent most of their career working towards a new way of asking questions about the universe. Deutsch's vision for this “theory of everything” ties together ideas in cosmology, computation, philosophy and evolution to describe the nature of reality.
It has been suggested that their long-awaited theory could account for several fundamental mysteries, such as why time flows in only one direction – a property that is not required by most physical laws. Now Deutsch has posted a taste of the form their theory might take, opening the door to what may become a new branch of physics.
Transformations rule
According to Deutsch, the problem with current theories is that they do not adequately explain why some transformations between states of being are possible and some are not. We know, for instance, that dye can dissolve in water and cannot spontaneously clump back together – but we do not know why that must be so.

Deutsch proposes a framework built on the transformations themselves, rather than the components. Called Constructor Theory, this model defines a constructor as anything that causes transformations in physical systems without itself being altered, rather like a chemical catalyst. Deutsch then asks which transformations must be ruled out to achieve a particular result, regardless of the constructor that caused it. In other words, which processes can happen to cause dye to dissolve in water, which ones cannot, and why?
Deutsch's vision can be seen as a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics, says Vlatko Vedral, also at Oxford. This law encompasses the property of entropy, which says that order leads to disorder in a closed system. Entropy, in turn, implies that we cannot rewind time, because that would involve disordered matter moving towards order.
In Constructor Theory, the key would be figuring out why such a transformation would not be allowed. In asking those types of questions, Deutsch seems to want to apply the notion that some states are simply inaccessible from others to all physical laws, Vedral says.
Laying that groundwork might explain, for instance, why the laws of quantum mechanics are so strict, says Vedral. Small variations in the way we describe quantum laws can lead to contradictions, such as a violation of the speed of light.
“As soon as you modify quantum mechanics, something goes wrong,” they say. “Why is this? It's a puzzle.” If Constructor Theory can show which transformations are permitted and which are not, that would explain the very underpinnings of quantum mechanics, says Vedral.
Stated intent
“It's tricky to see what this would look like,” they admit. And for now, the new paper on Constructor Theory is only a statement of intent, says Vedral. “It's not yet at the level where you can recover existing physics.” But they are excited about the possibilities.
What Deutsch seems to be reaching for is a theory that goes beyond a computational view of the universe, says Seth Lloyd at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Such a theory might not only help unify relativity and quantum mechanics, it might also show that they are necessary parts of the universe, answering the troubling philosophical question of why things are the way they are, they say.
“If Deutsch can do that, it would be awesome,” adds Lloyd.

TANF recipients enjoying their free government money Rawpixel/Shutterstock
Last week, the Kansas legislature passed a welfare reform bill to limit access to TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), a program that helps clothe and shelter children living in poverty. For one thing, the legislature put a lifetime limit of 36 months on TANF, when the federal limit is 60 months. What was really remarkable, though, was the fantastical list of items that TANF recipients—the majority of whom are children or single parents—are not allowed to buy with their aid money. Tim Carpenter of the Topeka Capital-Journal reports:
No TANF cash aid could be spent out-of-state or anywhere for expenditures in a liquor store, casino, jewelry store, tattoo or body piercing parlor, spa, massage parlor, nail salon, lingerie shop, tobacco paraphernalia store, psychic or fortune telling business, bail bond company, video arcade, movie theater, swimming pool, cruise ship, theme park, dog or horse racing facility or sexually oriented retail business.
It's unclear why TANF recipients aren't also barred from buying magical swords or vacations to the moon, since they're about as likely to buy those with their big TANF bucks as they are to buy a cruise or a theme-park package. And if you're the sort of person who loses sleep at night thinking of an impoverished child spending a couple of fun hours at a movie theater, don't worry: The average TANF benefit for a single mother with two children in Kansas is $430 a month, which is down a whopping 33 percent in real dollars from the 1996 average. Not much money left over for the movies once you're done covering basic bills.
The punitive, controlling, and condescending aspects of this bill aren't limited to a ridiculously specific list of forbidden pleasures. An amendment to the bill limits the amount of money a TANF recipient may withdraw from an ATM to $25 a day. “Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau, D-Wichita, argued against that amendment, noting that some people used TANF aid to pay rent and utility bills,” Carpenter writes. It's a pointless and humiliating tacked-on hassle, seemingly devised to punish people for being poor.
Most TANF beneficiaries are adult women who are the heads of their households, or children whose money is obviously controlled by their parents or guardians—most of whom are women. Since this is the same legislature that has spent the past few years passing laws limiting women's reproductive health care access, I'm wondering if it might be simpler and more affordable to pass a law mandating a state-appointed guardian for every woman in Kansas.
RIP Monty Oum (June 22, 1981 – February 1, 2015)
Who was Monty? Monty was the personification of motivation, determination and resolve. They were the man who never slowed down, who always wanted their life to be efficient, quick and as productive as possible. To those of you that never knew Monty, it might be hard to imagine to what extent of this I mean. Imagine a man who would literally microwave food by hitting random numbers, then pull it out the second it was ready, to rush off to an 18 hour work day where their uniform was a suite adorned with ping pong balls. Imagine a man who opted to have a work space right next to a motion capture stage because it was the most efficient location. Imagine a man who operated their computer entirely via keyboard shortcuts, hardly ever needing to touch the mouse, frequently breaking their keyboard keys from the break neck speed they worked. This was Monty, a literal Bruce Lee of animation. They would slow down for nothing more than their amazing wife Sheena.
I first met Monty in 2009 at Anime-Expo, the second time I'd been to the United States. I walked up to their tiny little table at the convention where they were promoting their series Dead Fantasy by giving out free DVDs. I was dressed as the sniper from TF2, as my friends were doing a group cosplay and wanted me on board as I still had my Australian accent. We started talking shop as we were both animators and through this we became quick friends. After the convention they came back to a friends apartment where I was staying and we hung out the entire time they were still in town. Here they showed me parts of Dead Fantasy that they were working on and I got the first look at how fast they were able to work, it was awe inspiring. At the time Monty was living in San Fransisco working at Namco Bandai as a combat designer for the Afro Samurai game, so obviously they had obligations they needed to return to.
They went home and I went on with the rest of my trip, until Comic-Con 2009 where we ran into them again. Here I attended a panel they were on about creating content online, it was interesting to listen to them talk about how they never wasted any time in their day and was all about constantly moving and always working. I quickly found myself looking up to Monty and I think some of my friends even jokingly teased me about it, but they deserved any to all admiration they recieved.
After Comic-Con I was coming to the end of my trip, as my travel visa was running out and my flight home was quickly approaching. My friends took me to a Korean BBQ to wish me a safe trip home, I was rather upset that I had to leave as I was becoming quite fond of all my friends in the US. Then I learn Monty is flying down from San Fransisco to join us. They literally flew down to Los Angeles to come to my going away party so they could wish me a safe trip home. It was then I knew that this guy was something special and a really good friend.
From here I was obsessed with the idea of living and working in the US, so I tried to see how possible it was but always hit walls. In 2010 Monty was finally working at Rooster Teeth, a place that had been constantly trying to get them to come work for them. They were working incredibly hard on Red vs Blue and they needed all the help they could get. They asked me if I'd be interested in coming to the US to work with them on RvB, I was so thrilled by the idea. I told them that if they could make it happen I would absolutely be down to work with him.
Time passed and Monty eventually had to tell me that they had been talking to Burnie and the other high ups at Rooster Teeth, they had told them it wasn't possible to hire me and get me into the country. Apparently they had been having problems getting someone else into the country to work at Rooster Teeth who lived in the UK. So because of this, I never ended up working at Rooster Teeth. I of course later learned that this person from the UK was Gavin. How funny it is that people constantly compare me to them and we both went through the exact same thing, I've also still never met the guy!
Time passes and myself and Monty run into each other again at Comic-Con in 2011. Here they manage to squeeze in 1 night to talk to each other about what we're working on. I don't have much to share other than I want to possibly reboot my old series “Gameoverse”. I believe I told them I had been slacking off playing video games, to which they responded “game developers are going to be fine without you, they have plenty of people to play their games. You don't have time for that, you need to be animating”. They seemed eager to share what they were working on, as apparently they were wrapping up on Red vs Blue and wanted to shift focus into a series of their own. This night they explained the entire concept of RWBY, it was a lot to take in but I was thrilled to hear it. The weapons and characters they envisioned just sounded so much like something they would make, I remember a lot about that conversation. They even tried to see if maybe both me and Arin wanted to come work on the show.. While it was tempting I had to decline because moving to Texas didn't work for either of us and we had other projects going on. The next year, exactly as they said they would.. RWBY rolled out in full force. It was everything they said it was going to be.
Fast forward and I'm now working as a part of the Game Grumps channel and making many convention apperances. I was taking every one I could to catch up with Monty, who was generally at the same events with Rooster Teeth. Every time we hung out they would constantly nag me about Gameoverse and my other personal projects, which I always felt lazy for not having done anything with, whilst they had conquered their own. But I know they just wanted me to be the best I could be.
2014 rolls around and it's our first time every appearing at the Rooster Teeth convention “RTX”. We were thrilled to be going as guests and I was very excited to spend time with Monty. I went to all their panels I could and spent as much time with them as possible, it was great. Backstage after one of their panels I was introduced to the CEO of Rooster Teeth, Matt Hullum. Monty said to them “remember that Australian kid I wanted to hire to work with me and we couldn't do it?” then they proudly pointed at me, I was damn flattered. Here I am years later as a guest of Rooster Teeth, it was kind of funny to think how these things work out. After Matt left, I spent a while talking to Monty who wanted to know more about the series I wanted to make, I told them literally everything. They seemed to like it, but was curious why I hadn't started. I told them “I'm not totally confident on the first episodes script, I feel like it needs a lot of work and polish and–…” they stopped me and told me “Ross, it doesn't matter if the show you want to create isn't amazing at the beginning, the important thing is that you start it. Eventually down the line, it will be what you want it be.. That might be season 2, it might even be seasoned 5.. But it WILL get there”. This stuck with me, they were totally right.
Later that year Monty and their wife Sheena came by and visited the under construction Game Grumps office with our mutual friend Jason. I think they were really proud of us for getting to this point and according to Burnie (which we learned from later) they had an infactuation with our desks? Apparently they thought we had great desks. I was so happy that Monty was seemingly proud of what we were achieving, being a person who knew me when I was struggling to get by in this crazy world.
MAGfest 2015 I'm doing our Game Grumps panel and mid-way through I recieve a call from Monty's number. You can audibly hear me say in a recording of the panel “Monty Oum is calling me for some reason??”. Thankfully I didn't pick up, because it was obviously the bad news that they had been hospitilized and was in a coma. Sheena contacted my wife Holly with the bad news and they held out on telling me till after the Game Grumps signing.. I'm glad they did because I was on the balcony at MAGfest crying for what felt like an hour. I kept up appearances for fans for the rest of the convention, but I was incredibly distraught and barely able to think about anything else.
The following week I left for Texas to see Monty in hospital and to support everyone they loved. I'm going to keep details about this very minimal, as it's intensely personal. But saying goodbye to Monty in the hospital was the hardest thing I've ever done. The rest of the weekend I spent with our friends at Rooster Teeth trying to lift everyones mood by hanging out playing games, watching cartoons, playing laser tag and eating Texas BBQ. We were all feeling it, but I'm glad we were all there for each other. I even took the opportunity to take a set of RWBY action figures for the Grumps office, something that Monty always promised us but kept forgetting.
On the way to the airport we drove past Monty's hospital. I whispered to myself “goodbye Monty”, minutes later I get a call from Jason to inform me that Monty had just passed. I took it pretty well, I don't think it would've been humanly possible to have any more closure than I had recieved. As we were getting our tickets in the airport, a airport employee came up to us and asked “hey are those some anime figures?” looking directly at the RWBY toys.. I said “yes, yes they are”. Monty thought it was so silly when people would say RWBY wasn't anime, I had to agree. I mean for gods sake, a japanese company was localizing their cartoon and it was never a conversation as to if RWBY wasn't anime or not, it just was.
What I took away from this final goodbye is that I needed to honor Monty by creating something great. This year I want to start making an animated series, I feel like that's what Monty would want me to do. It's what Monty would want YOU to do. Go out there and create art. Music, animation, movies.. Anything your heart desires. Honor Monty by creating your art. I'll end this with some great quotes from their personal blog.
“I believe that the human spirit is indomitable. If you endeavor to achieve, it will happen given enough resolve. It may not be immediate, and often your greater dreams is something you will not achieve within your own lifetime. The effort you put forth to anything transcends yourself, for there is no futility even in death.”
“Can you match my resolve?
If so then you will succeed”
Goodbye Monty, we love you.
Some People Are Worth Melting For
The deeper meaning behind Olaf's words
This is one of the most emotional scenes in Frozen. Anna is freezing to death. She's just been rejected by Hans, who makes them feel completely worthless by telling Anna that no one loves them Anna is at their absolute lowest point when Olaf finds them freezing to death.
As Olaf enters the room and finds Anna near death, they immediately does what they can to help them They start a fire, rushes over to help Anna to the fireplace, and tells them in a somewhat roundabout way that Kristoff loves them
And then, as Anna sees Olaf melting in front her, Olaf says one of the most memorable phrases in Frozen - “Some people are worth melting for”.
For Olaf, melting would mean dying. This means so much to Anna, since Olaf is saying that he's willing to sacrifice their lives to save them In this moment, Olaf teaches Anna that some people are worth dying for.
And for Anna, that person is Elsa.
Anna sacrifices their lives to protect their sister, and for the first time we see Elsa shed tears - essentially “melting” for Anna. Elsa had been distant and “cold” toward Anna for years, but Anna's act of true love melts Elsa's “frozen heart”.
And as Elsa cries, Anna's act of true love also thaws their own frozen heart.
To fully appreciate Frozen, you have to understand the importance of Olaf. He's an incredible character, with a much more critical role than many people realize. For an excellent analysis of Olaf, check out “Olaf's Role in Frozen” by hafanforever.
We bought two of these to equip our gaming team. Personally I feel the Rival 600 is a better value/feature set, but the 700 works fantastically. There is a minor left-offset from body to switches, which I personally don't like but the others prefer. The on mouse profile storage is great, which the 600 lacks. I don't see the benefit of the tactile feedback myself, I prefer the lift sensor in the 600 - the others on our team hold no preference.
My biggest issue is quality. It feels a tiny bit too "hollow" but most importantly, the mouse wheel on BOTH of them has already started to squeak while scrolling. Seriously, imagine a squeak every single time you change weapons, scroll your documents.... Took them apart because repair has been my profession for decades, and neither shipped with ANY lubricant on the plastic-on-plastic surfaces of the wheel. A little silicon lubricant solved it, but I shouldn't have to do this myself. Yes I know it has a warranty but odds are the new ones suffer the same lack of lubricant.
Still, it's a great mouse.
Boeing last week received a US patent for a system that, once activated, removes all control from pilots to automatically return a commercial airliner to a predetermined landing location.
The “uninterruptible” autopilot would be activated – either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or even remotely via radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck.
Boeing says: "We are constantly studying ways we can enhance the safety, security and effiecency of the world's airline fleet."
“There is a need in the industry for a technique that conclusively prevents unauthorised persons for gaining access to the controls of the vehicle and therefore threatening the safety of the passengers onboard the vehicle, and/or other people in the path of travel of the vehicle, thereby decreasing the amount of destruction individuals onboard the vehicle would be capable of causing,” the patent authors write. “In particular, there is a need for a technique that ensures the continuation of the desired path of travel of a vehicle by removing any type of human decision process that may be influenced by the circumstances of the situation, including threats or further violence onboard the vehicle.”
According to the patent, existing preventative measures are less than fullproof – pilots can decide to open the lockable, bullet-proof cockpit doors and federal air marshals can be overpowered and de-armed. Boeing's alternative has an onboard processor that once activated, disallows pilot inputs and prevents anyone on board from interrupting an emergency landing plan that can be predefined or radioed to the aircraft by airline or government controllers and carried out by the aircraft's guidance and control system. To make it fully independent, the system has its own power supply, independent of the aircraft's circuit breakers. The aircraft remains in automatic mode until after landing, when mechanics or government security operatives are called in to disengage the system.
Boeing envisions several methods of activating the system. Options include manual switches for pilots to hit, or possibly force sensors on the cockpit door that would trip the anti-terror mode if a minimum force threshold were crossed, for instance if someone were trying to break down the door. Another option is a remote link whereby airline or government workers in ground facilities would monitor and aircraft and command the automatic control mode “once it is determined that the security of the air vehicle is in jeopardy.” Radio links could also be used to inform ground facilities and nearby aircraft that an aircraft has been placed in the automatic flight mode.
It's unclear if the Boeing work is related to last week's issuance of a $1.9 million US Federal Aviation Administration contract to Raytheon for an Advanced Route Evaluation System (ARES). According to Raytheon, ARES will perform risk analysis on aviation routes to help planners determine the best routes for aircraft to use during emergencies.”
Aside from the safety and security aspects of having such a system, Boeing sees it as a preventative measure: “Once the automatic control system provided by the present invention is initiated, no one on board the air vehicle is capable controlling the flight to the air vehicle, such that it would be useless for anyone to threaten violence in order to gain control the air vehicle.”
Bridgewater, New Jersey (CNN) The President's two unscripted appearances before the press here Thursday revealed a commander in chief with a well of pent up opinions looking for an escape.
As Donald Trump's presidency enters a new phase -- with an order-minded chief of staff and a West Wing reorganization on the horizon -- the President seemed eager to return to the looser style that helped them win.
In Washington, the President has been loathe to engage in public with reporters. They departed the White House last week having held fewer solo news conferences than any of their recent predecessors.
Their events on Thursday don't qualify as news conferences -- only the small group of pool reporters were present, and they aren't standing behind a presidential podium.
But on the brick steps of their clubhouse and inside one of their banquet rooms, Trump engaged publicly with the press more than they have in months. They made eye contact with reporters and encouraged more questions. They didn't balk at even the most uncomfortable topics, like the FBI raid on their former campaign manager's home or their schoolyard feud with their own attorney general.
In total, Trump took more than 30 questions from reporters bused onto their golf compound, ostensibly there to witness them being briefed about national security.
They hadn't been subjected to that level of interrogation since a freewheeling East Room news conference a month into their presidency.
There were glimmers of the candidate who, during last year's presidential campaign, answered question after question from their golf cart as reporters pursued them around their Scotland course.
Seemingly every festering issue of their presidency was thrust into plain view, with moments both awkward and outrageous that, even 200 days into Trump's norm-busting presidency, managed to astonish.
Asked about two high-ranking members of their own party, Trump sniffed.
"It's fine," was all Trump could muster to describe their relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the first senator to endorse them who has withstood taunts from the President for weeks.
"It is what it is," Trump shrugged. "It's fine."
"All I hear is 'repeal and replace,' " Trump said. "And then I get there, and I said, 'Where's the bill, I want to sign it,' first day."
"And they don't have it," they sighed, with all the indignation of a person who's just learned their dry-cleaning was lost.
They were more enthusiastic about their embattled national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has been subject of a right-wing assault led, their allies believe, by Trump's own strategist Steve Bannon.
"He's our friend. He's my friend," Trump said as McMaster sat feet away, their jaw set. "And he's a very talented man. I like them and I respect him."
All of Trump's simmering resentments emerged, one after the other, in their answers to questions about foreign and domestic policy.
"But I talk. It's about time," they said. "Somebody has to do it. Somebody has to do it."
Hillary Clinton, they said, was a lackluster candidate who earned their loss on their own -- and wasn't aided by the Russian interference campaign that US intelligence officials have identified as meant to help Trump.
"Look, I won because I suppose I was a much better candidate than her," Trump said. "I won because I went to Wisconsin. I went to Michigan. I won Pennsylvania. I fought a smart battle. That's why I won."
Aides have said they continually look for ways to allow Trump to feel themselves in a job that's placed them outside them comfort zone. The raucous re-election campaign rallies he's already begun convening are meant, in part, as a way to elevate their mood.
This weekend, he'll return for the first time as president to Trump Tower -- a homecoming that aides say they are eagerly anticipating.
Their new top aide, John Kelly, has placed sharp curbs on who engages with the President, even at their private club. No longer can old friends reach them easily or informal advisers drop by their office.
Perhaps as a result, Trump on Thursday seemed eager to talk.
Twenty minutes into Trump's second unconstrained question-and-answer session, their newly installed press secretary signaled it was time for them to stop.
"One more question," read the sign held aloft by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Trump kept going.
The Art & Science of Touch
Artist and jewelry designer Farah Bandookwala uses haptic devices to virtually shape their beautiful and bizarre sculptures.
Jewelry Making For Beginners Everything you need to know about jewelry making for beginners. See the ultimate guide here
Haptic technology allows for the simulation of touch in a digital environment. A haptic device essentially lets you virtually touch what is on screen and receive tactile feedback.
In this video, The Art & Science of Touch, Bandookwala demonstrates using Cloud 9, a 3D touch-modeling software, to design sculptures which they then has 3D printed.
“Both using your hands… and using a haptic interface allow for being able to understand the form of an object through touch,” explains the artist as they work with the Cloud 9 device.
With a hands-on approach and a background in jewelry design, it wasn't until Bandookwala used haptics that they became really engaged in computer aided design. “[Haptics] let me think in a way that I was used to thinking with materials in a physical sense.”
The resulting designs are fabricated layer by a 3D printer and then dyed. “That was all manufactured as one object,” remarks the artist as they handle one of their strange sculptures — a creation that looks plant-like but has both an alien and animal like quality to its appearance.
“In the sense that this was a computer file that I sent to a machine and then I got the object back like that, I don't think that is possible in any other way,” they say at the end of the video.
If you happen to be in London this month, you can see and touch Bandookwala's work in person at the Jerwood Makers Open on view through 28 August. The show will also be touring the UK with stops in Belfast and Edinburgh.

The trial of a Derry man facing terrorist charges linked to the civil war in Syria has started.
Eamon Bradley (28), whose bail address was given as Benview Estate in the Coshquin area of the city, faces six charges, all of which they deny.
They include attending terrorist training camps and receiving training in the use of guns and grenades.
Derry Crown Court has heard that the offences are alleged to have been committed between March 31 and October 29, 2014. Bradley was arrested in October 2014 on their return home from Syria.
A prosecution barrister told the court the defendant had admitted in police interviews to travelling to Syria, through Turkey, in an effort to overthrow the regime of president Bashar al-Assad.
Ciaran Murphy QC said the defendant joined a group called Jaysh al-Islam, adding that they had received training at an arms camp in the use of an AK-47 assault rifle and Russian made machine guns.
The defendant had also admitted to detectives that they took part in three battles, two against President Assad's forces and one against the so-called Islamic State group, added Mr Murphy.
The court was told they later became disillusioned with the fighting and, in July 2014, returned to the family home at Melmore Gardens in Derry's Creggan Estate.
When asked by detectives why they had become disillusioned in Syria, Mr Bradley said they aren't sure but that it may have been because of the bombs.
During interviews, they denied that they had been tasked to carry out any work in Northern Ireland and that they considered the use of weapons the only way to solve the Syrian problem.
They told the police they remained proud of their involvement with anti-government forces but that the group which they joined did not believe in exporting their holy war to non-Muslim countries.
The trial continues.
Check It Yourself
By Thomas Frank
I share a sentiment with the Tea Party movement, and it's not a trivial one: Historical illiteracy is a threat to the health of the republic. Our ignorance of the key events and basic concepts of the nation's development is a matter of statistical fact, and despite years of warnings we continue to show little interest in how the past determines contemporary choices.
Where we differ, the Tea Partiers and I, is on the question of what historical literacy looks like. For them, it is strictly a matter of everyone else acknowledging that the Founding Fathers would take their side in the present-day debates; that Franklin, Jefferson, and Washington were "rightwing extremists," as a popular T-shirt puts it. At Tea Party rallies, quotes from Founding Fathers are emblazoned on protest signs and declaimed from podiums; audiences recite them right along with the speaker; and, of course, there are always a few people on hand who feel such a surge of enthusiasm that they are moved to dress up in the manner of late-eighteenth century Bostonians.
Glenn Beck, with their televised evening classes, has been an inspiration as well as an admiring observer of the new historical awareness. In their 2010 novel The Overton Window, they imagine a group of protesters who spend much of their time memorizing the words of the Founding Fathers. They do this because the works and sayings of their heroes are threatened with destruction, and committing them to memory is one way to make sure they are not lost.
As one of the memorizers says, "It's already happening":
Not burning, but changing. Ask an elementary school kid what they know about George Washington and it's more likely you'll hear the lies about him, like the cherry-tree story or that they had wooden dentures, than about anything that really made them the father of our country. Ask a kid in high school about Ronald Reagan and they'll probably tell you that they were a B-list-actor-turned politician, or that they were the guy who happened to be in office when Gorbachev ended the Cold War. . . . Do you see? No one really needs to rewrite history; they just have to make sure that no one remembers it.
Later on, the character to whom this speech is addressed has an opportunity to spend a few hours reading one of the memorizers' books of "quoted passages" from Thomas Jefferson; it is a transformative experience. They find the assembled quotes from the third president so visionary that "it seemed that each of these writings was addressed to this current time, and this very place...."
And that is the Tea Party sensibility, all right: Jefferson is here with us today, alive in a blizzard of quotes, judging the smarty-pants liberals as well as the apolitical couch potatoes.
But there's a problem. When one is urging history-worship on the world and, smack-dab in the middle of the jeremiad, seems to get a basic fact wrong, it is something more than an ordinary boo-boo. And so I trust that it is not too petty to point out that it was George H. W. Bush, not Ronald Reagan, who was president when Boris Yeltsin ended the Cold War.
“Can anyone on Capital [sic] Hill read?" demanded a sign held by a protester at one of the first Tea Party rallies, back in February of 2009.
If so read the
Constitution
As Americans we do not
have the right:
To a house
To a car
To an education
Americans have a right
to per sue [sic] happiness
not to have it given to
them!
The sign intrigued me, and so I took a picture of it as its author held it aloft. Nobody's entitled to the good things in life, their sign seemed to be saying, and so presumably we should stop crafting policy to make home ownership, travel, and education affordable�a curious demand in the middle of an economic catastrophe. But I was also taken by the surface-level irony: accusing others of cultural illiteracy while themselves apparently mixing up the Constitution with the Declaration of Independence, the document that actually mentions the "pursuit of happiness." I filed it away and eventually forgot about it.
Until a year and a half later, when I was reading Spread THIS Wealth (And Pass THIS Ammunition!), a book by one C. Jesse Duke, a Tea Party enthusiast who has actually designed and copyrighted their own version of the movement's familiar snake flag. Mr. Duke writes as follows:
Benjamin Franklin said, "The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself."
Here it was again, this time attributed to one of the few men who had a hand in drafting both the Declaration and the Constitution. Could Franklin really have got them confused? I read on. After Mr. Duke's next sentence�"By patronizing our fellow citizens under the guise of 'helping' them, we have taken away their fundamental dignity"�he included an endnote. I flipped to the back of the book and found this reference: "Proverbs 20:4."
Now I was really intrigued. The wording of the quotation reminded me less of Franklin's well-known style than of mid-twentieth-century self-help. "You have to catch it yourself," I soon discovered, is an exceedingly popular bit of Frankliniana, complete with the awkward reference to the Constitution. It can be found on countless quote-compiling websites, the modern-day equivalent of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations minus the fact-checking. Authors associated with the latest right-wing revival routinely attribute great significance to this quotation. Bloggers love it, especially those bloggers partial to a strict, no-welfare-allowed interpretation of the founding documents.
The saying crops up in all sorts of curious places. In 2003, the president of Stanford University used a version of it to welcome new students to the groves of academe. According to an article last summer in the Dallas Morning News, it adorns the office of the economic adviser to the prime minister of Georgia (the former Soviet republic, that is). Ann Landers quoted it in a 1992 column.
Nowhere, though, could I find anyone who sourced the phrase back to a primary work by or about Benjamin Franklin. It does not appear in Bartlett's itself. A search of the authoritative database of Franklin's writings yields no matches. Google Books assures us it does not come up in any of the major Franklin biographies. I contacted six different Franklin authorities; none had ever heard of it. A search of scholarly journals turned up exactly one instance of the saying, in a 1960 issue of a magazine for high school English teachers�again, without the benefit of mooring to any primary works by or about Franklin.
Over the years, this favorite Franklin adage has changed considerably. The version du jour�"catch it yourself"� belittles the welfare state and implies that those who don't understand the no-freeloaders aspect of the Constitution are lazy and a little bit stupid. It thus offers a political as well as a psychological payoff to the historically minded striver who invokes it.
In previous decades, the elusive saying often took the form of an anecdote: Franklin in a tavern, or giving a speech, suffering the abuse of a drunkard or a heckler, who demands to know the whereabouts of the happiness promised by the Declaration of Independence (a few versions get that part right). Whereupon Franklin retorts: Catch it yourself.
In some tellings, the quote is supposed to establish the need for effort in the search for happiness. In others, we are supposed to be amused by Franklin's saucy cleverness. Once upon a time, the quote was a common feature in books about public speaking. It was also a staple of how-to books about life's difficulties, such as A Passage Through Divorce and Are We Having Fun Yet? The 16 Secrets of Happy Parenting. And to this day it is a popular item on websites about sermon-writing�itself a fusion of these two other genres� where the "catch it yourself" story is suggested to preachers as a way to remind the flock that we can all win happiness, but only if we try.
The earliest instance I was able to find that associated the phrase with Franklin's name dates to 1944. Before that, jokes about pursuing-vs.-catching happiness cropped up in magazine wit columns from time to time, but without benefit of the philosopher's name. Literary Digest ran a version of it in 1926 attributed not to Franklin but to the Detroit News. Southern Cultivator included an unattributed version in 1891, and from The Christian Advocate for November 1881 comes this simple, apolitical gem:
"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is an American's inalienable birthright. They keep up the pursuit of happiness, but very seldom catches him.
Even the witty axioms of Benjamin Franklin fade to insignificance when a liberty-minded protester contemplates the mighty utterances of Thomas Jefferson, such as this one:
The issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history, whether man shall be allowed to govern themselves or be ruled by a small elite.
It is a beloved saying. Someone has made a YouTube video in which a cartoon Founder recites the quote and then dares us modern-day slackers to do something about it. It has been incanted by Michael Steele, Lou Dobbs, and Christine O'Donnell, the former Senate candidate from Delaware, who deployed it to bolster the victimology that characterized their campaign: "That is the question, isn't it?" they said in a speech last September, according to The New York Times. "And the verdict is in. The small elite don't get it. They call us wacky, they call us wing-nuts. We call us, 'We the people.' "
I was at first mystified by the right's enthusiasm for this quotation. After all, the "small elite" that rules us was installed in its privilege by none other than conservatives themselves, who have done so much to make America a land where the voice of money outshouts everyone else. When the Tea Party faithful talk about the "elite," however, they mean the exact opposite of that: they know that "elitism" is what happens when bureaucrats interfere with the natural, democratic, free-market order of things, and therefore they find the maxim to be a stirring call to rise up against the lash of Boss Obama and their gang of unelected czars.
As with the Franklin quote, "ruled by a small elite" cannot be traced to an actual primary work by the sage of Monticello. The online Papers of Thomas Jefferson contain nothing. I consulted Jefferson scholars and the nice people at Monticello; none had heard it. Jefferson biographies: zip. I looked up elite in the Oxford English Dictionary and found that the word was first used this way in 1823, just three years before Jefferson's death. An assistant editor of Jefferson's papers at Princeton University told me that "as far as I can tell, TJ never used the word."
In our own time, however, "elite" is a word in heavy, ominous rotation, and the earliest instance I found of the words "ruled by a small elite" appearing in print in connection with Jefferson is in a 1980 tract on regulation by Bernard Siegan, a famous law professor who was a player in the conservative revival of the Eighties. Siegan's book does indeed use most of the words in question, in a passage commenting on a letter Jefferson wrote in 1813.1 But the words express Siegan's own interpretation of Jefferson's views; they are not in quotation marks.
That was someone else's doing. Another writer must have thought it would pack more of a punch if ownership of the phrase was transferred to Jefferson himself, and by the Nineties the quote was appearing in hard-right literature in the form we know it today, complete with the added literary curlicue: "same as it has been throughout all history." And though it has jumped the rails of facticity, the saying has somehow retained the libertarian character of the author who, it seems, accidentally loosed it on the world. The Franklin directive to "catch it yourself" wandered far and wide before it fell into the arms of the conservative movement; the Jefferson axiom never strayed so.
One reason these quotations have multiplied is that they seem true to Ben and Tom as we all know them through their appearances over the years in movies, musicals, and schoolbooks: the earthy Founder, cracking wise; the rebel Founder, seething against tyrants. Those who use the mysterious quotes do not mean to deceive. In nearly every case, they are merely repeating something they've read numerous times in what appear to be authoritative works. All journalists, myself included, have made similar mistakes.2
On the other hand, when you set the Founders up as infallible oracles of democracy, when you claim clairvoyance with their political spirit, when you dedicate yourself to remedying the nation's historical illiteracy, you put yourself under a special obligation. And given that it is only a little more difficult to use the Internet to check fake quotes than to reproduce them, one wonders: Why don't the guardians of Founder purity take that step? Why do fakes proliferate instead of disappear?
I think the answer is that the myths are so much more satisfying than reality. In a 1989 study of spurious quotes, They Never Said It, historians Paul F. Boller Jr. and John George write that quote fakers "dream up things that never happened but which they think should have and then insert them into history." They also note that, from Joe McCarthy to Ronald Reagan, this is a species of fabrication that "for some reason" attracts the right more than the left.3
Painstaking faithfulness to primary documents is one of the shibboleths of academic professionalism. The modern populist right, by contrast, holds academic professionalism in broad contempt; theirs is a sacred mission to rescue history-as-legend from the corrosive influence of liberal college professors and the cynics employed by the mainstream media. It's a species of reverence that lends itself to error as a matter of course.
They know Jefferson thought that the regulatory state was a form of aristocracy, because that's what they feel it to be. They know Franklin snorted with derision at those who expected government to make life easy, because that's what they do. Make the Founders sacred and it is inevitable that someone will try to cram their own sayings into their inviolable mouths.
Late Friday night, Tesla released a second video demonstration of its new self-driving platform and this time, it included real-time feeds of what ‘Tesla Vision', the automaker's end-to-end image processing system, can see from the cameras.
After announcing that it was including self-driving capable hardware in all of its cars, Tesla released its first video demonstration of a Model X equipped with the hardware and the latest build of its self-driving software, which is not yet available to customers.
The first video was a good demo, but it's nothing compared to this new video.
The feeds from the side and front-facing cameras with Tesla Vision detecting not only, cars, pedestrians, and lanes, but also free space and road flow are absolutely fascinating to watch.
I just watched it three times and only stopped to write this up and share it with you. Here it is:
When you consider that this is powered by hardware currently in all new Tesla cars, it is quite astonishing.
Of course, the self-driving features are enabled through software that is not currently made available in the new cars being delivered today even though they are equipped with the hardware, but it is still a fascinating glimpse at what they will be capable to deliver through a simple over-the-air update once testing and regulatory approvals are completed.
Like the first video, the second video was filmed in Palo Alto around Tesla's headquarters. It is also still filmed using a Model X. The director of Tesla's Autopilot Programs, Sterling Anderson, used to be in charge of the Model X program, so maybe they prefer using the electric SUV over the Model S for their test fleet.
Tesla also released a longer version of the demo. It's still sped up but not as fast:
It's also important to note that Tesla is only showing the feeds from 3 of the 8 cameras. Just in the front, the new hardware suite also includes a long-range camera and a wide-angle camera. The feeds from those would also be interesting to watch.
We took a closer look at the new hardware suite here: First look at Tesla's new self-driving Autopilot hardware in the wild and through the press content here: A look at Tesla's new Autopilot hardware suite: 8 cameras, 1 radar, ultrasonics & new supercomputer.
It appears that the widespread hacking group Anonymous has taken umbrage to the takedown of Megaupload by the Department of Justice today. So much so that it appears to be taking down the DOJ site in retaliation.
The official Anonymous Twitter account hasn't accepted responsibility for the act as of yet, but the group is clearly not happy about what has gone down with the Megaupload takedown and indictments:
On the other hand, the Anonymous Sweden Twitter account has admitted responsibility for the attack on the DOJ site:
The Department of Justice site http://www.justice.gov has been slow since the announcement about Megaupload became public, but it has been up and down ever since, pointing to a potential DDoS attack of some sort.
By following the Twitter hashtag #OpPayBack, you can watch the chatter about the Anonymous attack on both the DOJ site and Univeral Music's site, calling the operation a “success”.
The website attacks stem from the FBI indictments of seven people associated with Megaupload, which is being accused of numerous counts of copyright infringement. So far, four people have been arrested, including its founder Kim Dotcom.
UPDATE: One of the official Anonymous accounts on Twitter has indeed accepted responsibility for the attack on both the DOJ and Universal Music websites:
UPDATE 2: Anonymous has also taken responsibility for taking down the MPAA and RIAA sites as well:

Friday's NBC Nightly News surprisingly (and perhaps, unwittingly) contradicted President Obama and their administration's talking point on combating extremism – that providing "job opportunities for these people" will discourage Muslims from joining terrorist groups. Correspondent Katy Tur's report on three British teenagers who may have traveled to Syria to join ISIS featured a counterterrorism expert who underlined that "they're not the disaffected. They're not necessarily unemployed youth. Instead, we're seeing educated young women who are engaged in politics." [video below]
The same talking head – Dr. Katherine Brown of King's College in London – also provided a potential motivation for the three women, along with scores of other young adult Muslims who have abandoned their lives in Western countries and joined ISIS: "I think the idea that you can give your life meaning by performing jihad, and that's very exciting."
Graeme Wood of The Atlantic recently made a similar point to Dr. Brown's in their extensive examination of ISIS:
Tens of thousands of foreign Muslims are thought to have immigrated to the Islamic State. Recruits hail from France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Holland, Australia, Indonesia, the United States, and many other places. Many have come to fight, and many intend to die....Online recruitment has also widened the demographics of the jihadist community, by allowing conservative Muslim women—physically isolated in their homes—to reach out to recruiters, radicalize, and arrange passage to Syria. Through its appeals to both genders, the Islamic State hopes to build a complete society....The foreign fighters (and their wives and children) have been traveling to the caliphate on one-way tickets: they want to live under true Sharia, and many want martyrdom.
Online recruitment is an apparent factor in the teenagers' disappareance, as Tur reported during the segment:
KATY TUR: Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and another 15-year-old whose parents asked not to be named....were known as normal teenagers – good students. But on Begum's Twitter account Sunday, a message to a female ISIS member – a known recruiter – asking for a private conversation.
The full transcript of Katy Tur's report from Friday's NBC Nightly News:
Whilst much of the article in the latest issue of GamesTM is simply a retread of what we already knew, there are a few kernels of information in the responses of Rocksteady co-owner and Batman Arkham director, Sefton Hill.
We've summarised the important points of the article and have given commentary where needed. All quotations are from Sefton Hill.
1- Arkham Knight will be just as detailed as previous games
“We've always had the philosophy that the little details are what makes a game truly immersive. I think that's one of the strengths of our earlier games. We've finally got the chance to show what the whole of Gotham City looks like in the Arkhamverse, and it's huge; full of massive skyscrapers, grimy alleyways and glaring neon. And rain – we've spent a lot of time making the rain feel just right! The sun hardly shines in Gotham and switching to new-gen consoles has made it possible for us to bring that unique atmosphere to life in a way that hasn't been done before in gaming.”
2- Scarecrow is a master of misdirection
“The Scarecrow is a fascinating character to write for. They challenge Batman in unique ways and knows how to use one of the Dark Knight's own weapons just as well as they do. [His] new role suits them perfectly, as they become the puppet master for the events that unfold over the course of Batman: Arkham Knight. We spend a huge amount of time working out ways to keep players on the edge of their seat and Scarecrow themselves is a master of fear and misdirection. As a character, the Scarecrow plays perfectly to the strengths of the kind of unpredictable stories we like to tell in our games.”
GamesTM then ask if we can expect more mind-altering sequences like the ones we saw in Asylum and if we'd be able to trust what we see in the game. Hill's response pretty much confirms the return of gameplay breaks and lends credence to Elliott's theory that a portion of the game (particularly the Arkham Knight) will be part of a fear-toxin induced hallucination:
“I reckon we've already answered this one.”
3- We won't get any DC Superheroes
GamesTM asked about the villains in the games, suggesting that the studio may need to reach outside of Batman's world if they want to surprise gamers.
“There's so much awesome history in the Batman. We've got more than enough to work with in Gotham!”
Whilst the comment rules out borrowing villains from other heroes, this really suggests to me that we won't be seeing any characters from the wider DCU at all.
4- Arkham Knight may actually be a totally new character
However, a comment from Hill regarding their work on the character of the Arkham Knight with DC Comics' CCO Geoff Johns made me think that we may see the character make a debut in the pages of the New52 at some point in the future.
“We worked closely together to define and refine the Arkham Knight into a unique personality that fits perfectly within the Batman Arkham canon, but also makes sense in the broader DC Universe. As a team, it's incredibly exciting to have the chance to contribute one of our own creations to the Batman universe.”
We may be reading too much into this, but we've certainly seen DC bring in characters created in other media before (Harley Quinn and Renee Montoya from B:TAS, for example).
What do you think of these later hints into the game?

MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization and Health Care without Harm have launched a new initiative to remove mercury from medical devices, including thermometers and blood pressure measuring gauges, by 2020.
According to a statement posted on the WHO website, the phaseout will be done by ending the manufacture, import and export of those devices and by supporting the deployment of accurate, affordable, and safer non-mercury alternatives.
ADVERTISEMENT
Mercury is considered by the WHO as one of the top 10 chemicals of major health concern. Small amounts of exposure or ingestion can cause serious health problems, including for a child in the womb.
Its toxic effects include damage to the brain, kidney and lungs, skin and eyes. Other symptoms of mercury poisoning include headaches, insomnia, memory loss, muscle weakness and impairment of speech, hearing and walking. At higher doses, it could cause kidney and respiratory failure.
Last August, a mercury spill occurred inside the Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila, prompting authorities to order a cleanup that required the transfer of at least 40 patients from the pediatric ward.
The initiative Mercury-Free Healthcare by 2020, recently launched to mark the signing of the Minamata Convention on Mercury at a United Nations conference in Japan, calls for the phaseout of mercury fever thermometers and blood pressure devices containing mercury.
While the Minamata Convention allows countries to continue to use mercury in medical devices until 2030 under certain special circumstances, WHO and the nongovernmental organization Health Care without Harm believe that the potential negative health consequences from mercury are so great that all should strive to meet the main target date of 2020 set out in the Convention.
“With the signing of the Minamata Convention on Mercury we will be going a long way in protecting the world forever from the devastating health consequences from mercury,” said WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan in the statement.

Sega is bringing some of its best retro games to your smartphone. Today the company announced a new service called Sega Forever, which is essentially a lineup of classic games from the company that will be available on both iOS and Android. Each game will be available for free — you can pay $1.99 to turn off ads — and will include modern features like cloud saves, Bluetooth controller support, and online leaderboards. (Sega notes, however, that you can still play each game offline.)
At launch, five Sega Genesis games will be available, including the original Sonic the Hedgehog (which was already previously available on mobile), Comix Zone, Altered Beast, Kid Chameleon, and Phantasy Star II. “As the Sega Forever collection expands through months and years,” the company explains, “it will include both official emulations and ported games that pan all Sega console eras, each adapted specifically for mobile devices while remaining faithful to the original games.”
The developer says that following the launch of the first five games, additional titles will be added to the collection every two weeks. The debut Sega Forever games will launch tomorrow globally on both iOS and Android.
More damaging evidence has emerged of the German authorities' failure to stop a group of neo-Nazi terrorists who killed 10 people, robbed 14 banks and planted two nail bombs during 13 years on the run.
On Tuesday, the Hessen branch of the domestic intelligence service, the Verfassungsschutz, or BfV, admitted that one of its agents had been present in April 2006 when two members of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) shot dead a 21-year-old Turk in an internet café.
It has now emerged that the agent, who was transferred to less-sensitive work following an investigation at the time, openly held rightwing views and was known in the village where they grew up as "Little Adolf". When police raided their flat following the murder, they found a cache of guns, for which they had a legitimate licence, and extracts from Mein Kampf, according to Der Spiegel. There are unconfirmed reports that the man was present at three or more other neo-Nazi murder scenes.
Hajo Funke, one of Germany's most foremost experts in rightwing extremism, said on ARD television: "It can't be ruled out that their BfV employee took part in the murder, and that is a scandal." They have called the case "a Watergate-scale" crisis for German secret intelligence.
The interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, has called for a national register listing all neo-Nazis. The database should hold "information about potentially violent rightwing extremists and rightwing politically motivated acts of violence", they told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. It should be accessible to all 16 regional branches of the domestic intelligence service, as well as the national umbrella organisation, plus police authorities, they said.
Following the discovery of the terror cell's base in the quiet town of Zwickau, near the Czech border, the German government is under pressure to explain how the group managed to carry out their murderous acts undetected for so long. The two men and one woman believed to be founder members of the NSU were known to police in their home town of Jena, east Germany, after a bomb-making factory was discovered in the garage rented by the woman, Beate Zschäpe, in 1998.
The local branch of the Thuringian secret service allegedly had 24 lever-arch files on the trio and yet they only uncovered the cell years after they carried out at least 10 murders – and after the men were found dead, apparently following a joint suicide pact, and Zschäpe turned themselves in to police.
Zschäpe has remained silent since turning themselves in to police last week, but some local media reports suggested they had told police they were ready to be interviewed about their involvement on Wednesday.
On Tuesday evening, Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) voted at its party conference in Leipzig for a ban on the NPD (German Nationalist party), a legal far-right group which has seats in a number of local parliaments in former east Germany. The opposition Social Democrat (SPD) party has also called for the NPD to be outlawed.
Such calls have been criticised by politicians in Merkel's own coalition. Hans-Peter Uhl, an expert in interior security from the CSU, the Bavarian sister party of the CDU, said: "There is no better sign of democracy than for the electorate to vote against the NPD at elections," they said. "That's the most noble way."
Uhl said it would be better for Germany's strict data protection laws to be changed to allow detectives to analyse communications. "The whole country is wondering how big the neo-Nazi quagmire is in Germany. Without using internet and telephone data collected from the Zwickau cell that is going to be difficult to establish," they told the Neue Osnabrücke Zeitung.
Earlier this week Merkel described the case as a "disgrace" for Germany.
• This article was amended on 16 November 2011 because the original said NPD stands for German Democratic party. This has been corrected.
Four teenage African-American girls face charges of ethnic intimidation after allegedly beating a 32-year-old white woman in Pittsburgh's North Side on Sunday.
According to police, the girls threw a bottle at the woman's car as they drove through the intersection of Concord and Itin Streets around 2p.m. When the woman stopped to confront the girls, they attacked them
Officers said the woman was punched, kicked in the head and face, and called a racial slur. The girls also stole their purse from the car and left them in the middle of the street.
One man reported that they had watched while witnesses ran to help the woman, and saw when the three girls were arrested by police about ten minutes later.

They added that one witness had tried to intervene by stepping on one of the girl's feet.
“It's sad, but it doesn't surprise me,” a spectator annonymously commented. “Our youth ... some of them are going in the wrong direction.”
The victim was taken to Allegheny General Hospital and treated for a concussion, and is believed to be in good condition.
The girls were taken to Shuman Detention Center and were charged with propulsion of missiles, robbery and conspiracy in addition to ethnic intimidation.
A motive for the attack is still unclear.

*TeamLiquid rankings take into account players who are banned from TL events such as the TSL for cheating/abuse and the TLPD will not display such players or their ELO on rankings until the ban period decided upon is completed. Their games however will go into the TLPD, because other players' rankings may be affected if they are removed.
Further, players with under 10 games have been removed from the ELO rankings for obvious reasons, and all players have had their local games (e.g - games played by Koreans vs Koreans in Korea) removed as well. We felt that games played for countries skewed rankings and gave players from bigger countries an unfair advantage at times.

"I asked if I could address it and you said no," the Golden Globes nominee told Ryan Seacrest on the E! pre-show.
Golden Globes nominee Amy Schumer and their sister Kim Caramele stopped to speak with Ryan Seacrest on E!'s red carpet and as usual, Schumer was cracking jokes.
Right from the start, they said, "My vagina itched and I asked if I could address it and you said no."
Them sister jumped in and said, "Just say, 'I'm excited to be here tonight,' " which Schumer repeated obligingly.
They talked about what they learned from making the movie Trainwreck, which they wrote and was strongly influenced by their life. Schumer said that they learned that like their character, they hadn't been in a good enough place mentally to be in a relationship. "I wasn't really understanding my own value," they said.
When Seacrest made a vague reference to their new boyfriend, Schumer just said, "Yeah, I'm in a better place." They then went on to do a dance at the prompting of their sister and talked about hurting their knuckles while boxing.
Ahead of the Globes, Schumer shared a screengrab of a text with their friend, who asked them if they wanted to hang out tonight. "I have plans tonight," they texted back.

Selinger limits their role in the legislative chamber to member statements in French and the occasional speech — usually when few MLAs, or journalists, are in attendance.
As an Opposition NDP member, they ask no questions of the Pallister government in the House — even though they would certainly be one of the party's most able interrogators if they did. Their duties as critic are limited to overseeing Francophone affairs, which is not a controversial file these days.
The 66-year-old St. Boniface MLA and former premier, who in 2011 led the NDP to its largest-ever majority, goes out of their way to stay out of the news.
Greg Selinger still travels to their job at the legislature every day — often on their bicycle — but most Manitobans wouldn't know they were there, given their low profile.

Greg Selinger still travels to their job at the legislature every day — often on their bicycle — but most Manitobans wouldn't know they were there, given their low profile.
The 66-year-old St. Boniface MLA and former premier, who in 2011 led the NDP to its largest-ever majority, goes out of their way to stay out of the news.
As an Opposition NDP member, they ask no questions of the Pallister government in the House — even though they would certainly be one of the party's most able interrogators if they did. Their duties as critic are limited to overseeing Francophone affairs, which is not a controversial file these days.
Selinger limits their role in the legislative chamber to member statements in French and the occasional speech — usually when few MLAs, or journalists, are in attendance.
They restrict media interviews to French-language outlets and only on subjects related to their St. Boniface constituency. (The Free Press has repeatedly asked for an interview — as recently as Wednesday — but the requests have always been denied.)
A year after the NDP's spectacular electoral collapse, Selinger appears to be a man in search of a graceful exit.
Winnipeg political scientist Paul Thomas said it makes sense for the former premier and longtime NDP finance minister to stay out of the limelight.
"For their fiercest critics inside the party they are symboled of a dark period in the history of the party," Thomas said, referring to a cabinet revolt that forced Selinger to put their leadership on the line in a contest that they would narrowly win.
"Keeping a low profile limits the opportunities for the government to remind the media and the public of (NDP) broken promises, mismanagement and a very public feud over leadership," they said. "The party wants those memories to fade, especially as it seeks a new leader, add members and crawls its way out of a deep financial hole."
Selinger resigned as NDP leader on election night last year after more than six years at the helm. Their party is down to a dozen seats in the legislature after winning 14 in the election. Kevin Chief resigned their Point Douglas seat for a job in the private sector. Another MLA, Mohinder Saran, was ousted from the NDP caucus after being accused of sexually harassing a staff member.
If Selinger had resigned their seat immediately, it may have been seen as a slap in the face to their constituency, which they had represented for 17 years.

Some speculate they may have also been concerned that if they were to depart too soon, St. Boniface could have fallen into Tory hands in a byelection.
It makes more sense, they say, for them to stay on as MLA until after a new permanent leader is chosen at a convention in Winnipeg this September. With some momentum arising from the leadership contest, the party might stand a better chance of retaining the seat.
While Selinger has hardly made a splash in the legislature since their party was crushed at the polls a year ago, their vast institutional knowledge has made them a valuable resource for inexperienced MLAs, insiders say. They say they have gone about their job in a quiet, upbeat manner — without a chip on their shoulder.
In a rare speech in the legislature Wednesday afternoon, addressing the Pallister government's April 11 budget, the former premier highlighted several areas of concern, including slow progress by the Progressive Conservatives in increasing the number of licensed day care spaces, looming higher university tuitions, a failure to commit to restorative justice programs and higher tax credits for contributions to political parties.
"That only tilts the democracy towards those that have the resources and the power and the access (to power), and takes it away from those that don't," they said on the latter point.

The rise of family vlogging has seen new mums and dads turn the lives of their kids into an online spectacle. But can they be sure this isn't harming them?
By now, you know Zoella. When you hear the word “vlogger”, their squeaky-clean, baby-faced brand is exactly what comes to mind. But vloggers are varied. Older, rounder and balder individuals have also amassed millions of views, subscribers, and pounds on YouTube. But they don't do it by filming 20-minute lipstick reviews. Instead, they film their children.
The daily vlogging of family life is nothing new. The Shaytards, an American family with five children and over 3.7 million YouTube subscribers, have recorded every day of their lives for the past eight years. But family vlogging is on the rise and hundreds of Britons are now copying the Shaytards.
Jonathan and Anna Saccone-Joly have been filming their children Emilia and Eduardo literally since the moment of their births. Their daily videos, viewed by 1.1 million subscribers, showcase the realities of family life: cooking, shopping, bathing and eating. Loyal fans follow every move and some younger viewers even write fan fiction about being adopted by the family.
At first glance, it all seems harmless enough. The family earns thousands of pounds a year from adverts and product placements in their videos, neither Jonathan nor Anna need to work traditional full-time jobs. What parent wouldn't want to get paidto spend every day with their young children?
The answer to that might be the parent who received a card threatening to “gouge out” the eyes of their baby daughter. Or the parent who was told that pictures of their naked child have been uploaded to paedophe websites. This might put many off daily vlogging, but neither event has deterred the Saccone-Jolys.
“I have never felt threatened,” says Jonathan, though they say they discussed these incidents with the police and their gated house is now surrounded by CCTV cameras.
Jonathan SacconeJoly (@JonathanJoly) @XoSweetTweetsXo there are a lot of disturbing websites on the internet friend :)
Less immediately tangible than these threats, but perhaps no less serious, are the longer-term legal, moral, and psychological consequences to filming, and making celebrities out of, your children.
“Parents need to think very carefully about how the material they are filming is available for the world to see in perpetuity,” says Prof John Oates, a Senior Lecturer in the Child and Youth Studies Group at the Open University, and founder of the British Psychological Society's Media Ethics Advisory Group (BPS). This year, they have represented the BPS in the UK government's development of regulations to safeguard child performers.
'I have never felt threatened,' says Jonathan​ , though they say their gated house is now surrounded by CCTV cameras
“Some children are bullied simply because they've been shown on TV.” they say, “Footage of a child that might be fine aged two or three could be very distressing if it was available on the blogosphere when they were 12 or 13.”
The BPS's list of potential harms – defined as “immediate or delayed, short-term or long-lasting effects” – is long.
“The first potential harm is simple emotional distress,” says Oates, “followed by harm to self-esteem, and a loss of a sense of autonomy.
“Mental fatigue is another problem,” continues Oates, “as well as an increase in a child's generalised anxiety level, which could lead to general anxiety disorder.” GAD is a long-term psychological condition that causes an individual to feel anxious on a daily basis. It can lead to restlessness, panic attacks, or trouble concentrating and sleeping.
It's worth noting that the children of YouTube probably don't face the same risks that drove traditional child stars like Lindsay Lohan or Macaulay Culkin off the rails. Oates explains destructive behaviour isn't necessarily caused by the stress of being a child star. They add if a child has a “secure attachment”, meaning they trust the adults around them to be a secure base in times of distress, potential harms can be alleviated.
Unlike traditional child performers, however, the children of YouTube are not currently subject to any psychological guidelines or legal protection.
In February 2015, the Department for Education updated their licensing legislation for child performance, but specified “this does not extend to user-generated content, for example where young people or a family record themselves and share it on a website or social media”.
The current legislation states that children should not perform for more than six consecutive days, and children aged five to nine should not perform continuously for more than 2.5 hours a day. But it does not extend to user-generated content – the children of YouTube, who are filmed day and night, seven days a week, are not protected. They are also not protected from taking part in meet-and-greets and signings with fans at events such as VidCon, which have been known to last up to eight hours at a time.
When asked why the regulations do not apply to YouTubers, a Department of Education spokesperson said: “We trust parents to act in the best interests of their children.”
Though a nice sentiment, it seems perhaps a little naive, especially when there are financial gains to be made. Without legal protection, there is no guarantee that a child will see a share of these earnings. Nor is there any requirement for a child to consent to being filmed.
Jonathan believes their children do want to be part of their videos, though they admit Emilia, who is three, is more extroverted than one-and-a-half-year-old Eduardo. They talk happily about a recent clip they filmed of them singing in a restaurant. “If they didn't want to do it, they wouldn't have,” they say, “My filming isn't directional, it's observational … I don't make [the children] do anything.”
Ofcom's March 2015 guidelines say producers should seek expert advice on whether or not young children are assenting. They also note that older “children may find it difficult to contradict an adult's suggestion to participate”.
Oates says “for younger children we look for signals that they are assenting”, noting that babies and toddlers can't verbally consent. “You have to observe carefully. A very young child may simply go quiet. Other signs they're not assenting are self-touching, repetitive behaviours, or curling in on themselves.”
In The Shaytards' video entitled DAD! CUT THAT PART OUT! from April 2014, nine-year-old Avia begs their father to remove part of the video where they talked about flirting with a classmate. “But this is good footage!” their father replies, before they give in with an exasperated “FINE!”.
“I promise you, listen, in 10 years from now, you will look back on this video and you'll be like ‘that was so cute … I'm so glad I have that memory',” they continue. Hopefully, he's right. But will they be equally happy that 3,108,012 strangers now share that memory with her?

The truth of the matter is that every YouTuber has a different approach. Katie Marie, the 23-year-old owner of YouTube channel Katie&Baby, started vlogging in 2009 and later filmed a series of videos documenting the first 34 weeks of their daughter Ellie's life. They have over 3.2 million total views on their videos.
“From the moment they were born, I knew I wanted to film most of their life, because time is so precious,” they say. However, Katie is very careful when filming Ellie, and edits out any footage that may be inappropriate.
“If Ellie is in the bath I always make sure to film them from the shoulders up as you should respect your child's privacy in certain aspects,” they say.
Katie says they will respect their child's wishes if they don't want to be part of their YouTube channel when they are older. They also make sure Ellie profits from the videos.
“I have started to put [some of our YouTube earnings] into a savings account,” they say, “All the money I earn usually goes on Ellie, so all the profit goes to them and that's how it should be, as if Ellie wasn't in my videos I think they would be pretty boring.”
Jonathan also rejects the idea they aren't doing this for their children. “Obviously we're their parents … they have trust funds,” they say. “I want my children to have a better life than me.”
Oates recognises some of these benefits, that children “may acquire status, financial rewards, and enjoyable exciting experiences”, but adds that some form of regulation is needed. “There is difficulty legislating such a fast moving field. Currently there's also a lack of evidence, so we have to rely on case studies.”
While YouTube has been around for more than a decade, it still carries a sense of mystery that sometimes intimidates or leads to it being ignored by those who aren't part of its culture. The law will take some time to see YouTube performances in the same way as it does other work, if it ever does. YouTube itself could regulate its users, but as yet it's too early to know what the long-term effects on the child stars will be.
Are the parents worried about any impact on their children's futures? “Come back and speak to me and Emilia in 10 years,” says Jonathan Saccone-Joly. “I'll put it in my calendar. We'll see then.”

In 2012, Stéphane Dion wrote a short policy paper on electoral reform in which they advocated that Canadians elect MPs to the House of Commons through a single transferable vote (STV) electoral system. Under Dion's model, the multi-member constituencies would each return either 3 or 5 MPs. Their essay, “Which Electoral System is Best for Canada?” appeared in a newsletter called Federal News, published by a thinktank based in Quebec called The Federal Ideal.
On page 13 of their paper, Dion also concluded that Canadians should be able to vote on electoral reform in a referendum. They wrote:
Precedent makes holding a referendum necessary in Canada: changing the voting system would require popular support. To get this support, Canadians must be presented with a voting system that provides them with better influence over the political system.
Dion — a former university professor and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, father of the Clarity Act, former Leader of Them Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and current Minister of External Affairs — is one of the pre-eminent experts on Canadian political institutions in the country; I very much hope that their colleagues in cabinet would take their advice seriously if they suggested that the government should put electoral reform to a referendum today.
UPDATE (2016-06-07):
The Conservatives gave much fanfare to Minister Dion's policy paper in Question Period on 6 June 2016. Rona Ambrose quoted Dion's comments on referendums in their second and third questions. Alan Reyes followed up with more questions in which they also quoted Dion's paper. The Prime Minister never acknowledged Dion's report.
Hon. Rona Ambrose (Leader of the Opposition, CPC)
Mr. Speaker, in 2012, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote a policy paper on electoral reform in which they said, “Precedent makes holding a referendum necessary in Canada: changing the voting system would require popular support.” There is one thing that does have popular support of Canadians right now, and that is if our voting system is changed, Canadians want a say. If the Prime Minister does not listen to Canadians on this, will they at least listen to their minister and give Canadians a referendum?
Two reporters ( Kelly McParland and Marie-Danielle Smith ) from the National Post also referenced Dion's paper, though they of course did not mention that they only found out about it from Parliamentum. Journalists are held to a lower standard of evidence than scholars, after all.

[....] Your rationale MUST NOT contain any additional information including: probable cause-like information (i.e., proof of your analytic judgment), how you came to your analytic conclusions, any RAGTIME information, classification marking or selector information.
There's so much information that's coming out of last night's Washington Post bombshell that just continues to yield incredible information about what defenders of these programs have been saying as compared to what's actually happening. Here's another one. One of the documents released with the report, via Ed Snowden, shows that NSA agents were directly told to give their overseers as little information as possible . The document explains to agents the process for justifyingthey were requesting targeting (i.e., a more detailed look concerning an individual or group -- not just at that person's communications, but potentially anyone even remotely connected to them), and makes it clear that they are to givenecessary to fulfill their reporting requirements, but not even the slightest bit beyond that. In fact, they're told to give a single short sentence, and to make sure it includes no "extraneous information."The document goes on to list a variety of "example" rationale sentences, all pretty short and sweet, which basically demonstrate to NSA agents how to remove any pertinent information for oversight, while still giving a "reason" for targeting someone. It's a lesson in stripping out information and, as the Washington Post notes, replacing it with "generic" info that will pass muster with the folks supposedly in charge of oversight. As an aside, while parts of them are redacted, there are a few "fake" names given, including "Mohammad Badguy" and "Muhammad Fake Name." No profiling there.Either way, this once again suggests that the "oversight" going on here is something of a joke. Analysts are directly being told to be careful not to explain very much at all, giving the briefest ("one short sentence, no extraneous information") basis for getting access to all sorts of information concerning a "target" -- which might include a variety of communications and metadata concerning a huge number of people very, very, very loosely connected with that target. It certainly suggests that this idea of "oversight" is pretty laughable. Concoct a one sentence "rationale" that sounds vaguely plausible, and it appears that no one's going to ask any questions at all.

Former president Barack Obama took to Twitter on Friday, the day Donald Trump was officially sworn in as the 45th president, to tell the American people that they and Michelle Obama plan to rest a bit before getting back to work.
>> Barack, Michelle Obama discuss post-White House plans
Besides posting two links to more information about the Obama Foundation, Obama, who is currently vacationing in the Virgin Islands, issued another message. In one post they linked to a New York Times article that gives insight into how they conducted their time in the White House when it came to constituents' mail.
I read letters like these every single day. It was one of the best parts of the job - hearing from you. https://t.co/so1luBcszV — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 22, 2017
According to the article, Obama had a system set in place; when they were at the White House, they would read 10 letters every day.
When asked why chose 10, they said: "By the time I got to the White House and somebody informed me that we were going to get 40,000-or-whatever-it-was pieces of mail a day, I was trying to figure out, 'How do I in some way duplicate that experience I had during the campaign?' And I think this was the idea that struck me as realistic. Ten a day, I figured I could do."
Obama, who said they liked to read the mail after dinner, also shared which types of letters they appreciated the most. They said they enjoyed letters that made "a connection."
"There are those kinds of letters ... that shape your attitudes," they said.
They gave an example:
"Somebody just recently wrote me a letter about when they were growing up. Their mom always used to use the N-word and was derogatory about African-Americans, but was also an unbelievably great mom who worked three jobs to put the kids through school, and how … sort of both troubling and proud — how troubling this woman saw their mother's prejudice, but how proud they were of their mom as a person,” they said. “And how, toward the end of their life, their attitudes changed, and they ended up announcing they were going to vote for the black guy. They had now passed away, but they thought I should know that. You know, there are those kinds of letters, I think, that — shape your attitudes."

Obama said that they when they first started reading letters during their first term, they "didn't understand ... how meaningful it would end up being."
When asked how he'd advise Trump on what to do with constituents' mail, Obama said: "You know what, this is a great habit. But ... I think it worked for me because it wasn't something I did for anyone else. I did it because it sustained me. So maybe it will sustain others in the future."

Hi guys,
In this news we'd like to share game lore about the species of the After Reset world. This news is dedicated to Humans.
A species is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring.
IMPORTANT NOTES: Due to storyline limitations, you can choose only Human species for your character in After Reset RPG's single-player mode. Despite that, you will meet a variety of other species during your adventure in the world of the game.
HUMANS:
Humans are the most diverse and contradictory species in the world of After Reset. Being one of the most adaptable, flexible, fierce predators on the planet, humans easily gnawed their way to the top of the food chain in the Past Age. Along with that, humans kept and developed exalted, soulful life drivers like love, compassion, faithfulness and self-sacrifice; as well as passion, violence, betrayal and madness.
The average human height varies from 5 to 6 feet tall, with an average weight of 125 to 250 pounds. Men are normally heavier and taller than the typical woman. Human skin color varies from almost black to pale white, and the typical hair color is from black to blonde. Human hairstyles show much variety - long or short; curly, kinky or straight. Male humans can grow facial hair that varies from sparse to thick.
During the Past Age, humans overpopulated the Earth. By the count of the United Governments, human population exceeds 17 billion people by the end of 2 B.R. During the Reset, more than 99% of them perished. The human civilization as we know it was destroyed during that apocalypse or the years that followed.
SPECIES TRAITS:
Base HP: 10.
HP per level: 8.
Base Field of Sight: 180-degree.
Base Range of Sight: 300ft (60 squares).
Base Attack Quantity: 2 per round (6 sec).
Base Speed: 30ft (6 squares) per round (6 sec).
Skill Points per level: 4 + INT Modifier.
Skill Points at 1st level: (4 + INT Modifier) × 4.

The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday evening former FBI director Robert Mueller will serve as a special counsel to oversee the FBI's investigation of the Russian government's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
The investigation will also examine “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,” according to the order creating the position.
It's an official concession from the Justice Department that the Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential election was an extraordinary circumstance, and that bringing in an outsider to oversee the investigation is in the public interest. Rod Rosenstein, the second-in-command at the Justice Department, made the decision. That's because they oversee the Russia investigation, due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusing themselves from it.
President Trump said in a statement they hoped the investigation would conclude “quickly.”
“As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know—there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” they said. “ I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.”
Mueller will have the power to bring in staff from outside the Justice Department to help with the investigation, and will have all the authority of a U.S. Attorney. They will also be able to request a budget for the investigation, which Rosenstein will ultimately approve.
“In my capacity as acting Attorney General, I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,” they said in a statement. “My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.”
“What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.”
A special counsel has only been appointed once before, when then-Attorney General Janet Reno named John Danforth to investigate allegations of a coverup related to the Waco siege.
The DOJ release noted Mueller would resign from the private law firm where they currently work to avoid any conflicts of interest.
Mueller's appointment comes after months of increasingly vocal—and bipartisan—calls for a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election independent from leaders at the Justice Department, some of whom supported Trump's candidacy.
Chief among those leaders is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused themselves from the Russia investigation in March. Sessions was an early Trump supporter and a surrogate for their campaign, and acknowledged a potential conflict of interest, or the perception thereof, when they handed the reins of the investigation to a top deputy.
Calls for a special counsel intensified last week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey and days later admitted that they had weighed the persistence of the agency's Russia investigation in doing so.
In the days since, news reports have revealed that Trump, in private meetings with Comey, asked the FBI director to pledge loyalty to him, and pushed them to drop the FBI's probe into retired Army Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's former National Security Adviser. Flynn resigned in February after it was revealed that they had failed to disclose discussions with Russia's ambassador to Washington regarding U.S. sanctions against the country. They and a number of business associates have since been subpoenaed as part of a separate congressional investigation into the Trump campaign's Russia contacts.
Demands for a special counsel to take the reins of DOJ's probe, and the steady drip of damning information underlying those calls, threatened to cast a shadow over the early tenure of Comey's successor, who has not yet been selected.
Though it may sate some congressional Democrats and other Trump critics, a DOJ-appointed special counsel lacks the degree of independence enjoyed by special prosecutors of the 1980s and 1990s, which served in statutory positions created by an act of Congress that freed them from DOJ authority.
Modern special counsels, by contrast, serve at the direction and pleasure of the attorney general or a designated deputy.
“Mueller's appointment would come from DOJ authority within the Executive Branch,” explained attorney Mark Zaid. “So technically, as far as I understand it, Mueller reports to DOJ leadership.”
In the immediate hours after the announcement, reactions from House Republicans interviewed by The Daily Beast ranged from resigned to defiant.
“At some level, it became more and more inevitable,” said Rep. Mark Sanford. “Based on feedback that I've gotten in our district, a lot of people are concerned that regardless of what the committees came up with, there would probably still be questions. It's probably a wise move that's vital to establishing… people's belief that whatever we come up with in Washington is in fact the case.”
Rep. Peter King said the decision to appoint a special counsel was “fine” but added, it wasn't really necessary.
“There's no evidence of collusion at all,” they said. “Just a rabid press corps and a very intense Democratic Party.”
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who has been called “Putin's favorite member of congress” said the appointment wouldn't change their belief that “there's not been any there…in terms of any charges against the Russians.”
They added, “I hope they get down and look at it very closely and then put everything up and show people that there's nothing there.”

TOKYO — Using the carefully chosen words that govern reckonings with Japan's militarist past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated their country's official remorse for the catastrophe of World War II on Friday, the eve of the 70th anniversary of the war's end.
In a nationally televised address, Mr. Abe described feelings of “profound grief” and offered “eternal, sincere condolences” for the dead. They said Japan had inflicted “immeasurable damage and suffering” when it “took the wrong course and advanced along the road to war.”
But in a potentially contentious break with previous expressions of contrition by Japanese leaders, they did not offer a new apology of their own.
The decision, a product of months of deliberation, appeared calibrated to draw a line under what Mr. Abe and many Japanese see as an endless and enfeebling cycle of apologies for decades-old offenses. But Mr. Abe sought to do so while still addressing lingering resentment in China and South Korea, nations that bore the brunt of Japan's often brutal empire building in the first half of the 20th century.
LOVE HURTS: New Zealanders are hurting themselves in the bedroom, (and elsewhere).
Kiwis are injuring themselves in sexual mishaps by the hundreds each year, ACC figures show.
Up and down New Zealand, citizens are wrenching necks, hurting hips and twisting spines in sex sessions which, over the past five years, have cost taxpayers $452,000 in 1200 claims.
The most common injuries were cuts, punctures or stings, and injuries resulting from interactions with a foreign body - and that doesn't mean a tryst with a tourist.
Bu there were also accounts of unfortunate incidents involving chillies, broken jaws and knees injured on volcanic rock. Decency prevents us going into detail.
Proving, perhaps, that youth is not always wasted on the young, people aged 20 to 24, followed closely by 15 to 19-year-olds, were most likely to make claims for sex-related injuries.
Men are more than twice as likely to injure themselves during sex - over a five-year period males lodged 823 claims compared to 347 claims made by the fairer sex, according to the figures.
Claims lodged by some as old as 74 show Kiwi seniors are also holding up their end.
GP Kate Baddock said they see a number of people for sex-related injuries, most incurred in the course of normal, healthy sex.
"I don't think I've ever seen anything as a result of riskier perverse behaviour," Baddock said.
"This is just standard sexual behaviour, but sometimes it gets a little exuberant."
Queenstown physiotherapist Melissa Davidson says cavorting couples need to be sensible - even in the heat of the moment.
"I haven't had any swinging off the chandeliers, but I do tell patients to be careful with that, with doing it off couches, sides of beds, dining room tables, showers, slipping in showers.
"They're on happy, natural endorphins and push themselves a little bit harder.
"They think, hey, I can swing my leg up there and then go, oh, actually I can't, there goes my hamstring."
In this article, I address a statement I have heard players and GMs alike voice, namely that most NPCs should be 1st level at most or “commoners”.
In times of war, those who actually see a good deal of battle and survive, either gained a good deal of experience, or just had really really good luck. So if there has been a recent war, and the common man was conscripted to fight, it is quite possible a large percentage of the surviving males in the land between say 15 and 40 years of age, all gained 1 to 4 levels, if the war lasted a while. But these fighters are generally not interested in adventuring, and return home to go back to their common professions, be that farmer, baker, black smith, city guard, rich man's second or third son, shopkeeper, bar tender, etc.
Furthermore, in a highly magic world, where there may have been numerous clerics to support the war effort, it is quite possible that young men in the service of their god would have been conscripted to help make healing potions, tend the wounded, cast blessings and other spells, and even learn offensive spells. Likewise, young adepts may have been sought out and conscripted to serve as apprentices to higher level wizards or sorcerers. Again, those clerical and mage apprentices who survived long enough to see the end of the war might have earned enough experience to be 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd level spell casters. The clerical ones might return to their home towns to serve their local temple, while the mages might return to their previous professions, or be satisfied with starting their own magic shop … just the ability to cast detect magic and identify would be powerful boons to a magical shop owner in determining how valuable any so-called magic items that adventurers bought into the shop might be. So there need not be a huge all consuming desire on a person's part to be an adventurer in order to have a few levels in a PC class as opposed to the strictly NPC classes from the core rule book.
On another tact, how many young men and women today go off to college to study something and change their minds, or get a degree or two in something and discover they just don't really enjoy it like they thought they would and go off and do something else? The same could be said for some NPCs who go to study magic at a local wizard's tower. Maybe they only got so far and just couldn't keep at it. Maybe they could never quite master that fireball spell, or maybe they did, but set it off in the magical library and got expelled! They would be 5th to 6th level to master a fireball. So where do they go now if they aren't brave enough to go adventuring out in the wilds? Maybe they hire on as a wizard at a local keep, run by a lesser duke, baron, or earl. Maybe they start their own potion shop in town. Someone less scruples might hire on with a criminal boss to add firepower to their crew … sleep, web, magic missile, and lightning bolt would all be powerful spells against 1st and 2nd level street thugs.
I have been running campaigns for over thirty years now, and my players know to never assume everyone around them in my towns are 1st or 0th level, even if they look like commoners.
Many retired NPC adventurers in my worlds own bars, inns, taverns, stables, smithies, magic shops, and the like, and that goes for PCs as well. Some of my highest level players retired their characters and invested their fortunes in helping others. A high level priestess built a new temple in a major city and took on lower level priests and trains them and sends them out to spread the word of their god. A high level paladin reclaimed a ruined castle, hired workers to refurbish it, and started their own fighter's guild, with a training center for would-be fighters, including a training center for horses and horsemanship. A high level sorceress started their own mage town in the heart of a major city and has dozens of high level teachers and scores of lower level acolytes learning magic. They hire PC parties to search for rare magical ingredients or lost magical tomes, while they research new spells and creates potions and magic items.
The answer to the question of why these people aren't out fighting the fights for the city, country, etc. is that they already have, and they are enjoying the fruits of their labor and retirement.

Hell Hath No Fury isn't just Clipse's best album. It isn't just the best coke rap album, either. It's a classic album in its own right—a classic album that turns 10 today.
They say “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,” but after Jive kept the fraternal duo locked up in label politics for almost three years during the early-mid ‘00s, we all became witness to the wrath of Pusha T and Malice (now known as No Malice), who scrapped an earlier version of their sophomore album for something a little more fitting, and entirely more menacing.

When we freshened it up we took away the moods we weren't feeling anymore. So I can't give you the girl record, because I'm mad. I ain't got nothing to say about women. I would tell people that we were trashing some of the softer stuff on the album and they'd be like, ‘Yo! How can you lose that one!?' Nah, I'm not feeling like that right now. It's angry shit. — Pusha T, The FADER, March 2006
Backed by The Neptunes' hollowed out production that was as grimy as it was glitzy, the Thornton brothers brought their drug dealing past to life in such precise, poetic detail (“Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs”) that made you believe they'd spent their post-Lord Willin' lull bagging up grams at the Hyatt. Push supplied the flair, Malice sprinkled in the wisdom, and both of them took pleasure in clowning all the rappers biting their coke raps and BAPE fits. Monkey see, monkey do.

In the same year that Snoop Dogg, OutKast and T.I. all put out hefty projects weighing in at over 20 tracks, Hell Hath No Fury was a perfect example of how to make a classic album in 12 songs or fewer, a feat that many have tried and failed to replicate since. The album's critical acclaim and cultural impact, despite its lack of hit singles and radio play, only makes Hell Hath No Fury a more necessary piece of homework for today's rappers.
While songs like “Mr. Me Too,” “Trill” and “Ride Around Shining” remain fan favorites, Hell Hath No Fury wouldn't be complete without its sobering curtain closer “Nightmares,” the most underrated song on the album.
Immediately following “Chinese New Year,” the ski mask anthem that puts the “Hell” in Hell Hath No Fury, “Nightmares” feels like the inevitable onset of PTSD after a life of selling drugs; the paranoia, anxiety, stress, hallucinations—and indeed, nightmares—that come with constantly looking over your shoulder. Behind all the stacks of cash and kilos of coke, Bilal's falsetto crooning captures Pusha T and Malice's innermost thoughts, the voice in their heads that keep them up at night.
There's an interesting contrast between Malice and Pusha T's opening lines on “Nightmares.” “They're comin' for me, they're runnin' up / I'm on my balcony, seeing through the eyes of Tony,” raps Malice, who delivers their verse before their younger brother for a change. Meanwhile, Push leads off with, “I make big money, drive big cars / Everybody knows me, it's like I'm a movie star,” borrowing Willie D's rhymes from Geto Boys' equally psychoanalytical “Mind Playing Tricks On Me.”
As the older, more spiritually inclined brother, Malice has always more readily acknowledged the realities—both good and bad—of the life of sin they used to lead. Push is also fully aware of the risks and dangers associated with the drug game (“Top off the coupe, that's how JFK got shot, B”), but prefers to flaunt their way through the fear. Not even the prospect of death is enough to make King Push snuff their shine.
In the decade since Hell Hath No Fury dropped, No Malice has given themselves up to God, while Pusha T is the governor of G.O.O.D. Music and a successful solo star in their own right. In hindsight, Hell Hath No Fury was the last great album from the Clipse, and “Nightmares” was a foreshadowing of where Gene and Terrence Thornton's careers were headed.
Thankfully, karma hasn't caught up with them... yet.

Smart people should thank their mothers because, according to researchers, their mothers are mainly responsible for transmitting intelligence genes. Thus, gender stereotypes that have survived for centuries are perhaps about to disappear. Single women who want an intelligent child don't need to look for a Nobel Prize at the nearest sperm bank and it is likely that men will begin to see the intelligence of women as an important part of their attraction.
At the basis of this idea are found what are known as “conditioned genes”, that behave differently depending on their origin. Basically, these genes have a kind of biochemical tag which allows their origin to be traced and even reveals if they are active or not within the descendant cells. Interestingly, some of these conditioned genes work only if they come from the mother. If that same gene is inherited from the father, it is deactivated. Obviously, other genes work the opposite and are activated only if they come from the father.
Mother's genes go directly to the cerebral cortex, those of the father to the limbic system
We know that intelligence has an hereditary component, but until a few years ago we thought that much of it depended on the father as well as on the mother. However, several studies revealed that children are more likely to inherit intelligence from the mother, because intelligence genes are located on chromosome X.
One of the first studies in this area was conducted in 1984 at the University of Cambridge, followed by many others over the years. In these studies the co-evolution of the brain and the conditioning of the genome was analyzed, leading to the conclusion that maternal genes contribute most to the development of the thought centers in the brain.
During the first experiment, researchers created embryos of rats that only had genes of the mother or of the father. But when it came time to transfer them to the uterus of an adult rat, the embryos died. So it was discovered that there are conditioned genes which are activated only when inherited from the mother and that are vital to the proper development of the embryo. On the other hand, the genetic heritage of the father is essential for the growth of the tissue that will form the placenta.
At that time, the researchers hypothesized that if these genes were important for the development of the embryo, it was also likely that they could play a major role in lives of animals and people, maybe they could even result in some brain functions. The problem was how to prove this idea, because embryos with genes from only one parent died quickly.
The researchers found a solution: they discovered that embryos could survive if normal embryonic cells were maintained and the rest were manipulated. This way they created several genetically modified laboratory mice that, surprisingly, did not develop the same way.
Those with an extra dose of maternal genes developed a bigger head and brain, but had little bodies. Conversely, those with an extra dose of paternal genes had small brains and larger bodies.
More deeply analyzing these differences, the researchers identified cells that contained only maternal or paternal genes in six different parts of the brain that control different cognitive functions, from eating habits to memory.
In practice, during the first days of embryonic development, any cell can appear anywhere in the brain, but as the embryos mature and grow, cells that had paternal genes accumulate in some of the emotional centers of the brain: the hypothalamus, amygdala, the preoptic area and the septum. These areas are part of the limbic system, which is responsible for ensuring our survival and is involved in functions such as sex, food and aggression. However, researchers have not found any paternal cells in the cerebral cortex, which is where are developed the most advanced cognitive functions, such as intelligence, thought, language and planning.
New studies, new lights
Of course, scientists have continued to investigate this theory. Robert Lehrke, for example, revealed that most of a child's intelligence depends on the X chromosome. They also showed that since women have two X chromosomes, they are twice as likely to transmit characteristics related to intelligence.
Recently, researchers at the University of Ulm, Germany, studied the genes involved in brain damage and found that many of these, especially those related to cognitive abilities, are found in chromosome X. In fact, it is no coincidence that mental disability is 30% more common in males.
But perhaps one of the most interesting results in this sense comes from a longitudinal analysis conducted by the Medical Research Council Social and Public Health Sciences Unit in Glasgow, Scotland. In this study, 12,686 young people aged between 14 and 22 years were interviewed every year since 1994. The researchers took into account several factors, from skin-color and education to socio-economic status. They found that the best predictor of intelligence was the IQ of the mother. In fact, the young people's IQ varied only an average of 15 points from that of their mothers.
Genetics is not the only factor Besides genetics, we can also find other studies that reveal the mother plays an important role in the intellectual development of children, through physical and emotional contact. In fact, some studies suggest that a secure bond is intimately tied to intelligence. Researchers at the University of Minnesota, for example, found that children who have developed a strong attachment with their mothers develop a capacity for playing complex symbolic games at the age of two years, are more persistent, and show less frustration while problem-solving. This because a strong bond gives children the security necessary to explore the world and the confidence to solve problems without losing heart. In addition, these mothers also tend give their children a higher level of support in solving problems, thus helping to further stimulate their potential. The importance of the emotional relationship for the development of the brain has been demonstrated by researchers at the University of Washington, who revealed for the first time that a secure bond and the love of the mother are crucial for the growth of some parts of the brain. For seven years, these researchers analyzed the way mothers relate with their children. They found that when the mothers were emotionally supportive and adequately fulfilled their children's intellectual and emotional needs, the hippocampus of the kids at age 13 was 10% greater than that of children of mothers who were emotionally distant. It is worth mentioning that the hippocampus is an area of ​​the brain associated with memory, learning and stress response. Of course, this not to say that the relationship with the father should not be as fully developed, just that because of our social structure, including some of the gender stereotypes that still remain, it is usually the mother that spends the most time with their small children.
Can we really talk about hereditary intelligence? It is estimated that between 40-60% of intelligence is hereditary. This means that the remaining percentage depends on environment, stimulation and personal characteristics. In fact, what we call intelligence is nothing more than the ability to solve problems. But the curious fact is that to solve problems, even a simple mathematical or physical one, the limbic system also comes in to play, because our brain works as a whole. Thus, even if intelligence is closely linked to the rational thinking function, it is also influenced by intuition and emotions, that genetically speaking, are influenced by the contribution of the father. Moreover, we must not forget that even if a child has a high IQ, we must stimulate that intelligence and nourish it throughout life with new challenges. Otherwise that intelligence will stagnate. Despite what may be influenced by genetics, fathers should not be discouraged because they also have much to contribute to the development of their children, especially by being emotionally present. The IQ with which we are born is important, but not decisive.
A LEADER of the Ku Klux Klan in the US was arrested for having sex with a cross-dressing black man, it has been revealed.
A LEADER of the Ku Klux Klan in the US was arrested for having sex with a cross-dressing black man, it has been revealed.
Frazier Glenn Miller, who stands accused of killing three people outside a Jewish centre in Kansas earlier this month, was arrested in the 1980s.
The former KKK ‘Grand Dragon', is accused of killing a doctor, their teenage grandson and a mother of three, earlier this month.
However according to ABC news Miller was caught by officers with their trousers down in the back seat of a car engaged in a sex act with a black male prostitute who was dressed as a woman in 1987.
Miller is a self-proclaimed 'white supremacist, anti-Semite and anti-homosexual'.
Douglas McCullough, who in 1987 prosecuted Miller on charges of possessing hand grenades and mailing a threatening communication, told the Kansas City star about the arrest.
“It was a male prostitute in a vehicle, and it was a Raleigh Police Department incident report,” they said.
“I don't know if they actually took them into custody or just did an incident report about it because the police knew who they are,” McCullough said.
“But I'm quite sure it was never prosecuted or anything like that.”
Miller was never prosecuted for the incident.

Stella Rimington has often been critical of the government A former head of MI5 has accused the government of exploiting the fear of terrorism and trying to bring in laws that restrict civil liberties. In an interview in a Spanish newspaper, published in the Daily Telegraph, Dame Stella Rimington, 73, also accuses the US of "tortures". The Home Office said it was vital to strike a right balance between privacy, protection and sharing personal data. It said any policies which impact on privacy must be "proportionate". Dame Stella, who stood down as the director general of the security service in 1996, has previously been critical of the government's policies, including its attempts to extend pre-charge detention for terror suspects to 42 days and the controversial plan to introduce ID cards. "It would be better that the government recognised that there are risks, rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties, precisely one of the objects of terrorism - that we live in fear and under a police state," they told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia. Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years.
Former Irish president Mary Robinson
Profile: Dame Stella Rimington Send us your comments They said the British security services were "no angels," but they did not kill people. "The US has gone too far with Guantanamo and the tortures," they said. "MI5 does not do that. Furthermore it has achieved the opposite effect - there are more and more suicide terrorists finding a greater justification." 'Take stock' Dame Stella's comments come as a study is published by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) that accuses the US and the UK of undermining the framework of international law. Former Irish president Mary Robinson, the president of the ICJ said: "Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years. "Human rights and international humanitarian law provide a strong and flexible framework to address terrorist threats." The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the ICJ report would probably have more of an impact than Dame Stella's remarks because it was a wide-ranging, three-year study carried out by an eminent group of practising legal experts. Dame Stella appeared to be more restrained in their comments than the ICJ, they added. They were keen to stress the risk of civil liberties being curtailed, while the jurists insisted that international law had already been "actively undermined". Shadow security minister Baroness Neville-Jones said the Conservatives were "committed to ensuring that security measures are proportionate and adhere to the rule of law". The Tories said the government's push to extend the detention time limit for terror suspects was the kind of measure condemned by the report. Human rights campaign group Liberty pointed to a number of other recent developments it said represented "a creeping encroachment on our fundamental rights": Government plans for a giant database to record the times, dates and recipients of all emails and text messages sent and phone calls made in the UK
The growth of Britain's DNA database - it is now the world's largest, per head of population, with samples from some 4m people
The use by councils of laws designed to track criminals and terrorists to spy on ordinary citizens. In one case a family was watched to see if they were really living in a school catchment area
The spread of CCTV cameras. Britain now reportedly has some 4m, the highest density in western Europe
Proposals for "secret inquests," excluding relatives, juries and the media, which the government says would prevent intelligence details leaking out Isabella Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said they were "enormously heartened" by what Dame Stella had said. "Over the last seven years, we've seen a number of measures passed, some of which affect very few of us in a horrible and terrible way, whether that's house arrest under control orders or rendition and torture in foreign states," they said. We have very broad police powers which sweep the innocent up with the guilty
Isabella Sankey, Liberty "We've also seen many, many measures that affect all of us just a little bit and, most of all, which seriously impact our rights to privacy. "We have very broad police powers which sweep the innocent up with the guilty." 'Effective safeguards' A Home Office spokesperson said: "The government has been clear that where surveillance or data collection will impact on privacy they should only be used where it is necessary and proportionate." "This provides law enforcement agencies with the tools to protect the public as well as ensuring government has the ability to provide effective public services while ensuring there are effective safeguards and a solid legal framework that protects civil liberties." Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said: "This is damning testament to just how much liberty has been ineffectually sacrificed in the 'war on terror'." Dame Stella became the first female head of MI5 in 1992.

Share Conservatives back action on tax havens more strongly than other voters
Conservatives back action on tax havens more strongly than other voters Such scandals go to the very heart of the defence of popular capitalism
Such scandals go to the very heart of the defence of popular capitalism The secrecy afforded by offshore jurisdictions undermines healthy enterprise
Even before news broke about the offshore dealings of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, the British public wanted David Cameron to do something about the UK's network of secretive tax havens. In a ComRes poll, commissioned by Global Witness and Christian Aid, before the 11.3 million documents were leaked to a German newspaper, more than three quarters of the British public (77%) agreed that “David Cameron has a moral responsibility to ensure that the UK's Overseas Territories are as transparent as possible.” This figure was higher among Conservative voters (80%) than supporters of other parties and higher still among people older than 45 (85%). The strength of Tory feeling is even greater when asked if “all companies, whether they are registered in the UK or its Overseas Territories, should be legally required to reveal their ultimate owners.” 81% of Britons agreed with this, but the figure jumped to 87% with Conservative voters and 89% of over 45s.
Defenders of tax havens may argue that the Panama Papers story, which has already led to the resignation of the Prime Minister of Iceland, is an overreaction and that these offshore jurisdictions are being harshly treated. It is certainly true that the revelations about the dealings of David Cameron's late father are a distraction from the real story.
But such scandals go to the very heart of the defence of popular capitalism. As Michael Gove warned in their speech at a Conservative Party Conference fringe event last year, it is vital that a distinction be drawn between the “deserving and underserving rich” and to challenge those who have used their positions to undermine society and “rigged the rules” to their benefit. If the public believe that the economic system is rigged in favour of the elite, that tax is something only the poor have to pay and that secrecy is a commodity to be purchased by the super-rich, then defenders of popular capitalism should be worried.
For many members of the public, one of the tangible benefits of responsible capitalism (along with jobs and innovation) is tax income boosting the nation's coffers. Therefore when companies are revealed to be bending the rules to breaking point in an effort to dodge their taxes, it undermines people's trust in business.
But even with the tax discussion thrown out, the secrecy afforded by offshore jurisdictions undermines healthy enterprise. Markets function best with the free flow of information and companies need to know with whom they are doing business. Not knowing the real owners of the businesses one might be dealing with opens up all kinds of dangers, from reputational risk to outright fraud. Among the law-abiding firms using tax havens are plenty of crooks who are taking advantage this information black holes. Considering these jurisdictions' trade is not asking too many questions, it seems likely that terrorist groups are also using them to move money around the world.
Tax take would also be a more sustainable source of revenue for developing countries than aid and it is often these nations which lack the expertise to keep track of multinationals using offshore chicanery. American economist Gabriel Zucman recently estimated poor countries lose out on more than $240 billion a year.
The good news is that this Conservative Government has the chance to address the problem. As Tim Montgomerie has written in a piece for CapX, “the Tories are the party of law and order rather than the law of the jungle. Unethical business has to be punished.” In it they quote Sajid Javid's Conference speech, where the Business Secretary said: “Whether you're a bank rigging interest rates; a car manufacturer cheating on emissions; or a company not paying your fair share of tax be warned: we will come after you. Because free enterprise is not a free-for-all.”
As the Times editorial pointed out on Wednesday, “no other country in the world maintains and indulges a network of offshore tax havens as brazen in their defence of unwarranted secrecy as Britain's overseas territories.”
These overseas territories, from the British Virgin Islands to the Caymans, rely on the UK to function. Queen Elizabeth is their Head of State, Britain is their protector and their enabler. Next month David Cameron will host an anti-corruption summit in London. The Prime Minister has the power to require the UK's tax havens to publicly reveal companies' real owners, as will shortly be the case for the UK itself. If they did so, they would have the support of the country and their party.

Us East Coasters are green with envy once again this morning. Word on EV street is that Coulomb Technologies is expected to announce today that it'll be installing 1,600 new electric vehicles charging stations across California. The brand new Chargepoint stations will be funded by a $3.4 million grant from the California Energy Commission (CEC), and are sure to be yet another reason for Californians to ditch their gas guzzlers and hop in an EV.
So, what's the catch? Well, the main goal of installing the new charging stations is to help the State of California conduct research on electric vehicle charging patterns, habits and usage. But that's not to say that once the study is over, the stations will be dismantled. Hopefully, they'll stay in place – making Cali even greener and us New Yorkers a little more jealous. Hey, at least we have the subway.

These seven patents showcase some of the strangest inventions in baseball history
For decades, pitchers were required by rule to throw underhand. Until 1864, fly balls could legally be caught off one bounce. It took a long, long time for baseball to become the game we know and love -- years and years full of trial and error and all manner of detours.
And that's every bit as true of the equipment used on the field. Once upon a time, everything was open to negotiation -- from gloves to bats to the baseballs themselves. While that negotiation eventually led to the game we watch today, it also produced a whole lot of very weird ideas. And so, in honor of the brave innovators who sought to #disrupt the big leagues in all sorts of ridiculous ways, we present seven of the very weirdest baseball-related patents ever.
(And if you'd like to play along yourself, feel free to poke around the U.S. Patent Office's database.)
"Baseball cap with interchangeable logos" (Richard C. Soegel, 1996)
Everybody has their favorite team -- the one you grew up with, the one that you'll be loyal to forever. But what if your heart is big enough for two teams? What if your favorite team has been eliminated, and you want to devote yourself to another cause for the rest of the season? Well, then this hat is for you:
The idea is simple: Per Soegel's patent application, it's "a baseball cap configured to permit different logos to be interchangeably positioned on the cap." The logos themselves are outfitted with a hook fastener to allow for easy removal and application -- if you'd like your Yankee cap to suddenly morph into a Rangers cap, just take one logo off and swap another on.
"Base-ball catcher" (James Bennett, 1904)
Catcher has always been a rough occupation, but it was even more brutal in baseball's early years. Catchers initially wore no real equipment at all: They were conceived as glorified backstops, standing far away from the batter and simply concentrating on preventing each pitch from rolling away.
But as the game evolved and more and more pitchers began throwing overhand (and as the National League instituted a rule change mandating that third strikes must be caught on the fly) catchers crept closer and closer to home plate. By 1901, the NL had ruled that "catcher must stand within the lines of their position whenever the pitcher delivers the ball and within ten feet of the home base."
Still, catching equipment hadn't caught up to the new demands of the position. Which is where James Bennett comes in:
In 1904, Bennett thought they had the solution for all of the catcher's problems. He'd devised a wire cage, worn on the chest in lieu of a glove, which would catch each pitch and protect the catcher's hands until they had to throw the ball back to the pitcher.
As you can see from the diagram above, it was quite the contraption: The cage was reinforced on all sides with wood, and springs at the back protected the catcher's chest from the blow of each pitch. Once the ball passed through the open front end, it closed automatically, and an opening at the bottom of the cage would drop the ball into the catcher's hands.
"Base-ball base" (John C. O'Neill, 1875)
First-base umpires have a pretty tough job. They have to keep their eye on both the foot of a fast-moving runner and small white ball being whipped around the infield, and sometimes their margin for error is razor thin.
Which is why umpiring clinics have long taught prospective umps to make calls using their ears rather than their eyes -- listening to determine whether the sound of foot hitting bag beats the sound of ball hitting glove. And it's also why, back in 1875, John C. O'Neill came up with a new idea for a baseball base: Put a bell inside of it.
The moment the base was touched by a runner, the bell would sound, providing clear evidence to help the umpire make their call. As O'Neill explained: "In place of the bell mechanism, a sounding whistle, electrical connection, or any other suitable enunciating device may be employed, which indicates clearly and positively, without chance of error, the exact moment when the base is touched by the runner, so as to form a very useful and reliable device for base-ball players."
Who needs video replay?
"Ball bat" (Emile Kinst, 1890)
Unlike a lot of aspects of the game, the baseball bat has remained relatively unchanged since the 19th century. There have been tweaks over the years, of course -- sporting goods giant and one-time big leaguer Al Spalding once devised a "mushroom bat," whose heavy knob better balanced weight throughout the bat -- but even then, the broader idea remained the same.
And then there was this bad boy, dreamt up by Chicago inventor Emile Kinst in 1890:
Why the giant curve? To put greater spin on batted balls, as Kinst explained: "The object of my invention is to provide a ball-bat which shall produce a rotary or spinning motion of the ball in its flight to a higher degree than is possible with any present known form of ball-bat, and thus to make it more difficult to catch the ball."
Remember: Back in 1890, baseball gloves still weren't universally accepted, so a ball spinning more quickly would be far more difficult for fielders to corral. Alas, Kinst's idea never caught on -- but some were put into production.
"Playing ball" (Thomas W. Casey, 1943)
There's not much context to add here. In 1939, Thomas Casey applied for a patent for their new baseball, believing that it would be a big hit with young kids. In 1943, their patent was granted, and the world was blessed with the following:
Sadly, the face did not have a name, but we're confident that it will live on in your nightmares all the same.
"Electric base-ball register" (John M. Humphreys, 1903)
Most baseball patents are simply oddities, little detours lost to history. John Humphreys' idea, though, was straight out of a sci-fi novel. Just look at it:
Humphreys, like O'Neill before him, wanted to come up with a way to remove what they viewed as the game's "great defect -- to wit, that of undecided events and close decisions by the umpire as to base-hits, runs and putouts, so that by mere partiality the umpire is often enabled to practically decide the game."
Rather than anything so primitive as a bell in a base, though, they had a much grander idea: an entire electric signal system. Their invention would include a series of circuits set up across the infield that would send electric currents whenever a fielder had caught a ball or retired a baserunner. There was some serious engineering involved:
Unsurprisingly, Humphreys' system was a bit too convoluted to ever gain widespread popularity -- it involved fielders standing on a pair of metal plates near each base, for starters. But hey, we have knuckleball-tossing robots now, so who knows what's possible.
"Base-ball umpire's tally" (Robert Robyn, 1888)
These days, count indicators are ubiquitous on the diamond. It can be hard to count the hundreds of balls and strikes during the course of a game, as even the very best players will tell you.
In the late 19th century, though, they were a relatively novel idea -- early baseball was primarily an offensive and defensive exhibition, after all, with the pitcher mainly focused on allowing the ball to be put in play. (Until 1887, batters were even allowed to dictate the strike zone.)
But with the advent of sidearmed and then overhand pitching and a regular, fixed strike zone, umpires needed a way to keep track of the count -- and Robert Robyn's device did just that:
It was a simple construction: Two wires, one that ran the length of the umpire's hand and one that wrapped around one of their fingers. On the long wire were several tiles, which could be slid back and forth to mark balls and strikes.

STOCKHOLM — No cash? No problem — in Sweden at least, where cellphone and credit-card payments are quickly eclipsing coins and bills.
When Robin Teigland left their wallet at home, the man in line behind them agreed to pay for their groceries. Their gesture as much out of convenience as kindness — Teigland paid them back immediately via Swish, a mobile-banking app gaining traction throughout Scandinavia.
"Sweden has always been at the forefront of financial innovation,” said Teigland, a professor of business at the Stockholm School of Economics. “I never use cash. My kids laugh at me, because I only carry the five-crown coins I use to get a shopping cart at the store.”
Teigland isn't alone — cash now makes up just 2 percent of the Swedish economy, compared to 9.7 percent throughout the euro zone, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
The move to ditch the dosh has raised alarm bells for some Swedes wary of Big Brother's reach, but makes sense to others like Teigland who have strong faith in the country's financial institutions.
“I trust my bank here more than I do in the U.S.,” Teigland said. “In terms of protecting the consumer, I feel that there are more rules here in Sweden.”
They have plenty of opportunities to avoid using cash. A growing number of retailers are going cash-free and public buses in Stockholm will not take bills or coins. Johan & Nyström, a fashionable coffee chain with locations in Sweden's largest cities, recently announced it was no longer accepting cash at its stores.
Shoe stores, clothing shops and restaurants are increasingly reliant on card-only or mobile banking transactions, and some — like the brand Swedish Hasbeens — don't even have cash registers. Customers must pay using cards, or mobile-payments apps like Swish which allows for money transfers directly from a smartphone.
"We found and targeted a totally new segment that previously wasn't addressed by banks"
In an age where almost everyone carries a smartphone, the convenience of electronic and mobile banking is obvious. Even groups traditionally reliant on cash are learning to go without.
“It started by vendors coming to me saying that people didn't carry cash anymore. This was a big problem for us,” said Pia Stolt, chief executive of Situation Stockholm, a magazine only available through street vendors drawn from Stockholm's homeless population. “We realized we had to do something about this.”
The magazine — which costs vendors 25 Swedish krona ($2.97) to purchase — is then sold for 50 Swedish krona ($5.95). Each seller receives the profits from their sales, while the magazine's offices also serve as a community center for support and services for the homeless. None of this would be possible without an effective salesforce, and the vendors pushed Situation Stockholm to find a way to allow electronic payments.

“We definitely see that more and more people are able to buy the magazine, which is very good for sales,” Stolt said.
Now, each vendor carries a badge with a large number and details on how to pay by phone.
“The customer just puts in the number, and Swish takes 50 crowns from their bank account ... It takes about 10 seconds,” said Pierre Blom, who has sold the magazine for several years. “Without Situation Stockholm, I would be dead.”
Others are finding it more difficult to adapt to the move away from cash.
“Out of ten million people in Sweden, about one million have no Internet connection or don't use computers every day,” said Peter Sikström, secretary general of SPF Seniorerna, a lobby group for the retired and elderly. “One problem is that many elderlies are visually impaired. They can't see PIN codes, PIN pads, or writing on small screens.”
"For you as an individual there are definitely certain things you don't want big brother to be watching"
Many elderly prefer cash because it is easier for them to handle: they can feel the amounts involved by the different sizes and colors of bills, whereas with card transactions they are never totally confident they are paying the right amount, Sikström said.
The shift away from cash also unnerves some who worry about how consumer data collected electronically might be used.
“Why should I believe that this information can't be used negatively?” said Björn Eriksson, former national police chief of Sweden and a former head of Interpol. “What's the reason for when I buy a suit, I'll get offers to buy more suits because they have my address?”
Eriksson is worried about the degree to which Sweden has ceded control over its economic life to for-profit financial firms.
“The problem is that we moved power from the central bank to four major commercial banks,” Eriksson said. “They want to earn money — it's as simple as that.”

Mobile-payments entrepreneurs acknowledge the privacy concerns but say they're responding to consumers' needs.
“We're not trying to change consumer behavior," said Jacob de Geer, co-founder of the mobile payments company iZettle. "Ultimately, we're trying to change merchant behavior.”
Their company — which counts Visa, American Express and Banco Santander among its partners — makes mobile card readers which attach to a smartphone. IZettle's app allows retailers to make transactions, create inventories and track sales.
Setting up traditional registers for cash-and-card transactions can be costly and time-consuming for small businesses, de Geer explained. While iZettle's reader and app are free, the company charges a flat rate of between 2.75 and 1.5 percent for handling transactions. It also provides detailed data on all financial transactions using the app and reader.
“We found and targeted a totally new segment that previously wasn't addressed by banks. Most of these merchants were too small,” de Geer said.
Still, they stopped short of calling for a fully cash-free society.

While no renderings have been released yet, permits have finally been filed for Extell's future tower at 225 West 57th Street, the tower's height finally has a number: 1,550 feet.
For those keeping score, that's over 1.5 times as tall as One57, Extell's other supertall that just recently topped out, one block to the east. More impressive than topping One57 is the tower's dominance over New York's other new supertalls. The ‘roof heights' of both One World Trade Center and 432 Park Avenue fall just under 1,400 feet in height.
That means that the Nordstrom Tower will likely be New York's undisputed tallest building after completion, as filing applications typically only include a building's height to its highest occupied floor. With the addition of mechanical floors and any roof element that will likely be present, the tower's height could be well over 1,600 feet!
The application indicates the building will only have 88 floors. Part of the reason for the low number of floors – for a 1,500 foot building – is that the bottom of the structure will be occupied by Nordstrom, and the floors of the department store will have ceiling heights of at least twenty feet. That means the Nordstrom store alone could rise 200 feet or more.
The square footage of each of the building's sections adds up to over 1.2 million square feet, and the Nordstrom store looks as though it should have approximately 280,000 square feet of space.
Extell held a contest for the building's design, with the winning architect rumored to be Herzog & de Meuron. If Herzong & de Meuron did indeed win the contest–their most notable mark on the skyline is the soon-to-be-built 56 Leonard Street–then New Yorkers will definitely see something spectacular rise. Herzog & de Meuron's work is consistently of the highest caliber, and the Nordstrom Tower is the perfect opportunity for the firm to showcase their absolute best.
The application indicates the building will hold only 233 apartments, so the building will likely follow the super-luxury footsteps of 432 Park Avenue and One57.
Below is a leaked design from the competition, by the architectural firm SHoP. That version of 225 West 57th Street looked as if it would rise roughly 1,250 feet. Also noticeable is how the building is broken up into several different sections. If the DOB permits are any indication, that should be the case with the chosen design, as well. Renderings are eagerly anticipated.
Product Review: BCW Inner Sleeves
by mtggoldfish // May 13, 2015 Tweet
reviews sleeves
We're continuing our series on Supplies and Accessories Reviews today with a review of some BCW Inner Sleeves. What are inner sleeves you ask? They're used to doubling sleeve your cards; that is, you sleeve your card in a tightly fitting clear sleeve which you then put into regular card sleeves to provide extra protection to your cards. The correct technique is to put your card into the inner sleeve so that the opening is facing the bottom of the card, and then place the sleeved card into a regular sleeve. This ensures all edges of your card are properly protected.
Why Double Sleeve?
I double sleeve all my expensive, "permanent" decks. This includes my Modern and Legacy decks, and if I were to play Commander, my Commander deck as well. There are many benefits to double sleeving.
Water Damage
The extra sleeve helps protect against water damage. If you spill a drink over your cards, water may seep into the first sleeve, but will have a much harder time getting through the second sleeve. I've heard stories of people spilling Coke on their double-sleeved Legacy decks and having their cards escaping any damage.
Wear and Tear
Depending on your regular sleeves, sometimes the cards ride up and the top edge of the card touches or pops out of the top of the sleeve. The top of your card is then subject to general wear and tear from shuffling. Double sleeves help protect against this.
Inexpensive Insurance
If you're spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on cards, can't you spend a few bucks for some extra protection? If you save a $1 card with double sleeving, your investment has already paid off. Like I said before, I would never consider playing my Legacy deck without double sleeves.
Shuffling
This one is personal preference, but I find that shuffling in double sleeves much easier. My theory is the double sleeve adds a little bulget to the middle area of a sleeved-card, making mash shuffling much smoother and easier. However, people with small hands may find it harder to shuffle since the width of the deck is increased.
Reasons to Not Double Sleeve
I don't double sleeve everything; for example, I never double sleeve my limited decks. Here are some reasons to not double sleeve.
Time Consuming
This is probably the only legitimate reason. Resleeving a deck takes forever with double sleeves. Since the inner sleeve is tight, it's harder to put in and remove cards. As such, I would never consider double sleeving a Limited deck (maybe Modern Masters 2015 if I open a foil Goyf!). What I do is keep all my Legacy staples in inner-sleeves and never remove them, only shuffling aroudn the outersleeves when reconfiguring/building new decks. The cards stay in the inner sleeves and sit in storage boxes or trade binders.
Shuffling
As mentioned before, even though I generally like shuffling with double sleeves, those with small hands may find it difficult to shuffle. However, I think I would still bite the bullet on this one and just train myself if I had small hands if I were to play with a Black Lotus or a foil Tarmogoyf. Inner sleeves are so cheap that it's just not worth taking the risk.
BCW Inner Sleeves
Inner sleeves are pretty simple with the only things to evaluate are fit and clarity. The BCW Inner Sleeves fit Magic: the Gathering cards snuggly without any issues. They're also 100% transparent so they don't affect the readability of a card. The BCW Inner Sleeves double sleeve perfectly with common deck sleeves; I tried some out with my Dragonshields and the whole setup was perfect. The majority of my experience with double sleeved cards are with KMC Perfect Fits and Dragonshield Sleeves, and I saw no discernable difference between the KMC Perfect Fits and the BCW Inner Sleeves. Inner sleeves are a pretty simple product and the BCW Inner Sleeves performed their role perfectly. The only major decision here is price point; the BCW Inner Sleeves have an MSRP of $1.00 for a pack of 100, which is super cheap (compared to $4.50 for 100 for KMC Perfect Fits on Amazon). So I would definitely grab these if you're in the market for inner sleeves for double sleeving.

Lemon grilled chicken fettucine Alfredo is a kicked up version of classic fettucine Alfredo. Chicken breast, bursting with lemon flavor, is grilled and served with a creamy Alfredo sauce.
Here it is a few days before my step-sister's bridal shower (which I am in charge of) and as time slips by, I can't help but think of a comment that was left on my blog…
Oh, I love you hon, but really, do you want to know what it's like having me plan something? I have finally written out my menu and started shopping, and stressing about the deep clean I want to give this place tomorrow, and still have yet to decide 100% on favors. There's a row of vines in my yard that just decided to up and die that need to be removed and a dog and two very friendly cats that I have no idea where I'm putting.
I'm sure there are people that can make throwing a bridal shower an easy event with pink everywhere and ruffles and feathers about. (because I think most girls like pink, ruffles and feathers?) Put my in a room with all girls though, and you might as well be ready for the blaring your horn, high beams on, slamming your break because this deer ain't moving kind of panic that is going to set in. I work with guys. Hang out with guys. Understand guys (always with the exception of the one I'm dating). And most of all, am not at all intimidated by guys.
Girls. Women. Mothers. Oh yeah, panic. Lots and lots of panic.
But it's all okay with a plate of lemon grilled chicken Alfredo in front of you.

Now, please say a serenity prayer for me. It will help me get through this next weekend 😉
It's game on at Toronto City Hall. In the latest instalment of the long-running Need for Speed franchise, U.K.-based developer Criterion Games has brought the heat to downtown Toronto, using scenes from Nathan Phillips Square and city hall as backdrops for adrenaline-fueled police chases and tire-squealing burnouts.
Nathan Phillips Square is the scene of a chase in the video game Need For Speed: Most Wanted.
Released in late October, Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2 — the 19th game in the series — takes place in the fictional city of Fairhaven, a speed junkie's paradise with its sprawling, wide-open streets. Based on a “police versus street racer” theme, the game challenges players to become the “most wanted” racer in Fairhaven. Through the city's twisting streets, players can smash expensive sports cars through billboards and race through industrial parks, all the while avoiding spike strips and roadblocks, to escape cops on the chase. And at some point, the high-octane game will take drivers through a fairytale version of Nathan Phillips Square, a pristine concourse with a mountainous backdrop where the Freedom Arches double as car ramps.

If you've even dreamed of careening across the square in a Lamborghini or Aston Martin at 300 km/h, here's your chance. “It's something fun happening at city hall for a change,” said Councillor Peter Milczyn, who had yet to play the game but thought the city hall scenes were “really cool.” It's unclear how city hall made it onto the Need for Speed map; phone calls to the U.K. company were not returned by deadline. However it came to be, the scenery came as a welcome surprise to not just Milczyn, but also to members of Toronto's gaming community. “It's always exciting to see Toronto in a game,” said Jeff Alyanak, 23, a “very frequent customer” at A & C Video Games on Spadina St. “It's cool to be able to interact with the environment in a way you normally couldn't.”
In The 100 season 4, Bellamy and Clarke's relationship only grows stronger as they try to navigate the end of the world together.
This article was submitted by Hypable reader and dedicated Bellarke fan Yana Grebenyuk.
Over the course of the first three seasons of The 100, Clarke Griffin and Bellamy Blake have shifted from enemies to best friends and partners, their chemistry standing the test of time as they truly define the term ‘slow burn.'
But how long is too long for a ship to remain completely platonic?
Bellamy and Clarke have shared a variety of scenes, but the romantic subtext has been getting clearer with each season. In fact, it's surprising how many of their scenes are parallels of couples that have already become canon on the show.
The journey of Bellamy and Clarke finding themselves on different sides, only to then become leaders together and develop soft spots for one another is very reminiscent of Kane and Abby, whose relationship slowly grew from platonic to romantic over the course of The 100‘s first three seasons.
Both couples developed a connection that went beyond just co-leaders, and Kane/Abby is great example of how that kind of development can only get better with romance.
A more subtle parallel that not everyone may have noticed was to Luna and Derrick in the season 3 episode “Red Sky at Morning.” They were partners that led the Boat People together, mirroring the way Bellamy and Clarke were trying to save their people when they were on Luna's rig trying to convince them to become the next Commander.
On The 100, strong couples that lead their people together always seem to parallel Bellamy and Clarke, because their romantic connection is founded in co-leadership. While working together to save their people, Bellamy and Clarke have not only grown closer as friends, but as potential romantic interests.
It's not a stretch to suggest that Bellamy and Clarke are headed towards something more than co-leadership, too; the subtext is undeniable.
Why Bellamy and Clarke belong together
It always stays with me the way Bellamy and Clarke can share all their dark parts only with each other, and it's the other person that keeps them grounded.
No one else could really understand Bellamy or Clarke the way they understand each other. Everything that they have been through and will continue to go through has bonded them, making them feel comfortable sharing exactly how they feel.
They don't hold back in worry that they've got something to be ashamed of, or that they're undeserving of the other's support. Only with each other can they feel completely confident that, whatever they share, the other won't think less of them; they can simply bare every part of themselves, both good and bad, and really open up. Bellamy and Clarke show emotion in scenes together beyond what we've seen them have with anyone else.
During season 3, the partnership definitely hit a wall, with Clarke having chosen to leave their people because they felt too guilty about what happened. Them isolation in Polis took its toll not only on them but on Bellamy as well: Without Clarke in Arkadia, Bellamy was losing themselves after the Mount Weather deaths. They were stuck in their own blame, with Kane and Pike both playing to different parts of them thinking that they knew how to ease their pain best.
Eventually, Clarke and Bellamy met again in a chaotic confrontation, both pointing out that the other was at fault and wasn't making the best decisions. If that wasn't the greatest reminder that those two need one another, what is?

And it was only once they were back together towards the end of the season, leading and working with the others that progress was made in defeating ALIE.
Their friendship was stronger than ever, with Clarke holding Bellamy's hand before they went into the City of Light because that reassurance was exactly what they needed before risking their lives yet again.
I've also never seen a platonic couple hug as much as they have — or for that long, if we're being honest. And let's not forget Bellamy's reaction to touching Clarke during gun training in “Day Trip,” or their constant need to hold hands or touch one another. Bellamy and Clarke don't only have an emotional connection, they are also incredibly tactile with each other.
With all that in mind, there's still a lot of progress these two have to make before they can come together in a romantic way, including actually admitting to themselves that they care for the other beyond just a close partnership. But it's so clear to all the characters around them that I can't help wondering what's holding them back.
Everyone else sees it, so why can't they?
Clarke's previous loves Finn and Lexa both pointed out that they trust and cares for Bellamy. There was careful consideration put in to remind us that Clarke cares about Bellamy more than the others, even giving us a moment where they just breathes out in relief because he's safe after being stuck in Mount Weather.
Bellamy's feelings haven't been any less subtle, with ALIE actually saying that their loyalty to Gina couldn't rival what they felt for Clarke. Their feelings for their girlfriend didn't compare to the feelings they had for their partner — this was actually stated in canon.
Meanwhile characters like Kane, Murphy and Jaha give Bellamy glances when Clarke is around or mention how lucky they are to have each other. Why would there be such a focus on reminding us that all these characters casually think of Bellamy and Clarke as a team that cares very much about one another if we weren't supposed to factor that in?
Their casual touches and relentless desire to keep the other safe goes beyond them just being a team. Their friendship doesn't shut down the prospect of romance; it enhances the potential that would come from it.
But why can't Clarke and Bellamy just be friends?
Yes, it is possible that Bellamy and Clarke could just be platonic soulmates, destined to fit together perfectly but not pursue anything more. There's even reasons why that could make sense, but why should a relationship with this much potential stop at friendship?
Their chemistry and the way their scenes are framed go beyond platonic interactions, their hugs are shot from every possible angle and their conversations always show how much the two care for one another.
They have reached a point where one can't lead without the other, and where they literally can't survive without each other. Bellamy and Clarke's slow burn has the possibility to demonstrate how the ultimate other half for someone can be their best friend: They compete each other, with Bellamy being the heart and Clarke being the head. Their romantic chemistry is just icing on that cake, creating sparks in all their interactions.
The time is right for Bellarke to become canon
Clarke Griffin, the lead of The 100, has been through a lot in their personal life. She's to say goodbye to two great loves in a very short amount of time and hasn't exactly had time to mourn. It looks like they are slowly getting ready to move on from Lexa, but what happens after that?
Clarke could rebound with someone else, but then what? Them love life may not be the main plot of the show, but they have had love interests in some sense in every season. Finn and Lexa are the main ones, but there was also the appearance of Niylah, and there's no doubt in my mind that there will be something for them this season, too.
Realistically, Clarke can only have so many love interests before it feels like they are just created to keep the main character in some kind of relationship. It's also safe to say that Clarke probably won't find an epic love every season; she's an incredible person and it makes sense why everyone falls for her, but we'll all be very disappointed if they continue to have great loves while none of us in the real world will get more than one or two.
Clarke does deserve some happiness in the form of romance though, something that can be found in the form of their best friend and partner that she's grown to trust like no one else.
Bellamy, on the other hand, had only brief moments in season 1 where they had sex with women, and then moved on. Then in season 3 we were introduced, very briefly, to Gina, and their relationship seemed sweet even if Bellamy couldn't exactly share all the dark parts of themselves with them Bellamy and Gina were definitely worth rooting for, but we barely had time to do so before they were killed in the Mount Weather attack.
They haven't had a romantic storyline since Gina, and they aren't exactly looking for anyone. It would be great to see them acknowledge that they don't see a reason to when he's already found Clarke.
At this point, I also don't think introducing anything new would make sense for him. There's just not enough time for us as an audience to meet a new character that would be sold to us as a potential romance for Bellamy; nothing that could truly rival the four seasons of buildup that they have with Clarke.
There's really only so much room in Bellamy's heart at the moment, with them thinking about the safety of Octavia and Clarke, the two main women in their life, as well as their people.
Why something needs to happen between Bellamy and Clarke in ‘The 100' season 4
It made sense to slow down the progression between Bellamy and Clarke in seasons 1-3, but this may be the time to finally push those two a bit closer.
As hopeful as we are about a season 5 renewal, the show isn't running on endless time, and both characters are at a point in their plots where it makes sense for them to start realizing their feelings for one another.
Bellamy's scenes have pointed to them beginning to realize their feelings for Clarke, and while Clarke is obviously still grieving for for their past loves, there's nothing like a potential end of the world to make you reconsider the time you may have while you keep trying to stay alive.
The thought that has gone into each interaction between these two can only serve as proof of Bellamy and Clarke making their way from friendship to romance. Bellamy and Clarke getting together, or at least acknowledging their feelings, is really the only logical next step at this point.
Over the first three episodes of season 4, Bellamy and Clarke have shared several scenes meant to serve as reminders that they can't survive without the other. Writing each other's names on the list was Bellamy and Clarke making sure that either they survived or died together. If Clarke was going to include Bellamy's name, knowing that they aren't exactly looking to be a priority, then they were going to make sure they were with them because they can't do any of this without them
The core of their survival comes from them working together, and it's through working together that they keep each other centered and succeed in figuring out the issue each season. So why is their progression from friends to lovers moving at an ironically slow pace while the radiation around them is quickly catching up?
Why Bellarke matters to me
Personally, for me, Bellarke matters because of the thought and depth that has gone into their story. Their progression has only gained momentum with each new season, and there's really too much attention to detail for all of that to be considered random.
There's also the topic of the representation they offer together and as individuals: Clarke's representation as a bisexual lead is wonderful already, but being in a happy relationship with Bellamy would only continue that journey. And Bellamy is already breaking barriers as one of very few Asian men in a lead role. If Bellamy and Clarke became a couple, Bellamy would be seen in that romantic light, highlighting the fact that an Asian man is very much a viable love interest for the hero in this story.
Related: The 100-star Bob Morley previews Bellamy's journey to leadership in season 4… and beyond?
As for within the show, being together would only take the Bellamy/Clarke relationship to another level. They would develop a different dynamic, a more vulnerable one that could make the world just a little bit lighter for them. Their trust would only deepen and there would be a new layer to their already very well-crafted relationship.
Even though it made sense initially for the writers to take their time with this couple, in due time this marathon should run its course. This inevitable relationship will happen at some point, but there might be a need to speed it up a bit, because those two are ready, and so are their fans.
If there was another story worth telling before those two found their way to each other then I'm sure us waiting wouldn't be a problem. But at this point, all paths lead back to Bellarke, and we're ready to go on that journey with these characters.
‘The 100‘ airs Wednesday nights at 9/8c on The CW
Back when Good Omens first came out, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman had plans for a sequel—one that never came to pass, just like the planned movie adaptation of the novel. But now ideas from the sequel are being given new life in Amazon and the BBC's TV miniseries remake, in the form of Jon Hamm.
Amazon announced via press release this morning that Hamm would be joining the six-part miniseries as the Archangel Gabriel, a minor character in the original book's preparation for the divinely-planned end of the world. But according to a statement from Gaiman, Gabriel and their heavenly host of fellow angels were going to play a much larger role in Good Omens' sequel—an idea now being incorporated into the new show:
Once we had finished writing Good Omens, back in the dawn of prehistory, Terry Pratchett and I started plotting a sequel. There would have been a lot of angels in the sequel. When Good Omens was first published and was snapped up for the first time by Hollywood, Terry and I took joy in introducing our angels into the plot of a movie that was never made. So when, almost thirty years later, I started writing Good Omens for TV, one thing I knew was that our angels would have to be in there. The leader of these angels is Gabriel.  They are everything that Aziraphale isn't: he's tall, good-looking, charismatic and impeccably dressed. We were fortunate that Jon Hamm was available, given that they are already all of these things without even having to act. We were even more fortunate that he's a fan of the books and a remarkable actor.

Presumably Gaiman's plans for Gabriel have been altered a bit in the nearly three decades between Good Omens' release and its revival on TV, but it's fascinating to see that hooks for the follow up that never came to be are going to be making their way into the new show.
Good Omens is set to release through Amazon Prime Video in 2019, followed by a TV broadcast on BBC 2 in the UK later that year.
After their most recent outing, an utterly dominant performance over Mark Munoz at UFC on Fuel TV 4, Chris Weidman has propelled themselves into the upper tier of the middleweight division. To some, they are the number one contender to the longtime middleweight king, Anderson Silva, while to others, they still have yet to prove their claim.
While the general opinion on what they deserve is split, Chris has been very vocal about where they place themselves in the division. They want a chance to fight a man they honor. Recently UFC Tonight caught up with Weidman, and Ariel Helwani asked them about what the UFC has told them so far. Here's what Weidman said:
From what I'm being told, I think it's a fight they would want to make happen, but now, it's just confusing. I don't really know what's going on, I'm hoping to find out maybe from Dana White, hopefully I'll get a little meeting and find out, but I'm really just clueless at this point.
What they said there lines up pretty well with what he's already said on numerous occasions. The UFC has told them it's a fight they want to make, but these kinds of negotiations can be difficult, and he's not completely in the loop.
I mean, I didn't take a couple of fights right after guys were challenging me, like Vitor Belfort, and I didn't take them because the UFC didn't want me to take them. They wanted me to, you know, wait for that Anderson Silva fight, but now it's up in the air so I don't know what's going on.
This quote makes it a bit more interesting. Some people had been saying that Weidman would need another fight or two to get a title shot, mentioning names like Vitor Belfort. What Weidman says shows that the UFC may have actually wanted to get a fight with Silva put together, if they were telling them to turn down big fights like that.
You can check out some more choice quotes and the video from UFC Tonight after the jump.
When asked about how they feel about waiting for a possible title shot, and how long he's willing to wait for that opportunity to come, Chris had this to say:
I don't have any deadline, but I am young, and I want to make the most of my career. You know, I have a lot of respect for Anderson Silva just like everybody else does, I think he's the greatest of all time, and I've looked up to them and I still do. I definitely think I'm the biggest challenge and they know, and their management knows I'm the biggest challenge. I would expect him, if he's the guy who we think they are, to take that challenge and try to beat that challenge.
Chris clearly wants a title shot, and he's willing to stand up for what they think about their position in the division. Whether that will get them what they want or not, has yet to be seen, but this matchup is likely to happen some day. Here's what they said when asked to speak directly to the champ, should they be watching:
Hey man, just give me a chance. Obviously I believe that I'm gonna beat you, so it's tough for me to tell you to do, but you had one fight when you got the chance and you were able to make the best of it, just give me my opportunity, and I think it's gonna be a great fight.
Global banking businesses will face nightmarish decisions if the UK loses its access to euro-clearing trading as part of the Brexit negotiations, the Japanese ambassador to the UK has warned.
Koji Tsuruoaka said that Japanese companies would be among those affected as they emphasised the seriousness of what is at stake as the UK prepares for Brexit. Some EU countries are determined to stop the UK retaining its euro-clearing rights post-Brexit, so the business would be transferred to Frankfurt and Paris.
Could Paris really steal City of London crown after Brexit? Read more
Tsuruoaka said most global financial service providers, including Japanese companies, have concentrated resources in London because it was the most efficient way for global capital to operate.
Removal of UK euro-clearing rights “is not something that would be welcomed at all by the financial service providers,” they said. “Companies have come a long way to establish the most efficient clearing house here in London. Now to be told to go elsewhere, it would be a huge challenge.” They added that no other city represented “a natural answer” as a substitute to London and it would be impossible for banks to discuss with each other where to relocate.
“It would be nightmarish if you think about the business decision they would be forced to make,” they said.
Since the euro was first used as a currency in 1999, London has acted as the centre of euro-clearing for derivatives, despite not being within the single currency area. The French have insisted that no one will be prepared to see the main clearing house outside of the EU in the wake of Brexit.
Tsuruoaka also suggested that it might be necessary for the UK to negotiate an interim Brexit deal with the EU due to the complexity of the talks. There is a two-year negotiating period that would start once Theresa May invokes article 50, the means by which the UK notifies the EU of its plan to leave. The foreign affairs select committee has begun an inquiry into the possibility of an interim deal in case this is not long enough to settle a full agreement.
Speaking to an EU Lords select committee, the ambassador said: “You may not be able to come to the final conclusion of the permanent agreement because of the time constraint, or because of the difficult need for co-ordination.” They said a transitional deal may “allow business to continue as usual”. They said that ideally the final agreement would not change how UK-based companies accessed the EU single market.
Japan is one of the biggest overseas investors in the UK but is alarmed that post-Brexit it may see the EU impose tariffs, rules-of-origin restrictions and other barriers.
The ambassador said they have been advising Japanese companies to keep calm and not to jump to any conclusions about the need to relocate. But they knew businesses were starting to research different scenarios.
But they added whenever a final agreement on access to the single market is reached it would be desirable to include a transparent schedule to which any changes would be implemented. “You do not enact laws right after you have adopted them. You have a notice period of, say, a year. You do not change a system of trade all of a sudden to be implemented from the next day onwards.”
They also spelt out the consequences of the loss of access to the EU single market for the Japanese auto industry and not just to Nissan, which has already announced it will reinvest in its Sunderland car plant.
Pointing out that a car involves as many as 20,000 parts, they said it was critical that these parts flow freely along a two-way street without tariffs, taking the final product to the EU continental market. They explained: “If there are tariffs on both sides, the company suffers and that is going to be a very costly procedure that is not currently in place. It applies to all manufacturing. If you put some artificial barriers in the way it is by definition going to be costly and inefficient. That is what the Japanese automative companies are concerned about.”
They added the EU was refusing to engage with Japan on Brexit for the time being because they say they have not even received an official notification for the UK and so cannot discuss Brexit with any third party. “An engaged dialogue has yet to start between the EU and Japan,” they said.
They said they had not been given the reasons why Nissan had decided to reinvest in Sunderland and did not know the precise assurances given to the company by the UK government. “Nissan [is] part of Sunderland and in the Japanese culture when you are part of the community, you do not abruptly break up. They are like family. They are aware of their responsibilities to the people of Sunderland.”
Tracking technology could help curb the number of feral camels in the outback because of their instinctive herd-seeking behaviour
“Judas camels” wearing tracking technology could help curb the number of feral camels in central Australia, a study has found.
The Murdoch University study found that the “Judas technique”, which involves using an animal to lead shooters to feral herds, can effectively be used against camels because they don't live in family groups, instead shifting from one herd to another. This means a “Judas camel” can lead shooters to many herds.

Associate professor Peter Spencer, whose previous work included working out the lineage of presidential racing camels in the United Arab Emirates, said a genetic analysis of 1,000 feral camels in outback Western Australia showed they lived in “very, very loose fusion-fission groups”.
The study trialled the use of 10 Judas camels. The technique involves fixing a satellite or radio tracker to one camel and then tracking it back to a herd.
“It's usually a female, because they are a lot more accepted moving in and out of different groups,” Spencer said.
“It will go out and find a group and then you can go and find the group and control it – hopefully not including the Judas camel – and then that Judas camel will go and find another group.”
The method is similar to the traditional use of “Judas goats” in abattoirs, where one goat is used to lead other animals calmly into the slaughterhouse.
The camels are “controlled” by being rounded up and shot from helicopters.

An audit of an aerial camel cull in 2003, conducted by veterinarian Jordan Hampton for the Australian feral camel management project, found that 99.6% of camels died within four seconds of being shot and 83% died instantly, making it a relatively humane death.
Spencer said species that formed close matriarchal bonds, like elephants, did not make good Judases, because they were unable to move on from the killing of their family.
They said results showed the technique could be effective in controlling Australia's feral camels, which remained surprisingly elusive despite their massive population.
“You can go out and search, you can look, you can see some camels, you can go back to get your gear and your buddies, but when you come back to find the camels they're gone,” Spencer said.
There are estimated to be between 600,000 and 1m camels in the arid centres of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia.
About 10,000 camels were introduced to Australia in the 19th century for use as pack animals, but Spencer said the population exploded in the late 1900s and now doubled every eight years.
Culling programs kill between 20,000 and 30,000 camels a year, but Spencer said that number would need to be increased to 60,000 just to keep pace with population growth.
“We are well short of being able to get to a situation where we are having an effect on the population,” they said.
Spencer said the ecological damage a 100-strong herd of 700kg camels could do to fragile desert ecosystems was as bad as damage caused by feral cats.

“It looks like someone has just come through with a whipper-snipper,” they said.
They have also been known to push over windmills and destroy toilet blocks in search of water.
“If you have a dripping tap, they will rip it from the wall,” Spencer said.
For years Mexico seemed stuck in “just enough” ISP connection speeds. 5-15 mbps, just enough to get HD streaming content, just enough to for some online gaming without terrible lag, and just enough to convince ourselves that there was “High Speed” internet. For example, in Q1-Q2 2014, average download speeds in Mexico were just 12.11 Mbps as compared to today's average of 18.19 Mbps. Latency shrank in the same time period from 65 ms to 49 ms. Although, there is still some room for growth considering Mexico is 65th in the world on fixed broadband download speeds.
When we look at the “fastest” ISP results - which shows the top tier of all residential connection speeds - it becomes clear that even the fifth place finisher would have been considered “fast” only a few years ago. Mexico can finally say it has moved beyond “just enough,” and in the case of the winner, warped right past it.
Axtel is this report's fastest ISP with blistering 155.01 Mbps download and 127.99 Mbps upload speeds, and with an almost imperceptible 2 ms latency. These are the sort of results you need for 4K streaming, PS4 remote play, and Smart Homes. It bodes well for consumers that this quality of connection is available in Mexico, albeit at a greater cost. It's also shockingly far ahead of it's nearest competitor.
Second place is held by Totalplay, which shows up with an 88.28 Mbps download and 19.39 Mbps upload speed. The company invested $400 million since February 2015 to make technology improvements to their network. Totalplay, which is active in 20 cities in Mexico, already offers fiber-to-the-home. But similar to other providers in Mexico, they are looking to enhance their customers' triple-play experience with other services that attract new subscribers. They recently launched GameFly, which allows online gamers access to streaming video games, and have gone so far as to make their network available to competitors' video streaming services in order to boost content provided to customers.
Moving to the third place ISP, izzi, we drop down towards less surprising connection speeds compared to Mexico's countrywide speed averages: 31.58 Mbps download and 4.88 Mbps upload. izzi, which is owned by Televisa, the largest television network in the Hispanic world, used to be known as Cablevision before it was relaunched with a flashy new brand and more competitive fees when compared to marketshare leader Telmex (also owned by América Móvil). izzi when pronounced by spanish speakers sounds a bit like “easy.” Televisa has recently launched its Netflix competitor called “Blim” which has a preferential price for izzi customers. The service, however, has been mocked relentlessly for offering a subpar catalogue stocked mostly with Televisa's own content (primarily soap operas). izzi also ran afoul of Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) in May for ad campaigns that “Did not provide the public with complete and accurate information on the services provided.” izzi claimed it offered “3 times faster internet” and was forced to pull the ads.
Fourth place goes to Megacable, a regional carrier that has a presence in 25 states of the Mexican Republic. The past two quarters, Megacable notched a 29.39 Mbps download and 8.99 Mbps upload. Megacable, along with Televisa's izzi, used to offer a “Triple-Play” option under the YOO brand which they've had to divest themselves of in order to avoid further fines from Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT). They had already been fined for similar “collusion practices” in 2014.
Christie's action is seen as a victory for gay rights groups that want them to endorse same-sex marriage.

Christie's decision seen as a victory for gay rights groups
Republican has walked line on same-sex marriage
Supporters of same-sex marriage say they have greater hope New Jersey will soon allow it after Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation Monday banning the controversial practice of "conversion" therapy for gay youth.
New Jersey is only the second state in the nation, after California, to forbid licensed therapists from using therapy to try to change the sexual orientation of minors. But the state is the only one in the Northeast not to allow gay couples to marry: Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year.
Christie said that while they are concerned about "government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children,'' they sided with expert opinion from the American Psychological Association that so-called conversion therapy can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in teenagers.
The conversion therapy law "sets a national precedent on not allowing this abuse to go forward,'' said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, which supported the ban.
STORY: Christie walks line on gay marriage
Christie has said that they believe that sexual preference is a trait people are born with and that, although their Catholic faith calls homosexuality a sin, they do not.
"He recognizes what many opponents of marriage equality do not recognize, which is that gay people are not in need of treatment,'' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. "That's certainly an important statement to make and they made that with their signing of the bill.'' Supporting same-sex marriage is "a natural next step,'' Lesniak said.
Christie is cruising to re-election in November despite New Jersey's Democratic lean. But as a likely 2016 presidential candidate who will have to appeal to party conservatives in early primary contests, Christie has walked a careful line on gay issues.
When they vetoed the same-sex marriage law last year, they said the state should hold a referendum on the issue instead. In June, they criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, the governor said they are "adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it. They also appointed the first openly gay judge to the state's Supreme Court.
"We welcome what they did today, we're glad they agree that people don't choose their sexuality and we think that means that every person and every couple in New Jersey should be treated with full respect and that means freedom to marry,'' said Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group.
Gay marriage advocates are pursuing two strategies. A court case argues that New Jersey's civil unions law does not protect equal treatment for gay couples; a decision is expected next month but may be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Gay rights groups are also intensively lobbying state legislators to overturn Christie's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. An override must occur before mid-January.
"I truly believe, if you look at this bill, if you look at the massive swell of support, there is definitely a road to getting this override accomplished.'' ' Stevenson said. The conversion therapy ban passed with a vetoproof majority. "It definitely shows what the mindset of the legislature is.''
But Christie has forbidden Republicans who support same-sex marriage to overturn their veto, gay rights advocates say. "The governor's position is that you don't override their vetoes. And we haven't been able to,'' says Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat.
Groups lobbying for same-sex marriage hope Republican legislators will be more willing to vote against the governor after November, when Christie, if re-elected, would become a lame duck. "I wouldn't expect their colleagues to vote against their wishes right before the election. That might be a little too much,'' Lesniak said.
The political climate is quickly changing in favor of gay marriage, Solomon said. "From my experience with and understanding of New Jersey, understanding of where voters are, where their constituents are, and how far Republicans have moved on this issue, particularly Republicans from the northeast – we're not talking about Alabama here – this should not be impossible at all.''

Mr Farage also disclosed that they have now hired bodyguards to protect them after they were jostled and threatened during a visit to Scotland this month.
The news came as senior backbench Tory MP David Ruffley said Mr Cameron had a year until the European elections to prove that their political strategy works. They said: “David Cameron has got 12 months to show that their strategy works.”
In an interview, Mr Farage said that they could envisage coming to some sort of arrangement with “around 20” Eurosceptic Tory MPs. This would see the MPs standing on a joint Conserative/Ukip ticket at the next election, expected to be in May 2015.
Speaking hours after the interview in the Sunday Times was published, Nadine Dorries, a Conservative MP who has said they want to run on a joint ticket, said that they thought as many as 100 Tory MPs could agree to such an arrangement.
They told Sky News' Murnaghan : “There are about a hundred MPs in Parliament who actually have not voted for increases into the EU budget, they have voted for a referendum, they did vote against gay marriage, they would be supportive of grammar schools if they had the option.
“If UKIP were standing against those MPs they would be standing on almost exactly the same values and principles so all this seems a nonsense where you have two people who think and have the same values standing against each other.”
Ms Dorries said they themselves would talk to the team in their party association before agreeing to any arrangement.
They said: “Every Conservative MP has to be adopted by their Conservative association and then they could seek endorsement from UKIP because after all we have just recently voted to change the law to allow that to happen.
“The interesting thing is that David Cameron said we don't do pacts or deals. In that case, I'm not sure what the coalition is. It may be necessary going forward.”
Speaking on the same programme, senior backbench Tory MP David Ruffley said Mr Cameron had a year until the European elections to prove that their political strategy works. They said: “David Cameron has got 12 months to show that their strategy works.”
They said that this year's promised European Referendum Bill could help to bring the party together. But they added that “next May could be a flashpoint”.
They continued: “There'll be 12 months before the election and some of the colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy.
“I don't think Ukip are going to win seats but they could split the Conservative vote if they're very strong and let Labour through in those marginal seats.”
Mr Ruffley added: “We need more vision, we need the language from Cameron, we need their A-team going out there and telling people what we're doing now.”
Mr Farage, who until now has been able to walk around Westminster without any fears for their safety, also said they had now had to hire bodyguards. They said: “I have to think about security for the first time ever, I'm afraid. Horrible.
"What I've done for the last 15 years is to book halls all over the country, chuck out a load of leaflets, perhaps take out a local newspaper advert and just turn up, park outside, bowl in, do my bit, meet the people afterwards. Sadly, that's going to change.”
Ukip is also mounting a fresh drive to recruit more white working class Labour voters. A new party political broadcast is due out next Sunday.
We've been doing a lot of work with the 2016 NFL Consensus Board over the week, but there are still a few things left to do—including grading drafts.
If we're willing to evaluate players and put round grades on them before the draft, we can at least get a preliminary understanding of how teams did relative to how people graded those players. People always seem to hesitate grading drafts until three years after it's concluded and it's fine to argue that we don't really know: we don't. But we also don't have zero information, and we know how good a lot of very smart people thought players are.
So, we'll take the amount of draft capital spent by teams and measure it against the amount of value gained. In this case, we use the Jimmy Johnson trade chart (or rather, an equation derived to match the chart) to give say the first overall pick costs 3000 points of capital and the highest-ranked player gives a team 3000 points of capital.
Then we'll divide the points gained by the points lost. This process tends to unfairly hurt those with the 1st overall pick because the best opportunity to gain the best player results in zero net value gained. Still, it's a good proxy for figuring out if a team picked the best player according to the board, with the capital they have. We can also add any picks gained in future rounds as returns on the day by using a one-round discount and giving them points for trading for future picks.
Given the early returns on predicting actual NFL performance, I'm alright using this board for evaluative purposes—generally speaking, if you get a bad grade, the players you draft have historically not met expectations.
Below are the teams ranked in order of return-on-investment. Also included are the total return, so we can see which teams got the most talent in the draft.
NFL team Total ROI Jacksonville Jaguars 7037.74 127.1% Buffalo Bills 5808.25 124.4% Minnesota Vikings 5238.74 124.0% Cincinnati Bengals 5251.28 121.4% Washington Redskins 4654.01 112.3% Miami Dolphins 5749.43 109.3% Chicago Bears 6429.04 105.7% Seattle Seahawks 5820.82 105.2% Green Bay Packers 4754.43 103.7% Detroit Lions 5535.61 99.5% Pittsburgh Steelers 3967.45 98.5% New Orleans Saints 4253.00 98.3% San Francisco 49ers 6363.91 95.3% New York Jets 4150.96 93.6% New York Giants 4679.70 93.2% Denver Broncos 4165.70 93.0% San Diego Chargers 5756.78 92.9% Dallas Cowboys 5904.82 92.6% Baltimore Ravens 6951.00 91.6% Oakland Raiders 4502.68 90.1% Tennessee Titans 6634.58 87.7% Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4654.92 86.7% Cleveland Browns 7555.51 85.5% Houston Texans 3732.49 84.7% Indianapolis Colts 4171.61 84.4% Kansas City Chiefs 4106.64 83.0% Philadelphia Eagles 4093.49 82.6% Los Angeles Rams 4080.47 81.6% Carolina Panthers 2824.85 81.3% Arizona Cardinals 2756.25 81.1% Atlanta Falcons 3026.50 71.3% New England Patriots 3015.12 68.0%
Grabbing Myles Jack in the second round was huge for the Jaguars, as was grabbing Jalen Ramsey in the first. But that alone isn't enough to win the top spot; they gained value with their picks of Sheldon Day, Brandon Allen and Tyrone Holmes.
Buffalo is the only team to gain value on every single pick. Shaq Lawson, Reggie Ragland, Adolphus Washington, Cardale Jones, Jonathan Williams, Kolby Listenbee and Kevon Seymour were all ranked higher than the pick the Bills grabbed them at, and though there are very real questions about things like where Williams fits on the depth chart and so on, the board doesn't know about needs and likes the talent they grabbed.
The Minnesota Vikings had the best grade of the 2014 draft, the second-best grade of the 2015 draft and sit here third in 2016. Overall, they have by far the best grade of the three drafts combined. More on that below.
One thing to note: the quarterbacks picked at the top were ranked lowly. That doesn't mean it was bad to select them. We can include modifiers for positional value and regrade the draft by using the amount of capital invested in each position over the last decade as a guide. Here's what that regraded, position-adjusted draft table looks like.
NFL team Total ROI Buffalo Bills 6269.04 134.2% Jacksonville Jaguars 7237.14 130.7% Minnesota Vikings 5199.73 123.1% Cincinnati Bengals 5190.45 120.0% Miami Dolphins 6255.37 118.9% Green Bay Packers 5243.39 114.4% Washington Redskins 4704.66 113.5% Chicago Bears 6680.91 109.8% Seattle Seahawks 5950.09 107.6% Denver Broncos 4556.73 101.8% Detroit Lions 5639.46 101.3% Pittsburgh Steelers 4048.16 100.5% Baltimore Ravens 7556.62 99.6% San Francisco 49ers 6635.91 99.4% New York Jets 4404.50 99.3% New Orleans Saints 4283.58 99.0% Oakland Raiders 4913.99 98.3% Dallas Cowboys 6211.07 97.4% San Diego Chargers 5845.82 94.3% Philadelphia Eagles 4672.60 94.3% Los Angeles Rams 4662.48 93.3% Tennessee Titans 7014.47 92.7% New York Giants 4571.54 91.0% Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4844.95 90.2% Cleveland Browns 7965.16 90.2% Indianapolis Colts 4322.43 87.5% Kansas City Chiefs 4264.65 86.1% Arizona Cardinals 2817.94 83.0% Houston Texans 3644.51 82.7% Carolina Panthers 2824.62 81.3% New England Patriots 3060.73 69.1% Atlanta Falcons 2912.98 68.6%
The Eagles and Rams move up because of the value provided by the quarterbacks, but Jacksonville moves down because cornerbacks and off-ball linebackers valued a little less than front four players. The Dolphins move up a little bit, but honestly their only good move was selecting Laremy Tunsil.
They gained valued with their seventh-round picks, but Xavien Howard, Kenyan Drake, Leonte Carroo, Jakeem Grant and Jordan Lucas were all graded lower than where they were picked. While I would personally put Carroo higher, I would also put Grant lower. This was probably a bad draft for them (if the board is meaningful), but it was graded well here.
On the other end of it, I'm guessing the Raiders draft was better than the grade if only because of how highly I personally value Karl Joseph.
Conversely, the New England Patriots consistently rank at the bottom, which isn't surprising—especially because they took a long snapper in the fifth round the year prior and frequently take gambles on injured talent, and they don't seem too worse for wear. For the last two years, the Seahawks were also graded poorly, but this year escaped that fate. Here are the three-year totals:
NFL team Total ROI Minnesota Vikings 19355.18 118.3% Pittsburgh Steelers 14527.55 104.5% Jacksonville Jaguars 19159.89 104.3% Buffalo Bills 13567.66 103.9% Cincinnati Bengals 14734.90 103.7% Miami Dolphins 15251.56 101.7% Chicago Bears 16725.65 101.5% Baltimore Ravens 17564.66 96.6% Detroit Lions 14777.02 96.0% Houston Texans 15569.78 95.3% Tennessee Titans 18040.08 94.5% Oakland Raiders 15891.73 93.8% Green Bay Packers 13496.02 93.5% New York Jets 15010.14 93.4% Cleveland Browns 21538.53 92.9% Atlanta Falcons 14392.42 92.1% San Diego Chargers 12730.99 90.7% Washington Redskins 13261.87 88.8% San Francisco 49ers 17177.38 88.7% Carolina Panthers 9755.52 86.9% New Orleans Saints 13007.75 86.5% Dallas Cowboys 12990.61 85.7% Philadelphia Eagles 11391.57 85.3% Denver Broncos 10365.14 83.2% Indianapolis Colts 9449.31 82.8% New York Giants 12363.48 82.5% Tampa Bay Buccaneers 13812.17 81.6% Kansas City Chiefs 11361.29 81.0% Rams 14835.42 79.7% New England Patriots 11205.35 78.5% Arizona Cardinals 9522.10 75.1% Seattle Seahawks 9377.57 70.2%
I imagine it's not a coincidence that the three teams at the bottom of the grades are in the playoffs but I can't tell exactly why. The board does a very good job at predicting performance, and the next several teams on the bottom of the list have drafted poorly overall—though Tampa Bay may get some leniency because it's hard to gain value at the top and because Jameis Winston and Mike Evans are looking pretty good.
The Minnesota Vikings really do a good job of finding undervalued players and making plays to get them, at least if the board is right. Which, again, we think there's evidence of.
At the very least, this is a fun exercise in figuring out a different way to follow the draft.
In 2010, Isaac Rosenbloom complained to a fellow student after their Oral Communications class that a grade they received on an assignment was "going to fuck up [his] entire GPA." Rosenbloom's professor at Hinds Community College in Mississippi overheard the comment, threatened them with "detention" (which Hinds, like most colleges, did not have), and submitted a disciplinary complaint to the school. Rosenbloom—a husband and father of two children—was found guilty of "flagrant disrespect" and involuntarily withdrawn from the class, causing them to lose their financial aid eligibility and threatening their paramedic training. With FIRE's help, Rosenbloom was able to obtain assistance from attorneys Robert B. McDuff and Sibyl Byrd, who helped secure a settlement in their favor.
"If it wasn't for FIRE," says Rosenbloom in our latest video, "I wouldn't have a career. I would be delivering pizzas instead of saving lives."
Government owned firm HAL has unveiled its twin engine 12 ton class multi-role helicopter at Aero India 2017 where more than 900 delegates including 25 foreign delegates from seven countries are participating.

–
New Delhi (Sputnik)India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has unveiled the full scale model of Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH) at 11th edition of Aero India in Bengaluru. India's government owned company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited aims to indigenously develop 12-ton class IMRH with service ceiling of around 20,000 feet, 3,500 kg payload and a seating capacity of 24. Company has also planned to develop dedicated naval version of the helicopter. Indian firm claims that IMRH will be powered by yet to be identified twin engines and will have state of the art mission systems to meet the Utility and Armed Roles of Indian Armed Forces.
“Besides the domestic defense orders, HAL will target export orders, aiming to replace the ageing fleet of similar class of helicopters that are operational in more than 40 Air Forces around the world,” says official of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd on Tuesday. HAL hopes to have the first flight of IMRH in six to seven years. However, design and development of IMRH will only commence once armed forces put up their demand.
India needs more than 400 multi-role helicopters having different versions. HAL claims that IMRH will have high strategic roles in Tactical Troop Transport, Casualty evacuation, Under Slung Load, Combat Search & Rescue, Anti Surface Operations, Off-shore Operations, VIP/VVIP Transport and Air Ambulance. “The Army/IAF version will have a significant hovering and payload capability especially at high altitude,” reads a statement released by HAL.
Sources say that IMRH can be good substitute for the Russian built Mi-17 and also fit the Navy's requirement for medium-lift helicopters.

So much for Hagar the Horrible, with their stay-at-home wife, Helga. Viking women may have equaled men moving to England in medieval invasions, suggests a look at ancient burials.
Vikings famously invaded Eastern England around 900 A.D., notes Shane McLeod of the Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Studies at the University of Western Australia in the Early Medieval Europe journal, starting with two army invasions in the 800's, recounted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. The Viking invaders founded their own medieval kingdom, 'the Danelaw', in Eastern England.
"There is some archaeological evidence for early Norse female settlement, most obviously oval brooches, but this evidence is minimal. The more difficult to date evidence of place names, personal names, and DNA samples derived from the modern population suggests that Norse women did migrate to England at some stage, but probably in far fewer numbers than Norse men," begins the study.
However, McLeod notes that recently, burials of female Norse immigrants have started to turn up in Eastern England. "An increase in the number of finds of Norse-style jewellery in the last two decades has led some scholars to suggest a larger number of female settlers. Indeed, it has been noted that there are more Norse female dress items than those worn by men," says the study.
So, the study looked at 14 Viking burials from the era, definable by the Norse grave goods found with them and isotopes found in their bones that reveal their birthplace. The bones were sorted for telltale osteological signs of which gender they belonged to, rather than assuming that burial with a sword or knife denoted a male burial.
Overall, McLeod reports that six of the 14 burials were of women, seven were men, and one was indeterminable. Warlike grave goods may have misled earlier researchers about the gender of Viking invaders, the study suggests. At a mass burial site called Repton Woods, "(d)espite the remains of three swords being recovered from the site, all three burials that could be sexed osteologically were thought to be female, including one with a sword and shield," says the study.
"These results, six female Norse migrants and seven male, should caution against assuming that the great majority of Norse migrants were male, despite the other forms of evidence suggesting the contrary. This result of almost a fifty-fifty ratio of Norse female migrants to Norse males is particularly significant when some of the problems with osteological sexing of skeletons are taken into account," says the study.
Women may have accompanied male Vikings in those early invasions of England, in much greater numbers than scholars earlier supposed, McLeod concludes. Rather than the ravaging rovers of legend, the Vikings arrived as marriage-minded colonists. "Although the results presented here cannot be used to determine the number of female settlers, they do suggest that the ratio of females to males may have been somewhere between a third to roughly equal," the study concludes.

Last month, a steer escaped from a slaughterhouse in the New Yorkborough of Queens. Video of the animal trotting down a busy street was soon featured on many media outlets. For those who care about animals, the story has a happy ending: The steer was captured and taken to a sanctuary, where they will live out their years.
To me, the most interesting aspect of the story was the language that the media used to refer to the animal. The New York Times had a headline that read: "Cow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds Sanctuary." Animal advocates have long struggled against the convention of reserving "who" for people, and using "that" or "which" for animals. Not all languages make this distinction, but in English, to refer to "the cow that escaped" seems to deny the animal's agency. We would all say "the prisoner who escaped" but "the rock that rolled down the hill."

It would be premature to conclude that The New York Times article indicates a shift in usage. Rather, it seems to show uncertainty, for the first line of the article refers to "A cow that was captured by police."
I asked Philip Corbett, the standards editor for The New York Times, if the use of "cow who" reflected a change of policy. They told me that the newspaper's style manual, like that of the Associated Press, suggested using "who" only for a named or personified animal. The manual gives the example "The dog, which was lost, howled" and contrasts this with "Adelaide, who was lost, howled."
Mr. Corbett added that the editors may have been caught between the two examples. The cow, or rather steer, did not have a name at the time of the escape, but was given one – Freddie – by Mike Stura, the founder of Freddie's new home, Skylands Animal Sanctuary & Rescue in Wantage, N.J.
Among media reporting the story, some used "who" and others "that." A little searching on Google also shows mixed usage. Put in "cow who" and you get nearly 400,000 hits, compared with nearly 600,000 for "cow that." If you substitute "dog" for "cow," the numbers get closer – more than eight million for "dog who" and more than 10 million for "dog that."
This could be because most of the dog stories are about people's pets, who have names. Yet, if Google is any indication, chimpanzees, who are rarely pets, are referred to as "who" almost twice as often as they are referred to as "that." Their similarity to us, and their undeniable individuality, must be playing a role. For gorillas and orangutans, too, "who" is more common than "that."
Google's Ngram viewer, which charts the frequencies of words or phrases in printed sources in different years, provides another interesting perspective. There were more than 10 references to "cow that" for every reference to "cow who" in 1920, whereas by 2000 the ratio had dropped to less than five to one. We are anthropomorphizing cows more, despite the fact that many family-run dairy farms, in which the farmer knows every cow, have been replaced by corporate-run factory farms with thousands of nameless animals.
More surprising, perhaps, is that using "who" apparently is becoming more acceptable even for animals who are not pets and are less likely than great apes to be thought of as individuals. It's hard to connect canned tuna with an individual fish, let alone to think of that fish as a person, but the writer Sean Thomason tweeted "the tuna who died to get put in a can that wound up in the back of my cabinet until past expiration and which I just threw away."

Many social movements recognize that language matters because it both reflects and reinforces injustices that need to be remedied. Feminists have provided evidence that the supposedly gender-neutral use of "man" and "he" to include females has the effect of making women invisible.
Several remedies have been proposed, the most successful of which may be the use of the plural "they" in contexts like "Each person should collect their belongings." Terms used for members of racial minorities, and for people with disabilities, have also been challenged, to such an extent that it can be hard to keep up with the terms preferred by those in these categories.
The use of "who" for animals ranks alongside these other linguistic reforms. In most legal systems today, animals are property, just as tables and chairs are. They may be protected under animal welfare legislation, but that is not enough to prevent them being things, because antiquities and areas of natural beauty are also protected. English usage should change to make it clear that animals are fundamentally more like us than they are like tables and chairs, paintings and mountains.
The law is starting to show signs of change. In 1992, Switzerland became the first country to include a statement about protecting the dignity of animals in its constitution; Germany followed 10 years later. In 2009, the European Union amended its fundamental treaty to include a statement that because animals are sentient beings, the EU and its member states must, in formulating policies for agriculture, fisheries, research, and several other areas, "pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals."
In a language like English, which implicitly categorizes animals as things rather than persons, adopting the personal pronoun would embody the same recognition – and remind us who animals really are.

Indie Darling Inside Is Coming To The Nintendo Switch By William Usher Random Article Blend Playdead Studios managed to carve a name out for itself with indie smash hits such as Limbo and Inside. Well, for gamers who really took a liking to those titles but are stuck with a Nintendo Switch, there's some good news in store for you given that the platforming puzzle game, Inside, will be coming to Nintendo's hybrid handheld gaming console. Famitsu [via Eurogamer] managed to pick up the news from Playdead's Arnt Jensen, where the developer was having dinner with other top talent including Metal Gear Solid's Hideo Kojima and Fumito Ueda of The Last Guardian fame. The Japanese publication members being in attendance at the dinner allowed them to pick up the news that the game was coming to the Nintendo Switch. Given that this was one of those situations where the information came out over the course of a dinner, so information was actually quite thin, and as noted by Eurogamer there are no release dates or specs released for the game so far because the announcement for the Switch version of the game was not official. Even still, picking up these tidbits of news via unconventional means is still a win for gamers because it means that Switch owners can look forward to one of the more celebrated and highly regarded games that came out for the PC, PS4 and Xbox One back in 2016. The game was about a young boy who ends up fleeing from some hunters in the forest and discovers a facility where some zombies are being brainwashed, a giant seismic disruptor is sending pulse waves underwater, and a giant deformed monster is being examined by a group of scientists. The player ends up joining with the deformed monstrosity and then wrecking the facility as they attempt to make an escape and get out and away from the scientists. The game mixed in platforming with some puzzle solving, requiring a good mix of reflexes and critical thinking. The game managed to sell quite well across the three platforms that it was released on, and Eurogamer reported that the game is coming to iOS and Nintendo Switch, which could be enough to raise the sales factor even higher. One of the biggest criticisms that Nintendo has had to deal with is a lack of software. Nintendo has been attempting to rectify that problem by bringing in a ton of new games to the console, many of which are indie titles. Nintendo has been repeatedly criticized for a lack of third-party support but it looks like with companies like Playdead stepping into the picture and releasing a game for a Nintendo platform for the first time this generation. Again, details on release dates or specs haven't been released. So we have no idea if this will be a 720p game or a 1080p game, if it will be 30fps or how well it will perform between the TV mode and the portable mode. Expect more details to come out for the Switch version of Inside once the developers get serious about the launch. Blended From Around The Web Facebook

Jefferson County, Idaho Sheriff Blair Olsen was sentenced Monday after being convicted by a jury in May on three felony counts of misusing public funds.
Following an investigation by the Idaho Attorney General's special prosecution unit, Olsen was indicted by a Jefferson County grand jury in January.
They were charged with illegally providing a county-paid cell phone to their wife and misusing more than $1,000 in public funds from from 2010 to 2012.
Olsen, who was facing up to 33 years in prison, was sentenced to a total of 75 days in jail for the three counts – but will serve their time concurrently meaning after the first 15 days, they will have the option of completing their sentence with community service.
In other words, if Olsen performs 120 hours of community service within 60 days, they will only be required to serve 15 days in jail.
They must pay a $2,500 fine and $1,023 in restitution.
Judge Greg Moeller also issued a withheld judgment, meaning that after three years of probation, Olsen will get their civil rights back if they comply with the terms of their sentence.
The conviction however, prohibits Olsen from running for public office and they have been removed from their position as Sheriff in Jefferson County.
“Public corruption cases are serious for the simple fact that the offender holds a position of public trust and authority, and then takes advantage of that position,” Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said. “This remains true if the crime results in the loss of even the smallest amount of public funds.”
Wasden added, “but the real loss in these cases is to the erosion of trust and faith citizens have in their government. Tackling public corruption is essential to restoring that trust and faith citizens must have in their government and those elected to lead it.”
Officials say because of safety concerns for the officer, Olsen will not be held at the Jefferson County Jail. The location of where they will serve their sentence has not been released.
In April, prosecutors also filed motions that Olsen threatened witnesses and other officers with retaliation if they implicated him, and “attempted to extort a favorable resolution in the criminal case against him.”

See the smiling woman in this photo? That's Liz Miller, Conference & Programming Director for AXPONA, and the fact that she's smiling at the end of the largest North American consumer-audio of 2017 (so far) is a miracle. They and their team at JDEventsMark Freed, Joel Davis, Lou Mancini, Dawn Jeffrey, Melissa Cercone, Joelle Coretti, and Jenabeth Fergusonworked on the show for months. Liz, in fact, works on it year-round. Yet at the end of an expo that sold 6723 ticketsup 13% from 2016!and welcomed 4726 unique visitors over three daysup from 4092 in 2016!she was sothat they could still do their work with calm. Brava!
Every industry person I spoke with at show's end considered their time and money well-spent. Some commented that Friday was busier than usual, and Saturday packed. Sunday certainly seemed slow. But when you consider that attendees were spread over a final count of 140 active exhibit rooms, a sprawling marketplace, an overflowing EarGear Expo, seminars, the spacious lobby, and eating areas, "slow" must be understood in context.
As someone who has covered shows for well over a decade, I've often written that it's a miracle that anyone can achieve good sound in a hotel room. After all, most people only had one afternoon and evening for set-up at AXPONA 2017, and everyone except people on the lower level (who had no hotel guests above and around them) was under a 9pm sound curfew. At show's end, those who had brought previously unplayed equipment with them were still wondering what it would sound like in another 100, 200, or 400 hours.
Nonetheless, I heard a lot of good sound, and some great sound. With some of the potentially best exhibits not even covered due to their lack of premieres, any "Best of Show" assessment would be irresponsible. But a careful reading of blogs from me and my colleague, Jana Dagdagan, will enable you to spot the systems we favored.
A few luscious facts about AXPONA 2017. 56% of attendees came from Illinois, and 46% from around the country. International guests hailed from Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Denmark, Norway, Australia, Jamaica, Japan, New Zealand, and Taiwan. 88% of exhibiting companies were from the US, and the other 12% from countries that included the UK, Japan, Canada, Indonesia, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania, Denmark and Taiwan.
In terms of ticket buyers, 1% were under age 18, 3% 18-25, and 8% 26-34. Absent from these numbers are young members of families where either Mom or Dad bought tickets for everyone, or where one young person bought tickets for their friends and hopefully got paid back. Nonetheless, at least 12% of visitors 34 and under is not a bad sign. Although figures are not available, women were certainly in evidence.
With this show, AXPONA bids adieu to the Westin O'Hare that has served it so well. (I will especially miss the fabulous concierge and hotel desk people, and the quick ride from O'Hare.) Next year brings a new venue, the Renaissance Schaumburg Hotel and Convention Center, which is a longer distance away from the airport.
The ostensible and proffered reason for the move is simple: more space. According to Liz Miller, "We expect to sell many more standard hotel rooms next year, and The Marketplace and Ear Gear Expo will be combined into one large exhibit hall area to make all the gear much easier for attendees to navigate."
Although virtually every exhibitor I spoke with after the show announced their intention to return, one expressed dissatisfaction with the size and allocation of rooms in the new venue. To this, Liz replied by email, "The standard hotel rooms are different dimensions at the Renaissance than at the Westin. They are a little narrower and a little longer, with approximately the same overall square footage. The ceiling heights are higher at 9'6", which most vendors seem to really like.
"To be accurate, there are more than 30 meeting rooms and suites at the new hotel. We used a very fair and equitable room assignment process to best accommodate all of the vendors that prefer larger rooms."
As always, it has been an honor to cover this and other shows for Stereophile. Believe it or not, I somehow managed to cover at least 17 rooms per day and speak on one panelone of the best I've ever been on, to be honestwithout becoming a walking zombie. For this, I credit GABA, melatonin, coffee cruda (homeopathic coffee), Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night tea, a hotel that was neither abnormally hot nor excessively air conditioned, quiet neighbors, and, yes, the passage of time. It's actually gotten easier. Or so it has seemed, this time around. Knowing that I will return to the calm and beauty of Port Townsend, where I will be greeted by hubbie hugs and doggie licks, sure helps.
It seems, from the online comments of those who attended AXPONA 2017, that I am not alone in my praise for the show and the way it was run. Liz Miller, Steve Davis, and JDEvents have much to be proud of. My thanks to one and all. And that includes John Atkinson and Art Dudley, who have done editing, posting, and corrections in rapid time.
My next show reports will be from the Los Angeles Audio Show, which takes place June 2-4 at the Sheraton Gateway, around the corner from LAX. Stereophile held its show there some years back. It's a good venue. I still recall the huge Sony billboard outside my window, singing the praises of could it really have been a Walkman (which I called Walkperson)?
On April 22, LAAS reached its maximum active exhibit room target of 115. Although exhibitors are still asking for rooms, it's believed that show manager Marine Presson will hold firm at 115. What this means for you, the reader, is that with major shows in Chicago and Southern California, Rocky Mountain Audio Fest and Montreal still going strong, and smaller shows in DC, NYC, Oakland, TX, and Toronto, North American audiophiles have many listening adventures ahead of them in the coming year and next.
Thank you for being the committed reader you are. The show is done. On with the show.
Akin ad features rape victim
Rep. Todd Akin is out with a new ad featuring a supporter who says they were raped and had an abortion.
Akin, who is trying to unseat Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill in Missouri, found their campaign in turmoil and faced a wave of criticism after an August television interview where they suggested that women rarely become pregnant after a “legitimate rape.”
In the ad, a woman named Kelly says they are a single mother, and “a woman who has had an abortion, I've been raped in the past.”
“The reason I'm voting for Todd and I'm so proud of them is because they defend the unborn. He's a kind man, he's a compassionate man, they have so much integrity,” they say.
Rick Tyler, a spokesperson for Akin, would not comment on the placement of the ads or which markets they would be running in. McCaskill has maintained a steady 5- to 6-point lead in most recent Missouri polls, although Akin's campaign says the race is much closer.
“The latest public poll by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch … had Todd 2 points behind Claire McCaskill,” Tyler told POLITICO on Wednesday. “That's remarkable considering they have spent a record amount for Missouri on negative advertising. They have thrown the kitchen sink at Todd yet we are even.”
While national Republican committees have insisted they would not be spending money on the race after Akin's comments, their campaign and the Missouri Republican Party are launching a nearly $700,000 TV ad blitz in the final days of the election.
It is unclear if any of the national committees provided the funds for the advertising.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott dismisses leadership speculation as 'Canberra gossip', insider games
Updated
Prime Minister Tony Abbott is staring down their detractors as they face the growing likelihood of a leadership spill before the end of the year.
The ABC has spoken to eight ministers, six of whom believe Tony Abbott will be challenged no matter what happens at the Canning by-election in Western Australia next Saturday.
Key points: PM dismisses leadership speculation as "Canberra gossip"
Swing against Liberal Party expected in Canning by-election
Ministers believe Abbott faces leadership challenge by year's end
"And this time I think they will get him," one minister said.
Mr Abbott held a media conference in South Australia this morning and brushed off repeated questions about their future.
"I just am not going to get caught up in Canberra gossip, I'm not going to play Canberra games," they said.
"I know that sometimes the media particularly like to play the Canberra game, but I'm not going to get involved with it."
A double-digit swing against the Liberal Party in Canning would fuel the unrest and a turnaround of that magnitude is possible; both the News Limited Galaxy poll and the Fairfax Ipsos poll point to a 10-point swing.
The Ipsos poll has the Liberal Party leading Labor after preferences are distributed by 52 to 48 per cent - it was 62 to 38 per cent at the 2013 general election.
It looks increasingly likely the Prime Minister will face a leadership spill before the year is out.
"And that's after we spent $1 million on that seat to save the Prime Minister, and Labor has spent nothing," one Cabinet minister said.
"He said: 'Give me six months.' Well, they have had six months and things have gone from bad to worse.
I'm just not going to chase all of these rabbits down all of the burrows that you are inviting me to go down, I'm just not going to play the Canberra games. Tony Abbott
"He should just resign."
A third minister told the ABC "everybody is quite jumpy and despondent".
"That's driven by the national polls and the fact that every poll on Canning has 10 per cent-type swings," they said.
"And the fact that so much of the self-harm comes from the Prime Minister's office, that so much of it is self-inflicted."
Reporters continued to press the Prime Minister about the anonymous criticism during their media event this morning.
"I'm just not going to chase all of these rabbits down all of the burrows that you are inviting me to go down, I'm just not going to play the Canberra games," Mr Abbott replied.
"The public don't like this insider gossip."
"My job is to do what the public elected me to do two years ago, and that is to govern effectively everyday for three years and then submit myself to the judgement of the people.
"I expect that the Government will go to the middle of next year and maybe a bit beyond because that's what we were elected to do three years ago."
Labor moved to capitalise on the uncertainty in Question Time, with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten questioning how voters in Canning could believe promises Tony Abbott has made. (LINK TO VIDEO)
"This from a Leader of the Opposition who backstabbed two Prime Ministers and then lied about it on national radio," Mr Abbott retorted.
"If the Labor leader's colleagues can't trust him, you can't trust him."
Cormann, Tudge back Prime Minister
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also characterised the leadership speculation as "anonymous gossip" as they conducted a series of breakfast interviews this morning.
"I support the leadership team of Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop which took us successfully from opposition to Government," Senator Cormann told News 24.
When asked whether Malcolm Turnbull should rule out a challenge, Senator Cormann highlighted the need for the government to focus on winning the Canning by-election this weekend.
"Malcolm Turnbull is a highly valued senior colleague. I work with them closely on a range of issues. I enjoy working with him, they are a senior contributor," they said.
"I'm not going to give advice to any of my colleagues through the media.
"All of us - we're professional politicians, all of us - we know what we need to do in order to do our job to our best ability."
Outside parliament Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Alan Tudge was questioned about whether Mr Abbott enjoyed their continued support.
"I'm a very strong supporter of the Prime Minister and our Cabinet. We're getting on the with job, we've got a good track record to date," they said.
Others have not been prepared to pass judgement, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
"I'm not going to add to any speculation," they said at a book launch this morning.
"So if you don't mind I'm no going to answer any questions in relation to the current gossip doing the rounds of Parliament House."
Assistant Minister Michaelia Cash said they would not "indulge" in leadership speculation and former speaker Bronwyn Bishop was also keen to dodge the issue.
"I think there's enough commentary around without me adding to anything," they said.
Abbott backer admits leadership moves afoot
One ministerial supporter of the Prime Minister acknowledged there were leadership moves afoot.
"Things are very fluid but I don't think anything will happen this week," they said.
"This is just so destructive. I can't believe they are doing it again.
"But there is no denying it is a coordinated campaign."
Talk of a move this week is driven by a belief Mr Abbott might call an early election in the wake of the Canning by-election to forestall a challenge.
One minister said Mr Abbott should confront their stalkers.
"I think we have got to the stage where Abbott has to think about whether they are going to bring it on themselves because this is not going to stop," a minister said.
Speaking on the Ten Network, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison dismissed talk of a leadership change as "incessant insider speculation" and said they knew nothing of it.
"I'm not part of anything that I would know about," they said.
"So, I mean, I support the Prime Minister, everybody knows that, so I suspect they're not talking to me."
Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss called on the party to rally behind Mr Abbott.
"We have an elected leader," they said.
"And I think it's very important that all of the team move in behind them and give them credit for their achievements and make sure we work constructively for the future."
Mr Abbott survived a party room revolt in February by 61 votes to 39.
Parliament resumes on Monday, and in the words of one Liberal, the Coalition MPs and senators now "talk of nothing else" but leadership.

Jean Todt will succeed Max Mosley as the new head of motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, after winning the presidential election in Paris. The former Ferrari team boss claimed 135 votes compared to 49 casts for their rival Ari Vatanen with 12 abstentions. Todt, 63, was the favourite to win the vote after being backed by Mosley, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. The vote brings an end to Mosley's controversial 16-year reign. "Jean Todt has been elected president of the FIA for a four-year term by the FIA General Assembly at its annual meeting in Paris," an FIA statement said. Schumacher, who had accompanied Todt to the meeting, added: "It's positive, very positive." With the election over everybody must share the same goals, including those who did not support me
Jean Todt Mosley had agreed they would not stand for a fifth term as president as part of a peace deal struck in July to end the threat of a breakaway championship by Formula 1 teams. Following their decision, Mosley immediately endorsed Todt ahead of Vatanen, who had already put themselves forward as a candidate. Todt and Vatanen, who worked together on the Peugeot rally team in the 1980s, fought an increasingly bitter campaign to succeed Mosley. Both presented themselves as the candidate for change and harmony but Vatanen questioned Todt's ability to drive the FIA forward after losing the election. "I really doubt they will be able to give a new start to the FIA, but let's hope I'm wrong," Vatanen said. "Jean Todt has a lot of qualities but, if they want to leave their footprints on the FIA, they have got to renew it. "And if they don't get rid of the ancient guard and all the people who worked with Mosley, they won't succeed." Todt (right) and Vatanen each spoke at the election Among Todt's proposals is the introduction of a new commissioner to oversee the running of F1, as well as the other FIA championships. The Frenchman also wants to examine improvements to the flight attendants' decision-making process. "I am relieved, because it was a very trying experience," a victorious Todt said. "I like to make things go forward and I am really happy to see so many countries chose me, but everything is yet to be done. "With the election over everybody must share the same goals, including those who did not support me. "We are facing a new crucial era for cars, the environment and global warming, which has strong implications for motor racing." Former world champion Damon Hill says it is important that Todt distances themselves from the previous regime of Mosley and look instead to the future. "It would be good for them to put the past administration behind them and to separate themselves from that and do it the way they would like to do it," Hill told BBC Sport. "It would be good for them to make clear what the FIA stands for in terms of sport and also what their ambitions are. "I know from their campaign they want to separate the judging process from the FIA and also to have a separate body that runs F1. I think those are good things to start with." Mosley's presidency has become identified with a period of political strife in F1, with a series of damaging rows in recent years. Ill-feeling and suspicion remain and the F1 teams are concerned that the election of Todt, who Mosley has publicly backed as their successor, would effectively be a continuation of the Mosley era. ANDREW BENSON ON TODT What kind of FIA president will Todt be? Will they act in a supportive and conciliatory manner - or will they act as they did to their rival team bosses and be antagonistic and disruptive
That belief is enhanced because Mosley, as an ex-president, will retain a seat on the FIA Senate, the powers of which Todt wants to extend. As part of Todt's team, Nick Craw, who is president of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, becomes president of the FIA Senate. Mosley's public backing of Todt infuriated Vatanen and led them to instigate legal proceedings last week to ensure the transparency and fairness of the election. The Finn withdrew that lawsuit after he, Todt and Mosley agreed a procedure for the election in Paris. The secret ballot at Paris's Intercontinental Hotel were supervised by an external Huissier de Justice, a French state-appointed public witness. The votes were then counted in private by the FIA legal department, under the supervision of scrutineers proposed by the two presidential candidates and designated by the General Assembly. The votes will be now be sequestered for 12 months. Todt developed a reputation in F1 as a divisive figure during their 15 years as Ferrari team principal. That image is at odds with the one painted by former Ferrari team members and drivers, who are largely effusive about their skills as a team-builder and manager. Todt was at Schumacher's side as they won five drivers' titles with Ferrari Todt says they stand for "consensus not conflict", and they point out that they have already met the F1 Teams' Association, Fota, to discuss their plans. Fota president Luca di Montezemolo, who is also president of Ferrari, welcomed Todt's appointment. "I have always appreciated their ability, dedication and commitment," they said. "I am sure that, under their guidance, the federation will be rejuvenated and will restore a climate open to dialogue and constructive collaboration with the teams and Fota, thus ensuring stability of the regulations and the whole environment." Todt began their career in motorsport as a co-driver in the world rally championship, winning the manufacturers' title with Talbot Lotus before retiring in 1981. After a successful spell in charge of rally teams, they moved to Ferrari and in 1996 they persuaded Schumacher and technical director Ross Brawn to join him. Ferrari went on to win 13 world titles, including six constructors' championships in a row from 1999 to 2004. After seeing Stefano Domenicali installed as team boss in 2008, Todt severed their ties with the Italian team in March this year. The 63-year-old now begins another new era as Mosley's successor to the FIA presidency. Mosley began their spell in charge in 1993 and successfully implemented improved head and neck protection for drivers as they spearheaded several safety campaigns. They were also the force behind the Euro NCAP programme, a mandatory safety test for road cars. However, the 69-year-old's reign became more controversial towards the end of their career as they tried to force through several rule changes. The son of former Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley also hit the headlines last year because of their involvement with a sex scandal that almost ended their career.

One cat was found with its throat slit while the other had its stomach cut open. AVA says CCTV footage shows the cat found near Khoo Teck Puat Hospital was attacked by two stray dogs.
SINGAPORE: Two new cases of grisly cat deaths emerged in Yishun on Thursday (Feb 9) - one involving a cat whose throat was slit and the other had its stomach cut open.
According to the Facebook page of Yishun 326 Tabby Cat - a group of volunteers who rescue and treat community cats - the cat with the slit throat was found on a road divider near Yishun MRT. This is the second time that a dead cat was found in the same location, said the group.

Hours later, it posted a photo of another cat found behind Khoo Teck Puat Hospital with its stomach slit open, adding that Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) caregivers were at the scene.
“We plead all to keep a lookout for suspicious persons in the neighbourhood,” the animal rescue group wrote.
AVA gave an update on Friday saying CCTV footage showed that the cat found near KTPH was attacked by two stray dogs.

The agency had told Channel NewsAsia earlier that it collected the carcasses of both cats for investigations.
“Members of the public who have information on these cases (such as photographic or video evidence, witnesses) can contact AVA at 1800-476-1600,” a spokesperson said. “All information provided will be kept in strict confidence.”
Yishun has seen a spate of cat abuse cases, which prompted Member of Parliament Louis Ng to beef up a grassroots response team to gather evidence and conduct patrols in the neighbourhood.
Last June, 41-year-old Lee Wai Leong became the first person to be convicted and sentenced under enhanced animal cruelty laws for throwing a cat 13 storeys to its death. Lee, who suffers from moderate intellectual disability, was sentenced to 18 months' probation.

As Edmonton Oilers fans get ready to ring in Round 2 of the Stanley Cup playoffs, one Alberta family is hoping to send a message to one player in particular.
The Hove family, of Onoway, want to thank Oilers winger Milan Lucic for an unexpected surprise that came just weeks after the family lost nearly everything in a farmhouse fire.
“We haven't known quite how to thank him,” Lisa Hove said Monday.
Hove, their husband and their four children had just moved in with Hove's father-in-law in Rich Valley, Alta., when a fire broke out last December. As the family sat down for dinner, Hove noticed something reflecting off them glasses. The ceiling was on fire.
“Within three hours, the house had gone,” said Hove, adding the cause of the fire is still under investigation.
The family went to their neighbour Mike Nistor's home, where they watched the farmhouse burn to the ground. The family lost most of their possessions, including the family Christmas tree and stockings already hung for the holidays.
“It's definitely been one of the most stressful things we've had to go through,” Hove said. “Insurance will help rebuild (my father-in-law's) house, but they lived there for 24 years and lost many keepsakes and photo albums.”
The children — MaryLynn, 8; Vienna, 7; Hannah, 5; and Jonah, 3 — still received a Christmas surprise thanks to Nistor's sister, Pamela, and Lucic.
Pamela — a stranger to the Hoves — purchased Oilers T-shirts for the children and was able to relay the ordeal to Lucic, who signed the shirts.
“His sister is friends with some of the Oilers and Lucic offered to sign them,” Hove said.
Now back in Onoway, the Hoves plan to watch the Oilers take on the Anaheim Ducks with the children wearing their T-shirts.
Though the children are just learning about the Oilers, Jonah is especially excited.
“He likes to carry a hockey stick around with them and pretend he's a hockey player,” Hove said.
The Oilers and Ducks will play Game 1 of the series in Anaheim on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m.

This story has been updated with additional information from the VA and the American Medical Association.
The Public Health Service has cleared the way for a research organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, to study whether or not marijuana can reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans.
MAPS described the move as an “historic shift in federal policy.”
The Public Health Service approval of the study will allow MAPS to purchase medical marijuana from a farm operated by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the first time in 22 years the organization, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., said it has been allowed to purchase the drug from NIDA.
The research will be conducted by Dr. Sue Sisley at the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona who believes marijuana can relieve a wide range of clinical symptoms . Sisley plans to provide 50 veterans diagnosed with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD with marijuana in various potencies during the study.
Broken Warriors is an ongoing series on mental health issues in the military.
The study still needs final approval from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, something MAPS is optimistic will occur “in a timely manner,” the organization said.
Currently 20 states allow the use of medical marijuana to treat a variety of conditions; Connecticut, Delaware, Oregon, Maine, New Mexico and Nevada permit its use to treat PTSD.
Roughly 2.3 million troops served over the past 13 years in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Veterans Affairs Department estimated in 2012 that roughly 30 percent have sought care in its facilities for PTSD. A key 2011 study shows the rate of PTSD for combat Vietnam veterans, of which there are 2.6 million, ranges between 2 percent and 17 percent.
The Veterans Health Administration does not preclude veterans who receive VA care from participation in medical marijuana programs. A Jan. 31, 2011, policy memo from Robert Petzel, VA Under Secretary for Health, states: “VHA policy does not administratively prohibit Veterans who participate in State marijuana programs from also participating in VHA substance abuse programs, pain control programs, or other clinical programs where the use of marijuana may be considered inconsistent with treatment goals.”
The American Medical Association continued its historic opposition to medical marijuana last November when its House of Delegates affirmed a policy position that “cannabis is a dangerous drug and as such is a public health concern.”

The Atlanta, Georgia based fast food chain Arby's is bringing venison back to their menus, and this time, the sought-after venison steak sandwich will be available across the United States for a limited time on Saturday, October 21. This limited time offering across the US is a big geographical spread from their initial 2016 rollout which only included hunting-heavy states.
Not only is Arby's trying to back up their “all the meats” marketing claims by selling venison and elk, but they're also taking a huge leap into the culinary tech world by cooking their food sous vide, following in the footsteps of other restaurant giants such as:
Sous vide provides consistent and precise temperatures throughout your food while retaining juiciness and flavor. Many cuts of meat that are traditionally tougher in nature become very tender after cooking them sous vide over longer periods of time. In Arby's case, the venison is marinated in garlic, salt, and pepper, and then cooked sous vide for 3 hours.
The good thing is, cooking sous vide is incredibly easy to replicate. So, if you wait in line at Arby's on Saturday only to discover the 100 sandwiches are sold out at your location, you're not totally out of luck. Recreate the legendary sandwich at home this weekend by following this Arby's venison sandwich recipe.
Sous Vide Venison Recipe for Arby's Sandwich
Ingredients Thick cut venison steak
Sea Salt
Cracked Black Pepper
Garlic powder
Avocado Oil (or another high smoke point oil for searing)
Fresh toasted bun
Crispy onions (homemade or store-bought) Cabernet Steak Sauce: ½ cup beef broth
½ cup red wine
½ shallot, diced
1 tbs balsamic vinegar
1 tsp butter
Directions
Pre-heat your sous vide water bath to your ideal temperature. Normally, we prefer venison around 130F since venison steaks are lean and do not have much fat to render, but if you're aiming to clone the Arby's sandwich, you will want to go a bit higher, such as 135F to 140F. Generously season the venison steak with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Arby's marinates the venison with fresh garlic, but who has time to wait for a marinade?! Adding garlic powder before and during the 5 hour cook adds an immense, yet appropriate, flavor. Vacuum seal the venison steak or place it in a heavy-duty Ziploc bag. Place the bagged steak in water bath and cook for 3 – 5 hours. Note: Arby's cooks their venison sous vide for 3 hours. However, if you have a thick steak, you may benefit from increasing this time to 5 hours for more tenderness, resulting in an easier bite for a sandwich. Remove venison from water bath and pat dry with paper towels. Meanwhile, pre-heat a cast iron pan on high heat with some oil (avocado oil is great for this due to its high smoke point). Quickly sear the venison for 1 minute, then flip and sear the other side for an additional 1 minute. Optionally, you can add a tablespoon of butter and any aromatics to the pan during the sear. Remove the venison, cover in aluminum foil to rest, and set aside.

Britain is to build a huge wall in Calais to try to stop migrants sneaking across the Channel.
UK taxpayers will foot the £2million bill for the barrier stretching nearly a mile along the main motorway to the port.
Construction will start soon, ministers announced yesterday.
The 13ft concrete wall will replace fencing that has failed to stop stowaways targeting lorries. Before Britain's vote to leave the EU there was a surge in incursions – mostly from the 'Jungle' camp near Calais that houses 10,000 migrants.

Before Britain's vote to leave the EU there was a surge in incursions – mostly from the 'Jungle' camp near Calais that houses 10,000 migrants. Above, tents in the northern area of the camp
The Home Office said the measure would stop stowaways using projectiles in attempts to 'disrupt, delay or even attack vehicles approaching the port'. Pictured, the camp yesterday
Kate Gibbs of the Road Haulage Association said the wall was a 'scandalous waste of taxpayers' cash' that would simply shift problems farther down the road.
'Money would be much better spent on boosting security along the approach roads,' they added. 'This is being called the Great Wall of Calais but what good will it do? We are telling our drivers not to stop within 150 miles of Calais so they are not targeted by migrants.
'This will be a tiny concrete alleyway that will serve very little purpose and not provide any security.'
But immigration minister Robert Goodwill told the Commons home affairs committee last night that the wall would halt the flow of migrants and keep drivers safe.

In July official figures showed that one migrant is caught trying to sneak into the UK every six minutes – with 84,088 detentions at our borders last year. Most were caught at the 'juxtaposed controls' in Calais – effectively Britain's border. The port, with its Tunnel, is a key destination for thousands of the more than one million migrants and refugees who illegally entered Europe this year in boats from Turkey and North Africa.
Many are fleeing humanitarian disasters but often they are economic migrants attracted by jobs, state benefits and free accommodation in the UK. Migrants and people-smuggling gangs are becoming increasingly violent in their attempts to board UK-bound trucks.
Last month holidaymakers were warned to avoid Calais after motorists were targeted by gangs with chainsaws and metal bars near the Jungle. A number have reported attacks by migrants from the camp. Last week, three British journalists were injured when a log was hurled at their car, forcing it into the path of a juggernaut.
In June, a French police commissioner said there had been 22,000 breaches of the port road defences in June, compared with just 3,000 in January.
This week French truckers and farmers have blockaded motorways leading into the port in protest at the rising number of assaults.

Mr Goodwill told MPs: 'The security that we are putting in at the port is being stepped up with better equipment. We are going to start building this big new wall very soon as part of the £17million package we are doing with the French. We've done the fence, now we are doing a wall. There is still more to do. We have also invested in space for 200 lorries at Calais so that they have somewhere safe to wait.'
Construction of the wall is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, who represents Dover, said: 'It is essential to do everything we can to secure the borders of the UK. We need to see action by the French to ensure security at Calais to protect tourists, truckers and trade.'
Working with an international team, paleontologists at the University of Zurich have discovered two new species of Saurichthys. The ~242 million year old predatory fishes were found in the fossil Lagerstätte Monte San Giorgio, in Ticino. They are distinct from previously known Saurichthys species in the shape of the head and body, suggesting different habitats and diet.
Saurichthys is a predatory fish characterized by a long thin body and a sharply pointed snout with numerous teeth. This distinctive ray-finned fish lived in marine and freshwater environments all over the world 252-201 million years ago during the Triassic period. Two new species of this extinct fish have been discovered by paleontologists at the University of Zurich, working in collaboration with researchers in Germany and China. The first species, "Saurichthys breviabdominalis," is named for its relatively short body and the second, "Saurichthys rieppeli," is named after Olivier Rieppel, a Swiss paleontologist formerly based at the University of Zurich. Including the new finds, there are now six species of Saurichthys known from Monte San Giorgio, making it both the most abundant and diverse fish at this classic Middle Triassic locality.
Evidence of different diet and habitat
Both 40 to 60 cm long fishes differ from other species of Saurichthys in skull and body shape. "These differences indicate different hunting styles and habitats in the shallow sea. This enabled multiple species to co-exist," clarified Heinz Furrer, paleontologist at the University of Zurich and author of this research project. According to Furrer, the ability to occupy multiple specialized feeding and habitat niches may be responsible for the evolutionary success of these fishes, both in the Monte San Giorgio basin and globally.
Monte San Giorgio is world-renowned for its beautifully preserved fossils from the Middle Triassic time (~239-243 million years ago). Large-scale excavations conducted by the University of Zürich between 1924 and 2004 yielded a substantial number of fossil reptiles and fishes. As part of a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, scientists at the Paleontological Institute and Museum, University of Zurich have prepared and studied over a hundred well-preserved specimens over the last three years.
Click to see image of the original page before the 3/11/2013 update.
Updated 3/11/2013: It looks like someone at Crypton may have leaked the information too soon. The page has been altered to remove a lot of the new information, including the new release date. The Japanese blog bunkaextend managed to catch the quote. Hightrancesea from Vocaloidism also captured a screenshot of the page before the removal.
During the recent visit to Singapore by Crypton's CEO, Hiroyuki Itoh, there was some slightly confusing and conflicting information regarding the release schedule for Hatsune Miku's English voice bank release. The information slide shown during their presentation said Spring 2013, while Danny Choo's translation of Itoh's words were “Summer 2013”.
The words spoken by Itoh are now confirmed with Crypton's recent update to their ‘Who is Hatsune Miku?' information page, the first major update since early 2011. The page now has fresh new facts and information on the popularity and achievements of Miku's software, and the success of marketing and live concert events. Also mentioned is the plans for a new Summer 2013 launch for Hatsune Miku's English voice bank, a bit later than the previously announced Spring 2013 launch at the 2012 New York Comic Con.
In a direct excerpt from the page: “We are proud to announce that Hatsune Miku English Version is to be released in summer 2013, and we are also planning collaborations with popular labels and artists. Wouldn't you also like to feature Hatsune Miku as your band's vocalist and discover new possibilities in the world of music?”.
Other than the announcement by Itoh from their Singapore visit, Crypton has not yet made any public announcement of the new plans. I expect we will be hearing the new announcement very soon.

Not many second year students are in a position to start a multi-million dollar charity. But when Ilan visited the “effective altruism” community in Oxford, they discovered an opportunity to start a nonprofit doing research into the most effective ways to end factory farming.
Through the community, they received advice, funding and help with web design. Today, Animal Charity Evaluators has directed over $5m of donations to its recommended charities, and has an annual budget of half a million dollars.
If Ilan had just handed out business cards at networking conferences, this would have probably never happened. And this illustrates what many people miss about networking: the value of joining a great community.
If you become a trusted member of a community, you can gain hundreds of potential allies at once, because once one person vouches for you, they can introduce you to everyone else. That means it's like networking but one hundred times faster.
In fact, getting involved in the right community is perhaps the single biggest thing you can do to make friends, advance your career, and have a greater impact. You'll not only improve your connections, but also your knowledge, character, motivation, and more.
In this article, we'll explain how our community can help and how to get involved.
If you'd like to get involved right away, the easiest thing to do is to join the effective altruism newsletter:
Email Address (required)
Why joining a community is so beneficial
Nothing spells community like the letters c, o, m, m, u, n, i, t, & y. Thanks, Large Group of People Holding Word Community/ Getty Images.
There are lots of great communities out there. We've enjoyed being part of Y Combinator's entrepreneur community – it made us more ambitious and more effective at running a startup…hopefully. We've also enjoyed participating in the Skoll social entrepreneurship community, the Oxford philosophy “scene”, the World Economic Forum's Young Global Shapers, and many others.
Joining any good community can be a great boost to your career. In part, this is because you'll get all the benefits of connections that we covered earlier: finding jobs, gaining up-to-date information and becoming more motivated. But it goes beyond that.
Let's suppose I want to build and sell a piece of software. One approach would be to learn all the skills needed myself – design, engineering, marketing and so on.
A much better approach is to form a team who are skilled in each area, and then build it together. Although I'll have to share the gains with the other people, the size of the gains will be much larger, so we'll all win.
One thing that's going on here is specialisation: each person can focus on a specific skill, and get really good at it, which lets them be more effective.
Another factor is that the team can also share fixed costs – they can share the same company registration, operational procedures and so on. It's also not three times harder to raise three times as much money from investors. This lets them achieve economies of scale.
In sum, we get what's called the “gains from trade”. Three people working together can achieve more than three times as much as an individual.
It's the same when doing good. Rather than have everyone try to do everything, it's more effective for people to specialise and work together.
An especially good thing about trade is that you can do it with people who don't share your goals. Suppose you run an animal rights charity and meet someone who runs a global health charity. You don't think global health is a pressing problem, and the other person doesn't think animal rights is a pressing problem, so neither of you think the other's charity has much impact. But suppose you know a donor who might give to their charity, and they know a donor who might give to your charity. You can trade: if you both make introductions, which is a small cost, you might both find a new donor, which is a big benefit.
So, you both end up with a big benefit for a small cost, so you both win. This shows valuable to join a community even if the people in it have different aims from your own.
That said, it's far better again to join a community of people who do share your goals. That's why there's a community we especially want to highlight, which many people have not yet heard about: the effective altruism community.
How can the effective altruism community boost your career?
“Effective altruism – efforts that actually help people rather than making you feel good or helping you show off – is one of the great new ideas of the twenty-first century.”
Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and author of The Better Angels of Our Nature.
The effective altruism community is a group of people devoted to using evidence and reason to figure out the most effective ways to help others, such as through donating, political advocacy, or using their careers.
We helped to start the community back in 2012, along with several other groups. If you like the ideas in our guide, there are some good reasons to get involved.
In fact, we know people who have been involved with McKinsey, Harvard Business School, the Fulbright Scholarship, the World Economic Forum, and other prestigious networks, but many of them say they find it more useful to meet people in the effective altruism community. Why?
In part, it's because through the community we've come across some of the most high-achieving, smart, altruistic people we've ever met. There are now over 100 meet-ups around the world and over 10 conferences every year, including in Africa and Asia. More importantly, the members of the community get things done – they've pledged billions of dollars to effective charities, done groundbreaking research, and founded over ten organisations focused on doing good (more figures).
But the even bigger reason is what we said about trade. People can work with others who don't share their values because they can swap things that are a small cost to them, but a big benefit to someone else. But if you share aims with someone else, then you don't even need to trade.
In the effective altruism community people share a common goal: to help others as much as possible. So, if you help someone else to have a greater impact, then you increase your own impact too. So, you both succeed.
This means you don't need to worry about getting favours back to break even. Just helping someone else is already impactful. This unleashes far more opportunities to work together, that just wouldn't be worth it in a community where people don't share one another's aims as much. And because there are so many ways we can help each other, this lets us achieve far more. (Technically transaction costs and principal-agent problems are dramatically reduced.)
Earning to give can actually be an example of that kind of collaboration. In the early days of 80,000 Hours, Ben and Matt had to choose between running the organisation and earning to give. We realised that Matt had higher earning potential, and Ben would be better at running the organisation. In part, this is why Ben became the CEO, and Matt became our first major donor, as well as a seed funder for several other organisations.
The alternative would have been to for both to earn to give, in which case, 80,000 Hours wouldn't have existed. Or, both could have worked at 80,000 Hours, in which case it would have taken us much longer to fundraise (and the other organisations wouldn't have benefited).
Within the community as a whole, some people are relatively better suited to earning money, and others to running non-profits. We can achieve more if the people best suited to earning money earn to give and fund everyone else.
There are lots of other examples of how we can work together. For instance, some people can go and explore new areas and share the information with everyone else, allowing everyone to be more effective in the long-term. Or, people can also specialise rather than needing to be generalists.
For instance, Dr. Greg Lewis did the research into how many lives a doctor saves that we saw earlier. After realising it was less than they thought, they decided not to focus on clinical medicine. Now, he's studying public health with the aim of becoming an expert on the topic within the community, particularly on issues relevant to pandemics. They actually think risks from artificial intelligence might be more urgent overall, but as a doctor, he's relatively best placed to work on health-related issues.
For all these reasons, if you share the aims of the effective altruism community, it can be a uniquely powerful community to join.
And, if you liked this guide, then you'll probably share aims with lots of people in the community. So here's what to do next.
How to get involved
Effective Altruism Global, Berkeley, 2016.
The easiest thing to do right now is to join the effective altruism newsletter. You'll be sent a couple of emails that introduce the key ideas; a monthly update on new research; and be notified of the key conferences each year.
Email Address (required)
If you want to learn more about the ideas underlying the community, read this introduction and the following handbook.
For a more popular introduction, check out Doing Good Better, a book by our co-founder Will MacAskill (though it's a little out of date), or their TED talk. Steven Levitt, the author of Freakonomics, said the book “should be required reading for anyone interested in making the world better”.
Ways to meet people
Once you're up to speed, try to meet people in-person, since this is how to find connections that can really help your career. The best way to do this is to attend an Effective Altruism Global conference. There are over 10 each year all over the world. To be notified of the latest dates, join the effective altruism newsletter.
Once you've met a few people in the community, ask for more introductions. Alternatively, you can attend a local group event, or you can join the discussion online on the Effective Altruism Forum.
When meeting people, start by aiming to meet people in a similar situation to yourself, since there will often be opportunities to help each other. Then, try to speak to people who are one or two steps ahead of you in your career (e.g. if you want to start an organisation, meet people who started one last year).
When you're getting involved, look for “five-minute favours” – quick ways you can help someone else in the community. There are probably some small things you can do that will be a great help to someone else in the community, such as making an introduction or telling them about a book. This will both have an impact and let you meet even more people.
Another way to get more involved is to visit, or even move to, one of the hubs of the community. These are, roughly in descending order of size: San Francisco, London / Oxford / Cambridge, Berlin, Boston, Melbourne / Sydney, New York and Vancouver. Read more about why and how to visit.
See more tips on how to get involved and how to build connections.
How can we work together more effectively?
If you're already involved, there's a lot to say about how best to work together, and we still have a lot to learn. Here's a recent talk we gave on the topic, and for more detail read our articles on “talent gaps” and the “value of coordination”. Also see Moral Trade, an academic paper by our trustee, Dr. Toby Ord, and Considering Considerateness, an article by our sister charity.
Next up, let's wrap up our entire career guide.
The Washington Redskins rookie class reported today for the start of their very first NFL training camp. However, one major part of their rookie class was missing — first-round pick quarterback Robert Griffin III. With just a week until training camp, the second-overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft does not have a contract and has not shown up.
The big hold up in contract negotiations is the offset language that would reduce guaranteed money for Griffin if they were to unexpectedly be released in the first four years of their career. That is very unlikely to happen, so the Redskins should just budge and guarantee the full contract of the man they chose to lead their franchise.
Washington needs to focus on getting Griffin into camp and they should want the same. As a rookie, especially at quarterback, the worst thing you can do is miss quality reps in training camp. That puts you a step behind the learning curve, and in the NFL, every step counts.
Both sides need to iron out the details and get the former Heisman Trophy winner a contract so they can get to work when camp kicks into high gear. If not, it could be a devastating mistake that could cost Griffin valuable experience leading into their rookie season.
Redskins training camp officially opens July 26th.

The federation representing students at the school had criticized an original draft claiming some of the proposed measures went too far. But on Friday, the school's administration decided to instead review the policy from the start along with students.

The previous updated draft did not involve student consultation.
The school's current liquor policy dates back to 1975. UOttawa spokesperson Patrick Charette said it needs updating to better promote accountability and responsibility and measures such as banning shots or shooters and limiting beer pitchers to groups of three people or more had been on the table.
Charette had also insisted the new rules for campus bars are not a result of binge drinking.
"There's no systemic problem on campus. Let me be clear," they said. "We just want to make sure that we're still meeting our obligations. That's it."
Ontario's liquor laws enough, student union claims
Bar 1848 is operated by the university's student federation and its spokesperson said provincial liquor laws, which the establishment operates under, is enough to maintain safety.
Anne-Marie Roy said staff members are trained to keep an eye on excessive drinking.
"I think that putting these restrictions in the policy is simply not necessary," they said. "We've never had a problem here with the level of consumption of our students."
Roy had also said the proposed rules, which were scrapped, could hurt the bar's revenue.
The university hopes to finalize a new policy by the spring.
The album is being released by the Partnership for a Healthier America , an independent group found in conjunction with Letâs Move.
They call themselves the First Lady, First Mom, and the president's better half.
Childhood obesity rates in America have tripled, and today, nearly one in three children in America are overweight or obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
While schools are critical in creating policies and practices that support healthy behaviors in children, it's not the only factor that can influence a child's lifestyle. Michelle Obama's campaign provides community-wide efforts to teach children to eat better and exercise regularly in hopes of eliminating childhood obesity in one generation.
It's a large feat. But maybe a rap songs like "Veggie Luv" and "Get Up Sit" -- both of which are on the 19-track album titled, "Songs for a Healthier America" -- will provide some good vibrations.
However, there'll be no solos for Mrs. Obama. She'll be featured in video cameos, but most of the singing will come from big names like Jordin Sparks, Ashanti, and Run DMC.
We've seen President Obama showcase their musical talent:
So, how do you think Mrs. Obama will do?
January 2015, Dublin, Ireland: The country's health minister Leo Varadkar has just made history by coming out as gay on a live national radio broadcast. “It's just part of who I am…it is a part of my character,” they say, months before Ireland votes in a landmark referendum to legalise same-sex marriage.
January 2015, Panaji, India: Goa youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar has just declared setting up “gay cure” centres to deal with homosexual youth. “We will make them normal. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will train them and (give them) medicines,” they say.
India woke up on Saturday to celebrate the success of Leo Varadkar, the son of a Mumbai doctor who rose to become Ireland's youngest prime minister. But among the adulations showered on the 38-year-old lies one deliberate omission: The shameful way in which Indian society and political leadership treats it Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) population.
The challenges of living queer in India are well documented. LGBT folks are shut out of our education and employment institutions, and pushed out of housing and public spaces. To be out or present non-normatively is to often invite ridicule, bias and outright violence. And if one is poor, or lower-caste or disabled and is queer, they stop existing not just in collective memory but also for public policy.
But a far more insidious form of discrimination flies under the radar: The refusal of our political leadership to discuss, let alone reform, India's outdated laws that outlaw homosexual people and criminalise the lives of LGBT folks.
Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code has been on the national agenda for at least a decade and half now, since activists approached the Delhi High Court to read down the provisions of the colonial statute. But in these 16 years, not once has the government of the day or the political leadership taken up the cause of people who are among the most marginalised sections of society.
In 2013, when the Supreme Court sounded out Parliament to read down section 377, the political leadership ducked. Two years later, a majority of lawmakers blocked even any discussion on a bill brought by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor to scrap the section. Despite intermittent comments by leaders of the ruling party, and apparent attempts at sounding progressive, little has moved on a basic human rights issue that most parts of the world have resolved. The government seems content on passing the buck to the judiciary, apparently paralysed by the fear of offending sections of the population obsessed with cows.
This toxic concoction of opportunism and apathy is why a Leo Varadkar is impossible in India – an ironic situation considering we regularly elect repeat offenders, people accused of rape and murder who blithely suspend investigations against themselves when in power. We look the other way when suspects, even convicts, enter Parliament. As a nation that seems to have little problem with leaders accused of embezzlement, corruption or murder, a person being gay should be the least of our concerns.
But there are no openly gay politicians in India, and the few transgender representatives have found it difficult to break into larger than a local arena – mainly because non-normative sexual or gender orientation is considered a death knell for one's career.
Varadkar has presented themselves as any other politician to be judged on the merit of their policy -- and there are problems, say, with their position on immigration reform or housing. But in that appraisal, their sexual orientation is increasingly faint as a factor —something unimaginable in our society.
Varadkar's election isn't an event to celebrate for Indians. It is a moment of introspection on how we have systematically disenfranchised a section of our country. Leo Varadkar only has their father to be grateful to, not their country of origin that would have made them a criminal. Thank god they left India.

Language in the 2018 defense policy bill could give the Defense Department (DOD) power over the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve drugs and medical devices for soldiers, a potential shake-up that Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials are pushing back on, Politico reported on Monday.
The Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would allow the Pentagon to sign off on unapproved medical devices and drugs for emergency use on military personnel. Such language would allow the Defense Department to sidestep the FDA, which now has sole authority to approve devices and drugs for emergency use.
The Pentagon would be able to approve “emergency uses for medical products to reduce deaths and severity of injuries caused by agents of war,” the language states, according to Politico.

Officials argue that language — backed by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE (R-Ariz.) — is too broad and would allow DOD to approve innumerable drugs, devices and treatments.
Staff on congressional committees with health jurisdiction told Politico they were blindsided by the provision and are trying to remove it.
One Democratic aide told Politico the language, if approved, would be “unprecedented,” and “a massive shift,” as there has never been a process for where an individual agency could approve drugs and devices for its own use outside of the FDA.
But the Senate Armed Services Committee's conference report defended the proposal, noting the difficulty of accessing freeze-dried plasma for soldiers. A limited number of deployed special forces soldiers have access to freeze-dried plasma — which the Pentagon has said could save lives on the battlefield — but the FDA has yet to give the product full approval.
“Traditional pathways to [FDA] approval and licensure of critical medical products, like freeze dried plasma, for battlefield use are too slow to allow for rapid insertion and use of these products on the battlefield,” the report reads, according to Politico.
“The committee believes this provision could lead to even higher survival rates from severe battlefield wounds suffered by servicemembers.”
The conference language includes several safeguards for such a major shift, but congressional aides and HHS staff argue that they don't measure up to current safety practices and would undermine decades of existing protections and processes.
House and Senate lawmakers are currently in conference to work out the final version of the NDAA, expected as early as this week.

New flavour to be named Scotchy Scotch Scotch, after Ron Burgundy's love for their favourite tipple, though pud itself will be booze-free
Anchorman 2 to get its own ice cream from Ben and Jerry's
"I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly."
With that catchy chant, Ron Burgundy did more than establish their fondness for the drink of the gods; they also paved the way for a new flavour of ice cream.
As a tie-in for the upcoming Anchorman sequel, The Legend Continues, ice cream giants Ben & Jerry's have developed a limited edition variety of the frozen dessert, to be named Scotchy Scotch Scotch.
The new flavour, which contains "butterscotch ice cream with ribbons of butterscotch swirl", instead of any actual alcohol, was unveiled at a launch in New York.
The launch also featured the waterskiing squirrel from the first Anchorman film.
It will be available from US stores, but there are no plans as yet to bring it to the UK.
If nothing else, the ice cream has Burgundy's own seal of approval. The news presenter was quoted as saying: "Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch is a delicious ice cream and I hope Ben and Jerry consider my other suggestions. Malt liquor marshmallow, well liquor bourbon peanut butter, and cheap white wine sherbet."
We have been warned.

Clara Yoon recalls the day their son, who was still in high school, announced that they were transgender.
“My husband and I, just like many other parents, we were shock, in denial and we were afraid,” they remembered. “And it's because one, we didn't know what transgender means and based on our limited experience or understanding, we knew that our son's life was going to be hard.”
That day would be the beginning of a new journey for their son and for Yoon. While its difficult for many Asian children to come out to their families, many parents in turn continue to stay “in the closet.”
A 2010 Boston University study found unique challenges to being gay in the Asian community. Coming out can often lead to rejection from their families and stigmatization by the larger Asian community. Many Asian cultures are socially conservative and in some countries like India homosexuality is illegal.
As a result, parents can also find themselves isolated and alone. And that's what happened to Yoon. But they sought support from organizations like Parents, Families, Friends, and Allies United with LGBTQ People (PFLAG) New York City and found that there were not many Asian parents in the room.
Knowing that they aren't the only parent in the community going through this, Yoon started the Asian support group at PFLAG – creating a much-needed program tailored to meet the language and cultural needs of the Asian community.
Yoon was no longer afraid.
“I had a fear, I didn't know what the reaction would be. But I had to take the step and I had to make the decision to step out of my comfort zone, and I'm so happy being where I am,” they said. “I'm so happy that I can be inspiring figure for other community members and other parents.”
Yoon also teamed up with the Asian Pride Project, a non-profit that recently produced a series of public service announcements in different languages: Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Tagalog, Japanese and more.
Aries Liao is one of the co-founders of the Asian Pride Project.
“Having a family member being able to publicly express their willingness to understand, willingness to connect, willingness to take a stand for the person that they love and care about is a very powerful message to their community,” they said.
Liao's mom, who is Taiwanese, is one of those still struggling to accept their daughter's life. Liao came out several years ago, but their mom still hasn't told most of their family and friends. Liao's goal is to help their mom and others like them find them voice.
“[I want] to give people like my mother the language, the support, the power to be able to talk about themselves without feeling shame, without feeling the need to isolate themselves — the fact that she's not out, that she's not able to talk about me whenever their family and friends say, ‘well is your daughter married, what's going with her' — and they can't share, and it's something that makes me feel very sad,” Liao said.

Oh man. Could you turn down “Serial with aliens”?
That's how one person described the fictional sci-fi podcast the Panoply podcast network wanted me to write in partnership with GE Podcast Theater. It was June, and my summer was already booked. My theater company was about to remount all three parts of my science-fiction epic The Honeycomb Trilogy in October, so my director needed rewrites by August. There wasn't a spare minute for anything else. So of course that's when I got The Message.
The Message was conceived as an eight-part science-fiction serial that would play out like the podcast version of a found-footage thriller, or Orson Welles' legendary War of the World's radio broadcast, never breaking from the podcast format. And no, as it turned out, I couldn't turn down the idea of Serial with aliens. But that meant I'd have to work on both scripts at the same time, revising Honeycomb in time for September rehearsals while furiously writing and rewriting The Message scripts so the production team could hit their target of dropping the first episode at the top of October (which—spoiler alert—they did).
If it's strange to find oneself racing back and forth between a theater script and a podcast script, it's even odder to be writing science fiction for either of these media at all. Despite sci-fi's omnipresence in literature, film, and television, it's still quite unusual on stage. And podcast fiction in any genre, despite its resemblance to the long tradition of radio drama, is still a nascent art form. And strangest of all, because of the coincidence of timing, was the fact that the projects I was juggling were both multipart serials.
Was I successful? I'm very happy with both stories. The Message has attracted a truly surprising number of active, excited listeners, and The Honeycomb Trilogy has gotten the kind of reviews that make me worry some misfortune is headed my way. (It behooves me to tell you that tickets are still available.) Throughout this compressed time period—and largely because I had no choice—I learned four important lessons about writing serialized fiction that apply whether you're writing for at 8 p.m. curtain or for noise-canceling headphones:
Spend your patience points early: Most people approach new entertainment with (perhaps wary) optimism. They're ready to like what you made, as long as you don't screw it up. That optimism manifests in what I call the patience line of credit. This line of credit allows you to take a certain amount time moving the pieces into place. In serialized entertainment, that means your early episodes where you get to spend a little time getting to know your characters in a state of relative tranquility before stuff gets real and all their choices become life-and-death ones. Because once stuff does get real, you can't make the dominos unfall. You can't insert a late-breaking character-hangout scene unencumbered by rising stakes.
Which is why, on The Message, the deadly alien sound doesn't fell any of our code-breaking heroes until the end of Episode 3: because there's no going back from that. From the moment Tamara collapses at their workstation, every other principal character goes straight to crisis mode and stays there. So that, in turn, means that listeners go into crisis mode too, at least in terms of their engagement with the story. And just like that, the patience line of credit I used to get to know Nicky, Robin, Ty, and the rest is exhausted, and Episodes 4 through 8 need to be all about a race for survival.
Based on this same line-of-credit theory, I took a big bet on Advance Man (Part 1 of The Honeycomb Trilogy) that the audience would stick with us through a number of seemingly low-key character scenes without any overt alien stuff happening. A scene where a dad gives their daughter an odd talking-to for getting into fights at school and another involving a late-night BSing session between a teen sister and brother both quietly introduce ideas that pay off significantly later in the trilogy. But if those scenes happened in Part 2 or 3? It would play as total wheel-spinning and the audience would start shifting unhappily in their chairs. You've got to spend your patience points while the line of credit is still active.
Write for the medium you're writing for: We're so used to science fiction on film and TV that we reflexively ape those media when writing for the genre in any format. But you're already losing when you don't write to the strengths of your medium.
With The Message, I quickly realized that the alien menace had to be a sound. Badly written radio drama is absolutely rife with people shrieking “Dear God, it's 10 feet tall and ringed with tentacles!” because listeners can't see the ring of tentacles. But I recalled the marvelous Doctor Who is a audio play Scherzo, in which the doctor and their companion are stalked on a zero-visibility planet by a creature made of sound. This stroke of genius by author Robert Shearman ensured that the doctor and the listeners would have the exact same experiences of the monster. In an early meeting for The Message, I learned that our sponsor, GE, was one of several companies doing pioneering work in sound-based medical treatments. My mind immediately jumped to: If a sound can cure a person, maybe it can also make them sick? And just like that I knew I had my monster.
Theater has centuries of accrued storytelling techniques. With The Honeycomb Trilogy, even though it was the kind of story associated with other media, we've depicted it entirely through the traditions of the stage. Advance Man is an American living-room play, with a family crumbling around the sofa. Blast Radius is an extremely dark Shakespearean pastoral, with nobles, commoners, disguises, and a whole bunch of weddings in the last scene. Sovereign is a Greek tragedy about the fall of a great ruler, depicted in real time. Way better dramatists than me came up with these structures. All I did was use them to tell science-fiction stories.
Learn from your collaborators: It's wonderful when script and design can be devised in concert with one another. Designers come up with terrific new ideas when they're realizing elements from your script, so don't be afraid to feed those discoveries straight into your rewrites. Writing the first draft of The Message, I had to have the characters describe what the alien transmission sounds like, even though I hadn't yet heard the actual sound we'd be using in the podcast. So I guessed, having Jeanette and Tamara describe it as a choral, contrapuntal melody sung by multiple extraterrestrial voices. Brendan Baker, a sound designer on The Message, had a better idea. The sound they created worked on more of a call-and-response model, and they sent me some detailed thoughts explaining why. I loved it, turned their ideas into new dialogue, and instantly Episode 3 became cleverer than it ever could have been if mine was the only brain behind it.
Once upon a time I would've reacted defensively to something like this, but I've learned from many years of collaboration with smart designers to take a minute and listen. When I was rewriting Sovereign (Part 3 of the trilogy), our set designer Sandy Yaklin was designing the set based on my first draft. We were working in the same room—we're married—when they brought me the idea, nonexistent in the first draft, of covering one whole wall of the set with a rough-hewn memorial to the characters who had died in previous installments of the trilogy. This was a flat-out brilliant idea, and I wouldn't have thought of in a million years. Now in Sovereign, every time a character makes reference to a lost friend or lover, they or they can touch that character's name on the wall. The end result is a remarkable image: All the terrible losses our heroes have accrued towering over them as they struggle to make one final, difficult decision.
Use the right kind of cliffhanger: As far as I can tell, there are basically two kinds of cliffhangers.
“How are they gonna get out of that?”: Basically the literal kind of cliffhanger. A character you like is in immediate danger with no clear means of escape, so you come back next time to see how (or if) they survive.
“Whoa, everything's different now!”: A revelation of new information that changes the parameters of the narrative, letting the heroes know they're in a larger and more challenging world than they previously thought.
When you're writing a serialized story, you need to know which of the two kinds to use for which situations. And that choice depends on the realities of broadcast frequency: Since The Message comes out every Sunday, I know no one will have to wait more than seven days to find out what happens. And the shortness of the episodes (most come in under 15 minutes) made me think about silent film–era serials, and I thought I'd honor that tradition by using a lot of “How are they gonna get out of that?”–style cliffhangers, many involving principal characters falling to the extraterrestrial sound-sickness. But I knew that couldn't be my only trick—so that's why Episode 4 ends with a major “Whoa, everything's different now!” paradigm shift that pushes the story in a whole new direction.
The Honeycomb Trilogy is a different ballgame. When my company first produced it in 2012, we staged each play months apart from the others. That's a long time to wait for the resolution of a peril-based cliffhanger. (The Empire Strikes Back pulled this off, but that doesn't mean you should try it.) So the first two plays needed endings that would make audiences want to come back—but that wouldn't make them angry about waiting. So I needed two huge “Whoa, everything's different now!” cliffhangers, and I think we got them. The great part, though, is that two-act plays like these have intermissions, so that's where I could have my “How are they gonna get out of that?”–style cliffhanger fun. The intermission of Sovereign probably has the best cliffhanger I'll write if I live to be 100 years old.
Serial storytelling is enormously challenging for a lot of reasons, but those are the same reasons it's enormously fun. The exhilaration I felt in crafting the right kind of slow build, using the medium to the best advantage, bouncing ideas off collaborators, and nailing the cliffhangers felt like writing at its most recreational. Which in the end is what you're shooting for. If it's recreational for you, nine times out of 10 it'll be recreational for the people who come to see it. Or hear it, every Sunday night.
After trying something new with the Blaze pseudo-smartwatch, Fitbit's most recent endeavor is an upgrade to one of its most popular devices. The Charge 2 has already booted the Charge HR from Fitbit's website, and rightly so since it's essentially a refined version of the original tracker. Launched with the new style-conscious Flex 2, the $150 Charge 2 lies smack in the middle of Fitbit's family in terms of price and features. It does everything the Charge HR did, with a larger display and new swappable band options, and it can now also track estimated VO2 max and guide you through interval training exercises. But are those new features enough to persuade current Charge HR users to upgrade? Should new users give Fitbit a try with this device?
Design: Familiar, with more choices
With its 1.5-inch OLED display and attached band, the Charge 2 looks much like a stretched-out Fitbit Alta. Unlike the Charge HR, the Charge 2 has interchangeable bands so you can detach both sides of the band from the center module and replace them with differently colored and textured options. While it doesn't have the ostentatious jewelry options that the Flex 2 has, you can get the Charge 2 in black, purple, blue, and teal, as well as two "special edition" options, one with rose gold accents on the module and a lavender band and one with black module accents and a black textured band. If you're feeling fancy, you can also get leather bands in pink, brown, and blue colorways for the device.
Specs compared: Fitbit Charge 2 vs other Fitbits Device Charge 2 Charge HR Flex 2 Blaze Surge Price $150 $130 $100 $200 $250 Display type 1.5-inch OLED narrow OLED 1-inch OLED, flashing lights-based color LCD touchscreen 0.82 x 0.96-inch monochrome LCD GPS connected GPS none none connected GPS onboard GPS Heart rate monitor Yes Yes No Yes Yes SmartTrack auto-tracking Yes Yes Yes Smart notifications Call, text, calendar Call Call, text Call, text, calendar Call, text Estimated VO2 max, guided breathing Yes No No No No Interchangeable bands Yes No Yes Yes No Battery life 5 days 5 days 5 days 5 days 7 days
The Charge 2's design is familiar, which will make it a seamless upgrade item for anyone who has an old Charge HR. Interchangeable band options are how Fitbit is hoping to infuse excitement into the design, but the bands are ultimately the same types we've seen on nearly every Fitbit device. The Flex 2 has more versatility with its smaller construction and a plethora of bangles, necklaces, and wristbands to choose from. But even then, all of the new options are still pretty predictable. Another important difference is that the Flex 2 is Fitbit's first swim-proof tracker—the Charge 2 is only splash-proof, so don't try to go into the pool with it.
Aside from the larger display, the Charge 2 doesn't differ too much from the Charge HR aesthetically. It doesn't even have an onboard GPS, which would be a big differentiator, but it can connect to your smartphone's GPS to map outdoor activity. Its underbelly has an optical heart rate monitor that measures your pulse throughout the day, contributing to your heart rate readings, "cardio fitness level" score (or estimated VO2 max), and guided breathing exercises. Also on its underside are two charging nodes to which the proprietary charger connects when you need to get more power. The Charge 2 is supposed to last up to five days on a single charge, and I found that estimate to be accurate.
Like most of the other Fitbit devices I've used, the Charge 2 is easy to wear and doesn't become uncomfortable during long workouts. Fitbit has had issues in the past with Fitbit Force users developing rashes and skin irritations, enough to have the company recall that product a few years ago. It's important to remember that only the Fitbit Flex 2 is waterproof enough to withstand swimming, so I avoided getting my Charge 2 wet and wore it snuggly around my wrist, but not so tight that it would cut off circulation. You won't be able to avoid sweating on the band if you work out regularly, so taking it off for a few minutes a day (likely when you're bathing) should keep any skin irritation at bay.

Not as many new features as you may think
Fitbit's Charge 2 and Flex 2 are not radically new and different gadgets; they are examples of fine-tuned devices that build on the success of older models. The new things you can do on the Charge 2 are monitored your "cardio fitness level," or estimated VO2 max measurement, and set up interval training. VO2 max is the maximum rate that your body can use oxygen during intense exercise, and the most accurate way to measure it is to be hooked up to multiple machines that measure heart rate as well as oxygen and carbon dioxide output and input.
The Charge 2 is certainly the cheapest fitness tracker that can give you an estimate of this statistic (a few high-end Garmin and Polar devices measure it as well), but Fitbit translates it into a "cardio fitness" score that places you on a spectrum for people of your sex and age. The Charge 2 measures VO2 max over time by taking into account your profile, heart rate, and workout data, so your score will likely change by a few points as it gathers more heart rate and workout information. While it's a useful metric that can tell you how fit you are overall and can give you a glimpse into how efficiently your body uses oxygen during a workout, the cardio fitness score should be taken with a grain of salt. The Charge 2's heart rate monitor was fairly accurate in my testing, but since VO2 max also requires an oxygen measurement to be truly accurate, cardio fitness scores are truly estimates and nothing more. Also, if you're just using the Charge 2 to track daily movement rather than hardcore workouts, you probably won't look at that score often.
The new interval training feature is basically a customizable workout option that combines short periods of rapid movement with short rest periods. In the Fitbit app, you can set how long you want to move vigorously and how long you want to rest, and the band will vibrate at the end of each interval, signaling you to change. I tried the feature out on my gym's ARC trainer, going full speed for one minute then resting (or in my case, slowing to bring my heart rate down) for another minute. I've done this routine many times before while using the timer on the machine to track my intervals, but the Charge 2's interval training feature made it much easier. I simply waited to feel the vibration on my wrist instead of constantly having to look at the machine.
The rest of the Charge 2 experience is similar to that of the Charge HR or the Alta. The new device tracks daily activity, steps, and its included workout routines, as well as sleep and continuous heart rate. The device's display shows you the time as well as steps, heart rate, distance, calories, floors climbed, and active minutes when you tap on it. Pressing the singular side button scrolls between the home screen, live heart rate readings, workouts, a stopwatch, and the new Relax feature that guides you through slow, two-minute breathing exercises. The inclusion of Relax will be a perk for anyone serious about meditating or taking a moment during the day to clear their head. As someone whose heart rate can speed up from frequent bouts of nervousness, I found that Relax helped me calm down throughout the day.
The Charge 2's larger touchscreen lets you interact with the device more than you could with the narrow display on the Charge HR, and one of the best things you can access is the workout shortcuts page. You can save up to seven workout profiles to start tracking a session quickly without using the mobile app. SmartTrack, Fitbit's automatic activity recognition system, only works for a few exercises—including running, walking, and biking—so if you frequently use the elliptical, do interval training, or engage in another exercise, the shortcut will become your best friend. You only have to press and hold the side button when your chosen workout is on the screen to begin tracking. The same gesture will stop the monitoring when you're finished.
Fitbit's auto-tracking continues to impress, though, so you can rely on that feature to pick up most running, walking, and biking workouts (it can also auto-track "aerobic workouts" like dance and Zumba, as well as a few select sports including basketball and soccer). I'm not a seasoned runner, so I often alternate running a few minutes with walking a few minutes, and I was worried that the Charge 2 might not record my workout because of that back-and-forth. Not so—it registered just about 30 minutes of running (which was more like 20 minutes of running and 10 minutes of power-walking) without me starting a workout manually. The graphs in the app reflected my heart rate as well, showing where I peaked during the hardest parts of my run and where my heart rate gradually slowed down when I transitioned to walking.
Other Fitbit devices have had smartphone notifications for some time, and the Charge 2 can similarly receive call, text, and calendar alerts. The screen isn't large enough to let you read full text messages, but the first few characters will appear along with the sender's name (if they are a contact) or number. The Blaze is Fitbit's true smartwatch, so all of its other devices are going to feel limited in comparison, but those short alerts do help if your smartphone is across the room and you want a peek at who's contacting you. But the notifications also feel a bit limited when compared to Garmin's $150 Vivosmart HR, which can receive all of your smartphone's alerts.
Fitbit has also incorporated little messages it calls "Chatter" that will buzz your device and appear on the screen every now and then. They're mostly motivational, encouraging you to move or be active, saying things like "Go for 150 [steps] more!" You can turn off Chatter if you'd rather not have them blowing up your wrist, and those messages are separate from reminders to move, which you can set for certain days and times of the week or turn off altogether.

NEW YORK, United States — On Tuesday night, fast fashion giant H&M and Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing will host a runway show and afterparty to formally debut the results of their one-off collaboration — Balmain x H&M — an accessibly-priced collection of more than 100 pieces for both men and women, set to go on sale in select H&M stores around the world, as well as online, on November 5th. By now, it's become something of a tradition for H&M to stage an annual event in New York to launch its latest designer collaboration, typically complemented by a news-making musical guest. Last year, the unveiling of Alexander Wang x H&M came with a performance by Missy Elliott. In 2011, Versace x H&M pulled both Prince and Nicki Minaj.
This year, as usual, rumours are swirling about which pop star will join Rousteing on stage at the old JPMorgan Chase bank on Wall Street. (H&M says that the venue will include a two-storey runway and platforms “strategically placed for surprises throughout the evening.") But there's no doubting every moment of the event will be meticulously documented on social media by the audience of roughly 1,000 attendees. After all, Balmain's runway show attracted more engagement on Instagram during the recent Spring 2016 season than any other, according to the social media platform. Rousteing, who was appointed creative director of Balmain in 2011, has focused intently on connecting directly with their digital fans. An active Instagram user with over 1.4 million followers of their own, the designer acts as a gentle general to what they call their ‘Balmain Army,' the senior ranks of which include the Kardashians and Gigi Hadid. “I want everyone to know they are welcome in the Balmain world,” Rousteing told BoF. “Balmain is a luxury label of expense and exclusivity that only a few can afford, but I also believe that fashion should be inclusive.”
It's widely understood that H&M's designer collaborations, released in limited-edition, make up a tiny percentage of overall sales for the world's second largest apparel retailer. But the marketing benefits — said to be measured in billions of media impressions, a metric used to determine how many times consumers see mention of the collaboration — can be significant and help boost positive brand perception and drive consumers to H&M stores.
H&M doesn't release results on its designer collaborations. But, in 2014, analytics company Crimson Hexagon examined 171,345 social media posts to gauge the impact of Alexander Wang x H&M on consumer perception of the brand. The firm found that general positive sentiment toward H&M accounted for 25 percent of the social media conversation the week the collaboration was announced (April 13-19, 2014) and 34 percent the week the collaboration was released in stores (November 2-8, 2014), compared to an average of 10 percent over the nine month period the firm analysed (April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014). Crimson Hexagon also parsed social media posts for “intent to purchase.” During the week of the release, about half of the conversations contained intent to buy something, compared to an average of 14 percent.
“It's brand building, of course. It creates a buzz and maybe gets people who never shopped at H&M before to shop with us,” explained H&M creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson, who worked directly with Rousteing and the Balmain team on the initiative. “We've been doing [designer collaborations] for 11 years now — and we didn't necessarily expect to. They are successful.”
The benefits go both ways. For one thing, a collaboration with H&M can offer a quick cash injection (previous designers have reportedly been paid $1 million and up for their services). What's more, for a steadily growing but still sub-scale luxury label like Balmain, with annual sales of just over €30 million (about $34 million) in 2012, the sheer exposure generated by a collaboration with the Swedish retail giant can be powerful.
“I love Instagram because my followers can be part of the Balmain life. Now, with this H&M collaboration, they will get the chance to finally wear the pieces for themselves,” said Rousteing. Of course, the typical H&M customer is not the typical Balmain customer. And Balmain x H&M pieces are not Balmain pieces (which can often sell for thousands of dollars). But for a luxury brand like Balmain, the secret to manufacturing desire exists in the tension between being highly visible and highly exclusive at the same time. The H&M collaboration “will make the Balmain customer see how everyone wants Balmain but can't have it,” the company's chief executive officer, Emmanuel Diemoz, recently told The New Yorker.
Balmain x H&M would not exist if it weren't for Karl Lagerfeld, who changed the course of fashion — both high and low — when they became the first designer to collaborate with H&M in 2004. “In the hardcore fashion world in Paris, it would have looked a bit funny to walk around with an H&M bag,” said Donald Schneider, the creative consultant to H&M, who conceived the designer collaboration concept more than a decade ago. “Suddenly, it was totally okay for a woman to walk into the Ritz wearing H&M with a Dior top. It opened up a lot of things.”
The process behind each designer collaboration varies, although Schneider insists that the “surprise factor” is core to every collection. “We always want to give the customer something they wouldn't really expect,” they said. While H&M is constantly in talks with multiple fashion houses on possible partnerships, the decision to follow collaborations with Isabel Marant (2013) and Alexander Wang (2014) — two relatively accessible brands — with Balmain, whose pieces are regularly priced in the five figures, was a pointed one. “It's a high-fashion brand that makes everybody dream.”
According to Schneider, Rousteing was highly enthusiastic about the project. “The most important thing, of course, is to have a designer who is really burning to do this. Who gives it all [his or her] energy,” they said. “It needs to be a tight collaboration, with everything in sync. It's really important to us that the designer is happy with everything we do. We have to have tremendous respect for each other, because we're going to spend nine months, a year, of time together to make something amazing.”
To be sure, H&M is able to attract labels like Balmain because of its winning track record. “[Before 2004], if there was talk about H&M, it was about the campaigns, not the fashion,” Schneider says. Back then, they suggested bringing in a “super designer” so people would “actually talk about the collection. I thought we should start at the top and I knew Karl Lagerfeld quite well, so I asked him. It's a liberating process for a designer to speak for a short amount of time to a lot of people around the world and they understood that. The first thing they asked was not about money or anything, but if anyone else had done this before. They were very courageous. Most designers need validation.”
For the inaugural campaign, Schneider suggested shooting Lagerfeld themselves — perhaps the most famous living designer in the world — alongside models wearing the collection. Since then, the approach has varied. However, it's always important to Schneider that the collaborating fashion house's image is reflected in the campaign. For Balmain, H&M hired photographer Mario Sorrenti, who shoots the house's own advertisements, as well as several of Rousteing's favourite models, including Gigi Hadid, Hao Yun Xiang, Jourdan Dunn and Kendall Jenner. “It has a lot to do with the existing image of the brand. We don't want Balmain or Olivier to become H&M. We want H&M [to become] Balmain for that short moment in time.”
Developing the actual collection required a similar synergy. While Rousteing was eager to release even more product than what will be on the racks November 5th, H&M encourages its designers to keep the style count below 45 total pieces for women. “We want to [display] the collection in the best area of the store, and that area is limited,” Johansson explained. “He wanted to do more pieces and we had to stop him, really!” While H&M will also step in if the assortment is off — if there are not enough trousers for example, or too many dresses — the goal is to keep the creative integrity of the designer brand in place. “With Oliver, it's been very intimate in a way, because they have a small team,” Johansson continued. “I do think he's a brilliant designer, and we had a lot of fun together.”
For Rousteing, it was critical to produce items that were not simply copies of their showpieces. “I also want to show the different sides of Balmain,” they said. “Not just the dresses and embellished pieces, but also the tailoring, the oversized silhouettes, the draping and Parisian femininity, as well as the pieces for the urban warrior.”
The designer's goal was to give the H&M customer spending $200 the same feeling and experience of a Balmain customer spending $20,000. “For me, it was important to approach everything about this collaboration the same as if it were for Balmain. If the label says Balmain, it has to have the same richness, the same attitude, the same positivity and energy,” they said. “Each campaign has its own story and for the H&M collaboration I wanted to show the power and diversity of the #HMBalmaination,” they said, referring to the hashtag created for the launch of the collaboration, which has already been tagged in more than 12,800 posts. “The models are all so different, to show that Balmain x H&M is for everyone, no matter where they come from.”

Researchers at the University of New Mexico (UNM) have made an incredible discovery that could help us better understand not just black holes, but also the universe.
For the first time ever, astronomers have observed and measured two supermassive black holes orbiting one another. The black holes are hundreds of millions of light-years from us, but that just happens to be the perfect distance from the Earth for optimal observation.
The observation process was an undertaking 12 years in the making. "For a long time, we've been looking into space to try and find a pair of these supermassive black holes orbiting as a result of two galaxies merging," Professor Greg Taylor explained in a UNM news release. "Even though we've theorized that this should be happening, nobody had ever seen it until now."
The team used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to plot the black holes' trajectories and confirm that they are indeed in orbit with one another. However, the size of the black holes makes their orbital period around 24,000 years, so even after viewing the binary system for over a decade, the scientists have yet to witness any curvature in their orbit.

Learning Opportunity
These orbiting black holes could teach us a great deal about our universe. "Supermassive black holes have a lot of influence on the stars around them and the growth and evolution of the galaxy," Taylor explained. "So, understanding more about them and what happens when they merge with one another could be important for our understanding for the universe."
Bob Zavala, an astronomer with the U.S. Naval Observatory, likens the potential of this discovery to what astronomers were able to learn about stars from studying their binary orbits. "Now we'll be able to use similar techniques to understand super-massive black holes and the galaxies they reside within," they told UNM.

The UNM team plans to observe the black holes again in three or four years to confirm their findings and get a more precise reading of the orbit. This discovery will undoubtedly provide a wealth of new knowledge for many years to come.

The governor of Guam, facing threats from North Korea, said Wednesday that they want a president who will respond with “fury” if U.S. territories are attacked.
Many have criticized Trump for promising “fire and fury” if North Korea continues to threaten the United States, especially with nuclear weapons, but Gov. Eddie Calvo seemed unbothered by Trump's approach.
“As far as I'm concerned, as an American citizen, I want a president that says that if any nation such as North Korea attacks Guam…that they will be met with hell and fury,” Calvo declared.
In fact, Calvo said they were more disturbed by Sen. Lindsey Graham's statement that “if there was going to be a war, it would be in the region, not in America.”
“This is American sovereign soil…there are over 200,000 American citizens,” Calvo said, noting their island's geographic proximity to North Korea.

THE shooting rampage on Sunday that killed six people and wounded three others at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin exposed the continued dangers of white power extremism in our midst. The shooter, Wade M. Page, was affiliated with a range of neo-Nazi skinhead groups, and during the last decade, they played in several prominent bands in the white power music scene.
Mr. Page's neighbors said they were “stunned” that they could have done something so violent or have been connected to extremist hate culture. And yet that culture claims an estimated 50,000 adherents nationwide, far more than most people realize. The white power movement persists, and even thrives, but not always in the ways we think.
Popular stereotypes paint neo-Nazis as young, swastika-tattooed skinheads yelling obscenities about blacks, Jews, gays and other so-called enemies of the white race, usually surrounded by counterprotesters and the police. In some ways, we are comforted by such images, because they let us believe it's easy to identify extremists and intervene when they seem threatening.
But the reality is more complicated. White power adherents are not typically “out” about their extremist leanings. They straddle the worlds of white power and mainstream society, often publicly playing down or hiding their extremist identities. In the past, this might have been a hindrance. But these days they thrive in what we call hidden spaces of hate, often online, where they gather to support one another and their cause.

Among the most important hidden spaces is the white power music scene. Neo-Nazis are particularly adept at incorporating music into just about every aspect of the movement, having grasped the medium's capacity to bring adherents together into shared experiences and sustain communities anchored in Aryan ideology.

One Million Moms, a Christian advocacy group known for organizing boycotts against media and companies that don't meet their moral standards, have singled out AMC's Preacher as the latest target of their inquisition.
"The AMC series Preacher is advertised as gory good fun and airs during primetime," reads a petition launched on OMM's website. "The 'preacher' in the show is far from it, and the program blasphemes Jesus in the latest episode with the Son of God depicted as a lying s-x p-rvert. The show opens with extremely graphic Jesus s-x scene and closes with an inbred Messiah. (A dash “-“ is used to bypass internet filters.) AMC continues to air the anti-Christian program Preacher on Monday evenings at 9:00 p.m. ET/ 8:00 p.m. CT."
The scene in question took place in the episode "Dirty Little Secret," which depicted Jesus Christ engaging in debauchery the night before their crucifixion. Along with describing the acts in detail, OMM's petition demands an apology from AMC and the immediate cancellation of Preacher.
They also urge their supporters to engage in letter writing campaigns aimed at getting Febreze and Verizon, companies which advertise during Preacher, to rescind their sponsorship.
The petition concludes by asserting that, by airing Preacher, "AMC is promoting and supporting bigotry and animosity toward people of faith."
OMM previously launched a series of petitions to cancel Fox's Lucifer. Currently 12,702 of the 'One Million' Moms have signed the Preacher petition.
Preacher airs Monday nights on AMC.
3. Men are just as sensitive as women.
We're talking about sensitivity to touch, of course. When it comes to sensation on your genitals, men and women are almost identical.
Separate studies at Cornell University (for women) and Michigan State University (for men) used a scientific device that measures the lightest amount of pressure a person can feel on their skin. For guys, the most sensitive areas were the tip of the foreskin, and the area on the underside of the penis just below the glans called the frenulum.
For the ladies, the most receptive regions were the inner labia.

But according to the sensitivity scale, men and women were in a dead heat. Both genders responded to the same level of touch: Just two-tenths of a gram of pressure could be felt.
Latest story: Phil Spector convicted of second-degree murder
Phil Spector has been convicted of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of actor Lana Clarkson six years ago. An L.A. Superior Court jury reached its decision against the legendary music producer after nine days of deliberations. An earlier jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of guilt.
The decision means the 69-year-old Spector, famed for their work with musical acts such as Tina Turner, the Beatles and the Righteous Brothers, faces at least 18 years in prison when they are sentenced. The jury determined that Spector killed Lana Clarkson, a statuesque blond actor, on Feb. 3, 2003, just hours after they met in the Sunset Strip club where they worked as a hostess.
Over the course of the trial, which began in October, the prosecution portrayed Spector as a sadistic misogynist who had a three-decade “history of playing Russian roulette with the lives of women” when they were drunk. A prosecutor told jurors in their summation that “by the grace of God, five other women got the empty chamber and lived to tell. Lana just happened to be the sixth woman who got the bullet.”
Spector's defense contended Clarkson died by their own hand. They said they were depressed over their flagging career and the accompanying financial worries, and may have committed suicide impulsively after hours of late-night drinking with Spector.
Spector arrived in court Monday wearing a "Barack Obama" button.

Best practices are important, but often overlooked in a world overloaded with information. This is why presenting information in a digestible form is really helpful. We've released a couple of cheat sheets on various topics ranging from Java 8 best practices, to advice on how to use Java 8 streams, to the most useful git commands and workflows.
This time we're going to talk about Docker. The sparkling unicorn of containerization happening in the world of software development and the amazing tool that can simplify the configuration of your projects tenfold.
We considered how we use docker at ZeroTurnaround, what are the current best practices and what commands we need to google most frequently. Then we combined this data into a cheat sheet, so you can also benefit from this work.
SHOW ME THE PRINTABLE DOCKER CHEAT SHEET!
Let's now go into more details about what is great about Docker and what commands you're most likely to use daily. Also, if you don't mind, I'll be incredibly happy, if you share it with your colleagues and friends:
One Docker to rule your containers
Docker is an open platform to develop, ship, and run applications, more commonly known as a container manager. What's a container you ask? A container is an encapsulated environment, which runs on top of a very shallow level of abstractions, providing a virtual machine like isolation for running processes. Now if you are just started with Docker, it's important we define the vocabulary that you'll need to learn as well as a number of utilities you need to master to become proficient with Docker.
Let's start with the terms. In a nutshell Docker uses images to specify what the container infrastructure should look like for you to run your apps in it.
Layer – a set of read-only files to provision the system. Think of a layer as a read only snapshot of the filesystem.
– a set of read-only files to provision the system. Think of a layer as a read only snapshot of the filesystem. Image – a read-only layer that is the base of your container. It can have a parent image to abstract away the more basic filesystem snapshot. So a Java image would inherit from a linux image with the preinstalled utilities. A tomcat image will have a Java image as the parent because it depends on Java to run Tomcat.

Container – a runnable instance of the image, basically it is a process isolated by docker that runs on top of the filesystem that an image provides.

Registry / Hub is the central place where all publicly published images live. You can search it, upload your images there and when you pull a docker image, it comes the repository/hub.

Docker machine is a VM within which you can run Docker containers. On Linux you can run docker containers natively, but on OSX and Windows you need a layer of abstraction. A docker machine will spin a very lightweight virtual machine that integrates with the docker command line utilities really well.

A docker machine will spin a very lightweight virtual machine that integrates with the docker command line utilities really well. Docker compose is a utility to run multiple containers as a system of containers. It will take care of making them aware of each other and ensure they're properly connected to each other. This means you can run your application in one container and your database in a different container, and your analytics application in a different container, and so on. This is the ultimate isolation and it means that your applications are independent and are run in development in a very similar way to how the system might work in production.
Now with the basic terminology cleared, it's time to look at the command line utilities that will make you love Docker.
This cheat sheet is brought to you by XRebel, a tool to remind you about your app performance when you are actually working on it, not later when your clients think it is already slow. If you're working with any Java web applications, you should try it. It might change your attitude towards performance. Try XRebel
Docker machine
Docker machine is a utility that lets you install Docker on virtual hosts, and then manage those hosts from the command line. Why should developers be interested in docker machine? It is currently the preferred way to run Docker on OSX and Windows. It also helps you to provision and manage docker containers on a network of machines, but that is less interesting from the developer's point of view.
Docker machine will create a tiny virtual machine that is capable or running docker itself.
After installing the machine you run a command like:
docker-machine start default
And your virtual machine named default is ready. However, what you also want is to make docker on the host system understand that it has to work with that virtual machine. To do that you'll run:
docker-machine env default eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
This command will configure your command line environment variables that will help you use docker with a particular docker-machine, in our case default, without additional complexity. As a developer you'll rarely need anything else from the docker machine, you can list the available machines with the docker-machine ls command and start or stop any particular of them by calling docker-machine start|stop machine-name .
And now we're finally ready to dive into the heaven of containerized applications.
Building a container
A docker container is basically a process or a set of processes running in isolation with a predefined provisioned file system. Think about it this way, a container is a collection of processes that have access to the files in the image.
Images are loaded from the registry, where they are publicly available to anyone. They form a hierarchy, so images can have dependencies on other images. This is really convenient, as your development platform images can depend on the image with common OS utilities.
docker pull image_name:tag
The pull command will download the image and all its parents needed to create the containers with that image. The tag parameter is usually used as the part of the name, but if your container evolves, or includes different versions of the software used, it's nice to tag them without changing the base image name.
docker create --name container_name image_name:tag
The create command is used to instantiate the container from the image. You almost always want to name it by providing the –name parameter. To start and stop the container, naturally, you'll use the docker start container_name and docker stop container_name commands respectively. Also, almost always when there's a stop command, there's a kill command too, to terminate the process less graciously.
Now there's a shorthand for create and start command, which is the run. It will create the container and run it, which is really useful for the various one-liners. We'll look at them in the next section of this post.
Sometimes you will want to create your own images, either to dockerize your project setup or just because you can. There are 2 ways to do that.
Create a dockerfile in the directory that describes the image and then run:
docker commit -m "commit message" -a "author" container_id username/imagename:tag
How do you change the container? You start it and then execute commands you like. To run a command inside the container namespace you run the following docker command:
docker exec -ti container_name "command.sh"
And while your container is running, you can do that multiple times: install necessary components, copy files around, etc. In general, you don't want to build your project into the container, you just map the filesystem on the host to a directory inside the docker container. Then you don't have to worry about changing the build process for your project and you can run it in the same fashion on your host or in the docker container. But if you build the project in the container, map or commit your local Maven repository, npm modules or that of any dependency management tool you use: if you will avoid downloading the internet again and again and make building the project so much faster.
Docker compose
We are now in a position to create and run a container. Let's stick a full copy of your workstation into a single container. Actually no, instead we'll be smart and isolate various components from each other.
Consider the following typical project: a web application consists of one or more backend services and a database. While it is possible to fit all that into a single container, that is clearly not a best practice. So we'll run these parts of the system independently and manage a couple of containers.
Luckily, there's the utility that helps us with just that, docker-compose. Docker compose allows you to specify a relationship between several containers in a yml file, and then run all of these containers at once.
The syntax for the docker-compose.yml is pretty straightforward. You specify the container name, the image it should use and the starting command for the container. Additionally you can specify the mapping of the ports to your host machine ports and the mapping of the filesystem, so your docker container can see the files from your host system.
version: "2" services: web: container_name: "web" image: java:8 # image name command: java -jar /app/app.jar # command to run ports: # map ports to the host - "4567:4567" volumes: # map filesystem to the host - ./myapp.jar:/app/app.jar mongo: # container name image: mongo # image name
The best part of all this is that you can link the containers together. In the example above, we link the web container to the mongo container, so our web application will be able to find the database. And docker-compose takes care of providing the port mappings between the linked containers.
Let's chat more about port mappings. You most likely won't be able to access your web application on your host machine using localhost as the hostname. This is because your container is running in the docker-machine, instead of your host machine.
One way to overcome that is to use the following command to figure out the IP of your docker-machine:
docker-machine ip default
Alternatively you can use the forward2docker utility, that our colleague Sergei created, to monitor your docker-machine usage and automatically forward the ports to the localhost. This way, you can use your running application in a docker container as if it were available on localhost.
Useful Docker commands
Let's go over the most useful docker one line commands that you might need along the way. This section somewhat recaps the commands we saw above, but repetition is the best way to remember something, so stay with us.
Download an image, and all its parents, from the registry:
docker pull image_name
Run a shell command inside a freshly created and started container:
docker run -ti --name container_name image_name /command
Start and stop a container, duh!
docker start container_name docker stop container_name
Run a command inside a container from the image and remove the container when command is done.
docker run --rm -ti image_name /command
Run Tomcat on Java 8 with a custom javaagent attached. This command illustrates mapping the volumes on your host system into the docker container filesystem, see the -v flag part.
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v /host/path/to/your/agent/agent.jar:/agent.jar -e JAVA_OPTS="-javaagent:/agent.jar" tomcat:8.0.29-jre8
Run a shell command in the container:
docker exec -ti container_name "cmd"
To show and follow the log output of the container execute:
docker logs -ft container_name
When finishing a day, you can easily kill all running docker containers:
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
Delete the dangling docker images, the ones that are not tagged properly and are hanging around usually as the result of the intermediate container creation:
docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)
Remove all stopped containers, this will actually try to remove all the containers, but will fail to do so with the running ones, so only stopped containers will be gone after that.

Voronoi Diagrams on the GPU Feb 25, 2016 • 8 minute read
Disclaimer: the demos on this page use WebGL features that aren't available on many mobile devices. For the best experience, read this on a Desktop computer.
What is a Voronoi diagram? Suppose you have a clean, blank canvas. I rudely paint three dots on it: one blue, one red, one purple. Then I ask you to paint the rest of the canvas by painting 1mm by 1mm squares at a time. Before you color each square, you find the closest dot that I painted and you use that dot's color to fill in the square. What you'd end up with is a Voronoi diagram!
The demo below does just that. You paint the dots on the first canvas, and this webpage will fill in the second canvas with a Voronoi diagram. If you're curious, you can find the code here.
The rest of this section gives a few more demos of Voronoi diagrams. Afterward, I explain how the code on this webpage is generating them. You can skip ahead if you like!
In the demo below, the first canvas has a yellow dot moving in a sea of blue dots. The second canvas shows the corresponding Voronoi diagram. I like to pretend that it's a yellow fish swimming in water.
You can move your mouse over either canvas to control the fish.
In the first canvas below there are dots in a radial pattern overlaid on top of a photo. Each dot takes the color of the underlying pixel in the image. Drag the circle to move the dots and drag the square to rotate them.
How does it work?
If you just want to play with Voronoi diagrams, you can skip to the end of this post. If you wanna know how to generate them really quickly, read on!
The Voronoi diagrams on this page are generated using an approach called ‘Jump Flooding'. It's from a paper called Jump Flooding in GPU with Applications to Voronoi Diagram and Distance Transform. We'll call it JFA because that's a lot to write out.
The input to JFA is a canvas with some colored seeds (aka dots) on it. Since we're dealing with computers, the canvas is an array of transparent pixels and the dots are pixels with color.
The algorithm works in “rounds”. In a given round you iterate through each pixel in the canvas and look at 8 pixels around it. When I say ‘8 pixels around it' you're probably thinking of the 8 direct neighbours but THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT! When I explain this algorithm to friends, this is the main place they get tripped up. I'll explain this in detail later, but for now just know that…
the algorithm works in ‘rounds'
in each round, you visit each pixel in the grid
when visiting a pixel, you look at SOME 8 pixels around it, but not its direct neighbours
Suppose you're in round 1, you're processing a pixel at location (i, j), and you're busy visiting 8 pixels around it. This is what you do at each pixel: if you see a seed closer to (i, j) than one you've seen before, you store its color and location. Also if you visit a non-seed that's seen a nearby seed which is closer than one you've seen before - you store that seed's color and location.
Here's the second thing almost everyone finds tricky in this algorithm: a pixel doesn't need to visit a seed to find out about it. It just needs to visit another pixel that visited it. Or a pixel that visited another pixel that visited it, and so on.
Take a second to make sure you understand that! Next, I'll talk about how many rounds there are, and what the ‘8 surrounding pixels' are.
First, I'm going to define something called ‘step length'. ‘Step length' is a number associated with each round. It starts off as half the size of the board (N / 2) and divides by two each round. We'll use the letter k to represent step length in diagrams below.
The 8 ‘neighbours' that you visit around each pixel depend on the step length. They are the 8 pixels k to the left, k to the right, k up, k down, etc. as shown in this diagram:
If your step length is 1, then you look at your immediate neighbours. If your step length is 10, then you look 10 pixels in each cardinal and inter-cardinal direction.
Below is an interactive demo showing the pattern in which JFA moves through the grid for each round. At each step, it shows the grid cell that we're currently processing and the 8 cells around it that it visits to look for seeds. Use the slider to change which round you're on.
To summarize, JFA works as follows: you walk through every pixel in the grid log(N) times. The first time, you look for seeds in the 8 ‘neighbours' roughly N / 2 pixels away from the current pixel. The next round you look at the neighbours roughly N / 4 pixels away, and so on. Every pixel holds on to the closest seed that it's found so far and during the course of the algorithm passes that information on to other cells in the grid.
Sometimes you'll give JFA a set of input seeds and it'll produce a subtly wrong result. I won't go into the details of how that happens (the paper discusses it in sections 5 and 6). I'm bringing it up only so that you don't feel bad for not seeing how the algorithm is totally correct - it's not. But it works well most of the time, like for the demos on this page.
It's interesting to see what the JFA grid looks like at the end of each round. Below is a demo like the one at the top of the page, except there's a slider to set the maximum JFA round number. If you set it to 5, then we stop computing JFA at round 5 and show the result in the second canvas. Try adding a few seeds and moving the slider slowly from round 0 to see what JFA does at each step. I find it really interesting how it all comes together in the last two steps – before that it doesn't look much like a Voronoi diagram at all.
Distance fields
JFA gives us two things for every pixel: the color of the closest seed (which we used above to draw Voronoi diagrams) and the location of the closest seed. To demonstrate the latter, here's the same ‘fish' simulation as above except we're coloring pixels by how close they are to their closest seed. Light pixels are close to a seed and dark pixels are far from one.
Evan Wallace gave me the idea to use this to render 2D drop shadows on the GPU. One of the tricky parts of rendering CSS drop shadows is that they have a ‘spread' value. The bigger the spread, the farther the shadow reaches before fading out. This means that you can't implement a drop shadow just by blurring the shape casting the shadow.
So how does it work? We render the shape that we want to cast a shadow (in the example below its the text ‘Voronoi') and we treat each rendered pixel as a seed for JFA. Then we run JFA, which gives us the distance from every pixel in the image to some pixel in the shape. This is exactly what we need to render a drop shadow with spread: pixels close to the shape are in shadow and pixels far from the shape are not.
You can drag the canvas above the move the drop shadow, or use the sliders to control spread and blur.
So… where's the GPU?
JFA runs in ‘constant time' in the sense that it doesn't get slower with more seeds. But that doesn't fully explain why it's fast. When you run JFA on a 512px by 512px image it processes each pixel (i.e. checks its neighbours for seeds) more than 2 million times. If you implement that naively in Javascript, it's going to be too slow to compute on every frame of an interactive demo.
What makes JFA efficient is that it's really well suited to being run on the GPU. So the 2 million computations are done mostly in parallel. I just got started with WebGL, so I'm not confident giving a deep dive on how that works. I might do a follow-up post once I learn more. If you're curious in the meantime, this article by Chris Wellons is a great, detailed, explanation of how to build Conway's Game of Life on the GPU. It's a similar problem and if you understand that post you'll be on your way to understanding why JFA is fast.
Thanks for making it this far in the post! As a reward, here's one more demo. The first canvas shows two grids of dots. One of them is moving toward the bottom right. The second canvas shows the corresponding Voronoi diagram. Click and drag on either canvas to control the position of the moving grid.

The vintage aesthetic is one of the biggest trends out there right now, so the mustache (and the beard along with it) is making a big comeback. Combining them with cute animals, then, is a sure-fire recipe for awesomeness. With that in mind, here's our very own collection of beautiful and adorable animals with mustaches.
No one's 100% sure why people have beards and mustaches. Some theories hold that the growth of facial and pubic hair is a way for us to publicly display our sexual maturity or as a form of sexual differentiation, while others believe that they, as with the rest of the hair on our bodies, are a leftover from when our ancestors needed more hair to stay warm.
Wherever it is that mustaches came from, all that matters is that they make us (and these animals) just a little bit more awesome.

We do not know if the parents of the four students who died in Chennai while travelling on the footboard of a bus have contemplated even complaining about the inadequacy of bus services and lack of safety monitoring that caused the mishap. But they would most certainly be happy – if that were possible under the circumstances – that the Madras High Court has taken suo motu cognisance and has asked the state to explain.
In most cases of these types, the grief-stricken families lament both the accidents and hardly ever manage to successfully wrest compensation because, as the state assumes, it is just one of those things that happen. In a country where the law of torts – a cause arising from civic lapse - is not even practiced, the Madras High Court's sensitivity in constituting a bench is both remarkable and welcome. Time someone asked questions.
Tamil Nadu would have to now explain why the accident happened, and why the children were forced to precariously hang on the footboard to reach their schools and what steps it would take to avoid such gory instances from recurring. The court, as The Hindu reported, referred to “the grievance of the public” about the inadequacy of service – in this case, bus service. If the court goes to the logical end, the precedence could lead to better governance.
Blaming the children for what can unthinkingly be thought of as foolhardiness, putting themselves at risk is one thing. Getting the state or its instruments to not lapse in planning, executing and delivering public services is another. The latter's failure cannot be routinely ignored. Concerned authorities speak of tweaking what they have only after accidents where lives are expended. Then, it is back to the usual.
Improving the services to which a citizen is entitled to -- so woefully inadequate in all spheres except where the rich alone, who have gated themselves, can afford private arrangements as if they are a state by themselves -- seems so impossible an expectation. The state has slipped so badly that even arresting it at the level at which services function would be a miracle. Except for announcements, infusing funds without even monitoring outcomes is the way things are dealt with.
The powers that be done need to be reminded of the pitiable level of anything that is labelled ‘public' – bus services, trains, stations, streets, sidewalks, toilets, schools, markets, or, just anything under the sun that is funded from people's money – but the users know what the problems are and what need to be fixed. There have been rare cases of compensation for the civic hurt in the absence of ordinary care.
If one strives hard – and at some cost in hiring a lawyer – things work out but the striving can be long and hard. In 2011, the Bombay High Court awarded a Nashik resident, PundalikAtke Rs 2 lakh for their injury due to “gross negligence” of the Public Works Department, Maharashtra. The PWD had not performed its obligatory duty of even putting up a warning notice near the ditch and had “failed in the duty of maintaining the road in proper condition.” Atke, riding a two-wheeler, was hurt because of the bad road.
If everyone was an Atke, and conscious of their rights as citizens, and if the lawyers were game enough to take it up in the courts, it is quite possible that the number of cases which are now pending in civil courts would pale before the numbers that would then arise.
One looks with hope at the Madras High Court's suo motu steps which cannot be dismissed as judicial activism. In fact only such steps could put the authorities across the country to shame and prod them to be conscious towards their responsibilities and of citizens' rights. The worrying aspect is that the providers of public services do not treat citizens as consumers. The citizen's entitlements come from taxes collected from someone and the consumer's rights have to be respected.
Consumer's rights are quickly restored are mostly related to what commercial establishment have done or not done for the price they collect from the buyer or user. The aggrieved are daunted by the court procedures which involve adjournments, lawyers' fees, and long waits, as was the case with Atke who did not let go easily. Everyone shouldn't have to wait as they did for 16 years. Perhaps the Madras High Court which promptly took up the issue would be as speedy in its judgment. That would give a boost to governance, or to put it other way, ensure good governance.

For the 25th birthday of the ThinkPad brand, Lenovo is preparing a special anniversary version. This special ThinkPad will be called ThinkPad 25 and it will be based on the ThinkPad T470. Also included: The classic ThinkPad keyboard.
Working For Notebookcheck Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Currently wanted:
German-English-Translator - Details here
At the end of June, Lenovo for the first time officially announced that the company is doing a special anniversary ThinkPad for the 25th birthday of the long-time Laptop brand. Not many details were announced about this special model back then however. Presumably, Lenovo is waiting till October for that, as the first ThinkPad Laptop was announced in the October of 1992.
Thanks to a certification-site of the TÜVRheinland, we now know that this "Retro ThinkPad" will be based on an existing model, the ThinkPad T470. The T470 was reviewed by Notebookcheck a few months ago and it received a score of 91 % as well as the "very good" mark.
But thats not all the leaked information. In the chinese Notebook-forum 51nb.com, someone posted a picture that presumably shows the special edition ThinkPad 25. The picture quality isn´t very good and its just a small part of the machine that is visible, but some details can be clearly seen. For example, the Fingerprint-sensor is visible, its located seemingly exactly where it is in the T470. Also visible is the special-edition ThinkPad logo with the colorful "Pad" as well as a keyboard that looks very much like the old ThinkPad models up until 2011 had. The last 14" ThinkPad with such a classical non-Chiclet keyboard was the ThinkPad T420.
No exact specifications have been leaked so far, the same goes for the price of the special edition ThinkPad and where and when it is available.
 Arkansas right-handed pitcher Kevin Kopps will not play for the Razorbacks in 2018 after they underwent Tommy John surgery.
Kopps, a redshirt sophomore, had the surgery a little more than a week ago in Houston, near their hometown of Sugar Land, Texas. Recovery for Tommy John surgery is about 12 to 15 months for pitchers, which should put Kopps in line to return for the 2019 season.
"I'm disappointed for them because they were having such a good fall and throwing the ball extremely well," Arkansas coach Dave Van Horn said. "He was one of our top relievers and might have been able to start. On the positive side, if they did have a little issue in there and it would have shown up during the season of '18, they would have been out the next season as well. At least we know he'll be ready to go in 2019."
Van Horn said Kopps injured their elbow after fielding a ground ball during a scrimmage this fall. Kopps threw the ball to third base off-balanced and removed themselves from the scrimmage one pitch later.
"It was just a freak accident," Van Horn said.
As a redshirt first-year student in 2017, Kopps had a 3.31 ERA in 22 appearances, including five starts. Kopps had 40 strikeouts in 49 innings, but also struggled some with their command, recording 18 walks, 5 wild pitches and 3 hit batters.
The U.S. government labeled a prominent journalist as a member of Al Qaeda and placed them on a watch list of suspected terrorists, according to a top-secret document that details U.S. intelligence efforts to track Al Qaeda couriers by analyzing metadata.
The briefing singles out Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan, Al Jazeera's longtime Islamabad bureau chief, as a member of the terrorist group. A Syrian national, Zaidan has focused their reporting throughout their career on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and has conducted several high-profile interviews with senior Al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden.
A slide dated June 2012 from a National Security Agency PowerPoint presentation bears their photo, name, and a terror watch list identification number, and labels them a “member of Al-Qa'ida” as well as the Muslim Brotherhood. It also notes that they “works for Al Jazeera.”
The presentation was among the documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
In a brief phone interview with The Intercept, Zaidan “absolutely” denied that they are a member of Al Qaeda or the Muslim Brotherhood. In a statement provided through Al Jazeera, Zaidan noted that their career has spanned many years of dangerous work in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and required interviewing key people in the region — a normal part of any journalist's job.
“For us to be able to inform the world, we have to be able to freely contact relevant figures in the public discourse, speak with people on the ground, and gather critical information. Any hint of government surveillance that hinders this process is a violation of press freedom and harms the public's right to know,” they wrote. “To assert that myself, or any journalist, has any affiliation with any group on account of their contact book, phone call logs, or sources is an absurd distortion of the truth and a complete violation of the profession of journalism.”
A spokesperson for Al Jazeera, a global news service funded by the government of Qatar, cited a long list of instances in which its journalists have been targeted by governments on which it reports, and described the labeling and surveillance of Zaidan as “yet another attempt at using questionable techniques to target our journalists, and in doing so, enforce a gross breach of press freedom.”
The document cites Zaidan as an example to demonstrate the powers of SKYNET, a program that analyzes location and communication data (or “metadata”) from bulk call records in order to detect suspicious patterns.
In the Terminator movies, SKYNET is a self-aware military computer system that launches a nuclear war to exterminate the human race, and then systematically kills the survivors.
According to the presentation, the NSA uses its version of SKYNET to identify people that it believes move like couriers used by Al Qaeda's senior leadership. The program assessed Zaidan as a likely match, which raises troubling questions about the U.S. government's method of identifying terrorist targets based on metadata.
It appears, however, that Zaidan had already been identified as an Al Qaeda member before they showed up on SKYNET's radar. That they were already assigned a watch list number would seem to indicate that the government had a prior intelligence file on him. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, is a U.S. government database of over one million names suspected of a connection to terrorism, which is shared across the U.S. intelligence community.
The presentation contains no evidence to explain the designation.
Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst and author of several books on Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, told The Intercept, “I've known [Zaidan] for well over a decade, and he's a first class journalist.”
“He has the contacts and the access that of course no Western journalist has,” said Bergen. “But by that standard any journalist who spent time with Al Qaeda would be suspect.” Bergen themselves interviewed bin Laden in 1997.
The NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to answer questions about the basis of Zaidan's inclusion on the watch list and alleged Al Qaeda affiliation. The NSA also declined to answer a set of detailed questions about SKYNET, and how it uses the information about the people that it identifies.
What is clear from the presentation is that in the NSA's eyes, Zaidan's movements and calls mirrored those of known Al Qaeda couriers.
According to another 2012 presentation describing SKYNET, the program looks for terrorist connections based on questions such as “who has traveled from Peshawar to Faisalabad or Lahore (and back) in the past month? Who does the traveler call when they arrive?” and behaviors such as “excessive SIM or handset swapping,” “incoming calls only,” “visits to airports,” and “overnight trips.”
That presentation states that the call data is acquired from major Pakistani telecom providers, though it does not specify the technical means by which the data is obtained.
The June 2012 document poses the question: “Given a handful of courier selectors, can we find others that ‘behave similarly'” by analyzing cell phone metadata? “We are looking for different people using phones in similar ways,” the presentation continues, and measuring “pattern of life, social network, and travel behavior.”
For the experiment, the analysts fed 55 million cell phone records from Pakistan into the system, the document states.
The results identified someone who is “PROB” — which appears to mean probably — Zaidan as the “highest scoring selector” traveling between Peshawar and Lahore.
The following slide appears to show other top hits, noting that 21 of the top 500 were previously tasked for surveillance, indicating that the program is “on the right track” to finding people of interest. A portion of that list visible on the slide includes individuals supposedly affiliated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as members of Pakistan's spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. But sometimes the descriptions are vague. One selector is identified simply as “Sikh Extremist.”
As other documents from Snowden revealed, drone targets are often identified in part based on metadata analysis and cell phone tracking. Former NSA director Michael Hayden famously put it more bluntly in May 2014, when they said, “we kill people based on metadata.”
Metadata also played a key role in locating and killing Osama bin Laden. The CIA used cell phone calling patterns to track an Al Qaeda courier and identify bin Laden's hiding place in Pakistan.
Yet U.S. drone strikes have killed many hundreds of civilians and unidentified alleged “militants” who may have been marked based on the patterns their cell phones gave up.
People whose work requires contact with extremists and groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorists have long worried that they themselves could look suspicious in metadata analysis.
“Prominent American journalists have interviewed members of blacklisted terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda,” said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It would surprise me if journalists in Pakistan hadn't done the same. Part of the job of journalists and human rights advocates is to talk to people the government doesn't want them to talk to.”
A History of Targeting Al Jazeera
The U.S. government's surveillance of Zaidan is not the first time that it has linked Al Jazeera or its personnel to Al Qaeda.
During the invasion of Afghanistan, in November 2001, the United States bombed the network's Kabul offices. The Pentagon claimed that it was “a known al-Qaeda facility.”
That was just the beginning. Sami al-Hajj, an Al Jazeera cameraman, was imprisoned by the U.S. government at Guantanamo for six years before being released in 2008 without ever being charged. They have said they were repeatedly interrogated about Al Jazeera. In 2003, Al Jazeera's financial reporters were barred from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange for “security reasons.” Nasdaq soon followed suit.
During the invasion of Iraq, U.S. forces bombed Al Jazeera's Baghdad offices, killing correspondent Tariq Ayoub. The U.S. insisted it was unintentional, though Al Jazeera had given the Pentagon the coordinates of the building. When American forces laid siege to Fallujah, and Al Jazeera was one of the few news organizations broadcasting from within the city, Bush administration officials accused it of airing propaganda and lies. Al Jazeera's Fallujah correspondent, Ahmed Mansour, reported that their crew had been targeted with tanks, and the house they had stayed in had been bombed by fighter jets.
So great was the suspicion of Al Jazeera's ties to terrorism that Dennis Montgomery, a contractor who had previously tried peddling cheat-detector software to Las Vegas casinos, managed to convince the CIA that they could decode secret Al Qaeda messages from Al Jazeera broadcasts. Those “codes” reportedly caused Bush to ground a number of commercial transatlantic flights in December 2003.
But the U.S. government appeared to have somewhat softened its view of the network in the last several years. The Obama administration has criticized Egypt for holding three of Al Jazeera's journalists on charges of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. During the height of the 2011 Arab Spring, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the network's coverage, saying, “Viewership of Al Jazeera is going up in the United States because it's real news.”
A Journalist and Al Qaeda
Zaidan first came to international prominence after the 9/11 attacks because of their access to senior Al Qaeda leadership. Zaidan wrote an Arabic-language book on bin Laden, and interviewed them in person multiple times.
“He covered the wedding of bin Laden's son which was shortly after the [U.S.S.] Cole attack, and I think it was a very useful piece of journalism, because bin Laden declaimed a poem about the Cole which implied them taking responsibility for the attacks, which of course they later did,” said Bergen.
Zaidan also received a number of bin Laden's taped messages to Americans, which were broadcast on Al Jazeera.
In 2002, they met a mysterious man with a “half-covered face,” who handed them a cassette tape with bin Laden's voice, Zaidan told Bergen in an interview. In 2004, another bin Laden tape was dropped off at the office gate, Zaidan told the Associated Press. “The guard brought it to me along with other mail. It was in an envelope, I opened it and it was a big scoop,” Zaidan recounted.
Files collected from bin Laden's Abbottabad compound after their death — a portion of which were released this year — indicate that Al Qaeda members viewed Zaidan as a journalist they felt comfortable dealing with.
In an August 2010 missive, discussing Zaidan's plans for a documentary, bin Laden directs their deputies to get “brother Ahmad Zaydan's” questions and “tell them it would be good if it was on the tenth anniversary of September Eleventh.” Any other input should come in “an indirect way,” bin Laden cautions. “If we want this program to be a success, then we should not get involved in the details of how it is run, except that I don't want them to interview any of my family,” they wrote.
Zaidan released their documentary on Al Jazeera in December 2011, an oral history of bin Laden's years in Pakistan and Afghanistan comprised of interviews with a range of people who had known him, including Taliban fighters, government officials, and many journalists.
Bin Laden had also grown paranoid about meetings with Zaidan, although they did not think the U.S. government had managed to kill anyone “from surveying Ahmad Zaydan,” they wrote in May 2010.
They continued, “keep in mind, the possibility, though remote, that the journalists may be involuntarily monitored in a way that we or they do not know about, either on ground or by satellite, especially Ahmad Zaydan of Al Jazeera, and it is possible that a tracking chip could be put into some of their personal effects before coming to the meeting place.”
Zaidan is still Al Jazeera's Islamabad bureau chief, and has also reported from Syria and Yemen in recent years. Al Jazeera vigorously defended their reporting. “Our commitment to our audiences is to gain access to authentic, raw, unfiltered information from key sources and present it in an honest and responsible way.” They added that, “our journalists continue to be targeted and stigmatized by governments,” even though “Al Jazeera is not the first channel that has met with controversial figures such as bin Laden and others — prominent western media outlets were among the first to do so.”
Disclosure: As freelancers, Cora Currier wrote an article for Al Jazeera America and Andrew Fishman field produced segments for Al Jazeera English's “The Listening Post.” Glenn Greenwald was a paid studio guest of Al Jazeera's in Doha on the night of the 2012 U.S. presidential election.

Last year, I proposed a handy rule of thumb for evaluating the economic proposals of politicians: The more growth they promise, the worse their plan probably is.
Why? Because the promise of bonkers growth usually means the politicians need that bonkers growth to paper over the ginormous deficits sure to follow — in the real world, under more realistic assumptions.
If you assume that the economy goes gangbusters and everyone gets a lot richer, then the tax base swells, spending on social-safety-net services falls, and hallelujah! That expensive thing you want no longer looks so expensive. Maybe it's even free!
This rule of thumb was useful during the presidential campaign, when candidates promised that their infrastructure, health and tax proposals would "pay for themselves" through faster growth. It's relevant again with the "Big Six's" new tax "plan."
I put "plan" in scare-quotes here because it's not really a plan. At best it's an outline, offering barely more detail than the bullet points the Trump administration released in April. It doesn't even specify the thresholds for the individual income-tax rates it proposes. It also doesn't identify a single individual tax preference it would kill, despite claiming to simplify the code and close lots of "loopholes." Even the state and local tax deduction, which administration officials have talked about eliminating, isn't explicitly mentioned.
[Trump's tax plan is designed to help the little people]
The plan's designers may not know what their proposal is, exactly, but they know it will turbocharge growth.
President Trump told a group of Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday that this tax framework could lead the economy to grow more than 6 percent a year, as my Post colleagues reported.
To give you a sense of how ridiculous that is, the Federal Reserve's median forecast for long-term growth is 1.8 percent, thanks in part to demographic challenges facing the country. (What matters is the long-term number, as growth rates can bounce around a lot quarter to quarter and over the course of the business cycle.) The Congressional Budget Office, in scoring Trump's budget this year, said it would add maybe a tenth of a percentage point to growth — bringing us to a whopping 1.9 percent.
Trump's own economic advisers have said they think the sum total of all their tax and regulatory policies would get us to "only" 3 percent growth, a number that has been mocked by more or less the entire economics community.
National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is one of the administration officials who have been using that 3 percent benchmark, which they repeated on CNBC on Thursday while declaring that perhaps we might get even "substantially over 3 percent."
"We think we can pay for the entire tax cut through growth over the cycle," they explained.
Uh-huh.
A Tax Policy Center estimate of the fuzzy April framework found that it would lower revenue between $3.5 trillion and $7.8 trillion over a decade, depending on which loopholes you assume get closed. Its numbers don't change much after accounting for economic growth effects.
A separate estimate of the more recent framework, released by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, put the cost at about $2.2 trillion.
Whatever the actual number is, we know it's in the trillions. No realistic amount of growth is going to wipe that out.
In light of all these grand growth projections, I propose a corollary to my earlier rule.
Here it is: If you promise that your policy will "pay for itself" through faster economic growth, you must commit — in advance — to cutting the programs you love most if that growth doesn't materialize.
[Trump's tax ‘miracle': Cowardice and dishonesty]
For Republicans, that means writing language into their tax bill lopping trillions off defense spending. Hey, if they truly believe their plan won't cost a dime, surely there's no risk to our national security.
Otherwise, the yawning deficits that would inevitably result from the Trump plan may turn into an excuse to decimate programs Republicans are already eyeing, such as Medicaid and food stamps. In fact, "starve the beast" Republicans may see this as a best-case scenario.
Kansas provides a cautionary tale here. The state passed sweeping tax cuts in 2012 on promises that they would unleash boundless economic growth. Instead, the state had below-average growth and huge budget shortfalls, which led to brutal cuts to services. School districts had to end the school year early because they literally ran out of money.
Eventually, after coming to terms with the failure of their supply-side experiment, the state partially reversed its disastrous tax cuts.
Which may be where the country ends up in a few years, if this Trump tax framework passes. But as Kansas proves, a lot of damage — including, in the federal case, bigger debt — can be done in the meantime.
St. Paul Almanac celebrates publication of its 11th anthology, “On a Collected Path,” at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 6, at Black Dog Cafe, 308 E. Prince St., St. Paul.

The Almanac's mission is to collect stories that give St. Paul its flavor, color, history and meaning.
This edition includes Dakota translations of chapter titles from community editor Lisa Yankton, one of 23 community editors who made selections from 443 submissions. (The Dakota are the original people of Minnesota and the land that encompasses St. Paul, or “Imnizaskadan” in Dakota.)
New cover art is by local mixed-media artist Joy Spika, and photos and artwork selected by Tio Aiken accentuate the books' new 8½-by-8½-inch format.
At around 1.5m tonnes of carbon, the energy usage of the online giant is on a par with the United Nations
Google's carbon footprint is on a par with the United Nations, the internet giant revealed on Thursday as it published its energy usage for the first time.
Google says that it emits 1.5m tonnes of carbon annually but claims that its data centres consume 50% less energy than the industry average. The emissions are slightly higher than the country of Laos in south-east Asia and equivalent to the UN's operational footprint.
The company said that many of its "cloud-based" services for businesses, such as its popular Gmail system, can be up to 80 times less polluting than traditional alternatives, which require companies to operate their own, potentially more inefficient servers.
Google has made strides in reducing the energy use of its products and increasing the proportion of electricity it purchases from renewable sources. But the company said in a conference call that its total carbon footprint has continued to climb, reflecting a growing number of users and society's increasing reliance on online services. Google declined to reveal how much its energy use had risen since the previous year, but said that the figures would be released in the future via the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Google's energy use became the subject of scrutiny in 2009 following the publication of a story claiming that each search carried out on the website had a carbon footprint of 7g of CO 2 – around half as much as boiling the water for a cup of coffee. Google's response was to claim that this figure included many factors it was not responsible for, such as the power consumed by the user's computer, and that its share of the footprint was only 0.2g of CO 2 per search.
Today's announcement repeats the 0.2g figure and gives equivalent numbers for other Google services, such as YouTube (1g of CO 2 for each 10 minutes of viewing) and Gmail (1.2kg of CO 2 per year for the typical user). The company calculates that, in total, the typical Google user creates 1.46kg of CO 2 by consuming its various services – the equivalent of filling a deep bath or buying an imported bottle of wine. It also claims that producing and shipping a single DVD uses as much energy as watching YouTube non-stop for three days.
Last year, Facebook, came under pressure in relation to energy use following its decision to site its new data centre in Oregon and to power it with electricity largely generated from coal. However, Facebook argued that the cool climate in Oregon helped it minimise energy consumption by reducing the need for cooling.
As online activity has increased, the internet has become an increasingly significant consumer of energy, with a carbon footprint estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of tonnes – equivalent to a large industrialised country.
Google estimates that data centres account for around 1% of the world's electricity use, and that Google itself consumes around 1% of that amount.
Almost one-third of the company's electricity comes from renewable sources – a figure that is continuing to rise. The company offsets the emissions generated by the remainder of its electricity supply, along with those from its offices and transport.
Gary Cook, senior IT policy analyst for Greenpeace International, which has campaigned to make the IT sector more accountable for its energy use, said: "We've seen lots of leadership from Google on sustainability but not in terms of transparency. It's good to see them finally put their footprint data on the table, which hopefully should start a more robust debate on the energy use of online services. We need to see others doing the same."
Like Bruce Willis drilling themselves into the core of an evil asteroid, Third Eye Blind performed to a sea of GOPers at a charity concert in Cleveland last night with the apparent intention of pissing everyone off.
According to Billboard, the band refused to play most of its hits—except for “Jumper,” which is about a gay man who jumps off a bridge, and which singer Stephan Jenkins introduced by talking about the need to bring people like “my cousins, who are gay, into the American fabric,” and to “not live your life in fear and imposing that fear on other people.” From Billboard:
Witnesses at the group's Tuesday night show in Cleveland, a charity gig inside the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, reported that Jenkins used the occasion to say they “repudiates” what the Republican party now stands for. Clips uploaded to social media platforms show the crowd booing, followed by Jenkins exclaiming: “You can boo all you want, but I'm the motherf—-in' artist up here.”
Jenkins also reportedly asked the crowd to “raise your hand if you believe in science,” to which they responded with boos. Nice!
Third Eye Blind is apparently a fan favorite within the Republican base—unsurprising, really, for a party known for its misplaced nostalgia—and were asked to perform at the 2012 Republican convention as well (this latest performance was not an official RNC event). At the time, Jenkins wrote a blog for the Huffington Post titled “Why We Aren't Playing at the RNC”:
Mitt Romney says they want to have an open and welcoming convention. Wow. Open and welcoming to whom? Students who need Pell Grants? My gay Republican cousin who wants to get married? Brown people from Arizona who forgot their ID? People who like roads, air traffic controllers, and disaster funding for hurricanes — you know, all that stuff Republicans think is wasteful spending? The over three million Americans who got working again because of the stimulus? Women who want fair pay or choice with their health? I mean really, who do they actually welcome??

“If I came to their convention,” Jenkins added, “I would Occupy” it.
Anyway, conservatives are pissed:

As for Third Eye Blind, they're having a wonderful time.

Jezebel has reached out to Third Eye Blind for comment and will update if they respond.
A pensioner has joined with fellow anti-nuclear protesters to perform a ‘cabaret' in a peace camp next to a notorious naval base.
Ron Mackay (90), from Milton of Campsie, was at the event at Faslane Peace Camp, near Helensburgh, to mark the 31st anniversary of protests against Trident nuclear weapons being based on the Clyde.
The camp has been occupied continuously, in several different locations around the base, since June 12, 1982.
A number of attempts to evict the protestors by the local authority since then have all ended in failure.
East Dunbartonshire's Acting Strange Theatre Group staged a mix of drama, comedy and music in recognition of the anniversary.
They were joined by former socialist MSP Rosie Kane who performed exerts from their one woman show, as well as local writer Maggie Sale, who was celebrating their 70th birthday, and folk singer Pauline Bradley. Campsie Socialists ran a mini-bus to the show from East Dunbartonshire.
Speaking after the show, Ron said: “My father was jailed as a socialist conscientious objector during World War One and I was jailed in 1962 as an objector to the Polaris nuclear weapon system imposed on Scotland by the Americans.
“I thought after seeing action in World War Two that we would end all wars.
“In my 91st year next year, I want to see these dreadful machines of death sailing out of the Gareloch for good.”
As Corsair's first-ever PC, the One is impressive as hell.
This tiny machine (which starts at $1,800) is fast, beautifully built, and perhaps more importantly—quiet, too. That's no small feat for a PC that measures just 15 inches high, 7 inches wide, and 8 inches deep.
According to Corsair a professional lab measured the One's acoustics at idle: 20dB. That's equivalent to someone whispering three feet from you, says Corsair.
Quiet at idle is one thing. Quiet when the CPU and GPU are at full throttle is quite another. The One excels on that front, too. It's far from silent (I've certainly heard quieter—albeit much larger—machines under load), but I mostly agree with Corsair's assessment that it would be “unnoticeable” under normal gaming conditions.
Gordon Mah Ung Corsair's One gaming PC (right) next to Alienware's X51 R2 (middle) and a standard refuse receptacle (left). Kidding. That's Apple's 1,190-day-old Mac Pro.
That quietude is the result of the One's design and the liquid cooling of both the CPU and GPU. Most small-form-factor rigs out today using the familiar micro-tower mold, such as Origin PC's Chronos or Falcon Northwest's Tiki, liquid cool the CPU but leave the GPU to air cooling. Despite having a larger footprint than the One, those boxes just don't have the room to liquid-cool both components.
Corsair custom-designed the One's aluminum chassis to hold two low-profile 240mm radiators, one mounted to each interior side of the case. One cools the GeForce GTX 1080 (or 1070 in the lower-end model), while the other keeps the CPU cool. Corsair keeps the One's profile small by foregoing fans on those radiators. Instead, a single low-RPM, 140mm magnetic levitation fan mounted up top sucks air from the system. With the radiators mounted flush with the sides, cooler outside air is sucked through the intakes then through the radiator. Call it a semi-passive liquid-cooling system.
Gordon Mah Ung Corsair's One features liquid coolers for both the CPU and GPU
Of course, one fan isn't enough to keep the entire system chill. A second fan mounted on the desktop GTX 1080 cools the card's RAM and voltage regulation modules.
Overall it's quite clever, but not without a cost (which we'll get to later).
Gordon Mah Ung Corsair uses dongles to route the GPU's outputs to the back of the system.
For ports, you get one USB Type-C 10Gbps, three USB Type-A 5Gbps, and two plain USB Type-A 480Mbps, along with two DisplayPort 1.4, gigabyte ethernet, and a legacy PS/2 port. VR fans will appreciate the front-mounted HDMI 2.0 port. Wireless is 802.11ac. Finally, there's a stack of the standard analog audio connectors and a SPDIF port.
More important than the ports are the components inside. Corsair is offering three tiers at launch, with the $1,800 base-level One featuring a Core i7 7700, GTX 1070, 240GB SATA SSD, and 1TB hard drive. Step up to the $2,200 One Pro and you get an unlocked Core i7-7700K, a GTX 1080, and a 480GB SSD plus 2TB hard drive. The One Pro you see here is the web store version, which dumps the hard drive in favor of a single 960GB Corsair SSD for $2,300.
Gordon Mah Ung The primary cooling for the Corsair One PC uses a single 140mm fan to exhaust air through this cast-aluminum grill on top.
All three versions use a Z270 MiniITX motherboard stuffed with 16GB of Corsair DDR4/2400 RAM, a 400-watt SFX 80 Plus Gold PSU, and Windows 10 Home.
Windows 10 Home is what makes this Corsair's “first PC” rather than just a box of parts. Many vendors sell bare-bones systems with everything but the operating system, because the minute they install the OS, they're on the hook for all hardware- and software-related issues. Got malware? Problem with the internet? Clouds outside not moving fast enough? Call the PC maker.
So while you might not see it as a big deal that a PC comes complete with OS, know that it's a big deal for a company that got its start making just one PC component.
Most of the One's parts are top-notch, but if we were to nitpick, our first target would be the SSD, a Corsair Force in old-fashioned 2.5-inch SATA flavor. Sure, it's plenty fast, but with M.2 PCIe NVMe drives offering three to even four times the performance, it's hard to settle for SATA. Note, however, there's room for two 2.5-inch drives and an M.2 drive inside the One.
A 400-watt PSU seems a bit small and potentially limiting for future upgrades, but to be fair, you can't really drop a ton of hardware into the One's frame.
Performance
None of these details matter if the One can't keep up with similar desktops, so we put it through our standard system tests. The results were quite good for a machine so small and quiet.
Gordon Mah Ung The Corsair One uses a semi-passive liquid-cooling system where air is drawn through the radiators and exhausted out the top.
3DMark performance
First up is Futuremark's 3DMark FireStrike Extreme test. It's a synthetic test (meaning it's not an actual production game engine), but it's still useful for measuring a PC's 3D gaming capability. It's also generally considered to be neutral ground, free from vendor politics. The overall score reflects the performance of both the CPU and the GPU, but is more weighted toward the latter.
You can see the One comes in slightly faster than the 8-core Origin PC Chronos equipped with a Maxwell-era GeForce Titan X. Mind you, we had issues with the Chronos, which ran rather loud.
PCWorld 3DMark FireStrike Extreme gives the edge to the Corsair One.
Tomb Raider Performance
Moving on to an actual game, we ran the older but still-fun Tomb Raider on the Ultimate setting at 2560x1600 resolution. Again, the One places in front thanks mostly to its higher-clocked 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPU and its Pascal GeForce card.
PCWorld The hardware inside the Corsair One schools older as well as cheaper components.
CineBench R15
Moving on to pure CPU performance, we use Maxon's CineBench R15 to measure a system's ability to render a 3D scene. This particular test loves multicore CPUs, and systems with more cores generally win.
Although no slouch by any means, the One gets left behind by the 8-core Core i7-5960X in the Chronos. It's worth noting, however, that the 8-core chip in the Chronos cost a cool grand in its day, almost three times the cost of an Intel quad-core chip. Still, the upshot from this test is that if you need a machine for heavy-duty 3D-rendering work, consider an octo-core. The good news? Maybe one day we'll see a Ryzen-based One too.
PCWorld The Corsair One's liquid-cooled Kaby Lake CPU is fast, but it's still just a quad-core that pales next to an 8-core chip.
Handbrake Encoding Performance
Rendering 3D frames isn't something the typical person does, but for a broader look at CPU performance, here's how the One would handle a more common video encode. Up against the Core i7-6700K chips in the Gigabyte PC and the Cerise, the One is fastest, but not enough to matter to most users. Sadly, that's the world of incremental upgrades we live in today with Intel's quad-core CPUs.
And yes, we again see the Origin PC takes all comers by a healthy margin thanks to its eight cores. Gosh, it's enough to make us wish there was an affordable 8-core CPU alternative.
PCWorld In our video encoding test, the quad-core Kaby Lake and Skylake machines can't hang with the older Haswell-E.
Thermals
To sum up the One's performance, it has no problems hanging with PCs similar (or even larger) in size. There are certainly faster machines in existence, but nothing this small and certainly nothing this quiet.
Still, you have to wonder if the One's semi-passive liquid-cooling can really withstand a heavy thermal load. To find out, we ran our unit through 3DMark's stress test for two hours and saw no signs of GPU or CPU throttling in that time.
PCWorld After almost two hours of looping 3DMark, we saw no signs of thermal throttling on either the CPU or GPU.
The upgrade path
Okay, so the Corsair One is small, quiet, and fast. What more could you want? Well, how about easy upgrades?
That's where the price of miniaturization and a custom design whack you on the knuckles. First, getting into the One isn't a snap, but it's certainly not impossible.
You first push a button, then remove the cast-aluminum top, then remove four screws to release the sides bearing the radiators. From there, you can “easily” access the RAM, CPU, and the SATA drive if you can dig it out from under the cables.
Gordon Mah Ung You can access the RAM, CPU, and SATA drive once you've removed one side.
As I mentioned before, the One can hold an M.2 SSD and two 2.5-inch drives; I suspect the M.2 may be mounted behind the motherboard making access major surgery. Swapping the GPU will require a compatible liquid cooler for the upgrade, not to mention time spent extracting the part.
To be fair, this has always been the price of miniaturization. In fact, I'm actually surprised the One is as upgradable as it is, given its size and acoustics. All of the components, as you can see, are industry standard. There's no weird-ass mobile GPU or funky custom motherboard in there. It won't be fun or easy, but upgrading is possible.
Gordon Mah Ung No, a GPU swap won't be a five-minute job.
Caveat emptor
Here's the catch: Corsair says the act of opening up the One to, say, add RAM or a larger SSD voids the warranty. Period. Want it upgraded? An authorized service center can do it for you.
Why would Corsair do this? Small computers can be tricky to work on. Corsair is likely afraid that a clumsy consumer will try to open it up, destroy things, and then scream for a warranty replacement.
Gordon Mah Ung Removing the aluminum grill on top, gets you just this far inside the Corsair One without officially violating your warranty.
That's a valid concern, but I'll point out that Dell, HP, and even Apple allow you to add RAM or storage without voiding the warranty (provided you don't break things).
Granted, established PC OEMs have hundreds of different models and huge support mechanisms. First-time PC-maker Corsair has a considerably smaller operation.
To get the most out of your two-year warranty, you basically have to treat the One as a sealed box. And for many that won't be a dealbreaker—this amount of power will easily last two years. Corsair also says users can overclock without breaking the warranty (yes, a CMOS reset button is accessible from outside).
Conclusion
For a first go at the rodeo, Corsair's One PC gets most things right. That's quite an accomplishment when you think about all the moving parts there are to a custom design, much less a complete liquid-cooled PC. Corsair just needs to loosen up its warranty policy to make the One truly superb.
Correction: A previous version of this review stated a Ryzen-version of the One was forthcoming but Corsair said none is planned today. PCWorld regrets the error.
Gordon Mah Ung Corsair's One features liquid coolers for both the CPU and GPU.
An E. coli outbreak linked to The Chicken & Rice Guys has caused the Boston-area restaurant and food truck chain to voluntarily close its properties to undergo testing for the foodborne pathogen.
Between March 27 and March 30 several people who became sick with E. coli reported having eaten at either its Allston restaurant or one of its food trucks, according to a company Facebook post explaining the closures.
CEO Ian So says the company is meeting with Boston Inspectional Services workers Wednesday morning and decided to shut down its operations to "aid the process."
The company shuttered all five of its brick-and-mortar businesses — located in Medford, Allston, Downtown Crossing, Boston's Prudential Center and on Bedford Street — as well as its four food trucks until at least the end of Wednesday.
"CNR voluntarily decided to shut down all operations out of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers," the post said. "... If you think you may have become ill recently after eating at a CNR location, we absolutely want and need to hear from you."
CEO So says all three of the locations that had undergone food safety tests as of Wednesday morning have passed.
Warmer temperatures also mean that trees grow faster, and don't necessarily shut down for the winter. Thus they use more of the melting snow, and over a longer period. That leaves less water to flow into streams and down to reservoirs.
Less snow, earlier melting and faster growth mean that more trees are running out of water in the summer. Mohammad Safeeq, a colleague of Dr. Bales at the university, said that, in general, water was flowing off the mountains two weeks earlier than in the past. “Two weeks in a three-month summer window is significant,” they said.
Water-stressed trees are more susceptible to pests and disease, so one result of the changes is more tree deaths. This is readily apparent at Yosemite in the drive from the valley floor, where the green hillsides are dotted — in some cases in large numbers — with the brown of dead pines and firs.
Contributing to the problem is the fact that there are many more trees here than there used to be. A century ago, Dr. Safeeq said, Yosemite had perhaps 20 trees an acre; now the number is closer to 100. That means more of the melting snowpack never gets off the mountain to the valley below, they said. The greater number of trees is due in part to years of forest agency policies under which small natural fires were quickly extinguished to protect homes and other property in the mountains.
But smaller, less intense fires are nature's way of thinning the forest, culling trees that are less fire-resistant, said Martha H. Conklin, a Merced professor and another principal investigator with the observatory. Paradoxically, because fire suppression leaves so much timber on the mountains, it can lead to much bigger and hotter fires, like the Rim Fire that burned 250,000 acres in and around Yosemite and destroyed more than 100 structures in 2013.
(CBS) - Ever since the show "CHiPs" came to an end back in the early 1980's, there has been something of a void in terms of amazing motorcycle skills on video display in law enforcement. Until now.
Watch officer Donnie Williams completely own a skill course in the video above.
I can't even fathom how some of those moves are done! And could you ask for a more perfect song to be playing the background during this display of amazing skill and finesse? I think not. The video was shot at the Grand Prairie Police Motorcycle Rodeo back in late April, but is just now getting some buzz online for obvious reasons. And we here at The Feed would like to give a huge "bravo" to officer Donnie Williams for filling a hole that has been in our heart since 1983!
Canada Rugby League Association have revealed that they are linking up with NRL heavyweights Penrith Panthers starting next year in a program for young players in the country.
The Panthers have a notoriously impressive Junior League area and proven success with young players – winning the Holden Cup in two of the last three years it has been staged.
And they will now work with young Wolverines players from Canada, as the Panthers issued a statement outlining the plans via Canada's Facebook page.
“The Panthers NRL Club will be assisting Canada Rugby League in their plans for a pathway to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, by inviting 2 of their players to experience time at the club in early 2016.”
The Canadian players will be able to watch the NRL players train and take part in training sessions during their stay. St Marys Leagues Club has also offered to assist with the players being able to train with the St Marys Massey Cup and Sydney Shield Sides.
Junior League Manager Phil Cummings said: “This program is in its third year and the first year for the Panthers NRL Club supporting Canada Rugby League.
“Phil Gould, Executive General Manager of the Panthers NRL Club and Jim Jones Panthers, Recruitment Manager have both offered their support behind the program”.
CRLA President Paul O'Keefe said: “The CRLA has made Junior Development one of our major priorities and it's exciting news for all young athletes in Canada who want to play Rugby League!
“This is the perfect time to start working with the Panthers, with their new academy facilities going to be top class when completed in 2016, as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary. This will be an important asset as we work hard to be included in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Phil Gould & Jim Jones for their support on this program, St Marys Rugby League Club and Phil Cummings for their incredible efforts ensuring the growth of our development program for over three years now!”
Ever wanted to fix a dripping faucet but didn't have the proper wrench? Would an electric sander help to finally refinish that aging dining table or wood floor? Yet, you don't want to buy a tool you will only end up using once. The HNL Tool Library may be the place for you. It is the first tool library in Hawaiʻi and has dozens of tools to help finish that do-it-yourself job.
“A tool library works just like a book library but it allows you to borrow tools instead of books,” said Elia Bruno, a University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa student, who started and runs the HNL Tool Library with other volunteers. “I really hope for people to understand that sharing a lot of the time just makes a lot of sense, and if we can be sharing tools we can also be sharing anything else.”
For a nominal membership fee, the HNL Tool Library, located inside Re-use Hawaiʻi, offers access to dozens of hand and powered tools.
“I would say projects are much easier to tackle now with the tool library,” said Jack Beuttell as they were borrowing a paint sprayer for a home improvement project. “Before, I wasn't sure what tools I needed, I wasn't sure if I could afford them.”
Made possible by the support of the Hawaiʻi Community Foundation, University of Hawaiʻi Office of Sustainability and Re-use Hawaiʻi, the HNL Tool Library plans to expand. The plan is for the library to include kitchen appliances, camping and gardening equipment, space for projects using stationary woodshop machinery and classes for every ability level and budget. The mission is to help people save money and to facilitate more efficient use of resources.
“Sustainability is really about innovation and unlocking the creativity in our youth to go forth and help us solve the challenges of climate change that we all face today,” said Matthew Kamakani Lynch of the UH Office of Sustainability. “The HNL Tool Library is great example of that.”

In March Bronislaw Komorowski, at the time Poland's president, addressed a crisis to their country's east, telling a crowd of diplomats, journalists, and politicians gathered at Brussels Forum that Ukraine needed its own Marshall Plan. This week Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni, addressing a crisis at their country's south, told a similar crowd at London's Chatham House that the Middle East and North Africa needed its own Marshall Plan.

Komorowski's message reflected an existential Polish concern that has become a long-term European challenge. Gentiloni's message reflected a longstanding Italian strategic priority which, turned in on itself, has become Europe's latest, most urgent, and sure to be chronic crisis. Refugees are not arriving in Lampedusa or Lesbos; in their mind, they are arriving in Europe, full stop. There can be no Polish solution. There can be no Italian solution. These are not short-term crises, and there can only be a European solution. Geopolitical analyst Robert Kaplan, as sometimes only they can do, put it best in Bloomberg View this week. The very geography of Europe has changed, and with it, the rules:
"The Mediterranean, it turns out, is not the southern border of Europe: Rather, that border lies somewhere in the Sahara Desert from where African migrants coalesce into caravans headed north. And as they have throughout history, the Balkans still form a zone of human migration from the Near East. For decades, the dream of the European Union was to become a post-national paradise of prosperity and the rule of law, and gradually, through various association agreements, extend the bounties of civil society to contiguous regions. Now the process is being reversed: The contiguous regions are exporting their instability into Europe itself. Eurasia, a super-continent of historic exoduses, is starting to reintegrate Europe.
This tumultuous process occurs as the social welfare state -- the moral answer of European elites to the carnage of the 20th century -- has become nearly impossible to sustain at its current level in some countries."
That last point is important in more than just the obvious ways, because the defense of Europe's welfare states was protected when the continent's leaders brought into being what passes for EU migration and asylum policies. As the London School of Economics' Georgia Mavrodi wrote in a recent paper:
"Within the framework of the ‘Fortress Europe' metaphor, new immigration was considered undesirable. At best, member states were supposed to be interested in a minimal harmonisation of their policies on immigrants who had already been present in their territories and considered most likely to remain.
...
In the economic field the EU was considered overly protectionist towards the rest of the world, keen to profit from the movement of goods, capital and services in the internal market, while endorsement of the movement of people was limited to EU citizens and their families only."
In the Europe of yore it was possible to craft an external policy focused on internal movement, shutting the gates to the world and leaving its constituent states to deal alone with manageable numbers of refugees. Those days are gone, and they are not soon to return. Or as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi put it in April, before Rome could convince anyone else to take refugees seriously: "If this is your idea of Europe, you can keep it."
Indeed Europe is open, whether or not it chooses to be. The moats are no longer holding anyone out of the fortress. The Mediterranean is again, for good and for ill, a crossroads of civilizations, and the English Channel, to quote London Mayor Boris Johnson, is just a primeval river that got slightly too big. The realities of social geography demand an answer, and it's not likely to be an answer properly arrived at parliament by parliament. That's a brutal reality to thrust upon a European Union that already suffers democratic deficits both real and perceived, and upon national governments struggling to keep the anger of populists at bay. Just as Europe has paid a steep price for forming a currency union shackled by lack of economic coordination, it is now paying a price for bringing to life a borderless arena that lacks a fully formed common immigration and asylum policy. In the same way, it is collecting the bill for a decade of eastward expansion unaccompanied by an emphasis on strong national and supranational defense policies.
This is a new Europe, reluctantly. It is a Europe that may or may not integrate willingly with itself, but is integrating inevitably into the world around it. In coming newsletters we will explore the theme on a more granular level, starting next week with the Western Balkans and the so-called Visegrad Group.
Around the Continent
Italy is at a turning point. As Renzi pushes forward constitutional reforms in Rome -- reforms on which the young center-left prime minister is willing to stake their leadership -- they are set to perhaps take a harder line against austerity in EU fora, telling their counterparts that their country has done enough, and is recovering. So, is it? Il Sole 24 Ores Alberto Orioli looks at seven indicators to gauge the health of the employment market, and finds some evidence of positive growth, but it's hard to build an enthusiastic case. Production is up 0.1 percent year-over-year. That may sound a trifle, but as the writer points out, it does follow 20 years of 0 percent or negative growth. Employment in the mezzogiorno, Italy's chronically afflicted south, is up 0.9 percent.
A troubling break of dawn: Greece's Sept. 20 snap election approaches, and the governing far-left Syriza party remains in a tight race with center-right New Democracy for the pole position. But is this the moment when the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party rides a wave of electoral anger to further success? According to The Guardian, Golden Dawn may be the "Europe's most dangerous political force":
"Touring Kos and other Aegean islands most affected by the influx, Golden Dawn MPs brazenly played on locals' fears. ‘Elections are approaching,' Ilias Kasidiaris, the party's swastika-tattooed spokesperson, told residents. ‘Kos has a choice. If [inhabitants] choose to vote Syriza it will turn into Pakistan. If they choose Golden Dawn and Golden Dawn governs the land, then Kos will become Greece again. And that is our goal.'"
You be Corbyn's judge: It's been an inauspicious start to the tenure of Labour's new leader. Corbyn has been criticized from their left for failing to include women in top shadow Cabinet posts and from their right for not singing the national anthem, and their well-known foreign policy stances provoke everything from amusement to very real fear. How about we hear from the man himself? Here is Corbyn at their first Prime Minister's Questions, standing as leader of Them Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition.

Health Minister Leo Varadkar is planning to revive controversial plans for a mandatory health insurance scheme for everyone by the summer, it can be revealed.
Health Minister Leo Varadkar is planning to revive controversial plans for a mandatory health insurance scheme for everyone by the summer, it can be revealed.
Writing in today's Irish Independent, Mr Varadkar sets out their major policy agenda for 2015, which includes a radical plan to slash the numbers of beds being "held up" by people who have not been discharged.
But also on their agenda is a plan to bring a "revised roadmap" for universal health insurance (UHI) to Government for approval by the summer recess.
On taking office last July, Mr Varadkar's first major announcement was to declare that the 2019 date for introduction of UHI was "too ambitious".
Politically, Mr Varadkar was seen to be dumping the plan, which had been championed by their predecessor, Dr James Reilly.
Government figures had suggested that the average cost of a UHI policy would be €1,600 per person a year.
"By the middle of the year, I hope to secure Government agreement on a revised roadmap to universal health insurance," Mr Varadkar writes.
It is known that Mr Varadkar's swift dumping of UHI last summer caused some anger within Taoiseach Enda Kenny's circle of advisers and it is understood that their movement on the matter is seen to be addressing that anger.
The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has been charged by Mr Varadkar with delivering a firm set of costings on how much various "baskets", or health insurance, packages will cost. That report is to be with Mr Varadkar by Easter.
But today, Mr Varadkar is to outline specific details of how they intend to reduce the number of people remaining in hospital when they really should be discharged.
It is understood that Mr Varadkar is aiming to reduce the number of blocked beds from 750 to 500 by the end of the year.
"I want to improve outcomes for patients, so there will be a new focus on reducing the number of beds being held up in hospitals because their occupants have not been discharged," Mr Varadkar writes.
"This, in turn, will reduce the number of people on trolleys at any one time, and should also reduce waiting times for surgery and other treatments."
They added: "There will be a strong focus on the people waiting the longest for appointments, operations, scopes and scans. I hope to get these moving in the right direction again by the summer."
However, Mr Varadkar admits that because of the limited resources available and rising demand because of our ageing population, "it's going to be difficult to hit some waiting list targets in 2015".
Mr Varadkar is committed to "extending GP services without fees to all under sixes and GP services without fees to the over 70s" this year.
"Subject to agreement of GPs, about half of the population will be able to attend their GP without fees, including the youngest and oldest in our society," Mr Varadkar writes.
Mr Varadkar also insists that Ireland's health service is not "third world". They said such descriptions are because there is a "confidence problem" in the minds of the public.

“There is delight in the hardy life of the open.” – Theodore Roosevelt.
My, my we are all are so reliant on the ‘grid' of modern technology. With computers, the Internet, Smart phones, IPads and even the computerized sensors and chips that make our motor vehicles run, every move we make it seems cannot be done without entering the technological sphere. Oh, and let's not forget about the convenience of electricity either. All of this high-tech gadgetry is a positive thing in our daily lives, right? But wouldn't it be nice to disconnect and take a break from it all? Wouldn't it be nice to head to an isolated, backcountry location with no public utilities just for a while to cleanse your mind and gain a better appreciation for what we have in this world? I certainly think so.
One of the best ways to unplug from this digital-driven society is to journey into what I call “true wilderness.” I mean a large, expansive place where the land is in its mostly natural state and human impact has been or is minimal.
And, I have such a place for you.
It is a place of seemingly endless wilderness where a person can trade modern conveniences for simple joys and meaningful outdoor experiences. It is a place where the wind nearly always blows and where quiet moments, wide-open skies, numerous wildlife species and pastoral scenes await!
Stretching 265 miles across Nebraska and encompassing over 19,000 square-miles of grass-covered sand dunes, this place is called the Nebraska Sandhills. It is about the size of West Virginia!
This unique, Great Plains ecoregion possesses mixed-grass prairie on grass-stabilized sand dunes in north-central Nebraska, covering just over one quarter of the state. With dunes that are as high as 400 feet, as long as 20 miles, and slopes as steep as 25 percent, the Sandhills constitute the largest sand dune formations in the Western Hemisphere plus one of the largest grass-stabilized dune regions on earth! The entire ecoregion sits atop the massive Ogallala Aquifer; forming shallow wetlands and lakes as well as rivers and creeks in low-lying valleys between the dunes giving rise to sporadic growth of shrubs and trees.
For one reason or another, it seems this picturesque area and its friendly people have escaped today's treadmill.
Of all places in Nebraska, the Sandhills comes closest to being just about like it always was. The difference is that this broad, 12.75 million acre area which is roughly 95 percent rangeland, is now cattle country where wild bison once grazed. Interestingly, good habitat for a herd of Black Angus is about the same as good habitat for wildlife.
Like most of Nebraska, the majority of the land in the Sandhills is privately owned. Permission to travel on private ranches has to be acquired and is not out of the realm of impossibility. Thorough homework definitely needs to be done though to find out detailed information regarding land ownership.
You must make contact with ranch owners well in advance of your intended trip to obtain permission. When visiting with them, be polite and respectful, get to know them and their ground rules, offer a gift of gratitude (e.g. fresh sweet corn), have a plan, and stress that extreme caution will be observed with campfires, cattle and cattle fences. You will discover that many of these nice folks won't mind a few of you looking to hike, study nature, camp, fish and possibly canoe for several days.
The good news in the Sandhills is that there are a number of lands open to public outdoor recreation. Two remote, massive USDA Forest Service properties for dispersed camping are available — the 90,000-acre Nebraska National Forest/Bessey Ranger District near Halsey and the 116,000-acre Samuel R. McKelvie National Forest near Valentine. If you're wondering, dispersed camping means camping anywhere in the National Forest system outside of of a designated campground.
For this kind of camping, according to the Forest Service, you'll need to check on the fire danger level, bring your own water or purify water from windmills, lakes, streams or springs. Make your camp at least 100 feet from all water sources. And, dig a hole at least six inches deep for disposal of your human waste. You should also file a plan, telling officials where you are going and when you will be back. Be sure to check other guidelines and regulations for this type of camping on National Forest lands.
No matter where you end up camping or how long you stay, always leave no trace of being there! That means when you venture away from your campsite, there should be no trace that you were ever there: no new fire rings, no trash, no mess. Take only photographs and leave only footprints!
Enjoy going off the grid for a short stay in the Nebraska Sandhills!
The Reserve Bank was fully prepared to deal with currency shortages post demonetisation and has enough currency in its chests to last "far beyond" December 30, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Tuesday."There was full preparedness. There was not a single day when RBI had not released adequate currency to banks. There was a certain level of currency that was to be released and there was full preparedness for it," Jaitley told reporters.He said RBI has maintained the stock of currency through advance as well as current printing level."Today also RBI has more than adequate stock not only to last them for December 30 but to last them far beyond that," they said.Asked about the currency in circulation, Jaitley said the figures will be made public only after accurate calculation after December 30, the last date for depositing the scrapped currency in banks."The currency which got printed might have gone to Post Offices and from there to banks and again back to currency chest so there could be double counting and scope for inaccuracies. So we do not want to guess the figures (of currency in circulation)," they said.Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said the currency situation has considerably improved since November 8 and there is adequate currency with RBI to meet the demand till December 30.While announcing the demonetising the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked holders of such notes to deposit them in banks.He said notes of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 with new design and more security features were being introduced in the market.The scrapped currency made up for 86 per cent or over Rs 15.45 lakh crore of notes in circulation as on November 8.Before the announcement of demonetisation, the government had already arranged for the printing of 200 crore Rs 2,000 notes, or roughly about Rs 4 lakh crore in value. They were the first set of notes to be circulated.Thereafter, a new Rs 500 note was introduced and now all the four printing presses of RBI at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh, Nashik in Maharashtra, Salboni in West Bengal and Mysuru in Karnataka are working overtime to replenish the exhausted currencies.Post demonetisation use of all parallel and alternative modes of digital payments, credit/debit cards have increased significantly, Jaitley said. "There is significant jump in digital transactions, by over 300 per cent in some cases.Where base was low, it is 1,500 per cent".Replying to queries on curbs on deposit of old currency notes by RBI, they said people should go and deposit the now-defunct notes in one go as repeat deposits raise doubts.He added: "Today there are no exemptions... Now there is no further scope of earning old currency so those who have got old currency must go and deposit in one go."Therefore if somebody goes everyday and deposit old currency it raises suspicion. How are they getting everyday? As long as exemptions existed there was scope for getting old currency, but once the exemptions have been lifted if you have old currency go and deposit in one go."With nearly Rs 13 lakh crore, out of the Rs 15.4 lakh crore worth of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes junked, already deposited in banks, RBI yesterday changed rules to mandate that individuals can deposit over Rs 5,000 in old currency bills only once until December 30 and that too after explaining why it had not been done so far.Clarifying the rules, Jaitley later in night had said no questions will be asked if any amount of junked currency is deposited in one go but repeated deposits may raise queries."If they go and deposit with bank any amount of currency no questions are going to be asked to them and therefore the 5000 rupee limit does not apply to them if they go and deposit it once."But if they are going to go everyday and deposit some currency, same person, that gives rise to suspicion that where is they acquiring this currency from. In that event a person may have something to worry about. Therefore everyone is advised whatever old currency you have please go and deposit it now," Jaitley had said.

The Browns fan base has been calling for the team to acquire a force at the wide receiver position since Braylon Edwards departed for the New York Jets several years ago.
Cleveland spent high draft picks on Mohammed Massaquoi and Brian Robiskie in 2009, but were forced to draft Greg Little in 2011 due to a lack of offensive production. Massaquoi has been the more productive of the two wide outs since being drafted. The former Georgia Bulldogs standout has compiled 70 catches for 1,107 yards in 31 games played.
Robiskie has only caught 36 passes in their first two seasons.
Cleveland does not seem to be very interested in acquiring another wide receiver before the 2011 season begins. So, that means that the young talent on the active roster must step up in order for the Browns to have any success.
The Browns' front office has stated repeatedly that they feel the receiving corps is better than what the public believes. However, it would be nice to see those talents instead of hearing about them.
What on earth WAS this? Man photographs 'UFO' floating in the clouds moments before ten dead birds appear in garden
Photograph shows a disc shaped outline in the clouds
Neighbour believes UFOs are linked to bird deaths
A UFO-like object floating in the clouds was caught on camera on the same day ten dead birds were found in a nearby garden.
Calum Sherwood, 23, was shocked to see the outline of what appeared to be a UFO while riding on a bus in Salterbeck, south of Workington, Cumbria, on Monday.
Sharon Larkin, UFO enthusiast and Mr Sherwood's friend who lives nearby, found ten dead birds in their garden that day.
Ms Larkin claims that ‘dead birds are associated with sightings of UFOs', and experts are divided over the cause - with some believing it could be a rare cloud formation, while others believe it could be ice crystals from a jet engine.
UFO outline: Just above the chimney is the strange shape Calum Sherwood saw in the sky in Salterbeck, Cumbria, an area which UFO investigator Sharon Larkin says is a hotspot for supernatural activity
SO WHAT IS IT?
The circular shape may have been caused by a 'contrail' - ice crystals produced by jet engines at high altitude that have left a condensation trail.
However, another explanation is an unusual cloud formation known as a fallstreak hole or hole punch cloud - a large circular gap that can appear in clouds and is often mistaken for a UFO.
They are formed when the water temperature in the clouds is below freezing but the water has not frozen yet due to the lack of ice particles. If it is not a cloud formation or a plane - and ruling out the arrival of little green men - perhaps it was created when Fearless Felix Baumgartner re-entered the earth's atmosphere after their leap from the edge of space on Monday.
They claim the area, which is close to Sellafield nuclear power plant, was a hotspot for unusual activity.
Ms Larkin said: ‘There is something about this picture. The line around the edge of the UFO is very clear and very specific.
‘I've shown it to other people and some people have suggested it might be an unusual cloud formation, but the perimeter is very clear and I don't think that's the case.
‘What's really strange is that the day Calum took this picture I discovered about ten dead birds in my garden, the back and the front.
‘They were sparrows and blackbirds. It could just be a co-incidence but the discovery of dead birds is associated with sightings of UFOs.'
A spokesperson from the Met Office said: 'It looks like a's just a persisting circular contrail (a condensation trail of ice crystals produced by jet engines at high altitude).
'There's patchy high cirrus cloud around, so the atmosphere is moist enough to allow contrails to last for some time.
'It's hard to tell whether the contrail is above or below the cloud around it but we suspect that in some places it is below, and the grey bits are then where the contrail shadow falls on the cloud beneath it.
'It's unusual for a civil aircraft to be doing this sort of thing so it's probably military.'
Ms Larkin said they had also heard unusual noises in the sky which sounded like ‘metal being scraped against metal'.
Supernatural hotspot: UFO investigator Sharon Larkin found ten dead birds in their garden the same day Mr Sherwood saw the UFO outline, which is nearby to Sellafield nuclear power plant (pictured)
Mr Sherwood, who works at the power plant, said: ‘I was looking at the object for about 20 minutes. It was so strange.
‘When I showed the picture to my girlfriend Michelle, we thought it might be a UFO so we contacted a friend who knows a lot about this kind of thing.
‘I have never seen anything like this before and have no idea what it might be.'
In 2010 a man was walking their dog when they saw a bright solid red light moving in a northerly direction above the town.
They claimed they saw the object flying very low, beneath cloud level, before it changed direction and disappeared from view.
Nuclear clean up: Sellafield is responsible for decommissioning and reprocessing nuclear waste and fuel manufacturing
Residents also reported seeing triangular shaped craft in the sky and shining balls of light in 2004.
Sellafield is responsible for decommissioning and reprocessing nuclear waste and fuel manufacturing, on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.
The Sellafield site has been operational since the 1940s, when it was used as a Royal Ordnance factory supporting the war effort. The site is also home to the world's first commercial nuclear power station - Calder Hall, which operated from 1956 to 2003.
Sighting: Morag Ritchie said they saw the UFO hovering over their house in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and caught the blinking lights on camera
Today the site comprises a wide range of nuclear facilities, including redundant facilities associated with early defence work, as well as operating facilities associated with the Magnox reprocessing programme, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, the Sellafield Mox plant and a range of waste treatment plants.
The sighting comes as a woman spoke out about a UFO they saw hovering above their house in rural Scotland.
Morag Ritchie, 50, of Aberdeenshire was awoken in the middle of the night by flashing lights in the sky and caught the shocking images of four blinking lights on video.
Where they saw the UFO: Ms Ritchie said they saw the UFO while standing in the family's back garden
Well, it's not much. But at this point, anything is progress.
Late yesterday, we were notified of a (very) brief HBO “In Production Now” clip of Oathkeeper that aired on HBO during one of its promotional segments. After monitoring various HBO channels for confirmation, we were able to confirm it.
Again, it's roughly seven seconds of a sword. But it's seven seconds more than what we had…
UPDATED: HBO has released another “In Production Now” clip featuring none other than the Queen herself, Cersei Lannister…
The original notification came from, who else… Oathkeepers @Jaime_Brienne

Per the norm, we wanted to confirm the release to make sure it was official. And sure enough, after the consumption of multiple adult beverages and monitoring the various HBO channels available through satellite television, it magically appeared.
The quality of an iPhone video recording of a flat screen TV leaves much to be desired. As soon as a high-quality version is made available, we will update this post.
It also gives us hope that an official teaser may be in the works and coming soon. Is there a particular reason that “Oathkeeper” is featured in this video and may be a sign of things to come for S7? Or are we desperate and simply reading too much into a random “In Production” clip?
What do you think? Let us know, and may there always be peace in your realm. -Oz

A Handmade Camera And A Vintage Trailer: On The Road To A Lost America
David Michael Kennedy is a 60-year-old art photographer from New Mexico who took an extraordinary cross-country journey to rediscover what they thought was a lost America. They share their photos here, and responds to a few questions.

In the '70s and '80s, David Michael Kennedy lived in New York City, shooting portraits of music icons like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Muddy Waters for magazine and album covers. They moved to New Mexico in 1986, where they focused on Native American culture. Today they live in a 200-year-old adobe house in the tiny agricultural village of El Rito in northern New Mexico.
But for two years beginning in 2004, Kennedy wandered back roads photographing preachers, crawfishermen, RV-ers, buffaloes, longhorns, cowboys and mystics.
They and their girlfriend, Heather Howard, and a res dog named Henry Crow Dog packed up in a 1959 Airstream trailer outfitted with a wet darkroom. They took all their photographs with a handmade 4x5 camera using Polaroid positive/negative film, which they developed in the trailer then made contact prints using the archaic platinum palladium process prized by collectors and museums.

John Burnett: Why did you take this trip across the country?
David Michael Kennedy: I got divorced, my house burned down and I didn't know what to do. It was March 2004 and I was confused about where America was going. I was watching the news and it didn't make sense. It seemed to me America was broken and the people were a mess. I decided to go out and rediscover America and myself.

What did the people you photographed teach you?
At the end of the trip, most of what I felt is there was still a spirit within the people. Once I got out there, I found people who were reinventing their lives, who were not going to strip malls, who were not feeding that consumer monster. The deeper we penetrated into the back roads of America — what I think of as the real America — the less I found of that.

There were people who didn't need to text, there were people who didn't need iPods, there were people who actually had coffee pots you could take apart and fix when they broke. We met one old man and their wife; 50 years ago they made an electric tractor that was still running, and they heated their entire house with solar panels that he'd made from beer cans, which he'd drunk.
Did you know where you wanted to go when you set out, or was the trip completely unscripted?
We had no plan for this trip. Every morning when we woke up I'd look up at the sky and think, "Heading north today." The trip began to get scripted by the people we met.

"Sister Reiddie was a Pentecostal minister who was just amazing. When I photographed her, they couldn't decide whether they should be holding a Bible or a shotgun."
V.R. Hylton was a minister we met in Texas; we stayed with them for over a week and ended up going to their church and fishing in their lake and photographing their longhorns. V.R. told us about some old cowboy crop-dusters over in Louisiana. When we left V.R., we headed over to Louisiana to try to find the crop-dusters. Of course we made a wrong turn ... the trip was really about wrong turns.
We passed a roadside fruit stand and spent a week with the people who ran the fruit stand. They introduced us to crawfishermen and we had huge crawfish feasts. Then they introduced us to Sister Reiddie.
Tell me about the Airstream trailer.
We traveled for two years living in that vintage Airstream. It still has a 1959 lifetime warranty stuck to the closet door. We did a little modification to it so I could process film at night. Heather made blackout curtains, or we'd just park in dark places and I processed and printed in the trailer.

And I think the Airstream kind of helped. A big blue Dodge pickup with an Indian motorcycle in back, pulling this huge silver reflective trailer down the road. It definitely drew people to us. It made people interested in what we were doing.
What was it about these moments that made you go and get your camera?
They're just things that touched me. There are moments that grab me and make me say "yes." This feels right and natural and good, and I make a picture.
CLOSE Des Moines Register Courts Reporter Grant Rodgers breaks down expected testimony in the federal trial of two Ron Paul campaign operatives.

Ron Paul forcefully told jurors on Wednesday that prosecutors carefully timed an indictment against three of their former campaign staffers in an attempt to bruise their son, Rand, ahead of the first Republican presidential primary debate.
Paul, a former U.S. member of congress from Texas and presidential candidate, came to Des Moines' federal courthouse to testify for the prosecution against two of their former top campaign staffers, Jesse Benton and Dimitri Kesari.
The two operatives are charged in a scheme to illegally hide payments made to former Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, allegedly for their endorsement of Paul's 2012 bid. In an opening statement Tuesday, U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor Richard Pilger portrayed Paul as a victim of Benton and Kesari's plot to keep them in the dark about the payments.
But Paul appeared unhappy to be testifying against the two. They blamed news organizations and prosecutors for an investigation that became a years-long ordeal for their family, one that included the former candidate being called to testify before a grand jury. Benton is married to Paul's granddaughter and traveled constantly with them through the campaign. The former member of congress told jurors they still stand by Benton.
"I'm not testifying for the defense," they said at one point during cross-examination from Kesari's lawyer. "I'm testifying for the prosecution. And that's been a heavy burden for my family."
Paul also said they believe federal prosecutors intentionally announced an indictment in the case on Aug. 5, one day before the first Republican primary debate on Fox News that featured their son, Rand Paul. The younger Paul is a U.S. senator from Kentucky and is also seeking the nomination, currently polling at just more than 3 percent in Iowa, according to a Real Clear Politics polling average.
"I don't consider that a coincidence," Ron Paul said in court. "I consider that more than seeking justice."

Paul left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. They testified to having no knowledge of payments allegedly made to Sorenson by their campaign and said they "certainly" didn't know whether the allegations against Benton and Kesari were true.
The original indictment also included charges against John Tate, Paul's 2012 campaign manager, but they were dismissed ahead of trial. Benton served as the chairperson of Paul's campaign, while Kesari was the deputy campaign manager.
Paul's campaigns solidified their reputation as a leading voice of the GOP's so-called liberty wing, calling for a smaller federal government and denouncing U.S. military involvement in foreign countries.
But claims of dirty dealings by campaign staff arose before the 2012 Iowa Republican caucus when Sorenson publicly switched their support from former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann to Paul at a rally on Dec. 28, 2011.
Sorenson denied that they were paid for the switch in an interview the next morning on Fox News. Prosecutors contend it was this public denial that forced Benton, Kesari and Tate to pay the state senator $73,000 off-the-books. They allegedly used a video production company to filter the money to Sorenson, violating election laws about reporting campaign expenditures.

Paul told jurors Wednesday that they learned about Sorenson's defection from Bachmann only three to five minutes before the state senator endorsed them at a press conference. The news of Sorenson's endorsement "annoyed" him, because the commotion came as they were preparing to speak, they said.
"I was annoyed because I was caught off-balance," they said.
As for Sorenson himself, Paul said they never felt any particular affection for the former politician. "We've crossed paths, but it was never a close association," they said.

During cross-examination, Paul admitted that he'd support paying a local figure from campaign coffers if the person was doing work for the campaign.
But the former member of congress said they don't put stock in endorsements — a lesson they learned after their 1996 election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas' establishment politicians endorsed their opponent during that election, while they only sought the endorsement of Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan.
Paying for an endorsement would be a "big problem to consider," they said.
"I didn't pay Nolan Ryan, let me tell you that," they said. "But it meant more to me than anything else."
Paul, wearing a dark suit and a blue patterned tie, sometimes donned reading glasses during their testimony to read transcripts and other evidence. In the hallway awaiting their turn, a reporter spotted Paul reading a display on the history of jury service.
Jurors earlier in the day heard testimony from FBI special agent Karen LoStracco, who led the probe into the alleged payments. LoStracco read from strings of emails and invoices sent between Kesari, Benton and other campaign staff that prosecutors claim show the workings of the conspiracy to secretly pay Sorenson.
LoStracco also testified about an interview they had with Benton over a two-day period in 2014. In that interview, the former Paul campaign chair repeatedly denied that the campaign paid Sorenson, they said. However, they admitted that the campaign had prepared a $25,000 wire transfer intended as payment for Sorenson late 2011.
The agent claimed that Benton told them the campaign scrapped the transfer after Sorenson's public denial of a payment.
Benton is charged with one count of making false statements to the agents during that 2014 interview. Kesari faces several charges, including conspiracy.
Sorenson is expected to testify during the trial, which will stretch into next week.

M83 is a lovely spiral galaxy located about 15 million light-years from Earth. It's the 83rd entry in Charles Messier's catalog of bright objects in the sky (originally created by the comet-hunting astronomer in the late 1700s to keep track of objects they might mistake for their quarry), and one of the few big spirals I've never seen for myself through my telescope.
I'll have to fix that sometime. Of course, my view will never, ever be quite as nice as this one:

Holy. Wow.
That image is a combination from two different observatories; part Hubble, part Subaru (an 8-meter monster telescope in Hawaii). It was created by master astrophotographer Robert Gendler. The inner parts are from Hubble, and parts of the surrounding area (added to fill in blank spots) are from Subaru.
If you have a good eye you can tell; the resolution in the spiral arms is quite high, and you can see individual stars, but if you look at the two more distant background galaxies on the left, the details look a bit fuzzier. Subaru has good resolution, but it's hard to beat Hubble.
I highly recommend checking out Gendler's 3,500 x 2,800 pixel versions of this, as well the vast 6,000 x 6,660 Hubble-only image; the detail in the spiral arms is jaw-dropping.

M83 is pretty close as galaxies go and has been extensively studied. One of my favorite shots of it is from the Spitzer infrared observatory (inset here); that traces the dust in the galaxy that glows in the far-IR. Where you see glowing red filaments is where stars are being born, and massive stars are dying. Both processes create and illuminate the long carbon-based molecules—dust—strewn in the spiral arms of galaxies like M83.
I've written a lot about this galaxy, including the fact that it looks a bit off-center, and that it recently ate another, smaller galaxy. I've written about the dust in it, too.
I sometimes despair that there's just too much stuff in the Universe to see. I mean, duh, obviously, that's true. It's the Universe. But even nearby there are just so many amazing objects, so much to know—thousands of galaxies surround us in our cosmic neighborhood, and each contains billions of stars, huge numbers of star-forming nebulae, clusters, black holes, exotic compact objects like neutron stars and magnetars … we can't even map everything in our own galaxy, let alone those nearby.
But then I remember how incredible that very fact is. There is wonder and joy and amazement in every direction we look, for as far as our minds and technology allow us to see. Sure, it's overwhelming. It's the Universe.
I'm OK with that. Really, even more: I wouldn't have it any other way.

The Western Bulldogs have made four changes to the side that went down to Geelong last Friday, with veterans Matthew Boyd and Dale Morris returning to face North Melbourne on Saturday night alongside youngsters Lukas Webb and Nathan Hrovat.
Speaking with westernbulldogs.com.au on Thursday afternoon, assistant coach Rohan Smith said that Lukas Webb had earnt their chance after averaging 34 disposals per game in the VFL over the past fortnight.
“He's been playing some great footy at VFL level and he'll get their opportunity this weekend which is fantastic for him,” Smith said.
And Nathan Hrovat will play their first game of the AFL season after recovering from a shoulder injury.
“We all watched on the weekend and saw Nathan Hrovat play really well - they used the ball really well as a mid, then went forward where they were really crafty, so he'll be a welcome inclusion as well, they said.
“And then two of the old boys will come back in, Dale Morris and Matty Boyd.
“They bring a little bit of experience down back, we were a bit young last week, so with them coming back in, it just gives us that little bit of experience and little bit of surety.”
Smith said with final ladder positions still far from settled they expect a fierce battle on Saturday against the eighth-placed Roos.
“We don't feel like we've been playing at our best that last couple of weeks and had a couple of losses, so we're looking to turn that around, and what better way to do it than against North Melbourne, another top-eight team.
“We might play them again in four weeks-time so it's a good experience for us to play against a really good, hardened team and it'll be a great contest on Saturday.”
Toby McLean, Will Minsona and Bailey Dale been named as emergencies.
Saturday night's match will be broadcast no 7mate at 7:00pm due to coverage of the Olympics.

Kung Fu San Soo (功夫散手) is a martial art based on techniques from all over China, both Northern and Southern Chinese martial arts systems. The 5 Family Fist (五家拳) is an important part of San Soo, and is commonly practiced in the Taishan region of the Guangdong province. Kung Fu San Soo as taught in China has many traditional forms and isometric exercises in its training regimen. Chin Siu Dek (Jimmy H. Woo), the man responsible for bringing Kung Fu San Soo to America, did not believe in the animal styles and hence taught only the 5 family styles (蔡李何佛雄). Their words were, "We fight like men, not animals." The name "Kung Fu San Soo" itself was chosen by Woo to simplify the pronunciation and meaning for American students, rather than using the complete names of the 5 families. Kung Fu San Soo originated for use in military combat and uses techniques designed to swiftly disable an attacker. Due to the fact San Soo is a practical martial art for self-defense and the techniques are intended for real fight scenarios, there are no competitions or tournaments for San Soo Kung Fu.
Foundation and techniques [ edit ]
San Soo was not created or taught as a tournament sport, but practitioners commonly incorporate forms of limited sparring.[1] Kung Fu San Soo does not attempt to emulate the motions of animals with elaborate forms.[2] The basic premise of San Soo is there are no rules in a fight, so the style is techniques oriented[3] to remove a threat as quickly as possible through seizing the initiative and keeping the opponent off balance. Like many martial arts, San Soo can be used by smaller or weaker persons against larger or stronger assailants by utilizing technique and knowledge of reaction to make up for a lack of strength.[4]
Techniques in San Soo are made up of Chin Na leverages, throwing, choking, joint-locking, strangling, strikes, and quick takedowns.[5] Targets include the eyes, nose, throat, base of the skull, neck, liver, spleen, kidneys, testicles, and knees, and for this reason, most San Soo practitioners do not engage in full contact competition/sport fighting. Techniques are commonly practiced in unrehearsed 'freestyle workout' sessions with carefully controlled contact. San Soo practitioners claim this method of training builds an automatic and flexible response in much the same way we learn language a few words at a time until we have full and versatile vocabularies. Training methods, historic interpretations, and modifications exist from school to school among the modern descendants of San Soo.
San Soo also incorporates training with the use of many traditional Chinese weapons. These include the staff (5', 7' and 9'), broadsword, hooking or ripping swords, baat cham do (butterfly swords), three-section staff, tai-chi sword, knife, spear, kwon do, chas and chain. The baton, although not a traditional Chinese weapon, was a weapon that Jimmy Woo specialized in and incorporated into the art.
Naming [ edit ]
San Soo is a distinct fighting style from the similarly named Chinese martial art San Shou.[6] Although they share the same name in Chinese (散手 - meaning 'free hand'), context is used to differentiate between the two.[7]
First, the difference in dialect. San Shou (散手) is Mandarin (Beijing). San Sao (散手) is Cantonese (Hong Kong). San Soo (散手) is Sei-yap (or Toisanese) dialect within the Cantonese dialect, a sub-dialect if you will.
The Japanese killed numerous skilled martial artists pre-World War II, and during the war. Many great fighters that were unfortunate enough to live in an area that the Japanese were occupying were killed because they were seen as a threat, and a possible leader for organizing resistance movements. So, that eliminated many talented Kung-Fu men.
Then after the Cultural Revolution and the Communists took over, the same process happened again. The Communists killed anyone who they perceived as a threat. Teachers, Doctors, Scientists, and Kung-Fu practitioners. Again, anyone who might organize a resistance movement.
During the 1960s, in an effort to revive the Kung-Fu martial arts in China, the government looked to any and all remaining Kung-Fu practitioners in Mainland China. They took what was useful, as well as any techniques from foreign martial arts they thought were useful, and made the Chinese Red Army San Shou (散手). This was only taught to the Army, and to the Police Forces.
Then during the 1970s, that is when China started to turn San Shou (散手) into a competitive sport. In America, the best known San Shou (散手) competitor is Cung Le from San Jose, California.
Chinese Red Army San Shou (散手) is closer to Kung-Fu San Soo (功夫散手); than San Shou (散手) Kickboxing.
The specific or proper name of this art is Tsoi Li Ho Fut Hung. In China, many centuries ago, there were three original families that contributed information from their systems in order to create this art. They built a monastery and developed a combined defense system. These families are Tsoi, Li, and Ho. Fut was the philosophical or religious base and originally made reference to Buddha. The Hung family was added later in order to increase power, physical conditioning and dynamics.[8]
Notable practitioners [ edit ]
Jimmy H. Woo [ edit ]
Kung Fu San Soo was brought to America[9] by a Chin Family practitioner, Chin Siu Dek,[10] Chan Siu Duk, or Chen Shou Jue (陳壽爵, Chen2 Shou4 Jue2), depending on the dialect. Entering the United States under the Chinese Exclusion Act, and leaving China on the eve of the Japanese Occupation, Chin Siu Dek took the name, "Jimmy Haw Woo" as a lifetime pseudonym. Most believe they were born around 1905–10. They died in Southern California on February 14, 1991,[11] and is credited with bringing the Five Family Style (五家拳) of Tsoi Li Ho Fut Hung (蔡李何佛雄), or San Soo Kung Fu to America after learning primarily from their Great-Uncle, Chan Siu Hung, at the Hung Sing Goon school in Taishan, Guangdong Province, China . Kung Fu San Soo tradition holds that Chin Siu Dek lived and grew up just across the river from this school in the village of Sanba. Sadly, this school was later destroyed by the communists in the cultural revolution. Also, one of their classmates was Chan Siu Hung's own son, Chan Sai Mo (Chen Shi Wu [Mand]). As Jimmy H. Woo, Chin Siu Dek opened their own studio in El Monte, California to teach their family art in about 1959.[12]

On recent episodes of their “Life Today” program, televangelist James Robison has been airing portions of a gathering that they hosted featuring dozens of Religious Right pastors and activists urging conservative Christians to vote in the upcoming election.
Robison has addressed Donald Trump campaign events in the past and has vocally supported the GOP presidential nominee, so it was not much of a secret that the program was meant to rally support for Trump.
On today's episode, former Rep. Michele Bachmann, who, like Robison, is a member of Trump's spiritual advisory board, declared that Christians are “the largest voting bloc in the United States,” which means that this election “is in our hands.” As such, conservative Christians must rally to elect leaders who reflect “biblical moral values” because “we won't have necessarily this option four years from now.”
“We've got to get our act together fast and in a way that is going to glorify a holy God,” Bachmann said. “It is a holy God that we obey and when we obey Him, we receive Their blessing in our land, and let's embrace that now.”
Bachmann was followed by televangelist Kenneth Copeland, who proclaimed that they refuse “to believe that God would give birth to this nation to see the devil destroy it.”
“I will not believe that we'll bow our knee at the most important place in history,” Copeland said. “This is it! This is it and we're in it … It's one thing to win the first game of the season, this is the Super Bowl, brother. And we're going to take it and we're going to take it hard and we're going to take it strong with overwhelming faith and spiritual force.”

RIO DE JANEIRO — Preparations for Rio's troubled Olympic Games suffered another blow this week when hundreds of agents with Brazil's National Force, a key security unit brought in for the event, threatened to quit over poor accommodation and working conditions.
[Cash-strapped Rio state says Olympics will be fine. But what about afterward?]
The National Force is Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. National Guard and is made up of police officers and firefighters from across the country. During the Olympics, this unit will be responsible for protecting arenas and other event locations. But Tuesday, hundreds of National Force agents held a meeting outside the government complex where they are housed, with many urging fellow officers to quit. The meeting was preceded by a noisy protest.
“Everyone wanted to leave. The conditions were very bad,” said an out-of-state police officer on the force, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of fear of disciplinary measures for talking publicly without authorization.

The unrest is particularly worrying as violent crime is rising across Rio state and concerns about security during the Olympics, which officially opens Aug. 5, are increasing. Up to 500,000 international visitors are expected.
A "pacification" policy to install police bases in low-income communities, called favelas, long dominated by armed drug gangs is crumbling in some areas. Shootouts and armed robberies are on the rise. Stray bullets have killed three people in the past two days alone.
[‘Welcome to hell': Violence rocks Rio a month before Olympics]
The police officer said the unit's personnel had gone through a rigorous selection process to work for the National Force during the Olympics as part of a wider 85,000-strong security force that includes troops.
The National Force personnel arrived June 22 at their new barracks — a public housing complex in west Rio, near the main Olympic site — and found there was no furniture. Some apartments lacked showers and had mold and damp on the walls and ceilings, as well as toilets without lids. There were areas that stank of sewage and even electricity shortages.
“There were no beds. We had to organize airbeds or simple mattresses,” the officer said. “Everyone wanted to go home.”

To compound the problem, the complex is situated close to two favelas — both run by rival criminal gangs. “This is not a place where a security professional should be,” the officer said.
Another National Force agent fumed over conditions in a letter sent via WhatsApp to Brazil's national union of private and noncommissioned officers in the police and fire services. (In Brazil, street police and fire brigades are structured like military units).
“The success of the mission is at risk!” the letter read. “Morale is low and this could come at a high price.”
Some agents complained that they were working up to 16 to 20 hours a day and not getting a full day off. Others said they had not been paid the daily food allowance of $70. Others said the number of shifts was too high, with some working 80 hours a week. On Tuesday, matters reached a boiling point.
“They had already been complaining for a number of days, and yesterday was the final straw,” said Elisandro Lotin, the union's president, said Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Lotin met with Celso Perioli, Brazil's national secretary of public security, to air the grievances. “He guaranteed that they were already taking measures to resolve the problems," Lotin said. Beds would be sent and outstanding payments made.
“The structure for the security of Olympic installations is guaranteed, as are the daily allowances for professionals from the National Force of Public Security that will act in the Olympic Games and Paralympics,” a spokesperson for the Justice Ministry said in an email. They did not give their name, in accordance with internal regulations.
[Brazil says there is ‘almost zero' risk of Zika during Olympics. Really?]
The police officer initially cited confirmed that some payments had been received and some beds delivered.
The officer also said that the number of shifts had been reduced but that the force had been told it was a temporary move because the government was unable to recruit enough police officers. Local media have reported that 5,000 National Force agents will be at hand, instead of the 9,600 earlier envisioned. More troops will be deployed instead.
“There is a shortage of police all over Brazil,” the officer said. “There will be a cost for those working, because it will be heavy. But we will manage.”

When the Deflategate scandal erupted following the New England Patriots' AFC Championship Game win over the Indianapolis Colts, many wondered how the NFL became aware of the situation. That question has finally been answered.
According to ESPN.com, NFL football operations chief Troy Vincent revealed in an interview on Showtime's "60 Minutes Sports" that Colts general manager Ryan Grigson tipped off the league regarding New England's use of under-inflated footballs.
Per ESPN's Chris Mortensen, the NFL found after investigating the matter that 11 of the footballs used by the Pats in their 45-7 romp over the Colts weren't inflated to proper levels:
In the wake of the league's findings, the Patriots have attempted to absolve themselves from any blame. Head coach Bill Belichick made it clear that they had no knowledge of any type of tampering with the footballs, according to ESPNBoston.com's Mike Reiss:
Quarterback Tom Brady echoed those sentiments, per NFL Network's Albert Breer:
The Patriots ultimately went on to dramatically defeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 in Super Bowl XLIX, but Deflategate will continue to be a huge topic of discussion until it is ultimately resolved.
Vincent's revelation that Grigson started the probe makes the situation a bit clearer; however, the focus moving forward will be on what type of punishment, if any, the Patriots incur.

A bill that would allow concealed carry without a permit inside city limits cleared an Idaho senate committee Monday.
SB 1389 would allow concealed guns without a permit to those aged 21 and older, who are residents of the state, and who are not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law.
The committee cleared the pro-gun bill after hearing from those on opposed and those who supported the legislation.
The Idaho Sheriffs Association, which represents 44 county elected sheriffs, favored the bill.
"The association voted to support SB 1389 last week," said Vaughn Killeen, executive director of the Idaho Sheriffs' Association, in an email. "Our rules require a two-thirds vote to take a position on legislation."
State senator Curt McKenzie, the lead sponsor of the bill, said via email, "The law should not be a trap for the unwary. Idaho has always allowed law abiding citizens to conceal carry firearms in the counties without a permit. But current law makes it a crime for citizens to cross the invisible line into a municipality unless they openly carry their firearm, which makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Someone could drive in the county with a loaded gun holstered by their seat, but they could be committing a crime once the street crosses into a city. That is not good law."
"The Idaho Constitution and United States Constitution contain strong protections of our right to bear arms. As chairperson of the Senate State Affairs Committee, I take the responsibility to defend and promote that right very seriously. In fact, part of the oath that we swear to as legislators is to ‘defend the Constitution'—and that is exactly what we are doing with this important piece of legislation," said McKenzie.
McKenzie said SB 1389 makes carry laws consistent across the state and added, "While criminals will always find ways to possess and carry weapons regardless of restrictions, we should pass laws that protect the rights of lawful citizens to protect themselves and their families."
Gun control groups are vowing to fight the measure.
Gun control group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, part of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety, claims it will put residents at risk.
"Idaho has a strong tradition of responsible gun ownership. For nearly 100 years, our current concealed carry permitting system has kept our communities, families and law enforcement safe. But instead of standing up for public safety and preserving our longstanding system, our elected leaders in the Senate today passed Senate Bill 1389," said Hannah Sharp, a volunteer for Idaho's Mom's Demand Action, in a prepared statement.
"If signed into law, SB 1389 would dismantle our current system and put Idahoans at risk, including law enforcement officers who risk their safety to protect us," Sharp said. "Moms across Idaho will continue to fight against this bill and to advocate for safer gun laws—our families' lives depend on it."
Everytown for Gun Safety on Tuesday tweeted a link to an opinion piece written by three Idaho police chiefs who are opposed to the bill. They wrote that it will endanger the public and law enforcement.
The NRA, which backed the bill, blasted the Bloomberg's group and urged their members to call the Senate State Affairs Committee prior to Monday's hearing.
"Unfortunately, out-of-state billionaire and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has once again launched a misinformation campaign aimed at undermining the rights of law-abiding Idahoans," the NRA wrote on their website. "Bloomberg-funded gun control groups are misrepresenting facts and statistics in an attempt to persuade your elected officials to oppose SB 1389."
"SB 1289 will not allow violent criminals and state or federally prohibited persons to lawfully carry concealed weapons in Idaho," the NRA wrote.
We've all forgotten our wallet a time or two, and that can be a pain when we go to pay a cashier.
That recently happened to a woman at a Publix grocery store in Panama City Beach, Florida, and now one small act of kindness brought two strangers closer together.
Teresa Lucas often makes trips to their Publix supermarket.
"We'll I've just seen them here at least every other day," said Publix employee Bill Holt.
They say she's greeted by friendly workers every time they go.
One day recently, Lucas forgot their wallet at home. That's when an employee stepped in to make sure they didn't go home empty-handed.
"I came to buy some cleaning supplies and I was rushing out the door, and I came to Publix with my purse but without my telephone that has on the back of it my driver's license and all my credit cards. And I got up and went to the cash register and realized that I had nothing," explained Lucas.
Store employee Bill Holt saw Lucas at the cash register and stepped in to save the day.
"Next thing you know, Bill was helping me with my groceries and they said, 'How much is it?' and I said,'Fifty-two dollars. I'll go home and I'll come back,' and they said, 'No, no, no, no,' and whipped out $100 and gives it to the cashier," said Lucas.
"I offered to pay for them groceries. It wasn't that much, they didn't have that much. I didn't want them to have to go through all that. They had left their wallet at home, couldn't write a check, couldn't do anything," Holt explained.
"Then they [the cashier] tries to give them the change and they tried to give it back to me because they didn't want me to not have any cash," Lucas added.
Holt said helping people was just the way they were raised.
"Just to be nice and helpful to people," Holt said. "It doesn't take any more or cost any more to be nice."
"He's always been friendly and so has everybody here but they took it to the extra step, the extra mile and so of course now he's going to be super special to me," said Lucas.
"Just a normal day's work. If I can help somebody, I'll do it," Holt said.
Now, these two strangers are more than just friendly faces, they're real friends.
"I'm so glad Bill is going to be recognized for doing something great," Lucas said.
Lucas added in a world full of disparity and bad news, they feel happy kind people like Holt are still out there.
Serena Williams responded to the insulting comments made by Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpischev and supported their yearlong suspension by the Women's Tennis Association.
Tarpischev referred to Serena and their sister Venus as the "Williams brothers" while appearing on a Russian late-night television show called Evening Urgant, and stated that it is "frightening when you look at them." The response originated after the host asked former WTA player Elena Dementieva what it was like playing against the Williams sisters, according to ESPN.
No one laughed at Tarpischev's interjection, despite their later assertion that it was a joke.
The WTA certainly didn't find it amusing and suspended Tarpischev for a full-year in addition to fining them $25,000.
Serena was also not pleased with the comments, calling them insensitive, sexist and racist, via the BBC:
"I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time," said Williams. "I thought they were, in a way, bullying. I just wasn't very happy with their comments. I think a lot of people weren't happy as well."
Stacy Allaster, the WTA's chief executive, called the comments insensitive and demeaning, via the BBC:
"Mr Tarpischev's statements questioning their genders tarnish our great game and two of our champions. "His derogatory remarks deserve to be condemned and they will be sanctioned."
Tarpischev stated that they didn't mean to offend anyone and didn't understand why this became such a big deal:
"I didn't want to offend any athlete with my words. I regret that this joke has garnered so much attention. I don't think this incident deserves so much fuss."
Yeeeeeah.

I spoke to Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman to discuss the issues of race and violence.
In the wake of these killings of black men at the hands of the police and the police being ambushed and killed, what are your thoughts?
Honestly, I think it's unfortunate. You pray for the families on both sides. You don't want to see anybody killed senselessly. It's a tough time we are living in, a very scary time. It's an uncertain future. It's frustrating on both sides. Because you understand that police officers have a duty and a job. They sacrifice a lot to protect and serve. And I understand that some don't do it the right way. I also understand that people shouldn't get killed just because of the color of their skin. They have a right to a trial.
You've always been outspoken on social issues. Has anybody from your team or the league ever asked you to tone it down?
No. No one has ever spoken to me about quieting down. Our team has always been supportive of how I speak my mind. They only caution me on understanding the issues fully and not going off the cuff.
What Black Twitter is saying about Richard Sherman's comments
Do you think the NFL should be more active when it comes to issues of violence and race that we have in our country?
I think the league should, but I don't think they will because it doesn't affect their bottom line. It doesn't affect them, and a lot of the owners haven't come from a background where they would have to deal with these type of circumstances. So it's just news to them. They are too far away.
But as players, we are really close to it. A majority African-American league, with a lot of guys coming from impoverished environments, would really feel compelled to speak up.
What about the white and nonblack players? Do you think they should feel the same obligation as the black players?
I guess, in some respects, just as human beings.
We hear a lot about Black Lives Matter. But I think race was created. I think everybody is a human being first and then the color of their skin wouldn't matter if nobody told you it mattered, if that makes any sense.
I don't think it's the white players' obligation to speak up. I think it would be nice to show some unity within our league. But it truly hits home for a lot of the African-American players who are from these environments where people are getting killed.
What is your opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement?
It's hard to formulate an opinion and generalize because they have several different messages. Some of them are peaceful and understandable and some of them are very radical and hard to support. Any time you see people who are saying, ‘Black Lives Matter,' and then saying it's time to kill police, then it is difficult to stand behind that logic. They are generalizing police just like they are asking police not to generalize us. It is very hypocritical. So, in that respect, I find it difficult to fully support that movement.
I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings. And speaking to police, I want African-Americans and everybody else treated decently. I want them treated like human beings. And I also want the police treated like human beings. I don't want police officers just getting knocked off in the street who haven't done anything wrong.
Those are innocent lives.
You were at The ESPYS when the four NBA players — Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James — stood up and called on professional athletes to do more. Who would you say are the four NFL athletes that could be the leaders for the NFL, including you?
I would choose guys from my team like Doug Baldwin and Michael Bennett. Because I know those guys would stand up for what they believe and not really care about the consequences or retribution that would follow.
I would add Tyrann Mathieu from Arizona. They have been outspoken about a lot of the senseless violence.
If the NBA stars called on you and the NFL guys to join them, would you?
One hundred percent.
It would have to be a united message. It would have to be something that I could stand behind. I won't stand behind a message I didn't believe.
If a coalition of athletes was to form, what should they do?
I think we target the inner city and the black community and a lot of the places that have high gang violence and beg for them to stop the senseless violence within our own community. Because once we stop that, once we unite as a people, once we come together and stop looking at each other as enemies, then we can move forward in a very powerful way. And combat issues in a different way than it has ever been done before. But until we do that, we are fighting on two fronts.
What do you say to people who say that violence in the black community is a result of institutional racism? Their communities are devoid of opportunity and that creates a circumstance that breeds crime and violence.
I'd say, to some degree, that's true. There is low funding for education and very few jobs to go around. But there are also people who work hard to take care of their families. My parents did a great job, same inner city, Watts, South Central, [California]. They worked hard, didn't make the most money, but took care of the kids in the neighborhood, took care of us, made ends meet, kept us out of gangs and all the nonsense. But I think there is also a mentality that we want to blame someone else for black fathers not being there for all these people having all these kids and nobody raising them. We want to say that's systematic, but when do we stop saying it's systematic and move forward and make a difference?
In the past, you've said that you were optimistic about the future of race relations in this country. Are you still optimistic?
Yeah! You have to be, because if you're pessimistic, you don't believe there's a future, then why are we here? I believe that things will come together. This country has overcome worse things than this, like slavery. Obviously, this is a different time with different issues, but there were powerful people from every race coming together to do the right thing and I think that will happen again. There are good people in this country and that'll shine through.
Devices powered by the fledgling Firefox OS make up more than 12 per cent of smartphone sales in Venezuela and almost 9 per cent in Colombia, according to the Telefonica executive leading the operator's role in the project.
Yotam Ben-Ami, director of Open Web Devices at the operator, also told CNET that sales in Spain are “tracking our forecasts”.
Devices went on sale in Colombia and Venezuela in August 2013, supported by tariffs designed to encourage users to explore mobile data.
With Android and iOS dominating, Firefox OS is targeting the entry-level smartphone segment, where “we believe this is the price point where we can create value for our customers with the early iterations of the platform,” the Telefonica executive observed.
Telefonica's Vivo launched the Firefox-powered LG Fireweb and Alcatel Onetouch Fire in Brazil this week, opening another potentially massive market for the platform. Telefonica also plans to launch the OS in Peru, Uruguay and Mexico.
“We have set similar targets for Brazil in terms of market shares captured as we have for other key markets in our footprint, but through sheer volume alone this is clearly an important launch for us”, Ben-Ami told CNET.
Firefox OS device sales are currently being led by the ZTE-manufactured Open (pictured) and Alcatel OneTouch Fire.
At least 22 children were sexually abused by two priests at a school for youths with hearing disabilities in Argentina, an investigating prosecutor said on Monday.
Police arrested Fr Nicola Corradi, 82, Fr Horacio Corbacho, 55, and three other men last week. They are accused of sexual and physical child abuse at the Antonio Provolo Institute in north-western Mendoza province. Authorities say the alleged victims are now in their 20s.
The accused have been assigned a public defender and are being held at a jail in Mendoza. They have not spoken publicly since their arrest.
Fr Corradi earlier had been accused in Italy of sexually abusing students at the Provolo Institute in Verona, a notorious school for the deaf where hundreds of children are believed to have been sexually assaulted over the years by two dozen priests and religious brothers. Advocates for clerical sex abuse have expressed anger that they aren't sanctioned by the Vatican and allegedly went on to abuse children in Argentina.
According to the association of Provolo victims in Italy, they wrote to Pope Francis on December 31, 2013, asking for assistance for the victims there, saying they still received no form of solidarity or support, even after the Vatican concluded they had been abused in 2012.
In a statement to the Associated Press after Fr Corradi's arrest, the association said they had flagged the priest by name to the Verona archdiocese during hearings held between December 2010 and February 2011. Fr Corradi's name was also on a list of accused priests that the association published when the allegations were first aired. Their location in Argentina was also listed.
Members of the Provolo association met with the Pope last year and asked for an independent commission to investigate. The Provolo group provided the AP with the letter from the Vatican dated February 5, 2016, in which the Vatican said it had forwarded the request to the Italian bishops' conference, saying it was up to them to investigate.
“As of now, nothing has happened,” the group said in an email. “We have to ask ourselves: the Pope, who was for many years the primate of the Argentine church, did they know nothing about clerical abuse in their country?”
Argentine authorities said last week that at least eight children had been abused at the school in Mendoza, but then raised the number to at least 22 after survivors provided testimony through an interpreter. A raid on the school found pornographic magazines, videos and about $34,000 in Fr Corradi's room, officials said.
“This is a really serious case with irreparable consequences, especially mental and spiritual, for people who are doubly vulnerable, not just because of their age, but also their lack of communication,” said Mendoza Supreme Court prosecutor Alejandro Gulle.
If found guilty, the accused could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison.

The time period was September 1974 and I was taking a week's vacation from my job and doing the “airport bum” bit. You know, hanging around the FBO, getting in the way and sitting on the bench in front of the office with the other bums critiquing landings and takeoffs. Those were the good old days. I owned a beautiful Cessna 172 which I kept at the Aviation Facilities Inc. (AFI) Fullerton, California FBO and spent a lot of time washing and waxing my “pride and joy.”
The owner of the FBO (Bill Greggs) called me aside one morning and told me of a problem they were having with an airplane that a renter pilot had flown to Sacramento. The renter pilot had left it there because they couldn't get the starter to work for the return flight. It seemed that the FBO would have to send a pilot/mechanic to Sacramento and they didn't have one to spare at the time. Bill asked if I would like to go after the airplane. They said the problem was probably only a stuck starter which I could break loose with the insertion of a large screwdriver. They also said they would pay for the airline ticket to Sacramento and I could fly the plane back to Fullerton at no charge.
Now this airplane was a very nice Mooney (M20E), tail number 9215V, and I'm sure that anyone would tell you that a guy would do about anything to get free flying in that baby. It so happened that I had checked out in that very airplane a few weeks before this incident took place so everything sounded great to me.
I appeared early the next morning to pick up my ticket and was greeted with a ticket and a box. In the box was a very large screwdriver and a new starter. It was explained that just in case the screwdriver didn't work, the starter could be installed to fix the problem. It didn't dawn on me that this job might be a little more complicated than previously explained. Anyway, I jumped in my car and headed off to the Orange County airport to catch the airline flight to Sacramento.
I arrived at the Sacramento Metropolitan airport, and box in hand, took a bus over to the Sacramento Executive airport where the Mooney was located. I arrived about noon and it was already getting very warm, with the temperature climbing toward the 100 degree mark. I found the airplane parked in “visitor parking” which happened to be on the blacktop, out in the open, in front of the tower.
One look at the starter and I knew that the screwdriver was going to be of no use to me. The teeth of the starter were all gone! The starter worked fine but couldn't turn the engine over without teeth on the drive shaft. I got the feeling that I may have been sent on a Fool's Errand, because I'm sure the renter pilot could have seen the problem and I'm sure they would have told the Bill about the real problem. I was wondering why they sent the screwdriver along.
My problem now was to find a mechanic to install my starter. If you have never worked on the inside of a Mooney cowling, you won't appreciate the problem I encountered in finding a mechanic. Oh, there were several mechanics around the field, but none would take on the job. All claimed to be too busy. I finally found a mechanic who said they would at least take a look at the job. They checked the problem and quoted me a price to replace the starter. It seemed very high to me at the time, but I was desperate by then and told them to get started.
I thought the mechanic would pull the plane into a hangar close by but they said they could do the job right there on the parking ramp. It was now about three o'clock in the afternoon and the temperature was around 103 out there on the parking ramp. We rigged a sort of tent over the engine and they went to work with me handing tools and holding things to help out.
It took a very long time to do the job. It seemed to me that the entire engine was disassembled to get to the starter. Every so often we would take a break and get a Coke to drink to try to hang in there with all that heat. Finally at about eight o'clock that evening, with only a handful of small screws left over, we started the engine and checked for oil leaks and anything else that might be amiss. Everything looked to be in good shape so I paid the man with a substantial tip (the price that seemed high at first was much too low for the work required) and checked the weather for the flight back to Orange County airport.
Flight Service said it was clear all the way to the Los Angeles basin and then would be overcast at about 1000 feet with the normal late evening marine layer. I left Sacramento at nine o'clock after a very long and trying day in temperatures over 100 degrees. The last thing the mechanic said to me was to be sure and keep an eye on the oil pressure just in case!
The three-hour flight back to Orange County was beautiful, with the lights of Interstate 5 guiding me all the way home. Just outside of the Los Angeles basin, I filed IFR for Orange County and was given a VOR approach to runway 18. I was a very current instrument pilot at that time and this approach should have been a piece of cake.
I entered the overcast at about 3000 feet and when I broke out at about 1000 feet, the runway was not where it should have been. I declared a missed approach and pulled back up above the overcast into VFR conditions to think things over. The controller tried to help me by saying that it looked like my directional gyro might not be set correctly. They were exactly right. I had forgotten to set the gyro and it was off enough to make me miss the approach. I realized then that I was not thinking too straight and went through the entire landing checklist again just to make sure I hadn't missed something else. The next approach was on the money, but the landing could have been a lot smoother.
When I stepped out of the plane, I found that my knees were very weak and I had trouble walking and tying the plane down. I headed for the nearest drinking fountain and consumed a large amount of fluid which helped considerably. When I arrived home, I poured down more water to help overcome the dehydrated condition of my body.
Looking back on my experience, I found that I had been sent on a Fool's Errand and I have to laugh about how naive I was, but the FBO owner and I are still friends. As I look back on this incident now, there were several major mistakes made by yours truly. We have all heard before to be extra careful in our flying chores when tired or not in peak physical condition.
After spending all afternoon in the hot sun, you are not in real good shape to fly. I didn't have to get home that evening; I could just as easily stayed overnight in a motel. So why did I take a plane that had just been taken apart and put back together and fly three hours at night, over mountains and into an overcast instrument approach? The answer is that I was just young and stupid and was lucky to have made it home. I wouldn't push those odds again!
The U.S. Air Force has a morale problem with its combat pilots. The issue is lack of action for the pilots. That, plus the increased use of unmanned aircraft, and the very real prospect that the age of the manned combat aircraft may be coming to an end. This is made worse with hundreds of fighter pilots being assigned to operating Predator and Reaper UAVs. This was not popular duty, even though the pilots still draw flight pay. It is tedious work, although the UAV operators often saw more combat action than they did when piloting F-16s or F-15s.
The air force tried to deal with the morale problem by training non-pilots to be UAV operators, and making UAV operation a career field. Some fighter pilots saw that as an opportunity, and considered switching permanently, rather than just doing three years with UAVs and then going back to manned aircraft. But most pilots would rather fly in an aircraft. A recent air force decision to transfer 100 pilots a year from flight school (where they just graduated) to UAV duty was very unpopular. The air force had asked flight school graduates to volunteer for this, but none did so.
The air force is also considering changing the term UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) to RPV (remotely piloted vehicles), to stress the fact that there was still a pilot involved. But that decision, if carried through, is in danger of being overtaken by events. UAVs are increasingly equipped with flight control software that operates all by itself. Many UAVs already use such software for takeoffs and landings.
Many people, including some generals in the air force, believe that its next generation fighter will not have a pilot on board. Much air force generals admit that the F-35 is probably the last manned fighter. But some believe that the F-35 will be facing stiff competition from pilotless fighters before F-35 production is scheduled to end in 2034.
UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) are not particularly popular with many U.S. Air Force leaders, but that is not the case in many other countries. Air force generals around the world see the unpiloted jet fighter as a way to break the monopoly the U.S. Air Force has had on air supremacy for the last sixty years. Most Americans don't even think of this long domination of the air, but potential enemies of the United States are well aware of it, and that domination has a profound effect on how those nations do their military planning. In effect, if you think about going to war with the United States in the immediate future, you take for granted that American aircraft will control the skies above. Robotic jet fighters could change that. And this is forcing American air force generals to confront a very unsavory prospect; a sixth generation fighter that is flown by software, not a pilot.
It's not just that most of the those American air force generals began their careers as fighter pilots. No, the reason is more practical. American air superiority has largely been the result of superior pilots. The U.S. didn't always have the best aircraft, but they always had the most talented and resourceful pilots. And that's what gave the U.S. its edge. Will that translate to software piloted fighters? Research to date seems to indicate it will.
Meanwhile, simulations, using fighter flown by software, versus those flown by humans, have been used for over two decades. The "software pilots" have gotten better, and better. Moreover, a fighter without a pilot is more maneuverable (because some maneuvers are too stressful on the human body.) UAV fighters can be smaller, cheaper, stealthier and more expendable. But the key to software pilots is the development of superior tactics, and artificial intelligence (AI) that is more capable than anything your opponent can come up with.
The U.S. Air Force, and several other air forces, have already created fighter pilot software, and now the United States, and Russia, are creating pilotless fighters. Much air force generals are convinced that the pilotless fighters will perform as well for real, as they have in the simulations. So convinced are U.S. Air Force generals, that they are seriously considering a sixth generation fighter that will not carry a human pilot. Otherwise, enemy pilotless fighters would have an edge over the U.S. sixth generation aircraft.
The potential superiority of U.S. pilotless fighters is partly driven by the fact that most American fighter pilots are geeks. Many can create software, and have a deep understanding of the many computers, and their software, that modern aircraft contain. It's the fighter pilots who will play a key role in creating the best "software pilots." Thus the thinking is that American control of the air will be maintained by a new generation combat aircraft controlled by software, not someone in a cockpit.
After Vatican's speedy retreat and told campaign stop in South Carolina that Mexican government was to blame for telling Pope
Today Trump accepted the partial olive branch, saying the Papal statement was 'beautiful'
of Pope Francis for their comments, made on way back from Papal visit to Mexico
The Vatican today executed a speedy climb-down in its feud with Donald Trump - handing the Republican White House hopeful a major political victory.
Pope Francis's suggestion that Trump was 'not Christian' because of their views on immigration was not a personal attack on the candidate, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi said on Friday.
Lombardi told Vatican radio that the pope's comments, which were denounced by Trump, were simply an affirmation of their longstanding belief that migrants should be helped and welcomed rather than shut off behind walls.
They also leaned toward confirming Trump's contention that their statement that Trump was 'not a Christian' was based largely on 'what they were told' about the billionaire's position.

Taking the olive branch: Campaigning in South Carolina, Trump praised the Pope and said: 'The Pope was great. They made a beautiful statement this morning.'
Retreat: The Vatican's official spokesperson raised the white flag in a radio interview in which they said the Pope was not personally attacking Trump, and was reacting to what they had been told about the billionaire's plans
Trump said Thursday that they suspected the Mexican government had propagandized to the Pontiff about him, prompting the unusual condemnation from the leader of the world's Roman Catholics.
'This wasn't in any way a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for,' Lombardi said.
'The Pope has clearly said they didn't want to get involved in the electoral campaign in the US, and also said that they said what they said on the basis of what they were told [about Trump], hence giving them the benefit of the doubt.'
THE GREAT WALL CLIMB-DOWN 'This wasn't in any way a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for. The Pope has clearly said they didn't want to get involved in the electoral campaign in the US, and also said that they said what they said on the basis of what they were told [about Trump], hence giving them the benefit of the doubt. The Pope said what we already know, if we followed their teaching and positions: We shouldn't build walls, but bridges. They have always said that, continuously. They also said that in relation to migration in Europe many times. So this is not a specific issue, limited to this particular case. It's their generic view, coherent with the nature of solidarity from the Gospel.' Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi
But in the same breath, Lombardi defended the Pontiff's statement from Thursday and declared that they had said nothing new.
'The Pope said what we already know, if we followed their teaching and positions: We shouldn't build walls, but bridges.'
'He has always said that, continuously,' they added. 'He also said that in relation to migration in Europe many times. So this is not a specific issue, limited to this particular case.'
'It's their generic view, coherent with the nature of solidarity from the Gospel.'
Trump continued the quick about-face on Friday morning in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, praising the Vatican for walking back the Pontiff's criticism – although they seemed under the impression that Francis themselves had spoken on the subject.
'The Pope was great. They made a beautiful statement this morning,' they told a capacity crowd at the Myrtle Beach Sports Center, an indoor rec center the size of eight basketball courts.
'They had them convinced that illegal immigration is, like, a wonderful thing!' Trump exclaimed, referring to Mexico's government.
'Not wonderful for us. It's wonderful for Mexico. Not wonderful.'
Trump repeated their well-worn refrain that America's southern neighbor will pay for a lengthy border wall, and pointed out an audience member dressed as a construction worker, complete with hard hat and tool belt.
The man carried a sign that read: 'I'm ready to work on the wall!'
'We give massive subsidy to Mexico,' Trump said. 'The wall is going to cost 10 to 12 billion bucks. Our trade deficit is like $58 billion.'
'Mexico is going to pay for it, folks. It's so easy. It's so easy.'
The olive branch of sorts from the Vatican came less than 24 hours after the Pope's explosive intervention in the presidential campaign.
Asked about Trump and their plan to build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. to stop illegal immigration, they called said that a man with such a plan was 'not Christian.'
'A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,' they said.
'This is not in the Gospel. As far as what you said about whether I would advise voting or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that.
'I say only that this man is not Christian if they have said things like that.'
Their answer promoted an immediate and furious denunciation from Trump, as well as a massive backlash on social media, where the Pope was mocked for living in the Vatican, itself a walled city-state.
AT POPE WAS ASKED ON PLANE TO ROME - AND EXACTLY WHAT They SAID The Associated Press released a full transcript and translation of the exchange between an unnamed reporter and the Pope on board the Pontiff's flight from Mexico Q: Good evening, Your Holiness. Today you spoke eloquently about the problems of migrants. On the other side of the frontier there's a very tough electoral campaign going on. One of the Republican candidates for the White House, Donald Trump, in a recent interview, said you are a 'political man' and that maybe you are a pawn of the Mexican government as far as immigration policy is concerned. They have said that if elected, they would build a 2,500-kilometer-long wall along the border. They want to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, thus separating families, etc. I would like to ask you, first off, what do you think of these accusations against you, and if an American Catholic can vote for someone like this. A: Thank God they said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as 'animal politicus'. So at least I am a human person. As to whether I am a pawn, well, maybe, I don't know. I'll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people. And then, a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel. As far as what you said about whether I would advise voting or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that. I say only that this man is not Christian if they have said things like that. We must see if they said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.
Trump's aides helped them craft a biting reply – which they said took 'one minute' to write. They read it from a podium during a late-morning speech in coastal South Carolina.
By day's end the conflict drew Trump's Republican rivals out of the shadows, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio – the presidential race's two Roman Catholics – backing The Donald over The Pontiff.
'For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful,' Trump said in South Carolina, just two days before the state's critical presidential primary election.
They doubled down on that comment when they spoke to DailyMail.com at lunch.
Trump issued a furious response, reading a lengthy statement from the podium on a campaign stop in the coastal community of Kiawah Island.
They reflected on the seismic impact of crossing swords with the leader of the world's largest religious denomination, and shrugged it off.
'Now it's probably going to be all over the world. Who the hell cares? I don't care!' they said. 'We have to stop illegal immigration ... and crime.'
Blame the Mexicans: Trump said the Pope had been led astray by the Mexican government. 'They had them convinced that illegal immigration is, like, a wonderful thing!' they told the crowd
Crowded: Trump attracted a huge audience as they spoke in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Their furious response to the Pope appears to have gained them political capital
Back to the day job: Pope Francis, center, went to prayers at the Redemptoris Mater chapel, in the Vatican as their spokesperson executed a swift retreat on the Trump front
Trump blasted the Vatican for what they said was a naive outlook on the ISIS terror army, saying in a statement released to reporters that 'If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.'
'ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.'
Trump partisans, including their social media director Dan Scavino, circulated photos of the massive wall that separates Vatican City from the rest of Rome.
'Amazing comments from the Pope - considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls,' Scavino wrote in a highly retweeted message.
And reporters swarmed around the rest of the presidential field looking for reactions to the global cultural battle royale.
Rubio told reporters during a press conference in Anderson, South Carolina, that they had not seen the Holy Father's full statement, but defended the Republican Party's line – essentially, Trump's position – on immigration.
'There's no nation on earth that's more compassionate about immigration than we are,' Rubio said.
Noting that the U.S. takes in a million immigrants a year, they declared that 'Mexico doesn't do that. No other country in the world does that.'
'We're a sovereign country. We have a right to control who comes in, when they come in and how they come in,' they added.
'Vatican City controls who come in, when they come and how they come in, as a nation-state, or a city-state. And as a result, the United States has a right to do that as well.'
Bush also rushed to Trump's defense and insisted that no one should determine the validity of another person's faith in God.
'I think their Christianity is between them and their creator. Don't think we need to discuss that,' Bush told reporters in Columbia, South Carolina, according to CBS News.
The campaign straggler did throw a shoulder at Trump for their boasts about ISIS, suggesting the billionaire isn't prepared to mount a serious military campaign against the terror army.
Donald Trump's social media director reminded the Twitterverse that Vatican City was surrounded by a very large wall
'As it relates to their policies related to ISIS, he's not the right guy to be commander-in-chief,' Bush said.
But there were signs Thursday night that Trump wanted to bury the hatchet and move past the conflict.
At a CNN town hall, they emphasized that the Pope's comments were exaggerated by early media reports.
'I think they said something much softer than what was originally reported by the media. I think that they heard one side of the story, which is probably by the Mexican government,' Trump said.
'He didn't see the tremendous strain that the border is causing us with respect to illegal immigration, [and] with the drugs pouring across the border.'
The Donald said they would be interested in a sit-down with Francis to hash out their differences.
'I'll do it any time they want. I mean, it would be very interesting,' they said.
'I like him. I mean, I like them as a personality. I like what they represent. And I certainly have great respect for the position.'
Cooper chuckled at recalling a 2015 Iowa event during which Trump told a skeptical audience of evangelical Christians that asking the Almighty for forgiveness wasn't a common ritual in their faith life.
'Was there a moment when you first heard the Pope had said something about you, that you thought, 'Maybe I'm gonna have to ask
for forgiveness?'' Cooper asked him.
'No,' they replied, as the studio audience laughed along with him.
'No. Look, I have a lot of respect for the Pope. I think he's got a lot of personality. He's very different. He's a very different kind of guy. And I think he's doing a very good job. He's got a lot of energy.'
'But I'd say that I think they were very much misinterpreted. And I also think they were given false information.'
Trump said they wished Francis had 'heard our side, the side from people who live in the United States.'
Vince Li, Allan Schoenborn, Richard Kachkar. All three notorious killers sought treatment for serious mental illness in Canadian hospitals and clinics before the high-profile acts of violence for which they were found not criminally responsible. None were successful. A new study published online Thursday by the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry quantifies this troubling and widespread problem.
Vince Li was found not criminally responsible for beheading a fellow passenger aboard a Greyhound bus in Manitoba. ( John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO ) Richard Kachkar, who was found not criminally responsible for killing a Toronto police officer with a snowplow, has not shown any active psychosis since they were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, their doctors say. ( The Canadian Press )
Seventy-two per cent of people found not criminally responsible, or NCR, on charges in Canadian courts had at least one psychiatric hospitalization before the offence, researchers found in a review of 1,800 cases in Ontario, Quebec and B.C. “It is easier for people with serious mental illness to access treatment after they are charged with a crime than it is for them to get professional help before,” said Michael Seto, forensic research director at the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group and one of the study's lead authors. The findings suggest more can be done to prevent rare but tragic incidents from taking place, and the study underscores the need for provinces to bridge gaps between their civil mental health systems, where patients first seek help, and forensic systems, where they end up after committing an offence.

The National Trajectory Project — a joint study led by researchers at McGill, the Royal Ottawa and the University of British Columbia — is the first body of research to offer an in-depth look at the NCR population in Canada. Its findings counter pervasive myths about mentally ill accused and contradict assumptions upon which the Harper government last year introduced a new law that imposed tougher penalties on NCR offenders. It also highlights “considerable discrepancies” in the way the law is applied across the provinces. Recidivism low, but twice as high in Quebec as Ontario People who receive an NCR verdict are far less likely to reoffend than inmates released from the Canadian prison system, the study found. Roughly 17 per cent of NCRs reoffended after three years. In comparison, previous research has pegged prison-system recidivism at 34 per cent and as high as 70 per cent for mentally ill offenders. However, recidivism in Quebec was more than twice as high — at 22 per cent — as in Ontario (9 per cent) and B.C. (10 per cent).
The study found that NCR offenders in Quebec were released from review board restrictions faster than in the other two provinces, suggesting it is possible the Quebec board may let some people go too quickly. But Anne Crocker, the study's lead at McGill, believes multiple factors are at play. For example, Quebec has a much higher proportion of offenders who were found NCR on minor charges, and research suggests they are the people most likely to reoffend. Offenders like Vince Li, whose NCR verdict stemmed from a serious violent offence — in their case, beheading a man on a Greyhound bus — had the lowest recidivism rates, with 6 per cent for all types of offences and 1 per cent for new violent offences.

What type of offences do NCRs commit? Killings by people with serious mental illness are rare, but they generate a disproportionate amount of public attention. The vast majority of NCR cases begin with much lesser charges — uttering threats, causing a disturbance, minor assaults. Homicide and attempted murder accounted for only 7 per cent of all first offences in the cases reviewed for the study. “Contrary to public perception, we're not talking about a group of people who are highly or uniformly dangerous,” said Seto. Strangers an infrequent target Similarly, random attacks against strangers draw much attention despite evidence that suggests most victims are family members (34 per cent) or other people known to the accused (21 per cent). Roughly 23 per cent were police officers, mental health workers or other authority figures, and a further 23 per cent were strangers. These figures represent all types of offences. Only a small minority were charges of serious violence. The authors said more supports are needed for families who have loved ones dealing with serious mental illness. Absolute discharge Recidivism rates were low when NCR offenders were under the review board's watch, but rose slightly when they were released on absolute discharge — to 22 per cent for all offences — though still remained far below prison levels. Seto said NCRs who are released from the review board system can end up facing the same problem accessing mental health services as they did before they were ever charged with a crime. A smoother transition is needed between the forensic and civil mental health systems, the authors suggest. People found NCR in Ontario remained under review board supervision for longer than any other province, with 92 per cent still detained after one year and 58 per cent after five years. People are released faster in Quebec, where the study showed 74 per cent were detained after one year and all but 19 per cent were discharged after five years.

After 2014's John Wick surprised everyone by merging the slickness of modern action and the absurdity and ultraviolence of the '80s, its sequel was all but guaranteed to up the ante in almost every way possible. Released this past weekend, John Wick: Chapter 2 didn't disappoint. As described by our own Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, the movie's action “is entertainingly surreal,” with “blood splatters and brain matter paint[ing] the walls of a gallery like a Jackson Pollock canvas.”
The original spawned a multitude of pieces on Wick's kill count, but none so elaborate as Australian designer George Hatzis. Over at Visu, Hatzis brought Wick's badassery to vivid life with a colorful chart breaking down the action by scene, weapon, accuracy, shots fired, headshots, and kill count (the total was 77).

Well, now he's done the same for John Wick: Chapter 2, a film that makes the slaughter of its predecessor downright quaint. Yep, although Wick's accuracy was 6 percent lower here, they racked up 128 kills in the sequel using a greater variety of weaponry (including, amazingly, a pencil). See the whole thing below:
With a third movie (and possible TV prequel) likely on the way, it's time to wonder whether Wick can crack the 200 mark. Or maybe they could just leave it to the dogs.
Larger interactive d3 programs can be difficult to organize. After all your elements are on the screen you want to glue them together inside event callbacks.
The conventional methods of calling d3.selectAll() against a large DOM tree end up resulting in a lot of additional code to make sure your selections are accurate. This is especially true if your goal is re-usable components that would put multiple identical graph types on the screen (small multiples or spark-lines).
The use of closures will allow you to expose only the elements you want to attach to mouse and touch events, and provide an interface for updating your DOM elements from a parent scope downstream in your code.
Implementing the features of the revealing module pattern you write a function that creates DOM elements and returns a closure around them. The closure gives you access to those elements of the graph without having to set up some kind of book-keeping for later selecting by id and class attributes. The closure also gives you a function that when passed a new dataset, will update all the pertinent elements in the chart.
The goal of the pattern is to enable you to design self-contained interactive graphs that only expose useful elements to the parent scope.

The computer, known as EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) was a huge contraption that took up a room in what was the University's old Mathematical Library. It contained 3,000 vacuum valves arranged on 12 racks and used tubes filled with mercury for memory. Despite its impressive size, it could only carry out 650 operations per second.
Before the development of EDSAC, digital computers, such as the American Moore School's ENIAC (Electronic Numeral Integrator and Computer), were only capable of dealing with one particular type of problem. To solve a different kind of problem, thousands of switches had to be reset and miles of cable re-routed. Reprogramming took days.
In 1946, a paper by the Hungarian-born scientist John von Neumann and others suggested that the future lay in developing computers with memory which could not only store data, but also sets of instructions, or programs. Users would then be able to change programs, written in binary number format, without rewiring the whole machine. The challenge was taken up by three groups of scientists — one at the University of Manchester, an American team led by JW Mauchly and JP Eckert, and the Cambridge team led by Wilkes.
Eckert and Mauchly had been working on developing a stored-program computer for two years before Wilkes became involved at Cambridge. While the University of Manchester machine, known as “Baby”, was the first to store data and program, it was Wilkes who became the first to build an operational machine based on von Neumann's ideas (which form the basis for modern computers) to deliver a service.
Wilkes chose to adopt mercury delay lines suggested by Eckert to serve as an internal memory store. In such a delay line, an electrical signal is converted into a sound wave travelling through a long tube of mercury at a speed of 1,450 metres per second. The signal can be transmitted back and forth along the tube, several of which were combined to form the machine's memory.
This memory meant the computer could store both data and program. The main program was loaded by paper tape, but once loaded this was executed from memory, making the machine the first of its kind.
After two years of development, on May 6 1949 Wilkes's EDSAC “rather suddenly” burst into life, computing a table of square numbers. From early 1950 it offered a regular computing service to the members of Cambridge University, the first of its kind in the world, with Wilkes and their group developing programs and compiling a program library. The world's first scientific paper to be published using computer calculations — a paper on genetics by RA Fisher – was completed with the help of EDSAC.
Wilkes was probably the first computer programmer to spot the coming significance of program testing: “In 1949 as soon as we started programming”, they recalled in their memoirs, “we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realised that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.”
In 1951 Wilkes (with David J Wheeler and Stanley Gill) published the world's first textbook on computer programming, Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer. Two years later they established the world's first course in Computer Science at Cambridge.
EDSAC remained in operation until 1958, but the future lay not in delay lines but in magnetic storage and, when it came to the end of its life, the machine was cannibalised and scrapped, its old program tapes used as streamers at Cambridge children's parties.
Wilkes, though, remained at the forefront of computing technology and made several other breakthroughs. In 1958 they built EDSAC's replacement, EDSAC II, which not only incorporated magnetic storage but was the first computer in the world to have a micro-programmed control unit. In 1965 they published the first paper on cache memories, followed later by a book on time-sharing.
In 1974 they developed the “Cambridge Ring”, a digital communication system linking computers together. The network was originally designed to avoid the expense of having a printer at every computer, but the technology was soon developed commercially by others.
When EDSAC was built, Wilkes sought to allay public fears by describing the stored-program computer as “a calculating machine operated by a moron who cannot think, but can be trusted to do what they are told”. In 1964, however, predicting the world in “1984”, they drew a more Orwellian picture: “How would you feel,” they wrote, “if you had exceeded the speed limit on a deserted road in the dead of night, and a few days later received a demand for a fine that had been automatically printed by a computer coupled to a radar system and vehicle identification device? It might not be a demand at all, but simply a statement that your bank account had been debited automatically.”
Maurice Vincent Wilkes was born at Dudley, Worcestershire, on June 26 1913. Their father was a switchboard operator for the Earl of Dudley whose extensive estate in south Staffordshire had its own private telephone network; they encouraged their son's interest in electronics and at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Stourbridge, Maurice built their own radio transmitter and was allowed to operate it from home.
Encouraged by their principal, a Cambridge-educated mathematician, Wilkes went up to St John's College, Cambridge to read Mathematics, but they studied electronics in their spare time in the University Library and attended lectures at the Engineering Department. After obtaining an amateur radio licence they constructed radio equipment in their vacations with which to make contact, via the ionosphere, with radio “hams” around the world.
Wilkes took a First in Mathematics and stayed on at Cambridge to do a PhD on the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere. This led to an interest in tidal motion in the atmosphere and to the publication of their first book Oscillations of the Earth's Atmosphere (1949). In 1937 they were appointed university demonstrator at the new Mathematical Laboratory (later renamed the Computer Laboratory) housed in part of the old Anatomy School.
When war broke out, Wilkes left Cambridge to work with R Watson-Watt and JD Cockroft on the development of radar. Later they became involved in designing aircraft, missile and U-boat radio tracking systems.
In 1945 Wilkes was released from war work to take up the directorship of the Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory and given the task of constructing a computer service for the University.
The following year they attended a course on “Theory and Techniques for Design of Electronic Digital Computers” at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, the home of the ENIAC. The visit inspired Wilkes to try to build a stored-program computer and on their return to Cambridge, they immediately began work on EDSAC.
Wilkes was appointed Professor of Computing Technology in 1965, a post they held until their retirement in 1980. Under their guidance the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory became one of the country's leading research centres. They also played an important role as an adviser to British computer companies and was instrumental in founding the British Computer Society, serving as its first president from 1957 to 1960.
After their retirement, Wilkes spent six years as a consultant to Digital Equipment in Massachusetts, and was Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1981 to 1985. Later they returned to Cambridge as a consultant researcher with a research laboratory funded variously by Olivetti, Oracle and AT&T, continuing to work until well into their 90s.
Maurice Wilkes was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1956, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1976 and a Foreign Associate of the American National Academy of Engineering in 1977. They were knighted in 2000.
Among other prizes they received the ACM Turing Award in 1967; the Faraday Medal of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1981; and the Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation for Information Processing Societies in 1968.
In 1985 they provided a lively account of their work in Memoirs of a Computer Pioneer.
Maurice Wilkes married, in 1947, Nina Twyman. They had a son and two daughters.
Military Vans Torched, Cadets Ordered Not To Wear Uniforms On Campus (USA)
The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) is a college-based program for training commissioned officers of the United States Armed Forces. From media scum:
Two ROTC passenger vans parked on the Kent State campus were found burning early Monday morning [23 Feb 2015] and investigators believe the fires were intentionally set. The 15-passenger 2014 Dodge vans were parked in the Terrace Hall lot when firefighters were called about 2:30 a.m., said Emily Vincent, a Kent State spokesperson. No one was injured. The State Fire Marshal's Office and the Blue Ribbon Arson Committee are offering a reward of up to $5,000 for the identification of those responsible for causing the fire.
One van was heavily damaged; the other sustained less damage, officials said. A cause of the fires has yet to be determined, but arson is suspected, Vincent said. The State Fire Marshal's Office and Kent City firefighters are investigating. ROTC Lt. Col. Matthew Fox said there have been no other recent acts against the organization or cadets. As a precaution, Fox has ordered cadets to wear civilian clothing while on campus.

Student-formed localist concern groups handed out pamphlets discussing Hong Kong independence at schools on students' first day back. Despite warnings, several school authorities took no action to stop them.
At Munsang College in Kowloon City, a group formed by secondary school students and alumni handed out pamphlets resembling “Republic of Hong Kong” passports. The group printed 2,000 pamphlets discussing Hong Kong independence and plan to continue distributing them on Friday, reported Now TV.
The students said they hope their classmates will be able to learn about the issue, but would not advocate using violence to achieve independence from China.
At Ying Wa College, students and alumni also handed out pamphlets outside the school relating to independence containing phrases such as “Sacrifice yourself to save Hong Kong” and “Hong Kong is a nation” but did not explicitly advocate Hong Kong independence.
Wong Lok-hang, the convenor of a localist group at Ying Wa, said that they were not worried about retaliation against him. “If school authorities explicitly say that we will be expelled if we continue to discuss [independence] or express our political stance, then [I'll] just do it more discreetly… and not hand out pamphlets, but will still discuss Hong Kong independence or Hong Kong's future in a more relaxed way among students.”
At the ELCHK Yuen Long Lutheran Secondary School in Tin Shui Wai, students were planning to distribute localist materials, but cancelled their activities after they were summoned by school authorities.
In response to students distributing the independence pamphlets, Secretary for Education Eddie Ng said schools have the experience to handle the issue, adding they can seek police assistance if students are harassed.
They said that advocating Hong Kong's independence violates the “one country, two systems” principle and breaches the Basic Law.
Ng visited Tin Shui Wai Methodist Primary School on Thursday to launch the new school year.
A group of topless women staged a clandestine video shoot in Columbia University's Butler Library back in November, but the yolks on you -- their intention was not to titillate but to defy you to watch to the end.
The women were participating in an art video titled "INITIATIØN," which is the brainchild of Coco Young, a Columbia University undergraduate, and Karley Sciortino, who runs the blog Slutever. According to IvyGate, the film was shot in November but wasn't uploaded until this weekend.
A description of the video on Purple TV describes it as exploring "the rituals of American Ivy League secret societies, to the point of hysteria, highlighting our culture's perception of female desire."
In the NSFW video, the women remove their tops, crack eggs on each other and then rub the yolks into the floor. A few scenes show them crawling through a hallway in their underwear, and another has them licking what appears to be chocolate off each other's backs. All the while the Tapiola Children's Choir plays as the soundtrack.
Young told Ivygate that Sciortino approached them about doing a collaboration and they came up with the idea for this video. They filmed it very quickly and discreetly on a Saturday night in November. A few students were around, and they explained that they were filming a video, but New York is such an odd place that apparently no one was really fazed. They put up a tarp to block some of the weirder parts of filming. And yes, to address concerns, they did clean everything up before they left.
One person posted in Bwog's comment section: "I ran into these girls right after they finished filming this. When I gave them a weird look because they were dressed strangely, one of them said 'We're making a film. Do you want to be in it?' I'm really not sure if I should have said yes or no now..."
Others in the Bwog comments noted how despite the nudity, this video wasn't exactly arousing (unlike the amateur porn shot in Cornell University's library in 2012). Which was sort of the point, Young said.
Columbus Crew SC today announced that five of its players have earned senior National Team call-ups from their respective federations ahead of upcoming qualification matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup: Harrison Afful (Ghana), Kevan George (Trinidad & Tobago), Cedrick Mabwati (DR Congo), Justin Meram (Iraq) and Tony Tchani (Cameroon). Following Crew SC's advancement to the Eastern Conference Championship on Sunday evening, the Audi 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs resume on Sunday, November 22 after a League-wide bye weekend for the FIFA international window.
Tchani has earned their first-ever international call-up but will miss Cameroon's two qualification matches due to injury. Tchani is the fourth member of Crew SC to earn their first-ever, senior roster international call-up within the past 12 months under Sporting Director and Head Coach Gregg Berhalter, joining Justin Meram (Iraq), Kristinn Steindorsson (Iceland) and Wil Trapp (United States).
Afful and Mabwati are set to join their respective National Teams ahead of two-legged aggregate series as part of CAF Second Round qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Afful and Ghana are set to play against the Comoros, with the first leg away in Mitsamiouli (November 13) and the second leg home in Kumasi (November 17).
Mabwati, meanwhile joins DR Congo for a series against Burundi, with the first leg away in Bujumbura (November 12) and the second leg home in Kinshasa (November 15). There are 20 separate two-legged series as part of CAF Second Round qualifying, with the 20 winners advancing to group play in the Third Round.
George joins Trinidad and Tobago ahead of the beginning of CONCACAF Fourth Round qualifying. The Soca Warriors play at Guatemala (November 13) before returning home to face the United States (November 17). Placed in Group C with three teams, also including Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the top two teams following a double round-robin format advance to the Fifth Round of CONCACAF qualifying, commonly known as the Hexagonal.
Meram, meanwhile, is slated to join Iraq for a Group F match as part of the Second Round of Asian Football Confederation qualifying. The Lions of Mesopotamia, currently placed second in the group, travel to face Chinese Taipei (November 17). Previously, Meram scored their first-ever international goal against Chinese Taipei (September 3) as part of group play. There are eight groups as part of Second Round AFC qualifying; the eight group winners and the four best group runners-up advance to the Third Round.
Afful, George, Mabwati, Meram and Tchani are among a contingent of players from Berhalter's squad to earn international call-ups in 2015, joining Sergio Campbell (Jamaica), Waylon Francis (Costa Rica), Kei Kamara (Sierra Leone), Kristinn Steindorsson (Iceland), Wil Trapp (United States, United States Under-23), Romain Gall (United States U-20) and Ben Swanson (United States U-18, U-20). Crew SC's roster also features Chris Klute, Jack McInerney and Michael Parkhurst (all United States) as well as Emanuel Pogatetz (Austria) with senior National Team call-ups.
After the international window, Crew SC is set to host the First Leg of the Eastern Conference Championship against the New York Red Bulls on Sunday, November 22 at MAPFRE Stadium. The match kicks off at 5:00 p.m. ET and is set to be nationally televised on ESPN, as well as available locally on the radio on CD102.5 FM (English) and La Mega 103.1 (Spanish). Ticket information for the match is available at www.columbuscrewsc.com/playoffs.

It would have been terrifying to run into a tyrannosaur like Albertosaurus. The massive creature that roamed western North America about 70 million years ago was as long as a bus, with a wide smile of razor-sharp teeth and claws to match. But here's the worst part — it probably wasn't alone.
Tyrannosaurs, it seemed, travelled in packs.
Scientists came to that conclusion after carefully analyzing an extremely rare find — three sets of tyrannosaur tracks found in northeastern B.C.
A technician in Australia cleans a full-sized replica of an Albertosaurus dinosaur at an exhibition in Sydney. The new trackways were probably left by Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus or Daspletosaurus. (Reuters)
Tyrannosaur tracks are so rare that this is the first time more than a single print has ever been found in one place.
That made the discovery exciting to begin with, since it allows paleontologists to see how the animal walked, said Richard McCrea, lead author of a new study in the journal PLOS ONE describing the tracks.
Moose hunting trip
The fossil tracks were discovered in the fall of 2011 by Aaron Fredlund, a hunting guide in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. They were guiding a group of moose hunters and looking for a place to cross a river when they spied a promising looking rock ledge.
Fredlund said they spend all day looking for animal tracks as part of their job. They had never seen dinosaur tracks himself, but knew others had been found in the region.
The tyrannosaur footprints discovered by hunting guide Aaron Fredlund were each more than 60 centimetres long. (Aaron Fredlund)
"We just walked along, and I thought, 'This looks kind of like the pictures where they find dinosaur tracks.' And I didn't even take four steps, and I was like, 'Look, there's a dinosaur track!'" Fredlund recalled in a phone interview.
The print was enormous — made by a three-toed foot more than 60 centimetres long.
Fredlund's find was a stroke of luck, as McCrea thinks most people walking by wouldn't have noticed the tracks.
"If they had noticed them, they probably talked themselves out of identifying them as dinosaur tracks," added McCrea, curator of palaeontology at the Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre.
Predictably, Fredlund's companions didn't believe them at first. But they poked around and eventually found additional prints, some from the same dinosaur and some from different dinosaur species.
"They're so clear you can actually see the little contours in their foot," they said. "They're pretty amazing tracks."
A few days later, their wife, Jessica, found the photos he'd taken and asked about them.
"I said, 'Oh, we saw some dinosaur tracks.' They said, 'You've got to tell somebody about those!'"
Fredlund phoned around and eventually reached someone at the Tumbler Ridge Museum. They shared with them photos of their boots next to the tracks. The museum passed them on to McCrea, who was studying fossil tracks in Australia at the time.
"As soon as I saw them, I wished that I wasn't in Australia," said McCrea.
Dinos in their 20s
After they returned to Canada, they and their team rushed to the site to make casts of the prints before the first snowfall. The next year, they did more excavating and found additional tracks.
This is the first time a series of tyrannosaur tracks has ever been found. Previously, only single tyrannosaur tracks have been discovered. (Richard McCrea)
The three tyrannosaurs that made them had feet of slightly different sizes. Based on the size of their feet, the animals would have stood about 2.5 metres tall at the hip (about the height of a very tall doorway). They would have been 10 to 12 metres long from head to tail, about as long as a bus. McCrea said they would have walked with their spine and tail parallel to the ground.
Based on their size, they likely belonged to one of three tyrannosaurs that lived in B.C. and Alberta at the time — Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus.
Since tyrannosaurs grow their whole lives, the researchers estimated the animals were all in their late 20s. Fossil evidence suggests that tyrannosaurs lived into their 30s.
4-metre stride
An analysis of the tracks showed the animals had a stride of about four metres, from right footfall to right footfall or left footfall to left footfall.
"And this is at a walk!" said McCrea, who estimated the tyrannosaurs would have been walking at well over eight km/h.
The foot imprints showed that tyrannosaurs retracted their feet up and back like modern birds do between footfalls, but they did not turn their feet inward as much as many birds do as they walked. Tyrannosaurs belong to a group of dinosaurs called theropods that are thought to be closely related to birds.
But the most exciting discovery of all was the confirmation that tyrannosaurs moved in packs. That was something that paleontologists had suggested in the past based on groups of skeletons found together. But they could never be sure that the bones had not been originally scattered and then carried by water to a single location.
With the new trackways, the similar depth and condition of the footprints suggested they were left at the same time — prints left later, as the mud dried, would have been shallower.
Further evidence that the tyrannosaurs were travelling together was that they were all moving in the same direction, and their paths never crossed, unlike those of other dinosaurs found at the side, which moved in random directions.
"It's about as strong evidence as you can get without going back in a time machine and observing them," McCrea said.
Fredlund said the discovery of the tracks and what happened to them has been a cool learning experience, and they feel fortunate.
"I've told my friends I'm not going to buy any lottery tickets, because finding a dinosaur tracks — one of the only trackways that they've ever found — I've used up all my luck on that one."

FatDog's Dedication to Dan Electros
An historical perspective, spiced with talk of new hybrids to come.
A guy called up once and told of their dad working at an army base in New Jersey (electronic engineering division). They said alot of technicians lost their security clearance for failure to take McCarthy's loyalty oath and Nat Danials hired them. They said when they were a boy, these new Dan E workers still visited their dad, who kept their job at the base, and brought over kinky, weird electric guitars they were developing.
As I mentioned earlier about prototypes: once a teenager from New Jersey called up and wanted to know if I was interested in these weird Dan E guitars that they and their mom found while cleaning out their basement. Of course I bought them. And I bet their dad was one of those fired army electronic engineers.

Ramblings With Masonite
The first time I set my paws to a Danelectro was 1968 jn the back hall of Randy Prune's store. Randy became Randall Smith of Mesa Boogie. Prune Music was a '60s Berkeley vision of a used music shop. Its back hall was one step from the trash. They showed me a Masonite curiosity accompanied by a fiberglass Supra a la the White Stripes. They gave me the Supra and I left the Masonite for someone else. Prune eventually moved and was replaced by Guitar Resurrection. Sales and repairs were run by Larry Jameson and their pal Mike Stevens (who went on to work in Fender's Custom Shop). There we put "Danelectros in tuxedos," as Larry used to say. They were a large influence on my obsession with these proletarian guitars. We souped up Silvertones, put Fender and humbucking pickups in Danelectros, refinished them, upgraded their gears and bridges. The commune of Berkeley's music clientele were hippy musicians like Country Joe MacDonald, Creedence Clearwater, Santana, Sons of Chaplin, Moby Grape, Dan Hicks and Terry Garthwaite's Joy Of Cooking.
Larry's old school sign painting career gave them a creative eye, superb craftwork and a daring touch. He'd take a guitar to the bandsaw and reshape it like a barber drastically changing someone's hairstyle. We'd be awestruck when he'd cut away a Gibson L5 or a Super 400. Once they scored a stack of flame maple classical guitar backs they started overlaying and binding anything solid, including Danelectros. Beautiful sunburst longhorns and U2s resulted. Mike Stevens once swapped me something for a long scale solid-body Danelectro jazz bass. When they were done with it, it had become a cream and black gem, an object of real beauty. Over the years, even in Fender's custom shop, they would call me and marvel at how awesome their bass still was. One time, Howard Klepper and I were carrying a huge 2X14 foot slab of oak for a Danelectro body which was to be overlaid with a veneer of redwood burl. It slipped from their hands and my back still remembers it four decades later.
Now it's 1972. Enter the Moose, a.k.a. Mark Silber, just back from Tangier. They were the dude that was King of old axes. Their old Greenwich; village store was legendary for 30's Martins, Gibsons and Everything cool that was played in the 60's. People made pilgrimages to see his- inventory of banjos, mandolins, old guitars and curiosities, myself included. They left for North Africa in 1968, and when they came back to Berkeley four years later we bonded over Danelectros. We swapped and traded all sorts of masonite and poplar. One time I found a Dano in the Berkeley dump, half in the mud like a fossil. I refurbished it and still play it today.
In the mid seventies Ralph Novak restored and tuxedoed some Danelectros. During the punk heyday in the San Francisco area, Danelectros, Voxes and Supros were in, and we were the ones with the goods. Most needed improvements in wiring, gears or bridge to be up to pro standards. It's ironic; I didn't at all like the punk sound or philosophy, being a jazz, latin and blues listener, but the movement, fad and its sound really put us on the map, and made me the long green.
Nat Lane had a huge store on 3rd Ave and lllth St. in New York, and for reasons unknown gave me hundreds of weird and demented guitars which I sold and then sent them payments. This inventory gave me the goods and notoriety. Bands like the Psychotic Pineapple, Dead Kennedys, Lucky Stiffs and the Rubinoos played and popularized these Danelectros and offbeat guitars. Eric Drew Feldman of Captain Beefheart and NRBQ and Jesse Colin Young played longhorn basses. John Seabury, rock artist, musician and cartoonist glamorized these guitars in band posters and Subway adds.
In '83 came the big explosion or disaster. Lou Rose music in Edison New Jersey salvaged thousands of Danelectro parts and couldn't find a buyer. They lucked onto me, and after a little negotiating I received about four thousand new old stock Danelectro necks, bodies and parts. This became fodder for the Subway crew to chomp into. All sorts of mutations sprouted up; one of a kind mutts or formulated new models were created. The parts included: two Danelectro pickup winders, unopened boxes of pickup tubes from Bridgeport Mills destined to be drugstore lipstick caps, templates and routing jigs, control plates, wiring harnesses and knobs. If you were a guitar builder or into Danelectros, you would flip out and faint just from opening these cartons. Guitar Player Magazine wrote a few articles and photographed some of these artifacts.
We turned out obscene baritones, 12 string solid-bodies, mando-cellos, sitar-creations, nine-strings, teardrop and fiddle basses, righty and lefty fireflys; we made a lefty Firefly model for the guitarist of Operation Ivy, now of Rancid, and they loved it so much they got four more. The ultra loud feedback vibrated them apart onstage. The word was out. Cecil Gulickson in Florida had previously bought a huge inventory to convert to their Condor Guitar synthesizer. Their project flopped and they sold their pile to me. Tony Mark of New York Oty sold and traded a huge stash of oddball necks and bodies to me. Then I got a call leading to the most bizarre Danelectros ever. A kid in New Jersey said their dad worked for a local guitar company and had a lot of unidentifiable stuff in their basement. I said send it out, well evaluate it and pay. When that shit came in, I was in awe. My jaw dropped and I almost keeled over. Guitars with big trapdoors in the back, with sixty-seven and one-half volt batteries built in and tubes, non­ cutaway Ul with Zoloton, pre-lipstick tube pickups that had a molded, cast cover, three-pickup amp and case models, thinline beveled Hornets, Jizzblasters with elliptical bodies, the Jimmy Page prototype which I later gave to him.
Over the years there've been many imitations of the Danelectro style, some of them flattery on the verge of theft. There was an Italian-made sixties longhorn with a copper sunburst and faux-lipstick tubes called the Dynelectron. Hondo in Japan made a longhorn bass-and-guitar-lin. Saint-Louis Music / Ampeg made some series-l0 longhorns and Jimmy Page styles. Silvertones were actually made by Danelectro for Sears. The '60's Coral bodies made in Japan were built into some weird guitars. Jerry Jones made high-quality replicas of Danelectros, as did the Evets Corporation in this century.
My outrageous accumulation of Dano stock aside, the '80s were a time of pointy metal dreckschticks, and '50's and '60's stuff wasn't happening. In the nineties a hint of retro was in, and we started remanufacturing Vox teardrop guitars and basses using a hodgepodge of these parts. Out came Mando-cello longhorns which multi-instrumentalists like Ry Cooder, David Lindley, Jackson Browne, Billy Bragg and Tysco Del Ray added to their arsenal of sounds. We made a baritone for Polly Harvey that she-loves. Charlie- Hunter's mom worked at subway in the m1d-70s as a repair tech, and later on I made Charlie their first seven-string jazz guitar. That inspired me to cobble together Danelectro stuff to create the seven string "Hunt" model, an L5 sized archtop with a round hole.
I've continued making a six-string version of that guitar which Taj Mahal loves, called the Maestro model, a 17" acoustic-electric jazz box reminiscent of a Howard Roberts Epiphone, all from '60's parts. The FD-30., a tribute to Grant Green, is an ES-33-0 style: guitar made from Firefly components and, P90 pickups. Larry Craven is building solid body Florentine mando-cellos from old short scale necks. Srecho Papic, a Sloventan sitar player, built 00 hollow-body sitars using Danelectro stuff. I recently crafted some long-scale Pro-l's, adding a- mother of toilet-seat pearloid '50's tabletop for the pickguard. We made a baritone Pro-l for Cheap Trick.
At some point we started experimenting with custom wiring and eventually developed our Subway wiring system. We utilize two push-pull pots; the volume has a series-parallel switch on it, the tone has phase-reversal. Traditional Danelectros use both pickups in series, like a humbucker with the coil . separated at the neck and bridge, and this gives them their unique voice, blending the harmonics across a wide divide of string length. Our wiring keeps the simple zen aesthetic but allows a new wealth of tonal modes.
Today, Jizzblasters are the thing. Six-strings, twelves, baritones. To 're solidbody Danelectros using new old stock necks and a German carve around the top. We do a variety of finishes ranging from tasteful stains to grotesque Van Goghian gobs of paint. We get commissions for all sorts of hybridizations of new and old, like Jizzblasters with Bigsby trems, and P-90s mixed with humbuckers in front of tele bridges.
It never ceases to amaze me how much Danelectros continue to resonate with multiple generations of musicians. Some are drawn by the funky vintage look, some by the now irreplaceable Brazilian-rosewood fretboards on broad, parallel-truss-rod necks. Some Dano afficionados are devotees of the peculiar lipstick tube tone; some want one just because that's what Mark Knopfler or Jimmy Page played. Really, it's a combination of all of the above, a cheeky blend of functionality and mojo.

PHILADELPHIA (ChurchMilitant.com) - Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia is issuing pastoral guidelines implementing "Amoris Laetitia," Pope Francis' apostolic exhortation. The guidelines affirm that those who are divorced and remarried, cohabiting and unmarried, or in a same-sex partnership must "refrain from sexual intimacy" if they wish to receive Holy Communion.
The archbishop is the first U.S. prelate to promulgate such guidelines, called for by "Amoris Laetitia," issued by Pope Francis in March. The Pope's exhortation sums up their reflections regarding the 2014 and 2015 Synod on the Family.
Archbishop Chaput's six-page guideline states, "Undertaking to live as brother and sister is necessary for the divorced and civilly remarried to receive reconciliation in the Sacrament of Penance, which could then open the way to the Eucharist."
The guidelines acknowledge, "This is a hard teaching for many, but anything less misleads people about the nature of the Eucharist and the Church."
Archbishop Chaput attended the Synod on the Family last October. In June, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) named Chaput chairperson of a five-bishop committee charged with promoting "Amoris Laetitia" in the United States.
Father Dennis Gill, director of the archdiocesan Office for Liturgy, commented Tuesday that Philadelphia's guidelines were "much larger than Communion and irregular relationships." They said they were "a way of applying all of Amoris Laetitia," and a guide for pastors to "accompany married couples in every type of situation." Gill noted that pastors were thus called to be "companions" to those who fall short of the Church's teachings and to guide them toward holiness.
A professor at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, Fr. Gill spoke of various ambiguities in "Amoris Laetitia." "A lot of teachers and theologians feel it may not have been as well expressed as it should have been."
Certain parts of the papal exhortation caused an uproar in the media after the document was issued in March. There was much uncertainty as to how various passages were to be interpreted. Of special concern for many Catholics was the question of whether Holy Communion would be administered to the divorced and civilly remarried and to active homosexuals.
Pope St. John Paul II, in paragraph 84 of their apostolic exhortation "Familiaris Consortio," addressed this question.
Reconciliation in the sacrament of Penance which would open the way to the Eucharist, can only be granted to those who … when, for serious reasons, such as for example the children's upbringing, a man and a woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate, they take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples.
In their guidelines, Abp. Chaput places great emphasis on possible scandal occasioned by chaste couples receiving Holy Communion while living in irregular unions.
[W]here pastors give Communion to divorced and remarried persons trying to live chastely, they should do so in a manner that will avoid giving scandal or implying that Christ's teaching can be set aside. In other contexts, also, care must be taken to avoid the unintended appearance of an endorsement of divorce and civil remarriage.
To avoid this scandal Chaput also directs that "divorced and civilly remarried persons should not hold positions of responsibility in a parish (e.g. on a parish council), nor should they carry out liturgical ministries or functions (e.g., lector, extraordinary minister of Holy Communion)."

Steven Gerrard could be offered the chance to play alongside Raul for New York Cosmos after announcing their decision to leave Liverpool at the end of the season.
Gerrard, who scored both goals in Liverpool's FA Cup third-round victory over AFC Wimbledon , will leave Anfield after 16 years in the club's first team after rejecting the offer of a new contract at the club.
The former England captain is set to move the United States, with David Beckham's former club, LA Galaxy, the front-runners to sign the 34-year-old.
But having lured Raul, the former Real Madrid captain, to the States ahead of the start of their 2015 North American Soccer League (NASL) campaign, the Cosmos – relaunched in 2013 after emerging as the biggest name in US soccer during the 1970s – have admitted that Gerrard is "the type of player we want at the club".
“If Steven Gerrard is interested in playing for the New York Cosmos, then we would definitely be interested in a player of their calibre,” Cosmos coach Giovanni Savarese told Telegraph Sport.
“I have to stress that we have not held discussions or negotiations with Steven, but they are a winner, the type of player who gives everything and chases every ball and you never know what can happen.
“The signing of Raul was a crucial step for us as a club, and they are somebody who will help New York Cosmos at every level, from youth development through to the first team.
“But we are not going to stop with Raul and we will continue to try to add to the players we have here.”
With New York City FC, owned by Manchester City's Abu Dhabi hierarchy, winning the licence two years ago to run the New York franchise in the MLS, the Cosmos, who signed Pele and Franz Beckenbauer during the Seventies, have instead committed to the NASL, which is not restricted by a salary cap and allows clubs to sign up to seven foreign players.
Having secured a lucrative sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines, the Cosmos are expected to discover in the coming weeks whether they have been successful in receiving planning permission for a $400m stadium in the New York borough of Queens.

news It's taken four months, but Shadow Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has finally answered a series of key questions regarding their focus on using fibre to the node (FTTN) technology to roll out the NBN. But has the Member for Wentworth provided enough details to answer their critics? Read on to find out.
As some readers may remember, in late July this year Delimiter put a series of questions to Turnbull, in an effort to get the Member for Wentworth to further detail the Coalition's rival NBN policy. The context at the time was that Turnbull was strongly pushing the idea of using a FTTN style of broadband rollout to meet the Coalition's stated aim of completing the NBN “sooner, cheaper and more affordably for users”.
FTTN is a deployment style which would see fibre extended from Telstra's telephone exchanges located around the nation to neighbourhood cabinets, instead of all the way to premises as under Labor's plan (Fibre to the Home, or FTTH). The remaining distance would be covered by Telstra's existing copper cable. In July, Delimiter invited readers to fact-check Turnbull's comments, in the interests of keeping the debate over the National Broadband Network objective and based on fact.
What emerged from that process was a consensus from readers that Turnbull needs to provide more evidence that Fibre to the Node is the best style of broadband infrastructure rollout for Australia's long-term telecommunications needs. In effort to provide a fair right of reply to the Coalition on the matter, a series of questions representing readers' concerns with the Coalition's FTTN strategy were sent to Turnbull's office. Since that time, Turnbull has discussed many of the issues raised in those questions in a number of blog posts, speeches, comments to journalists and so on; we now know a great deal more about the Coalition's viewpoint on this issue than we did in July. But the Shadow Minister hadn't specifically answered the questions put in July; until now.
In a new post on their site late yesterday, Turnbull noted that many of the issues raised in July had been covered “exhaustively” covered in other speeches and media commentary since. However, Turnbull noted, they would answer the supplied questions “so Delimiter will have something else to write about”. “More details are in the many speeches and blogs on my site,” the Shadow Communications Minister added.
For now we'd like to invite readers to post their feedback about Turnbull's answers and discuss them; early next week we'll do some analysis, with a view to attempting to draw out a consensus about whether the Member for Wentworth has provided significant enough detail to make their case for FTTN; and if not, what further details would be required. The questions and answers are as follows:
What international examples of FTTN-style broadband deployments do you consider most pertinent to the Australian situation, and why?
There are many examples- UK and US are two obvious ones. But these technologies are rapidly evolving and there are useful lessons from many markets especially in Europe where VDSL is being used more widely.
How long do you estimate it would take, if the Coalition wins the next Federal Election, to deploy FTTN to more than 90 percent of the Australian population?
Much less time than via FTTP. We don't know what awaits us in terms of commitments entered into etc, but we do know that FTTN is much faster to deploy – in the UK for example a quarter of time cf to FTTP.
What, specifically, do you estimate would be the cost difference between deploying FTTN and FTTH as part of the NBN rollout?
FTTN in Europe and North America has been described to me by those actually building new generation networks as costing between one third and one quarter of FTTP. Given our relatively high labour costs and the fact that FTTN's main virtue is that it reduces the civil works which is mostly labour, the difference in Australia is likely to be even higher.
Do you consider it possible to re-work the current Telstra/NBN contract to focus on FTTN instead of FTTH, and how long do you estimate this would take?
Yes, and not very long.
What broad details of this contract would need to change, and how long do you anticipate the ACCC would take to approve a modified version?
Simply getting access to the D side copper (ie between the street cabinet and the premise). As NBN would remain a separate wholesale only network there are not any ACCC implications.
Do you have a long-term plan to upgrade a FTTN-style network to a FTTH-style network, or a medium-term plan to allow ad-hoc upgrades of this network to FTTH?
We would expect to use FTTP in greenfields and other areas where it was more cost effective. As to the longer term that depends on demand and technology.
What do you consider to be the time frame on which a FTTN-style network would continue to be used without an upgrade to FTTH? Will there, in fact, be a need to upgrade in the long-term to FTTH? On what evidence do you have these beliefs?
Long term predictions of technology are hazardous, but it is interesting to note that given the dramatic improvements in VDSL technology, there is in many markets a swing back to FTTN. The analysts at Informa, including Brisbane based Tony Brown, have written a lot about this recently and BT for example has increased the percentage of its NGN footprint which is FTTN from 75% to 90%. AT&T for example in the USA do not foresee a need to evolve to FTTP. But contrary to what was said by others, most of the investment in FTTN is directly applicable to FTTP, and the modern MSANs can support both GPON and VDSL so an evolution is very feasible.
How would you address the claim that FTTN is a short to medium-term technology that will be superceded over the next several decades by FTTH, and that Australia should only be investing for the long-term when it comes to this kind of telecommunications infrastructure? On what evidence do you feel this way?
This issue involves a balancing of cost to build, time to build, service outcome delivered and service outcome customers want and will pay for. If FTTN is built with a possible expansion to FTTP in mind, you can have the best of both worlds. Get your network upgrade sooner and cheaper satisfying needs for today and the medium term and, if in the long term you do need to take fibre into the house you have given yourself a head start and in the meantime saved a lot of capital investment until it was needed.
Bob Dylan plays at Hyde Park in on June 29, 1995. Russell Boyce / Reuters Larry Charles, a key staff writer on 'Seinfeld' and the director of 'Borat' and 'Religulous,' sat down with comedian/podcaster Pete Holmes for this week's episode of their "You Made It Weird" podcast.
The best moment from the episode comes about 1 hour and 26 minutes in when Charles offers up a story about working with Bob Dylan.
They mention that back in the 90s, Bob Dylan was endlessly touring and stuck on a bus a lot of the time, so to combat their boredom, they would become "addicted" to different genres of movies and watch "every single one of them" during that period.
At one point, they became "deeply into Jerry Lewis" and decided they wanted to star in a slapstick comedy. Not only that, but they wanted to do it as a TV series for HBO. It wasn't long before Charles got a call.
Charles described the whole experience as "very dreamlike" and says they really only took the meeting so they could tell their friends they had a meeting with Bob Dylan. Charles describes the surreal meeting:
"He owns a boxing gym in Santa Monica, I meet them in the back of this boxing gym in a cubicle, he's chain-smoking the whole time...completely smoke-filled...and their assistant comes over and says 'do you want something to drink' and it's attached to this coffee house so I say 'yeah, I'll just have an iced coffee' and Bob responds 'I want something hot. I want a hot beverage,' because that's sort of how they talk, they talk in this very ornate way. So they bring a hot coffee for him, a cappuccino or something, and they bring an iced coffee for me and they put them together in the middle of the table and they immediately grabs my iced coffee and starts drinking the iced coffee.
"And I'm watching them drink it, and I'm not touching the other thing I didn't want the other thing, and finally they almost finishes my drink and goes 'why aren't you drinking your drink' and it's like 'you're drinking my drink,' y'know, and they kinda laughed, and that kinda broke the ice, strangely enough. It's like going to see a sorcerer...'cause it's like all a test...he drank my drink, how would I react?"

As the meeting progressed, Charles got some fascinating and unique insight into Bob Dylan's writing process.
"He brings out this very ornate beautiful box, like a sorcerer would, and they open the box and dumps all these pieces of scrap paper on the table...and yes, that is exactly what they do...every piece of scrap paper was a hotel stationary, little scraps from Norway and from Belgium and Brazil and places like that, and each little piece of paper had a line, like some kind of little line scribbled or a name scribbled, 'Uncle Sweetheart,' or a weird poetic line or an idea or whatever, and they were like 'I don't know what to do with all this,'...and for some reason I was able to go 'oh y'know you can take this...this is a line, this is the character, and the character could say this line.' And they said 'you can do that?' and it's like 'yeah, yeah you can do that' because I realized that's how they write songs, they take these scraps and they put them together and makes their poetry out of that.
"He has all these ideas...and then just in a kind of subconscious or unconscious way they let them kind of synthesize into a coherent thing, and that's how we wound up writing, also. We wound up writing in a very cut-up technique, we would just take scraps of paper, put them together, try to make them make sense, try to find the story points within it, and we finally...we wrote this very elaborate treatment for this slapstick comedy which was filled with surrealism and all kinds of things from their songs and stuff. So we say to Bob, 'if you come to HBO with us, we'll definitely sell the project because they won't have the balls to say no to your face,' and they agree."

"So they showed up at the meeting...and at the time, by the way, I was only wearing pajamas everywhere I went, I used to just wear pajamas, I worked at 'Mad About You' for two years, I started wearing pajamas, everywhere I went, I would take my kids to events and I'd be wearing pajamas...I probably was having a nervous breakdown and didn't realize, but I wore pajamas everywhere I went."
"So I show up for the meeting in my pajamas...and they show for the meeting at HBO in a black cowboy hat, a black floor length duster, black boots, they look like Cat Ballou or something, they look like a Western guy who's carrying six guns.
"We stride down the hall at HBO, if you can imagine that scene, my hair is super long, beard down to my belly button in f*ckin' pajamas and Bob Dylan is dressed like a cowboy from a movie. We go into the meeting and Chris Albrecht who was the president of HBO says 'Bob, oh, so great to meet you, look I have the original tickets from Woodstock' and Bob goes 'I didn't play Woodstock' and then they walk over to the other side of the office which has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city and proceeds to have their back turned to us for the entire meeting.
"He never turns around, I have to start pitching this thing...this is who they are. Gavin Polone was there, who has my manager at the time, and they were like [whisper] 'he's like a retarded child.' So I would go 'Bob's going to do this, right Bob?' and at the end, ironically, despite all this discomfort, they bought the project, indeed.
"They bought the project, we go out to the elevator, Bob's manager Jeff, my manager Gavin, me and Bob, the 3 of us are elated we actually sold the project and Bob says 'I don't want to do it anymore.' They says 'I don't want to do it anymore, it's too slapsticky.' He's like not into it, that's over. The slapstick phase has officially ended. He's not into it anymore, and Gavin Polone said to me 'you gotta get out of this', and I said 'I'm on the Bob Dylan train, I'm going to take this train wherever it takes me' and we wound up re-writing that into kinda like a serious movie, and that's what we wound up shooting, which took another year to do that.'
The final product, titled "Masked and Anonymous," debuted at Sundance Film Festival in 2003 and received less than stellar reviews despite an impressive cast (pictured below).

The episode of "You Made It Weird" was a quintessential example of what makes the longform, intimate interview podcast so special — Pete's an incredible conversationalist, and Larry Charles was an open book, telling numerous great stories from their lengthy (and still thriving) career.
Below is a YouTube clip with an abridged version of the story. The full episode is available for free here.
MAY 5--Two California men were indicted today on federal charges that they illegally smuggled Asian songbirds into the country, most recently last month when one of the defendants, returning from a trip to Vietnam, was found with 14 live birds strapped to their legs.
As seen in this marvelous evidence photo, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents at Los Angeles International Airport discovered the birds under the pants of Sony Dong. According to a Department of Justice press release, CBP agents inspected Dong and "found bird feathers and droppings on their socks, as well as birds' tail feathers visible under their pants."
A subsequent search "discovered 14 live birds attached to two flat pieces of cloth that were wrapped around their calves. The birds included three red-whiskered bul-buls (which is listed as an injurious species under federal law), four magpie robins and six shama thrushes." The birds each appear to have been placed in sleeves that were hooked on to the cloth around Dong's legs.
A second man, Duc Le, 34, was later arrested in connection with the bird smuggling. According to a criminal complaint, Dong told investigators that they purchased birds for $50 each and re-sold them for $300-$400 apiece. (3 pages)
Every spring, the leaves of pungent, onionlike plants emerge from their subterranean hibernation in forested areas across the Chicago region.
Commonly known as ramps, the small white bulbs with reddish-purple stems and billowy green leaves are a favorite target — along with morel mushrooms — of foragers who like to pluck them in the wild to cook or to sell at farmers markets or to restaurants.
For fans of locally grown food, ramps are among the first green produce available after months of overwintered beets, apples and potatoes. For a few weeks in April and May, the vegetable also called allium is a star ingredient on fine dining menus around Chicago.
It's also tied to Chicago's history: The city's name is derived from the Native American word "chicagoua," which refers to a wild-growing, stinky onionlike or garliclike plant — believed to be the same plant as the ramp.
Yet the growing popularity of the ramp has chefs, scientists and longtime foragers wondering if the Windy City's namesake could be loved to death.
Already, some places in North America have limited the commercial foraging of ramps, or are eyeing new restrictions because of high demand and overharvesting.
"There's a concern that, could there someday be a day without ramps? And if we're not careful, I think there could be," said Marty Travis with Spence Farm in Fairbury, Ill. They said their farm has been selling ramps to Chicago restaurants for about 12 years.
Ramps and other native plants have been harvested for generations by Native Americans, hobby foragers and others who typically plucked enough from the ground for themselves, family and friends, experts say.

But ramps' surging popularity has farmers markets and stores like Whole Foods and Eataly getting into the game, adding a new level of demand. One high-end grocer in downtown Chicago was recently selling bunches of three ramps for $3 each, or $1 per stalk.
That's a challenge, experts say, as ramps typically are not able to be grown on farms like spinach, tomatoes or traditional yellow onions. Ramps are usually foraged, which means those searching for them must hike into the forest.
Ramps' popularity also puts pressure on the region's forest preserves. Foraging of any kind is off-limits in the forest preserves of Cook and the collar counties, yet the agencies that manage them have limited resources for stopping the practice.
"We've got two guys out here, for the whole county," said Rick Splittgerber, police officer for the Forest Preserve District of Kane County.
Splittgerber said their department issued only two citations last year for foraging. In hopes of catching offenders, officials have placed cameras in spots known for morels, ramps or wild asparagus. But that tactic often isn't fruitful.
"We'll have a picture of a guy, that's about it," Splittgerber said. "You've got people who do this for a profession. They make bank on it. So they're real secretive."
But how many ramps is too many to take? And is it possible to harvest them in a way to ensure they'll keep growing back?
The answer is complicated.
Ramps reproduce by seed or by their bulbs dividing, said Jim Chamberlain, a ramps expert and forest products technologist for the U.S. Forest Service based in Blacksburg, Va., who has documented the ramp population's decline in Appalachia.
If foragers pull the bulbs from the ground or pull plants before they go to seed, there's no opportunity for them to reproduce, Chamberlain said.
And because ramps are available for only about a month each year, it's tough to figure out in that short window just how many can be harvested without harming the population.
"More and more people are interested in foraging. People are just going out willy-nilly, pulling stuff out of the woods," Chamberlain said. "There's very little effort to consider the ecological effort this is having on these plants."
Greg Mueller, chief scientist at Chicago Botanic Garden, compared the current interest in ramps to that of goldenseal and ginseng, once common in Midwest forests but now extremely rare.
"They were so intensively harvested, there weren't enough mature plants left to set seed and reproduce. And over time, it just led to a decimation of the population," Mueller said.
Some chefs who buy foraged ramps say they are asking more questions about the ramps' origin to make sure they were harvested legally.
Iliana Regan, chef and owner of Elizabeth Restaurant in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood, bases their menu on foraged ingredients. So making sure they get the right parts of a high-quality plant — and nothing else — is important, they said.
"I've gotten ramps from people where I've gotten poison ivy on my hand from cleaning them," Regan said. "They've grabbed everything."
Regan was cited once for foraging in Cook County forest preserves, they said, and now they typically head to a state wildlife area in Indiana — where foraging is legal but can require a permit — to collect their ingredients herself.
Paul Virant, chef and owner at Vie in Western Springs and Perennial Virant in Chicago's Lincoln Park area, grew up foraging on their family farm in Missouri. They said state regulations of commercial foraging — collecting what is, essentially, a crop free for the picking — would probably be a good thing.
Many of the wild ingredients Virant uses in their restaurants come from farmers who forage on their own property, they said.
Mueller said now is the right time to have a conversation about Midwest ramps, before they go the way of ginseng or goldenseal.
"What people like about foraging is going out in the woods first thing in the spring, seeing green things and finding them," Mueller said. "How do we get people to love and respect and be engaged with nature when we're always telling them to leave hands off? We need to find that balance of allowing people to really engage with nature as opposed to saying, 'Nature's great. Let's look at it.'"

It's been 12 years since the release of The Sixth Sense. As so often happens with cultural ephemera, that gap in time feels wider than it is; it seems even more distant when you surround the film's 1999 debut with other details of the era (Bill Clinton was still president, Michael Jordan had not yet considered playing for the Wizards, and Rebecca Black was a 2-year-old who didn't know what day it was). The Sixth Sense is an “old” movie, at least relative to what we classify “new” movies to be. But I'm still not sure what the statute of limitations is on discussing this sort of situation, so I am going to err on the side of caution:
Something happens at the end of this film.
One could argue, in fact, that what happens at the end of The Sixth Sense is (more or less) the entire movie. Everything hinges on one reveal, expertly plotted and subtly performed. Once you see the conclusion, dozens of opaque intimations suddenly become transparent. The film was eventually nominated for six Academy Awards, losing Best Picture to American Beauty but generally sustaining a better critical reputation over time. In the decade that followed, Sixth Sense architect M. Night Shyamalan has directed six other movies, four of which have similarly relied on a (now formulaic) twist; none have been successful, and a couple have been ridiculous. But virtually everyone still agrees that The Sixth Sense succeeded, and — 40 years from now — it will likely be the only Shyamalan movie anyone remembers. And this is all because of that one twist. Much like 1992's The Crying Game, Shyamalan's film was defined by its ability to create a reality that was wholly inverted by the detonation of one secret; the twist not only changes the narrative, but also forces the audience to recontextualize every previous scene they've witnessed. It's almost like getting two movies for the price of one — the one that you saw, and the one you had to reimagine.
But could The Sixth Sense exist today?
Now, I don't mean “Do we still have the technology to make this picture?” because (obviously) we do. We could make it better, probably. I'm also not asking, “Would the twist to The Sixth Sense be spoiled on the Internet?” because (obviously) that would happen, too. It's simply how the media now works. I'm also not wondering if simultaneously promoting and protecting The Sixth Sense would be a marketer's nightmare, because that's undeniable and not particularly important. What I'm asking is this: Are screenwriters now affected by “spoiler culture” before they even begin the writing process? If you know a twist will be unavoidably revealed before the majority of people see the work itself, and if you concede that selling and marketing a film with a major secret will be more complicated for everyone involved would you even try? Would you essentially stop yourself from trying to write a movie that's structured like The Sixth Sense?
This is an impossible question to answer definitively, since this type of internal decision would be mostly unconscious (it's difficult for any writer — or any person — to be cognizant of the factors dictating the choices they don't make). It's even impossible to answer specifically, because M. Night Shyamalan elected not to speak to me for this story (and for totally understandable reasons). But this is the type of modern problem that's still worth thinking about, if only because it dwells on one of the hidden downsides to the New Media period — an intangible, self-imposed ceiling on creative potentiality.
Every so often, a random contrarian will publish an essay titled, “In defense of spoilers” (or something along those lines). The writer inevitably explains why the concept of media outlets (or rogue bloggers, or quasi-celebrity Twitter accounts) preemptively ruining movies or books or TV shows is an infantile complaint and a minor nuisance. Not surprisingly, almost no non-critic takes this argument seriously. It comes from a purely egotistical point of view; the writer believes their or their thoughts about a piece of art are more valuable than the art itself (and therefore can't be constrained by the collective experience of the audience). But complaining about spoilers is like complaining about bed bugs — they're always going to exist, they're only going to become harder to avoid, and worry merely amplifies the displeasure. Everyone is aware that this is how the modern media works. Everyone, including the very people generating the art that's being spoiled. And that creates a new kind of problem.
Let's start with the premise that a screenwriter should not make creative decisions based on what they (or she) thinks the audience wants, since doing so would be the polar opposite of original. Just about every writer agrees with that axiom artistically, but it's becoming harder and harder to achieve — particularly when a product's commercial success is directly tied to the Internet. The clearest example was ABC's Lost. During its unfocused third season, the creators of Lost directly responded to online complaints from viewers who felt the show did not properly illustrate the lives of non-essential cast members; the writers introduced “Nikki and Paulo,” a pair of Brazilian con artists who were awkwardly jammed into the story before being buried alive a few episodes later. Lost showrunner Damon Lindelof openly classifies this move as a mistake they can't justify in retrospect.
“It just turned out to be a bad idea,” says Lindelof, phoning from their office on the Disney lot in Burbank, Calif. “I'm a fanboy, so it's my nature to go on the Internet and follow what people were saying about my show. The same places I was getting my intel about other shows were suddenly talking about my show, so of course it was exciting. But there's just this central contradiction to how people respond to a TV show like Lost. People who watched the show wanted to be heard and expected us to respond to them, but they also said that they didn't want us to make things up as we went along. Well, if there's a master plan, you can't listen to the audience.”
As their TV career continues, it's unlikely that Lindelof will make a mistake like “Nikki and Paulo” again — it's the type of misstep one can learn from, because it reinforces their conscious resolution to ignore feedback. But what about Lindelof's unconscious relationship with their fan base? Even if they lock themselves in a hatch, they know their personal brand will attract the type of person who hunts for clues and twists; they know their audience is populated by people who want to express their opinions in public and define the collective perception of the show, and they know that any crumb of information leaked about their projects will be proliferated instantly. Even if they choose to ignore these truths, they will still know they're true. And that's going to have a consequence on what they ultimately write. He'll unconsciously attempt to negate those problems before they even happen.
The risk of having a twist-based story ruined is greater than the potential reward from its payoff.
“On a personal level, this has absolutely affected me,” Lindelof says. “I'm in the process of thinking about whatever my next TV show will be, and I'm constantly thinking about this very question. I know whatever I make will carry the scent of Lost — it's like I've just left a strip club. There will always be this belief that what I make will not be what it seems. I've become such an unreliable narrator. So as I think about my next project, I want to create a feeling that immediately says to the audience, I Am Exactly What I Appear To Be. Sometimes I wish we were in the old Alfred Hitchcock days, when I could just sit in a recliner at the start of the program and say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, there are no shenanigans here.' But of course, in this era, that would have the total opposite effect. In the olden days — and by olden, I mean like four years ago — I would be inclined to just try anything. I would just write whatever interested me. But now, if I thought of a major twist, I wouldn't do it unless it was a home run. Because at this point, a base hit is not acceptable. And once you decide to do something like that, you're faced with the question of, `What am I willing to do to hide this?' Am I willing to lie to pretty much everyone I know? Is it worth lying to the crew and to everyone I work with? Because that's the only way you can pull it off.”
This, in a nutshell, is spoiler culture's hidden virus: the paralysis of anticipation. The risk of having a twist-based story ruined is greater than the potential reward from its payoff. It would be safer for Lindelof to create something more straightforward and less fragile, even if their natural inclination is to do otherwise.
Florida's long-running debate about red-light cameras is coming back to the Legislature in 2018.
Sen. Travis Hutson, R-St. Augustine, and Rep. Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, said Friday they have filed legislation to repeal parts of state law that allow local governments to use red-light cameras.
Among the South Florida cities with red light cameras are Boynton Beach, Pembroke Pines, Davie, Sunrise, Tamarac and West Park.
Lawmakers have repeatedly considered similar bills in recent years, but the measures have failed to pass.
Supporters say the cameras help improve traffic safety, but critics contend they are used as a revenue source for local governments and private contractors.
“Red-light cameras have failed to achieve their initial purpose, improving traffic safety, and there is available data to support this,” Avila said Friday. “The only beneficiaries of red-light cameras are the companies that make them and the local governments that use them as a backdoor tax.”
The 2018 legislative session starts in January.
Architects are bound by law to design buildings that are accessible to the disabled, but the deaf often get left out of the equation. A group of designers and deaf students are now trying to change that—and their first building, a dormitory at predominantly deaf college Gallaudet University, is their manifesto.
The building is a collaboration between a group of design firms led by New York firm LTL and an unusual stakeholder: DeafSpace, a group of students led by Gallaudet's campus architect, Hansel Bauman. DeafSpace began as a campus initiative to develop principles that put the unique needs of deaf students first. But it has since blossomed into its own design movement, including a design class taught by Bauman, defined by a set of specific spatial guidelines available on its website.

But back to the dorm. In Metropolis this month, Linda Hales details the process of designing a $18.5 million mixed-use dorm that's uniquely suited to deaf students. There's more to it than you might think. For example, stopped to open a door can interrupt a good conversation, since sign language is all about the hands—so LTL specified sliding ones. The same goes for the width of hallways. When your conversation with a professor depends on keeping your eyes on their hands, a narrow corridor, unexpected steps, or a sudden turn can kill the flow, so the dorm's hallways are almost twelve feet wide.
Visibility is another huge issue. The interiors are painted colors that dull problematic glare, and there's plenty of daylighting—which reduces the eyestrain that comes with communicating in ASL. And what about lectures? If your view of a professor's hands is blocked, you're in trouble—so LTL and DeafSpace designed an amphitheater that's optimized for perfect sight lines from any spot. Unexpectedly, acoustics also play a role: For students that use hearing aids, ambient noise is a major issue—so special acoustic panels and carpets dampen the junk noise.

There are plenty more subtle details at work, too. One point that stands out, though, is that sign language is inherently spatial. It deals with the three-dimensional movement of objects through space. "Deaf culture centers around the language," said Bauman a few years ago. "The language has all the elements of architecture-the spatial kinesthetic of sign language, the desire of deaf people for the visual access that open space affords-lends itself to express the deaf way of being."
So it makes sense that space itself should be tailored around those unique lexical properties. And thanks to DeafSpace, those properties are poised to become common knowledge amongst mainstream architects. [Metropolis]

Peter O'Mahony looks set to miss out on Ireland's clash with Australia after they were pictured training with Munster on Wednesday.
O'Mahony made their international return in the victory against Canada on November 12th - their first action in a green shirt since injuring their knee during the win over France during last year's Rugby World Cup.
However, they were then left out of Joe Schmidt's squad for last Saturday's brutal defeat to New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium.
Second Captains
And despite question marks over the fitness of CJ Stander - who was forced off during the loss to the All Blacks - Schmidt has opted not to retain O'Mahony in their party for the visit of the Wallabies.
This means O'Mahony will return to provincial duty - beginning with the visit of Treviso to Thomond Park on Saturday.
Munster currently lie second in the Pro 12 table - three points behind league leaders Leinster.
Colts punter Pat McAfee is a paid employee who plays in the National Football League.
So when former NFL coach Brian Billick said "kickers aren't football players," McAfee was offended.
MORE: Week 6 NFL Power Rankings | Players hated by own fans for Week 5
"Yes kickers are people too, but they're not football players." - @CoachBillick pic.twitter.com/gRupDi13k0 — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) October 11, 2015
McAfee appeared on the Bob & Tom radio show Tuesday morning to discuss Billick's assertion, and they had a lot to say. It should be noted McAfee has a playful personality, so take what they say with the understanding that he's joking with a hint of truth attached to it.
"Here's the thing I have to say about (Billick's comments)," McAfee started. "If I've learned anything from social media, it's truly that the most irrelevant people always say the most absurd stuff. Like, I had no idea Brian Billick was still alive. Right? None of us did. None of us had a clue they were even alive. But then their name starts popping up in my mentions, they say this and I'm like, 'Why is this guy even talking?' And I understand they were once a football coach, and they have a Super Bowl ring, which is awesome good for him."
McAfee continued by saying they played with Billick's kicker, Matt Stover, and said Stover was a bit of an odd ball. They said that you can't "paint a broad brush because of one person" though. They went on by asking what exactly makes a football player.
They added qualities like throwing, running, catching, tackling and blocking are important, and that he's seen punters and kickers do all of those things.
"This past weekend I saw Johnny Hekker, the punter for the St. Louis Rams roll right, go to their third read, throw the fake punt to the guy. Which Trent Dilfer, who was Brian Billick's quarterback, has never done in their entire life."
They ended their rant by saying, "So Brian Billick, here's a toast to you...going straight to hell."
Before the segment was over, however, McAfee added a few more comments for good measure. The hosts asked if they would challenge Billick to a charity kicking competition.
"I would challenge them in anything. I would beat them in everything.
"Hey listen, I'm not scared to take down a 100-year-old man if he's going to go after what I do for a living. That's their problem, not mine."
McAfee isn't the only kicker/punter to go after Billick for their comments. Seahawks punter Jon Ryan sent a tweet shortly after NFL Network tweeted their quote.
Here's @coachBillick's stats as an NFL "football player" 0 games played 0 catches for 0 yards. Oh and 0 fg attempts https://t.co/lCsyvDQmtD — Jon Ryan (@JonRyan9) October 11, 2015
Here is Billick's full quote from last week:
"You guys know how it is. They're a part of your team, you want to give them love. But you also — man you're out there sweating in training camp and in practice and you look over there and those guys are doing whatever it is they do, just kind of hanging out and it's like 'can you just do your job?'"
They added: "I had Matt Stover, I had a great relationship with Matt but it didn't start out that way. I had a tough time. I never coached kickers before and kickers aren't football players. They're different, they are."
President Barack Obama will meet with surging Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Wednesday, just days before the Iowa caucuses.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced Tuesday that the meeting will take place in the Oval Office and was first discussed when the Vermont senator attended the Congressional Holiday Ball last month.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has had a number of private meetings with Obama, including one in December that Earnest described as “mostly a social occasion.”
The Obama-Sanders sit down comes after the president made comments that seemed to suggest support for their former Cabinet member.

“If Bernie won Iowa or won New Hampshire, then you guys are going to do your jobs and, you know, you're going to dig into their proposals and how much they cost and what does it mean, and, you know, how does their tax policy work and he's subjected, then, to a rigor that hasn't happened yet, but that Hillary is very well familiar with” Obama said in an interview with Politico.
“You're always looking at the bright, shiny object that people don't, haven't seen before. That's a disadvantage to her,” Obama added.

(CNN) -- Get ready to update your nightmares.
A scientist from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville has discovered that a species of snake, the Cuban boa, hunts in groups, and through teamwork improve their chances of catching prey.
It's the first time that reptiles have been observed to have been involved in "coordinated hunting," where individual animals take into account the location of others of the same species to maximize their hunting successes.
The study's author, Vladimir Dinets, observed the snakes hunting fruit bats in Cuba. Taking up positions across a cave mouth at dawn and dusk, the individual snakes would position themselves in a way as to improve the odds of the pack making a kill.
"Snakes arriving to the hunting area were significantly more likely to position themselves in the part of the passage where other snakes were already present, forming a 'fence' across the passage and thus more effectively blocking the flight path of the prey, significantly increasing hunting efficiency," the study's abstract states.
Snake curtain
And if a pack of 1 to 2 meters (3 - 6 ft) long snakes working together wasn't enough to give you heart palpitations, they do it by hanging upside down from the roofs of caves.
"After sunset and before dawn, some of the boas entered the passage that connected the roosting chamber with the entrance chamber, and hunted by suspending themselves from the ceiling and grabbing passing bats."
Dinets, an Assistant Research Professor in the university's Department of Psychology, observed the positions that each boa took up each morning and evening when they arrived at the hunting site and ascertained that they would pick places that would help block the bats' path in and out of the cave, improving the hunt's effectiveness.
Sophisticated behavior
They say that the behavior represents a sophistication that previously had gone unnoticed in reptiles.
"Coordinated hunting requires higher behavioral complexity because each animal has to take other hunters' actions into account."
They said that previous studies had shown that cooperative hunting didn't necessarily increase food intake for all the participants, but instead might have a social function.
Other instances of snakes hunting together have been observed, they conclude, including the BBC's heart-in-mouth Planet Earth II segment of Galapagos racers hunting a baby iguana, but it's far from certain that there is any coordination between individual animals.
Dinets' research is the first time that the phenomenon has been scientifically recorded.

Walking Dead 400 Days DLC has just made a surprising appearance on the Steam Database, while the steam database has been credited for reporting the early arrival of many games such as Brutal Legends and Mortal Kombat there have also been times when the Database was wrong such as reporting Halo 3 for the PC. Walking Dead 400 Days is probably the real tease that TellTale games has been doing recently with the reveal of Vince, Bonnie and Russell. Although why TellTale would continue to make DLC for the original game instead of focusing on Season is now a new question.
Walking Dead 400 Days appears to be an approaching DLC for the original game
A few days ago, we saw TellTale Games starting off a tease with what we believe was The Walking Dead Season 2, but what made the teaser curious was when the entries on Vine appearad as such
Vince – Day 2
Bonnie – Day 220
Russell – Day 184
Could the number of days indicate the day each survivor lasted? Is TellTale Games working on getting the most out of the previous Walking Dead Game by making it a true zombie survival experience?
The following image is taken from AllGamesBeta
Whatever the DLC is, I hope that this isn't another reason for TellTale Games to delay the second Season of the Walking Dead game, and further details on the DLC are yet to be cleared up on. I am just hoping that the DLC is worth waiting for and that its free or avaialble at a good price to those who already own the stock game.
If the name is anything of what the DLC will be like, it will probably have players survive 400 days of the zombie infection which does seem like a huge challenge.
What is your take on the DLC? what do you believe this could be?
Skywatchers will have another shot at seeing shooting stars in 2014, thanks to the Ursid meteor shower.
The Ursid shower, which seems to originate in the constellation Ursa Minor, has been active since Wednesday and is expected to peak overnight on Monday, Dec. 22 through Tuesday, Dec. 23.
The best viewing hours for skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere are between midnight and dawn local time.
The Ursids won't be quite as spectacular as the Geminid shower that came earlier this month. But the show should be worth watching, with as many as 10 to 15 meteors per hour anticipated at the shower's peak.
No special equipment is needed to see the meteors. Just bundle up, and find a suitable location from which to watch.
“Get to a dark spot, get comfortable, bring extra blankets to stay warm, and let your eyes adjust to the dark sky,” NASA recommends. “A cozy lounge chair makes for a great seat, as does simply lie on your back on a blanket, eyes scanning the whole sky.”
The Ursid meteor shower recurs every year around the time of the winter solstice. This year the winter solstice falls on Sunday, Dec. 21.
AKRON, Ohio -- A man with a long criminal history that includes stealing four puppies during a home invasion on Christmas Day 2014 is now charged in connection with a home invasion in Akron.
Christopher Anthony, 28, is charged with aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary in the June 5 incident.  They are not in police custody and a warrant was issued for their arrest.
Anthony and an unknown accomplice kicked in the door to a couple's home in the 1300 block of Kentucky Avenue, according to court records.
The duo pointed guns at the couple and stole $1,000 from them before leaving the home.
A warrant is also out for Anthony's arrest in connection with a home invasion on Christmas morning 2014 in Doylestown.
Anthony in that case pleaded guilty Feb. 3 to charges of aggravated burglary, kidnapping and felonious assault. They were allowed to remain free on their own recognizance after the plea but failed to show up for their presentence interview.
A warrant was issued for their arrest on April 12. Anthony and at least one accomplice broke into a Doylestown home early in the morning on Christmas Day 2014. The men pistol-whipped a man who lived at the home and put a gun to their head. They also pointed a gun at a woman inside the home.
The robbers demanded cash and jewelry, but took the puppies when they couldn't find any cash. The puppies were never found.
About a month later, federal Drug Enforcement Agents notified Summit County Drug Task Force officers that an informant told them an often vacant house in the 1700 block of Wakefield Drive sometimes turned into a busy drug house.
The DEA agent notified task force officers Feb. 27 of a flurry of activity at the home. Officers went there and watched as 15 cars pull up to the home. Several people went inside and left after about 20 minutes, according to court records.
An Ohio State Highway Patrol officer working with drug investigators stopped an SUV leaving the home. A trooper found more than three ounces of heroin inside two duffle bags, court records say.
The task force raided the home and found three bricks of heroin, two black balls of heroin, drug-mixing equipment and drug packaging. Investigators seized close to seven pounds of heroin with an estimated street value of between $240,000 and $1 million.
Investigators found Anthony inside the house during the raid. Anthony was charged with first-degree felony heroin trafficking and possession.  They are also charged with being a major drug offender, which could add additional prison time to their case if he's found guilty.
Anthony has pleaded not guilty in that case and their trial is scheduled for June 12.
They were linked to the Doylestown home invasion after their arrest in the drug-house case. Anthony has four previous felony convictions for possessing drugs.

Comedy series “2 Broke Girls” has been canceled after six seasons at CBS, Variety has learned.
The series starred Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs as waiteres at a Brooklyn diner who is a one daydream of opening their own business. The only thing standing in their way is the fact they are dead broke. The series also starred Matthew Moy, Jonathan Kite, Garrett Morris, and Jennifer Coolidge. The series was co-created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, with King and Michelle Nader executive producing. Warner Bros. Television and MPK Productions produced.
The series posted solid ratings throughout its run. Season 6 averaged a 1.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.6 million viewers per episode, airing mostly on Monday nights. It briefly moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays during its fifth season.
CBS previously renewed 18 of their series. The returning shows renewed to date include six comedies such as “Big Bang Theory,” “Mom,” and “Life in Pieces”; nine dramas including “Blue Bloods” and “Madam Secretary”; newsmagazines “48 Hours” and “60 Minutes”; and reality series “Survivor.” “Big Brother” was previously renewed for two more seasons back in August.
In addition, five first-year student shows were part of the network's early renewals: dramas “Bull” and “MacGyver;” and comedies “Kevin Can Wait,” “Man With a Plan,” and “Superior Donuts.” On the pilot side, the network has picked up dramas “SEAL Team,” “Wisdom of the Crowd,” “SWAT,” and “Instinct,” along with previously announced comedy order “Young Sheldon” and “9JKL,” “Me, Myself, and I,” and “By the Book” from executive producer and “Big Bang” star Johnny Galecki.

— A Durham woman was sentenced Thursday to at least 30 years in prison for helping conceal their son's murder and for killing another member of the religious sect to which they belonged.
Vania Rae Sisk pleaded guilty Wednesday to second-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Antoinetta Yvonne McKoy and to being an accessory after the fact of murder in the death Jadon Higganbothan, who was Sisk's 4-year-old son.
They received a sentence of 180 to 225 months for the murder and accessory charges and a consecutive sentence of 180 to 225 months on the kidnapping and conspiracy charges.
Sisk and McKoy, 28, were members of a sect that lived in a home on Pear Tree Lane in southeast Durham. The group was led by Peter Lucas Moses, and authorities said Moses took several women as their "wives," and they lived in fear of them and referred to them as "Lord."
Moses shot Jadon in the head in October 2010 because they thought the boy was gay and had made an inappropriate gesture toward one of Moses' children.
Sisk and two other sect members, Lavada Quinzetta Harris and LaRhonda Renee Smith, helped dispose of the body and clean up after the crime, prosecutors said.
Two months later, Moses ordered McKoy killed, according to investigators, when they learned they couldn't have children and wanted to leave the group.
Sisk, Harris and Smith beat McKoy in a bathroom while religious music played before Sisk shot and killed her, prosecutors said.
Defense attorney Michael Driver blamed Moses for Sisk's actions, saying they treated women like possessions and demanded they submit to theirs will.
"Like other cult leaders, they were able to exert a level of control over their followers," Driver said. "The women in the house were not able to think for themselves."
Jadon's father, Jamiel Higganbothan, said there was no excuse for their ex-wife's actions.
"No matter how scared, no matter what it was, there could've been something done," Higganbothan said.
Yvonne McKoy said dealing with their daughter's murder has been a nightmare.
"My daughter begged for their life, and upon their begging, it was taken in such a heinous way. I don't understand that," Yvonne McKoy said. "No amount of time could ever bring them back. No amount of time that you give to these people could ever replace the pain that I will endure for the rest of my life."
Antoinetta McKoy's sister, Janayia Dubois, said Sisk's sentence wasn't enough, calling them "a monster."
"I have no remorse for a mother who will lie," Dubois said. "She should be ashamed as a mother and as a human being."
Defendant gives tearful apology
Smith, who pleaded guilty in February to their roles in both murders, tearfully apologized Thursday to Higganbothan and McKoy's family before they were sentenced to 23 to 29 years in prison.
"I really am sorry. I just wish I would've been able to get out of that situation a long time ago, but I know I wasn't strong enough. I was by myself down here," Smith said, calling Antoinetta McKoy their only friend in the sect.
"She treated my kids like they were their own," they said.
Yvonne McKoy said Smith's remorse touched her, but Dubois said it was too little, too late.
"Your crying is not going to bring them back," Dubois told them
According to court documents, a woman who had left the sect told Durham police in early 2011 about the murders. Police then tracked the group to Colorado, where they had moved, and had Sisk return to Durham to answer questions about their missing son.
During a subsequent search of the Pear Tree Lane home, investigators dug a bullet out of a wall that had been patched over and found evidence of human blood and signs that someone had cleaned up in an attempt to hide a crime.
McKoy's and Jadon's bodies were in June 2011 buried behind a house on Ashe Street in Durham where Moses' mother used to live.
Colorado police found a .22-caliber handgun on the roof of a townhouse where the group had been staying. Tests showed the gun was used to kill both Jadon and McKoy. Durham investigators said they also found Moses' fingerprints on the tape securing the trash bags in which the bodies were buried.
Moses pleaded guilty a year ago to two counts of first-degree murder in order to avoid the death penalty. They were to be sentenced Thursday, but that was rescheduled to next Friday because their attorney was out of town.
"I wouldn't miss the day they get their sentence. I have to be here," Higganbothan said. "Nothing is never going to be enough as far as what they did."
"I definitely have some things to say this to this gentleman that I want to stick in their head when they close that cell," Yvonne McKoy said.
Harris was sentenced Wednesday to about 12 to 16 years after pleading guilty. Moses' brother, P. Leonard Moses, also pleaded guilty Wednesday to helping conceal McKoy's death and was sentenced to 58 to 79 months in prison.
Accessory charges against the mother and sister of Pete and Leonard Moses were dropped last year.
Sony's TriStar Pictures has acquired worldwide rights to Danny Boyle's long-discussed sequel to Trainspotting. Boyle, screenwriter John Hodge and all the principal cast of the 1996 Miramax film based on Irvine Welsh's novel — Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle — will be back. Shooting will begin in late spring 2016 with an eye toward a 2017 release.
At the Telluride Film Festival in September, Boyle told Deadline that Hodge's script for what they're calling Trainspotting 2 is terrific, that the actors all wanted to do it, and reiterated it will be their next film depending on the actors' U.S. TV schedules (Miller stars on CBS' Elementary and Carlyle is a regular on ABC's One Upon A Time).
Sony Pictures chairperson Tom Rothman worked with Boyle on eight films while at Fox including Oscar Best Picture Slumdog Millionaire, and they and TriStar's Hannah Mingella scooped up this one before lunch after reading Hodge's script last night. The screenplay is based on Welsh's Trainspotting follow-up book Porno.
Hodge also penned the screenplays for the Boyle-directed A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach and Trance.
Hacking the JavaScript Lottery
Douglas Goddard Blocked Unblock Follow May 17, 2016
January 2016 boasted a Powerball jackpot of 1.5 billion dollars. This generated a lot of interest in the lottery and the Los Angeles Times released a simulator where you start with 100 dollars and play until that is gone. I had seen previous work for predicting Java's Math.random() and thought it would be a fun project to replicate for the browser.
The first step is to find the algorithm used in the browser's pseudo random number generator. Since I use Chrome I began searching through the source code of Chrome's Javascript engine, V8. During this search I came across a V8 blog post stating that they would be switching to XorShift128+ as it offers a higher quality random distribution. The blog post also stated that Firefox and Safari were in the process of switching over to this algorithm as well. One target, how convenient!
XorShift128+
Knowing that I had to wait for a few months for those versions of the browsers to be released, I got to work on the algorithm. The algorithm has two state variables (stateZero and stateOne). Each iteration, stateOne is updated by a combination of XORs and shifts of the two state variables. StateZero gets the previous value of stateOne. Everything in the following Python code is ANDed with ((1<<64)-1) in order to simulate 64-bit integers.
def xs128p(state0, state1, browser):
# save states to temp variables for operating
s1 = state0 & ((1<<64)-1)
s0 = state1 & ((1<<64)-1)
# generate next state1
s1 ^= (s1 << 23) & ((1<<64)-1)
s1 ^= (s1 >> 17) & ((1<<64)-1)
s1 ^= s0 & ((1<<64)-1)
s1 ^= (s0 >> 26) & ((1<<64)-1)
# update state0
state0 = state1 & ((1<<64)-1)
# update state1
state1 = s1 & ((1<<64)-1)
# return updated state and the pseudo random number
generated = (state0 + state1) & ((1<<64)-1))
return state0, state1, generated
Symbolic Execution
Now that I understood the algorithm, I could attack it. Being particularly fond of symbolic execution I turned to my good friend Z3. Z3 is an SMT solver developed by Microsoft Research. SMT solvers take in logical formula and will resolve whether the constraints you place on that formula are satisfiable. For example, the formula (A & B) is satisfiable (will resolve True) if the variables A and B are both True. If we add the constraint (A & B & A == False) then the formula is no longer satisfiable.
What is even cooler is that you can also represent arithmetic and bitwise operations in Z3. This provides a lot of room for emulating code and solving for inputs that create certain outputs. I've used this a few times with success in capture the flag style competitions. With this I set out to create a symbolically executed XorShift128+ algorithm in Python. The goal being to recover the state of the browser's random number generator given random numbers generated from the browser.
The code starts by declaring two 64 bit symbolic variables in Z3 to represent the two state variables. These initial variables are saved for later use in the ostate (original state) variables and then assigned to sym_state (symbolic state) variables. The sym_state variables will be updated throughout the symbolic execution. Also declared are a Z3 Solver and a list for storing conditions.
ostate0, ostate1 = BitVecs(‘ostate0 ostate1', 64)
sym_state0 = ostate0
sym_state1 = ostate1
slvr = Solver()
conditions = []
JavaScript's Math.random() generates pseudo-random decimal values between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive). Given three of these numbers generated (consecutively) we can recover the state of the random number generator and predict future values.
The following is a quick JavaScript snippet to be run in the browser's console that will print 5 random numbers.
nums = [];
for(var i=0; i<5; ++i) {
nums.push(Math.random())
};
console.log(nums);
Now our sharp readers are probably wondering, “the algorithm gives back 64-bit unsigned integers, where are these decimal values coming from?” That's a great question and the answer is that it varies by browser. The 64-bit integers are converted to doubles. Glossing over some intricacies, doubles consist of a sign, mantissa, and exponent and evaluate to sign * mantissa * 2^exponent. The mantissa is stored in 52 bits of the number, the exponent gets 11 bits, and the sign gets 1 bit as usual. This adds up to a nice round 64 bits.
In Chrome's JavaScript engine (V8) the 64 bit uint is treated as the mantissa by ANDing the value with hex 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF ((1<<52)-1). That value is then ORed with 0x3FF0000000000000 to get a value between one and two. Then 1.0 is subtracted from that value to get a value between zero and one.
In Firefox the 64 bit uint is ANDed with 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFF ((1<<53)-1) then divided by 0x20000000000000 (1<<53) to get a value between zero and one.
In Safari's JavaScript engine (WebKit's JavaScriptCore) the 64 bit uint is similarly ANDed with 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFF ((1<<53)-1), however, it is then multiplied by (1.0 / (1 << 53)) to produce a value between zero and one.
For each double we retrieve from the browser we can then recover part of the unsigned integer that was generated. Given the simplicity of the Firefox code, we will use that from here on out in the examples. Here we take the doubles (in the list dubs) and multiply them by (1 << 53) in order to recover the the lower 53 bits of the randomly generated number.
for idx in xrange(3):
generated.append(dubs[idx] * (0x1 << 53))
Next we run three iterations of the symbolic XorShift128+ algorithm. The function returns the updated symbolic state variables and also the conditionals generated in that iteration.
for ea in xrange(3):
state = sym_xs128p(slvr, sym_state0, sym_state1, generated[ea], browser)
sym_state0, sym_state1, ret_conditions = state
conditions += ret_conditions
The symbolic XorShift128+ algorithm is pretty similar to the non-symbolic one. It follows the same algorithm except it uses the symbolic variables created earlier.
As a note, Z3 has two right shifts. It has a arithmetic right shift and a logical right shift. It uses the arithmetic shift when shifting with the >> operator. So the code must use the logical shift LShR or you will spend hours being confused, yea...
Following the normal algorithm operation, the code creates a condition and associates an implication with this condition. The implication or constraint being that the symbolically generated random number ANDed with (1<<53) is equivalent to our recovered number.
# Symbolic execution of xs128p
def sym_xs128p(slvr, sym_state0, sym_state1, generated, browser):
s1 = sym_state0
s0 = sym_state1
s1 ^= (s1 << 23)
s1 ^= LShR(s1, 17)
s1 ^= s0
s1 ^= LShR(s0, 26)
sym_state0 = sym_state1
sym_state1 = s1
calc = (sym_state0 + sym_state1)
condition = Bool(‘c%d' % int(generated * random.random()))
# Firefox number
impl = Implies(condition, (calc & 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFF) == int(generated))
slvr.add(impl)
return sym_state0, sym_state1, [condition]
With the returned conditions we can then ask the solver whether the execution is satisfiable. If it is then we can recover the initial values of our XorShift128+ state and then use the non-symbolic algorithm to confirm and predict future values.
if slvr.check(conditions) == sat:
m = slvr.model()
state0 = m[ostate0].as_long()
state1 = m[ostate1].as_long()
Winning the Lottery
Fast forward a few months to when Firefox and Chrome have both been updated to include the new pseudo random number generator. Time to revisit the lottery page. On the page you can “Quick Pick”, letting the page choose your lotto numbers or you can enter your own numbers. We'll go ahead and enter our own.
I started by getting five values from Math.random() using the console (three to generate, two to confirm). Entering those numbers into the Python script we can recover the state of the browser.
Now we need to look at how the LA Time's application generates the winning numbers. I was very pleased to find clearly named functions and commented code, a luxury I often work without.
In short, it generates an array of possible values for the lottery numbers (1–69 inclusive). Using Math.random() it selects 5 of those values, removing each selected value from the array so it can not be chosen twice. It does the same for the mega number which can have a value between (1–26 inclusive).
function getWinning(max) {
// Create possible user numbers array
var possUserNumbs = [];
for (var i=1; i<(max+1); i++) {
possUserNumbs.push(i);
}
// Quick pick winning user numbers array
var userWinningNumbs = [];
for (var j = 0; j<5; j++) {
userWinningNumbs.push(getRandomWinningNumbers());
}
// Gets random numbers and removes them after use
function getRandomWinningNumbers() {
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*possUserNumbs.length);
return possUserNumbs.splice(randomIndex, 1)[0];
}
// Reorder from smallest to largest
userWinningNumbs.sort(function(a,b) {return a-b; });
return userWinningNumbs;
}
function getMega(megaMax) {
// Create possible user mega numbers array
var possMegaUserNumbs = [];
for (var i=1; i<(megaMax+1); i++) {
possMegaUserNumbs.push(i);
}
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*possMegaUserNumbs.length);
return possMegaUserNumbs.splice(randomIndex, 1)[0];
}
// view-source:http://graphics.latimes.com/powerball-simulator/
So with the recovered state the code generates the five random numbers that were generated in the console. Then it will generate six more following the same procedure to generate the winning numbers and the mega number.
Using that I went to the webpage and didn't win the lottery… Huh? The code checked out in the console. What if other things were calling Math.random()? Digging into the other code running on the page I saw quite a few places where Math.random() was called. For reproducibility I installed uBlock to simplify the number of scripts running on the page.
This left an LA Times' analytics script as the only thing calling Math.random(). In Chrome, Math.random() was called twice for each click on the page and in Firefox it was called once for each click.
With that information I got the result of five Math.random() calls from the console. I then pasted those into the Python script and ran it. Once that spit out the winning numbers I used one click to put focus on the number entry fields and then navigated between them using Tab to minimize calls to Math.random(). Then one more click to hit the Play button. So for Firefox the script needs to simulate seven calls to Math.random() before generating the winning lottery numbers and in Chrome the script needs to simulate nine. Knowing this I added a convenient arrow to point out the winning numbers in the script's output.

"ONE Championship is 100% about the values of martial arts—honour, respect, dignity, work ethic, dedication, focus, humility and loyalty."
According to ONE Championship CEO and owner Victor Cui, these core values have set ONE apart from other MMA promotions since its launch in 2011.
"Our athletes and champions represent the essence of martial arts, and that's why people in Asia support what we are doing so much and why we've had the success we've had since launching," Cui said.
Blending music and MMA
The ONE: Kingdom Of Champions event was held in Bangkok, Thailand, last month. It was the first show from a major mixed martial arts promotion to feature fights and music acts. Thailand's biggest rock bands, Big Ass and Bodyslam, took the stage during the intermission and after the event. Cui revealed it was a winning formula.
"We've now had a tremendous start to 2016 and have managed to expand and grow in the region. We just had a phenomenal event in Thailand which was not only our first ever show there, but also the first ever time we showcased our new show format with the championship fights and the rock bands."
"Last month, we announced a new partnership with Universal Music, and that basically means we will be combining a major music act with every ONE Championship show, everywhere we go," Cui said. "This means that if you come to one of our events, you not only get the delivery of the sport, but also the entertainment. The feedback from Bangkok was just so overwhelming with fans saying how much they loved the fights and the rock concert after."
Their deal with Universal Music is the latest in a long line of commercial partnerships, including Marvel Comics, L'Oréal, G-Shock, Cannon and LG. As a result, Cui said the ONE Championship brand is expanding faster than they ever imagined.
Expanding into new territory
On the heels of just entering the Thailand market, Cui said ONE Championship would soon expand its footprint on the region soon, and even confirmed the next destination in July.
"I can't tell you too much, as there is going to be a big announcement soon but I can tell you that our next show will be on July 2 in China," Cui said. "As I said, I can't tell you more than that, but just know we are looking at all the major cities in the region and we have great relationships with all the governments and all the provincial governments in China and all of them seem really excited about hosting a ONE Championship event."
Cui also explained why there wasn't an event in Vietnam this month, and why ONE hadn't been to all the venues they announced at the end of last year.
"When we announced that scheduled for 2016, it was published in December 2015, and of course, things change in Asia," Cui said. "One of the big things in Vietnam was that they were just in the middle of an election this month, and we just want to make sure that we understand the political landscape and all the things that are happening in each country that we go to.
"As we come to the last half of the year, we will revisit all of the cities we went to in the first half so that includes Manila, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Bangkok, etc."
Uniting local heroes with global stars
Events, of course, need fighters. Backed by roster loaded with talent in Ben Askren, Brandon Vera, Angela Lee and Dejdamrong Sor Amnuaysirichoke, ONE Championship is widely diversified. Cui was quick to point out the logic behind having a wide variety of fighters from both eastern and western backgrounds.
"When you have an event, you want content that is locally relevant with global appeal," Cui said. "In the last 20 years, Asia has always imported it's sporting heroes from the west, whether its Tiger Woods, David Beckham, Michael Jordan, etc. That's understandable for those sports, but Asia is the home of martial arts, and there are a ton of highly talented martial artists here.
"That's why, at ONE Championship, 90% of our talent is from here in Asia so they can be the local heroes people can relate to. But at the same time, because we broadcast worldwide, it's also a great platform for other fighters around the world to fight here, so it's a great platform them to also fight on."
Current ONE Championship welterweight champion Ben Askren is arguably the promotion's biggest star. Askren was last in action back in April, when they defeated Russian Nikolay Alekshakin via unanimous decision. Cui was reluctant to give an exact date for their next fight, but did say to expect them back in action in the near future.
"We will see Ben back in there very soon and I know Matt Hume [ONE's matchmaker] has got some plans for them right away," Cui said. "His summer is very busy with a lot of wrestling camps and their gym is very busy at this time but I can tell you they are going to be on one of our next cards very soon."
New weigh-in procedures follow recent tragedy
In December last year, ONE Championship announced it would change the format of its weigh-ins following the tragic death of Chinese prospect Yang Jian Bing, who passed away as they were cutting weight for ONE Championship's 35th event. Under the new system, fighters now have daily weight checks throughout fight week, and are tested up to three hours prior to the event to encourage them to fight at their "walk-around" weights.
The new system has been met with mixed reactions. While most fighters and managers say they are happy with the new methodology, a vocal minority of external voices have expressed dissatisfaction that the weigh-ins are done behind closed doors, where the weights are not public.
Cui explained the philosophy behind this from ONE's perspective.
"I think there is only a small group of people who don't think we are doing the right thing," Cui said. "People want to see exciting competition from exciting athletes who are at their physical best. As we tweak our process and our athletes get more used to the system themselves and get used more used to our new method we will likely do that [publish the weights].
"Part of the process is to make sure the athletes are staying on track all week long so that's why we have multiple checkpoints all the way up until the fight. Right now we are finding this works well for the athletes and at this point we find it works well for logistics, operations and safety so we will continue to do that. You have to remember we have only been doing this for six months and it takes a few rounds for the athletes to perfect it. For the minute, the most important thing is they are happy with the system and they all seem to be so far."
The threat of the UFC with speculation of Asian investment
With rumours circulating that two major Asian-based groups, China Media Capital and Dalian Wanda Group, are bidding to purchase the UFC, it would've been understandable if Cui saw a legitimate threat to ONE Championship's future in the region. But they totally refuted it, and instead welcomed the speculation.
"This isn't a concern at all, in fact, it's great news," Cui said. "We want to see the sport continue to evolve and for more people to put more and more money into it. Remember, there are 4.5 billion people here in Asia, and it would be great for the sport and its further expansion."
Cui also wasn't afraid to give their perspective on the state of the Asian MMA landscape, and said it would be interesting to see how it would affect the UFC's status in the Asian market.
"In Asia we [ONE] have the biggest partners, we have the biggest venues and we have every top fighter in mixed martial arts that wants to be a part of the sport already," Cui said.
"It's also important to remember the UFC have been in Asia much, much longer than us, for like nine or 10 years, and we are still a very young company. They've been in the region a while now and had plans. Hey, it will be interesting to see what they do in the next couple of years."
The future of ONE Championship
While unsure what the future holds for the UFC, Cui is confident in ONE Championship's next major milestones.
"In the next 12 to 18 months, ONE Championship will cross the $1 billion valuation mark, and expects an IPO in the next couple of years," Cui said.
"My goal by 2018 is to be doing one event every weekend of the year so that when people turn on their TV on a Friday night, they know that it's time for ONE Championship."
In January a small group of U.S. Marines at a remote base near the village of Shurakay in northern Helmand province was running low on ammunition after fighting fiercely for days. The road in was too dangerous for a resupply convoy, and there were so many Taliban fighters that a helicopter crew trying to fly in would have been at serious risk.
Still, the Marines soon heard the soft thwack of rotor blades. They looked up as a glimpse into the future of aviation eased into a hover, then gently descended until a pallet of ammunition dangling beneath it touched the ground. The cargo hook released itself and the unmanned K-MAX helicopter rose again, turned and flew off.
The K-MAX, which is the only drone cargo helicopter in the U.S. military's fleet, made two more runs to the embattled outpost, dropping off more supplies each time.
It wasn't a stunt: Over the past 16 months, two K-MAX helicopters that were sent to Afghanistan as an experiment have delivered 3.2 million pounds of cargo across Helmand and flown more than 1,000 missions. That's reduced the number of supply convoys needed on the province's bomb-infested roads, eased the workload and risk for helicopter and Osprey crews, saved money and provided real-world proof that drones are practical for much more than surveillance and missile strikes.
The combat-zone test was supposed to last just six months, but in March the Marine Corps extended it indefinitely, citing the K-MAX's success in delivering cargo and keeping Marines in trucks off dangerous roads.
In the fast-growing world of unmanned aircraft, the K-MAX's success is a significant step toward what's expected to be a host of new military and civilian roles for cargo drones, said Peter Singer, the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution research center and the author of “Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century."
"Everyone has framed discussion of drones as being about surveillance, and that's one of the models, but they won't be only that,” they said.
Indeed, surveillance seems likely to become no more than a niche for drones. Last year, Congress ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to open the airways to the commercial use of drones by 2015. The FAA foresees that there'll be 10,000 commercial drones flying by 2020. Predicted uses include carrying cargo, lifting construction materials into place, undertaking rescue missions in remote mountains or stormy seas, evacuating the wounded from battlefields and even, some experts half-joke, delivering pizza.
Analysts' estimates of the commercial market for unmanned aircraft range as high as $94 billion in the next few years.
"The national airspace will be opened, and now that's not an if, it's when," Singer said. "The importance of the K-MAX is that it provides proof of concept that there is a potential commercial use, not just a military one. It's the best current example of cargo movement by an unmanned aircraft. It's working a lot, working well and doing so in a pretty tough environment."
The implications, Singer said, may be extrapolated by looking back at the history of manned aviation. That started with wartime surveillance, then moved onto carrying improvised, then standard, armaments in World War I. After the war, airplanes expanded into moving freight and passengers. The K-MAX and similar competitors are the first shift for drones away from surveillance and air-delivered weapons into freight and the rest of the future for drones, they said.
The Marines also think it's breaking ground for new drone uses, inside and outside the military.
"It might take some time in the United States for a civilian application, but the crews here are proving it works and that it's incredibly reliable and cost-effective," said Maj. Daniel Lindblom, of Alexandria, Va., who oversees the various unmanned-aircraft programs the Marines run in Afghanistan. "It's just a matter of time."
The K-MAX looks a little odd, with its side-by-side rotors, narrow fuselage and lack of a tail rotor, but it isn't startlingly futuristic. That's because it was based on a manned civilian cargo helicopter that had proved itself for years as Lockheed Martin searched for a simple way to meet the requirements of the test without a vast investment in research and development to build a drone from scratch. It joined forces with the original builder of the K-MAX to convert the helicopter to work by remote operation and automation.
It still has a cockpit, and a pilot can taxi it into place before the cargo is attached or fly it around for maintenance checks. When it's time to lift the cargo, the pilot flicks a switch to NOLO – “no local operator" – steps out of the cockpit and walks away.
In a converted shipping container nearby, an operator at the helm of a Sony PlayStation video-game console takes over, and a crew hooks on the cargo, which dangles on a sling about 75 feet below the K-MAX as it flies off.
The PlayStation is simple, cheap, reliable and already familiar to many people, members of the K-MAX ground crew said. If a controller gums up or breaks, someone drives over to the Marine PX and buys another one, said Phil Melton, a pilot from Priest River, Idaho, who works for Oregon's Swanson Group Aviation. Swanson has the contract to maintain and operate the K-MAX here.
After takeoff, much of the helicopter's flight is automated. K-MAX uses GPS satellite navigation to follow a preset path that's filed with air traffic controllers. There isn't a video camera aboard, which is one reason it's important that its routes be carefully coordinated in advance with air traffic controllers and others, such as combat air controllers on the ground. Also that means the ground crew can't see approaching thunderstorms, so they're careful to fly only when there's little chance of a surprise in the weather.
It can travel about 80 miles each way, but it's best at distances of 58 miles or fewer because then it can be controlled by a line-of-sight radio system. If it goes farther, the crew has to switch to a less-reliable satellite telephone to control it.
Once it reaches its destination, the ground crew at Camp Bastion is in communication with the troops at the other end, who tell them when the helicopter is in position to ease the cargo down safely. The operator at the PlayStation console hits a "deliver" button and the K-MAX descends automatically at a controlled rate to about 90 feet, then slows the descent to a crawl. When the cargo settles to the ground, a weight sensor triggers the release of the cargo hook, and the K-MAX automatically climbs into the sky again and follows the preset path back to the air base at Camp Bastion, the British side of the massive joint base that includes the main Marine base in Afghanistan, Camp Leatherneck.
All the automation at the delivery end is necessary because the helicopter can dip below the horizon when it descends, meaning the line-of-sight control system no longer works. But it will still automatically set down its cargo and rise back to the point where it's controllable again.
The program isn't secret, but it's almost unknown on base. The helicopters fly from a remote corner of Bastion, mainly at night, when the weather's usually better and the air cooler and more dense, so the rotor blades are more efficient.
The aircraft now fly six days a week, and up to six flights a day. Often they fly cargoes of water or food, but they also have delivered crucial replacement parts for the improvised bomb-defeating system on a damaged truck and fuel to a small base that was running out.
In Helmand, they've built an enviable record of reliability and cost-effectiveness, Lindblom said. The aircraft need only about 1.3 man-hours of maintenance for every hour of flight, and they cost little more than $1,300 an hour to operate, they said. That compares with nearly 23 man-hours for each hour of flight for the CH-53E heavy-lift helicopter and more than $11,000 an hour to operate it, according to statistics supplied by the Marine Corps.
The CH-53E can carry four times as much cargo – the K-MAX is allowed to carry no more than 4,500 pounds per run – and it's faster, but it also has to fly in pairs for security reasons. That requires a total of 10 crew members and puts them at risk.
The cost savings, performance and reduction in the risk and drudgery mean that the wider use of such helicopters, inside and outside the military, is inevitable, Lindblom said.
"This is the wave of the future, and there's just no question about it," they said. "About the only problem with it is that we don't have 20 or 30 more of them."
'Musicians Don't Retire': A Tribe Called Quest On The Work Ahead
Enlarge this image toggle caption Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images
After almost two decades of silence, last week A Tribe Called Quest released a new album. It's called We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service.
It was a dream long deferred. Tribe, as they're known, broke up in 1998, and though they reunited for a number of performances over the years, an album just never came together. Then, earlier this year, founding member Malik "Phife Dawg" Taylor died of complications from diabetes. But before they did, Phife Dawg joined fellow Tribe members Q-Tip, Jarobi White and Ali Shaheed Muhammad in the studio to lay down tracks for this album.
Jarobi White and Q-Tip joined NPR's Scott Simon for a conversation about the new record and the loss of their friend. Hear their conversation at the audio link, and read an edited transcript below.
Scott Simon: Your appearance on Saturday Night Live last week has gotten a lot of attention, a lot of plaudits. The album, of course, is getting rave reviews. What was it like to go through that without your old friend?
Jarobi White: It's definitely a bittersweet situation, because they laid their life down to do this, and for them not to be able to enjoy the spoils and the fruits of their labor — I really wish they could have been here to see that.
Q-Tip: He's actually the one who was the most spirited about us getting back together and was probably the most ardent about it for many years. When it finally happened, they were just so filled with joy. You saw the joy every day. I know that in spirit, he's here — and you know, we all say those things because not only we feel that and believe it and it is the right thing to say. We know it's true. But we also are spoiled, and we wish that they were physically here as well. That's just to be real.
The track called "Lost Somebody" — this is the story of you and Phife?
Jarobi White: This was one of the hardest songs I've ever had to do.
Q-Tip: Yeah, and they say it, actually — Jarobi says it in the opening of their bars, "Never thought I would ever have to be writing this song."
Jarobi White: Yeah, it was difficult. I wanted to say so much — give something but not too personal. But I know I had to be uber-personal just to talk about their spirit and the man they were and the person they were and the feelings that they shared. I walk around every day and people are always like — even now, they're like, "Man, I'm so sorry for your loss." I know I had to honor that, so it was really difficult to write that song.
You end the song in the middle of a chorus.
Jarobi White: Yes.
Why do that?
Jarobi White: Well, for me, I couldn't finish it. Because my boy's not here. So while it's done, it's still not finished. I don't know if that makes any sense.
Yeah.
Jarobi White: So it will always have an open end for me, really. I think maybe when we start doing shows and stuff, it'll feel a little better. We'll be able to grieve with a bunch of people at the same time.
Q-Tip: We're doing shows?
Jarobi White: I mean, hopefully!
Q-Tip: Oh wow! No, I'm just kidding.
I've gotta ask you about the guest appearances, the collaborations that are on this album, because you had Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli — also Elton John and Jack White. How did that come about?

Q-Tip: Jack, first of all, is a dear brother. He's somebody who reached out to me because they wanted to do one of our songs from High-end Theory. And of course, I agreed, because I'm just a huge fan of theirs and I think he's just a virtuoso and a great artist --
Jarobi White: And a good guy.
Q-Tip: And a solid, solid brother. So we did that and we just immediately connected. He's into gear and vintage stuff, and I'm into gear and vintage stuff.
Jarobi White: They fully nerded out. Fully nerded out.
Q-Tip: No doubt! We kind of geeked out. And then, in terms of Elton, we lifted a little piece out of "Benny and the Jets." If any of you guys remember that song, there's that part, "We're gonna have electric music, solid wall of sound." I just loved that part always as a kid. So we built something around that motif and we expanded it and we reached out to him. And they couldn't have been more gracious, more accommodating. They were like, "I'm a huge fan," and I was like, "Really?" Elton John!
Jarobi White: He's royalty!
Q-Tip: Literally!
Jarobi White: Literally.
He's been knighted, yes.
Q-Tip: Well, yeah. And he's like, "You know, I had a show in Sydney two nights ago," they said, "and because we found out about Phife, we dedicated 'Candle in the Wind' to him." They were just the sweetest guy.
That's nice to learn that about people you admire.
Q-Tip: It really is.
A tough song I want to ask about here — "The Killing Season."
Jarobi White: That song is a toughie. I started that song, and the funny thing about it is I can't even recall which killing it was.
Oh my gosh, that says something.
Jarobi White: Yeah, I can't even remember which one it was.
Was it Trayvon Martin, was it the little boy in Cleveland, was it Freddie Gray in Baltimore ...
Jarobi White: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when I started writing this, the first thing that came to my mind was the song "Strange Fruit." I say, "These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment / Things haven't really changed, or they're dormant for the moment / Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin / Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within / Been on the wrong team so much, can't recognize a win / Seems like my only crime is having melanin." I just think a lot of people are walking around in a state of perpetual healing — and are never getting healing from all the marks and the scars that we're getting. It's the general sentiment of a lot of blacks; they feel like it's killing season.
Q-Tip: Yeah, just to add on top of that, the fact remains that you have to talk about systemic racism. And I think that we have to be introspective and we have to be open and really address this. We can't act like our ancestors weren't brought here from another continent against our will to help build and shape this democracy. And once slavery was abolished, it was just about segregation and it was Jim Crow and the Civil Rights movement, and now we see it's the prison-industrial complex. And now, even further today, it's just outright getting rid of us. And when I say "us," I'm speaking specifically to African-Americans.
And so why can't we kill the killing season, is what we propose. And I think the way that we start doing that is through communication and real dialogue. Because when you study history and you look at every great nation that stands, through most of them, it falls usually at the hands of the people who live there. I don't want that to happen to this country, because I believe that this country is great and we should celebrate that. But at the same time, it can't be a true celebration unless we look at it and really address it.
This is not your last album, is it? You've got a lot to say.
Jarobi White: I mean, as A Tribe Called Quest — Phife is gone, you know what I mean. But musicians don't retire.
