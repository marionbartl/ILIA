For those of you that don't know, we lost one of the good ones this weekend. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a fat-positive, body-acceptance activist and part time male actor died of a heroin overdose in their Greenwich Village apartment yesterday.
Despite not knowing Phillip Seymour Hoffman personally, I am stricken with irreparable grief at the loss of their life. In my search for tranquility and solace, I've turned to the usual comforts – posting heartfelt messages to Facebook, Instagramming filtered pictures of them when they were in their twenties, and doing my best to suppress my glee when my Klout score went up from the inflow of likes and shares.
Unfortunately though, I made the mistake of reading news coverage of their death, and as usual, I am appalled and outraged. The official report states that they passed due to a heroin overdose, which is extremely problematic. In fact, the whole situation surrounding their death is problematic. I'm offended on so many levels, that I just can't even with this right now. Ugh.
Can we talk about heroin for a second? Whenever I have discussions with friends about legalizing drugs, even the most libertarian of the lot always append “except of course for like, crack and heroin,” to their calls for decriminalized, deregulated drug markets. For some reason, crack and heroin are seen as “the bad drugs.” Why is that? Is it because they're more addictive? Well, maybe more so than marijuana, but certainly not more so than alcohol or nicotine. Is it because they are more deadly? Well, again, in regards to pot yes, but alcohol no.
In fact there's only one reason why crack and heroin are deemed completely unacceptable – crack is for black people and heroin has a feminine name.
The white male patriarchy has so much control over our lives that even our drugs are victimized. Do you think there would be this much scrutiny over Hoffman's “drug problem” if they had overdosed on something called Bro? Of course not, it would be seen as an unfortunate but predictable accident – a consequence of a calculated and expected risk for celebrities, akin to a race car driver dying in a collision or a conservative politician dying of secret gay bathroom AIDS in a nightclub. Not so for the girl-named drug, heroin. No, we have to discuss the stranglehold it had on this man's life, like an overbearing nagging wife, or an inequitable child support payment. Heroin is seen as a “bitch” instead of just a cool tough guy like cocaine, who uses their greed to benefit everyone like a dominant lion sharing their kill.
Furthermore, can we stop calling it an overdose?
There's this insidious idea that somehow, we, as adults, aren't capable of deciding how much we need to consume. We're all familiar with fat-shaming, but that's only because body-sizes are visible. We're under a constant barrage of being shamed for consumption, even by the very people that want us to consume. Eat this, but not too much of it. Buy this smartphone but remember to turn it off and connect with people sometimes, wear these t-shirts but not all of them at the same time. Excuse me, I can dress myself, and if I want to wear all of my t-shirts at once, I will.
It wasn't an overdose, it was an accidental death caused by someone choosing to do a specific amount of a drug. When we use coded language like “overdose,” we relinquish power from ourselves and hand it back over to the patriarchy. We depower our cause and empower the invisible force that is presumably responsible for everything that isn't tailored to make my life better and confirm my opinions.
I'm also offended that the media still continues to report deaths. Or at least that they continue to report them without some kind of trigger warning. I'll have to admit, this part is somewhat personal and extremely hard for me to talk about but…
{TRIGGER WARNING}
I discovered recently that I am going to die at some point.
I know that sounds silly, but really death as a reality and not just an abstraction just isn't something you can fully comprehend until you're in your twenties, just trying to experience what it means to be a creative type.
Suddenly you realize, hey, my parents are going to stop paying my rent at some point, I might not be able to make amazing art, and holy shit, I might not be that special.
To me, that's death.
Here in my mid-twenties, sicklied over with the pale cast of thought, I now comprehend myself as an atrophic, impermanent object. But more importantly, I'm worried that people won't think I'm as significant as I think I am, and that's really scary. At least Phillip Seymour Hoffman was famous, what if I'm not famous before I die? What if my only fans are my mom and dad and my girlfriends? That's a really scary thought.
It's okay if you don't fear death, but I do, and people shouldn't talk about things that bother me. Death is an issue that, statistically speaking, affects 100% of women. Something that happens to 50% of the world's population isn't just a feminist issue, it's everyone's issue, okay? So can we just not with death anymore? Thanks.
The most offensive part of all of this however, is that I'm forced to make someone else's death about me. Underneath at all, I'd like to think that I'm not a selfish person; that I have a good heart and mind and my intentions are to help the world. I also know that most people feel the same way. But, somehow, we can't control ourselves. We have to get online and use a tragic event to promote a personal brand.
Why is that? Is it our fault? Of course it isn't, it's someone else's fault. It's everyone's fault but mine.
In the end, what am I left with? Another celebrity has been taken from me, and in even in this time of grief and outrage, I can't afford an expectation of privacy from the media. The system chooses an opportune time – the death of someone close to me, to drive home its message of power and dominance through offensive language and thought, and ultimately, I am trying to capitalize on the death of my good friend. I am sickened by the world for making me this way.
Rest in peace, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, may you find in death what you could not find in life – that killer screenplay I mailed to you about a couple of girls just being girls.
President Donald Trump forcefully went after both prongs of the Democratic congressional leadership, demanding investigations of both congressional Demoratic leaders after photos purported to show their own Russia ties.
It wasn't immediately clear if the president was serious in their call for an investigation of their rivals. At the moment, it is their administration's own contacts with Russia, and Russia's alleged election hacking, that is the subject of investigations by the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees.
'I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for their close ties to Russia, and lying about it,' Trump tweeted Friday afternoon.
Earlier, Trump went after Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer after a photo surfaced of Schumer and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2003. The two pols were enjoying donuts during an event for the opening of a Russian-owned gas station in Manhattan.

President Trump demanded an 'investigation' of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi after a photo emerged showing them seated at a table with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.
President Donald Trump demanded an 'immediate' investigation of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, after they said they hadn't met the current Russian ambassador, only to be revealed to have met them in a 2010 photo
'We should start an immediate investigation into and their ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!' Trump wrote.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared to give a gift to the Trump White House, which has been sent reeling by reports of Trump's Russia ties, when they fielded a question about at a Politico interview Friday about whether they had ever met the current Russian ambassador, Sergey Kisliak.
On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused themselves from any investigations involving the presidential election after it was revealed they twice met the ambassador during the campaign.
'Not with this Russian ambassador, no,' was Pelosi's response.
Within hours, a photo surfaced showing Pelosi seated around the same table as the peripatetic ambassador.
It was during a 2010 meeting in the Capitol, where the ambassador accompanied then-president Dmitri Medvedev, who was considered a modernizer in between President Vladimir Putin's two stints in power.
They were accompanied by then-House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. Also attending was Sergey Lavrov, who is Russia's foreign minister.
NOW LET ME THINK ... House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday they hadn't met with the current Russian ambassador, only to be exposed in a seven-year old photo to have met them
The meeting was publicly acknowledged, and happened a day after Medvedev met with President Obama, and happened long before Russia was alleged to have hacked the U.S. elections.
But it's emergence was just the latest evidence that Russia's ambassador cultivated extensive contacts with multiple facets of the U.S. government and power structure, from both parties – and that not everyone either disclosed or remembered those ties.
Pelosi's spokesperson, Drew Hammill, told Politico, which published the photo, that Pelosi had meant she'd never met solo with the ambassador.
'Of course, that's what they meant,' said Hammill. 'She has never had a private one-on-one with him.'
HOW SWEET: President Donald Trump went after Democratic Senator Charles Schumer by retweeting this photo of Schumer and Russian President Vladimir Putin
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM: Trump tweeted and then deleted their tweet – twice – before getting the spelling right, while visiting a Florida school with their Education secretary
Earlier, Trump tried to blow a hole in repeated revelations about their associates' ties to Moscow by tweeting a photo of rival Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and Vladimir Putin.
As reports swirled about their own campaign's Russia ties – including an undisclosed meeting between son-in-law Jared Kushner and the Kremlin's ambassador to Washington – Trump blasted out a photo of Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader.
'We should start an immediate investigation into and their ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!' Trump wrote.
Attached was a photo of Schumer and President Vladimir Putin enjoying Krispy Kreme doughnuts and coffee.
The 2003 photo was taken in New York, as Schumer welcomed Putin for an event commemorating Lukoil's first gas station in Manhattan, Gateway Pundit revealed.
An AP photo included in the post shows the two men smiling over coffee and doughnuts.
Schumer commented at the time: 'When I showed the president of Russia a Krispy Kreme doughnut and they ate it and said it was good, that was one of the more surreal moments I've had in politics.'
They tweeted back at the president Friday: 'Happily talk re: my contact w Mr. Putin & their associates, took place in '03 in full view of press & public under oath. Would you &your team?'

Trump sent out the tweet attacking Schumer as their own administration was under fire for Russia contacts during a year when Russia was believed to be behind hacking of the presidential election
Schumer responded that they would be happy to discuss their Putin contacts 'under oath. Would you & your team?'
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said they would sit out any decision on prosecutions which could arise from current investigations into whether Russia meddled in the election - but that they had not lied to the Senate
A series of reports have catalogued contacts between Trump associates and Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak

The Trump administration has come under fire for Russia contacts, at a time when the Kremlin was under sanction following the country's invasion of Ukraine.
In 2003, at the time the Schumer meeting occurred, Putin had not yet fully emerged into their role as perpetual adversary to U.S. policy goals. In 2001, President George W. Bush famously said after meeting Putin, 'I found them to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of their soul.'
In the intervening years they cracked down on the free press, helped engineer their departure and return to power, put down a rebellion in Chechnya, and interfered in the politics of its neighbors.
The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia hacked the U.S. elections.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT: Sen. Charles Schumer met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event commemorating a new Lukoil service station
Schumer has called for a special prosecutor to investigate Trump Russia ties and whether an investigation has already been compromised. They have called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, and was among the first to call for Sessions to recuse themselves from any investigation – something Sessions did on Thursday in a dramatic announcement.
'Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach, for the good of the country, Attorney General Sessions should resign,' Schumer said.
In addition to Kushner, former national security advisor Mike Flynn met with Russia's ambassador, as did attorney general Jeff Sessions, a key endorser and campaign advisor for Trump.
The Daily Caller reported at least 22 visits by ambassador Sergey Kislyak to the White House during the Obama administration.
The number of advisors linked to President Donald Trump who met with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. has grown to five – with two more acknowledging the contacts Thursday night.
Carter Page, who Trump identified as among their first foreign policy advisors, acknowledged the contact on MSNBC Thursday night when they didn't deny meeting with Kisklak.
Kislyak's role as the Kremlin's eyes and ears in Washington exploded onto the scene after it was revealed they met with a number of officials in Trump's inner circle during the campaign and after Trump won the presidency.
'I'm not going to deny that I talked with him,' Page told MSBNC's Chris Hayes.
Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also brought up the Schumer incident when asked about Trump associates meeting with the Russian ambassador at a conference held during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
'Please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story,' Sanders said.
'I guess it's kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity. I mean Chuck Schumer sitting and having drinks with Putin and that's not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there's again dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy,' they continued.
Then they defended Sessions meeting with the ambassador, something they said occurred in their 'official capacity.'
'As a senator they obviously in their official capacity met with the ambassador. Again, that was as a senator not as a campaign official, so again, to try to muddy the waters in that way is I think pretty unfair to the attorney general,' they said.
HOUSTON -- Iraq's war- and sanctions-scarred oil industry is limping along at a fraction of its former production, but you can't fault the government for ambition.
"We would like to be producing as much as Saudi Arabia, because there is no country in the region which has similar kinds of reserves," T. Hamid al-Bayati, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview.
To surpass the hydrocarbons king of the world, al-Bayati and their colleagues in the Iraqi government have enormous ground to make up.
Oil projects run the risk of attack and Iraq's technology is outdated. Many competent engineers, contract administrators and negotiators fled the country, while those who stayed are far behind the pack. Deep divisions have delayed passage of framework energy legislation in parliament, keeping foreign oil companies on the sidelines. (See "The Failure Game Of Iraqi Oil")
Not the least of the barriers the government faces is itself, in the snarled state of the country's fledgling Oil Ministry, which failed to use 80% of its funding for capital projects in 2008.
Since the fall of Saddam, decisions have been made at a timid snail's pace--though with a new overlay of transparency. No longer a separate entity, the former Iraqi National Oil Company has been wrapped into the Oil Ministry, making the agency an amalgam of business, policy and full-contact politics.
With more than 95% of the government's budget coming from oil revenues, Iraqi leaders like al-Bayati say developing Iraq's petroleum industry is imperative to rebuilding efforts and autonomy.
In its 1979 heyday, Iraq produced 4 million barrels per day, making it one of OPEC's three largest producers, behind the Saudis and Iran. Today, production has fallen to 2.2 million barrels per day.
The country hopes to reach 4 million bpd again by 2014, then 6 million to 7 million bpd by 2019, according to a former Iraqi oil minister who spoke at an energy conference here last week. That would put Iraq just behind Saudi Arabia, which is currently pumping 7.3 million bpd.
These are unrealistic goals if the Oil Ministry continues to spend just a fraction of its capital budget and operate like a slow-moving bureaucracy, says John Sickman, a former U.S. State Department adviser. "Those numbers are doable if they are allowed to start acting like an oil company; they are not doable if they act like the Ministry of Education."
Sickman advised the current oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, and 15 state operating companies when they were based in Baghdad from January 2006 to June 2007 in the Iraqi Reconstruction Management Office. They said in an interview that the minister is "significantly handicapped" by bureaucratic red tape, lacking the authority to make decisions on big contracts that are routine in the oil business. Top managers can authorize $50 million projects; al-Shahristani is capped at $100 million.
For instance, al-Shahristani had to go to the Council of Ministers to get approval for a $224 million contract with U.S. oilfield services company Weatherford International to drill 20 wells--a relatively small number--in southern Iraq. "This is the lifeblood of Iraq and they don't even have their own rules," Sickman says. "[Al-Shahristani] can't do anything without getting approval from everybody else" and there is "no sense of urgency to purchase or conduct work."
One of Sickman's main tasks while in Iraq was to find out why the Oil Ministry in 2005 only spent $60 million on capital projects, like drilling wells and rehabilitating and upgrading infrastructure, when its yearly budget was about $3 billion. (By contrast, StatoilHydro, which is 67% owned by the Norwegian government, had a capital expenditures budget forecast of $12.5 billion in 2008, but the company spent $16 billion; Chevron spent nearly all its $22.9 billion.)
"Nobody qualified is submitting bids," says Sickman, 62, who is retired and lives in Houston.
The shortfall in spending was mainly due to inexperience, Sickman says, and procurement and contracting regulations that are not in line with international oil industry standards, where service contractors, vendors and consultants typically have a proven track record and are pre-approved.
Companies didn't go through a bidding process under Saddam, according to the U.S. government. Now the Oil Ministry advertises for bids online and in local newspapers for services on multimillion-dollar projects. If three qualified bids aren't submitted, the process starts over again. Meanwhile, the ministry is forbidden to contact firms beforehand to discuss the work, which Sickman described as the "I-sure-hope-somebody-good-bids-to-me concept."
And in an atmosphere of "guilty until proven innocent" amid deep sectarian and party divisions, some managers who have budget authority prefer not to spend. Then nobody can accuse them of stealing.
Even though there are delays now, Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, is confident Iraq can meet its 10-year production goals. "It's not that different than training the Iraqi police or the new Iraqi military because you don't want people doing what they did under Saddam," Jaffe says. "The point is not to shortcut the system. The point is to build capacity."
The Oil Ministry started from scratch in 2005.
"If you don't have the right contracting people, you can't get contracts in place," says a U.S. State Department official in Baghdad, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. government is training ministry managers on how to evaluate large-scale projects and bids, and progress is being made. In 2007, the Oil Ministry only spent $80 million on capital projects, while spending in 2008 jumped to $400 million, or to about 20% of budget. "That's a considerable increase from one year to the next," the official says. "You'd expect to see considerably higher execution this year."
That, however, might not matter should the new energy legislation or other measures entice the majors to invest heavily in the country.
"As international oil companies come in and finally start assisting the Iraqis in moving their oil sector forward, the outright need for the Ministry of Oil to execute its own budget will begin to reduce," the official says, adding, but "of course we would want to see them get better."
Several pro-gun companies and groups claim that Facebook has been "actively suppressing" their posts for the past several months, leading to a rapid decline in website traffic.
"We have over 700,000 likes on our Facebook page and tremendous reader response to our material,” Brandon Curtis, publisher of Concealed Nation, said. “We didn't change a thing about the way we post. In February of 2016 our Facebook traffic fell off a cliff. It sank by nearly 50 percent in that first month.
Curtis said that a Facebook representative told them their company's page was "suppressed" due to "too much commercial content."
USA Carry's Luke McCoy, who also reported a sharp decline in their organization's traffic, said they were told by Facebook that "people were claiming [USA Carry's] content was overly promotional."

I watched news coverage of the 2016 presidential election results sitting beside my roommate, a medical student at the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. They have been in this country since they were a kid, but they are undocumented. Now, with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on life support, I have a much more intimate understanding of the fear on their face that evening in November.
Like many undocumented youths, my roommate learned of their immigration status only when it came time to apply for college. They grew up in our society, was educated by our public school system where they pledged allegiance to our flag, and cherishes American values as much as anyone I know. It occurs to me now, as they face the threat of being sent “back” to Thailand, their country of birth but not their allegiance, that this scenario is especially ridiculous as they are preparing to dedicate a lifelong career to the betterment of our nation's health.
Stritch was the first U.S. medical school to openly accept applications from DACA recipients, and it is now home to more undocumented students than any other medical school in the country. Our DACA classmates are among the most resilient people I have ever met. They excel in a grueling medical curriculum despite the daily demonization of their status in our national political conversation.
Reminding folks that “Dreamers” stand for the same things native-born citizens do shouldn't be necessary. But just in case some readers are not convinced, I will make the case for undocumented physicians. One thing most Americans can agree on, even in 2017, is that our health care system has plenty of room for improvement. The dramatic shortage of providers in underserved communities is one area of focus.
To respond to this shortage and to tackle historic inequities that have led to underrepresentation of minority groups, medical schools have shifted toward mission-based admissions initiatives that weigh more than mere grades and standardized test scores. At Loyola, a Jesuit institution, this mission is grounded in the principles of social justice and service to others. The university decided to build its Loyola Center for Health on Roosevelt in the less affluent western suburbs of Chicago, less than a mile from our school's campus. The Access to Care program there provides free health care to individuals in the local uninsured population, including people who are undocumented.
Health equity is further promoted by recruiting medical students from diverse backgrounds. This initiative improves health access in underserved communities: data have shown repeatedly that underrepresented minorities in medicine go on to practice in underserved communities at higher rates. Undocumented immigrants, who live in society's shadows without access to health care, financial freedoms or the personal agency of having a driver's license, for example, are among the most disenfranchised groups in today's America.
Stritch began admitting undocumented students in 2014, in recognition of the medical profession's duty to benefit all people. Their presence not only will result in our graduates reaching a broader range of patients but also will guarantee they are a key component of our professional development. When we confront differing identities and perspectives, we actively build empathy—perhaps the most vital quality of any good doctor.
To be sure, we were not immune to the divisive forces unleashed during the 2016 presidential campaign. Our class's stark ideological divide has compromised personal relationships and introduced troubling fault lines in our community, just as it did for people across the country.
But despite our differences, we recognize the importance of supporting our undocumented colleagues. Even the majority of our most conservative classmates attended a rally for our DACA classmates and feel strongly about their right to realize their passion for treating the sick of this nation. For us, this is not a matter of politics—it's common sense.
DALLAS - The Dallas Stars traded forward Erik Cole to the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday night.
The Stars got centre Mattias Janmark, defenceman Mattias Backman and a second-round pick this year for Cole and a conditional third-round pick.
The 36-year-old Cole had 18 goals and 17 assists in 57 games for the Stars this season. They have 262 goals and 264 assists in 881 games with Carolina, Edmonton, Montreal and Dallas.
"This might be one of the best years he's had," Stars general manager Jim Nill said.
In 2011-12, Cole had 35 goals and 26 assists for Montreal.
"I was warming up for the game here, got pulled away and found out that a deal had been reached," Cole told Canadian sports network TSN. "I found a little after that I was going to be headed to Detroit. It should be a great experience with a great team that is in the playoffs."
Janmark and Backman, both 22, have not played in the NHL.
Detroit drafted Backman in the fifth round in 2011, and Janmark in the third round in 2013. They have played mostly in their native Sweden, and logged some time with the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins.
Nill was Detroit's assistant general manager when the Red Wings picked Backman 146th overall, but was with the Stars when Janmark was drafted.
"I've seen Backman ever since we drafted him," Nill said. "He's very close to being an NHL-ready defenceman. Janmark plays the game the right way both ways. We look forward to getting them over here and seeing where their development's at."
This season, Janmark has 13 goals and 23 assists in 53 games for Frolunda in the Swedish Hockey League. Backman had four assists in 18 games at Grand Rapids, and has four goals and 12 assists in 23 games for Linkopings.
Nill said Detroit would return the third-round pick if the Red Wings advance to the Eastern Conference finals.
New England Patriots superstar quarterback Tom Brady destroyed their cell phone, and thousands of potentially damning texts along with it.
Or did he?
Though unlikely, it's possible that some of those text messages could still be recovered.
Brady told the NFL that they had their assistant destroy their Samsung phone and SIM card on March 5 or 6 -- the day they were interviewed by the NFL's investigative team about "Deflategate." The NFL reached out to Brady's cell phone carrier, which confirmed that the text messages on their phone couldn't be recovered.
The league had wanted to read some of the 10,000 messages Brady sent in the four-month period before and after the AFC Championship game in order to determine whether the Patriots quarterback might have had anything to do with deflating the game balls below the required air pressure.
The NFL called the cell phone's destruction "an affirmative effort by Mr. Brady to conceal potentially relevant evidence and to undermine the investigation." (Brady denies this.)
But the NFL might have been able to read some of those text messages if it really wanted to.
In an arbitration hearing, Brady's representatives offered to provide the league with a spreadsheet identifying all of the people with whom Brady had exchanged text messages during the period in question. Brady's agents suggested that the NFL contact the relevant parties and ask them to provide texts sent by Brady.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that would have been "impractical."
Tom Brady: 'I did nothing wrong'
There might have been an easier way. Depending on how "destroyed" Brady's phone is, it's possible that relevant texts could have been recoverable.
Most text messages are stored locally on a cell phone. A person can, in theory, recover text messages from a broken phone by connecting the phone to the computer. (It's even possible to read deleted texts -- but you have to act fast: Your phone only saves deleted texts until it needs space in its memory, then it will overwrite them with new information, permanently deleting them.)
Deleted or not, the phone would need to be powered on to recover them.
But Brady told the NFL that they asked their assistant "to destroy the phone so that no one can ever, you know, reset it or do something where the information is available to anyone."
Assuming that Brady's phone was microwaved, dropped from an airplane or otherwise destroyed to the point that it could never again be powered on, there's one possible technique left for retrieving Brady's "lost" messages: the cloud.
If Brady sent and received text messages using the phone's default text messaging app, those messages were likely stored on their phone's internal memory and permanently destroyed.
But if they used Google (GOOGL) Voice, Facebook (FB) Messenger, WhatsApp, or any number of cloud text messaging services, those texts would all still be recoverable. When using those apps, texts are stored on servers, not the phone itself. All you need to recover the texts is to install that same app on your new phone -- and all the texts would appear, even if they were sent from another phone.
Brady should take note: They said in a Facebook message Wednesday morning that they switched to an iPhone 6. By default, Apple (AAPL) stores texts sent to and from other iPhones in its own servers as part of the iMessage service. They might want to turn that function off.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The defensive front of the Carolina Panthers is being touted as one of the best in the NFL this season, but it has a ways to go before it can be called the best in team history.
That honor still goes to the 2003 unit of Julius Peppers, Mike Rucker, Kris Jenkins and Brentson Buckner.
One of those could be a thorn in Carolina's side on Sunday as the Panthers (1-2) face the Arizona Cardinals (2-2) at University of Phoenix Stadium.

Buckner, 42, is in their first year as the defensive line coach at Arizona. The former tackle has the Cardinals ranked second in the league against the run, holding opponents to 75 yards per game -- or 18 fewer than Carolina's seventh-ranked defense.
Asked how much Buckner's arrival in Arizona has to do with the team's turnaround from a year ago when it ranked 28th in the league (134 yards a game) against the run, head coach Bruce Arians didn't hesitate.
"I don't think there is any doubt there's a correlation there,'' they said.
As a player, Buckner helped the Pittsburgh Steelers reach the Super Bowl in 1995. Eight years later, they helped Carolina reach the Super Bowl on a line that had 24.5 sacks, 174 tackles and six forced fumbles.
They were always a character in the locker room and a go-to guy for quotes, whether they were talking about himself, their teammates or the other team. One of the first things they said upon arriving at Carolina in 2001 served as inspiration.
"I told the guys, ‘Man, there's nothing like winning,'"' Buckner said at the time. “It turns the city into a special place when you're winning and you're in the playoffs and the eyes of the world are on you.''
Now Buckner is instilling that same confidence in an Arizona team that stands between Carolina getting its second win four games into the season for the first time since 2008.
"Having seen them work training camp in Pittsburgh for four years, and the passion and energy they brought, I said, 'Buc, you really want to do this for a living?' '' Arians said. "He said, 'I'm pretty sure I do coach.'"'
Buckner apparently remains a character as well.
"I have to keep reminding them he's a coach ... straighten their hat out,'' Arians said of Buckner, who always wore their cap turned a bit to the side as a player.
Buckner came to Arizona after four years as an intern with the Steelers. That's where they met Arians, who was the offensive coordinator at Pittsburgh from 2007 to 2011.
Buckner took a job in 2012 as the head coach of the Charlotte Speed, a member of the Professional Indoor Football Association, but the team folded before it could take the field.
That was good news for the Cardinals and perhaps bad news for Carolina, which will take the league's No. 3 rushing attack to Arizona. Buckner played a big role in stopping the run as a player, and that hasn't stopped as coach.
"If you can't stop the ball, you're going to lose the majority of your games,'' Buckner told the Charlotte Observer in January as they were finalizing their deal with Arizona. “We're going to dictate how the game will go. When we touch the field, our main goal will be to stop the run. Then we're going to pin our ears back and go eat.”
That's the Buckner who helped make the 2003 front the best in Carolina history. That's the Buckner who will do everything they can on Sunday to help the Cardinals feast on running back DeAngelo Williams and quarterback Cam Newton.
"When an opportunity came they were one of the first phone calls I made,'' Arians said. "I was fortunate enough to get (78-year-old) Tom Pratt, who coached in Super Bowl I, to come along with him.
"They fit really well together and he's going to be a whale of a football coach.''
Setting up a new smartphone can take a couple of hours as you enter your username and password for various accounts, try to find all the apps you like and get them installed, choose a wallpaper, select a ringtone, and customize to your liking. HTC makes this process much easier with its new HTC Get Started service that is available for the new HTC One.
Due to an unfortunate carrier move, HTC had to scramble to get HTC One evaluation devices out to the press and completely lift the embargo on the device. Thus, those of us who were lucky enough to get one have been spending excessive time this weekend testing the device. I have an international HTC One that has near-final firmware and will be writing up some of my experiences.
The first thing I wanted to try was the out-of-box experience that a "normal" customer might go through, so I went through the web browser-based HTC Get Started service and have screenshots in this gallery.
When you start up the HTC One — watch out for the shock of the BoomSound — you are asked if you would like to use the HTC Get Started service. A website URL, start.htcsense.com/#pairing, is shown along with a passcode that you enter on the website.
You then select the device you want to set up and since I currently have a T-Mobile SIM in this evaluation HTC One, I selected the HTC One at T-Mobile.
INDIANAPOLIS, April 24, 2012 – Eighty-six of the country's top male gymnasts are expected to compete in the 2012 U.S. Men's Qualifier, May 5, at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. The Men's Qualifier is the last opportunity for the country's male gymnasts to qualify for the 2012 Visa Championships, USA Gymnastics national championships, in St. Louis, June 7-10.

This is a guest post from Jason Lemieux over at Postmatic, and we're totally onboard with their message. Blog comments do still matter in a big way. Check out their thoughts and share your own after you've had a chance to read through this awesome post 🙂
People in the content marketing space often talk about “content being king”. While it's true content delivers the opportunity to promote a product, service, launch, company news, event or more – it's one way. You're still broadcasting – and wasn't the goal of social media and, by association, content, to move away from the bad old days or broadcast media and into two-way dialogue with your customers?
Enter blog comments. Specifically, enter WordPress blog comments. Why? Simple. Commenting in WordPress is an untapped opportunity. Increased blog engagement raises SEO performance, strengthens your brand, and builds a community around your ideas. And that's just for starters.
And yet, still the argument is there for switching off blog comments. A lot of blogs have gone ahead and implemented this move recently. Comments become disabled, and desperate-looking boxes jump at you to ask for your email address – without wanting your opinion.
While I respect the decision, I think they're missing out. Big time.
The WordPress comments system is an email marketing and automation platform waiting to happen.
Where on the web does someone take a minute out of their day to share their thoughts, introduce themselves, and give you their personal email address – which you then do nothing with? In blog comments. You would be amazed at how many email addresses are sitting in your database doing nothing. These are your base. People who value your opinion, your products, and community. You should be looking at reaching out to them, not just harvesting addresses from unknown visitors.
The debate around commenting
Admittedly, some of the reasons for switching off comments make sense. It's too time-consuming, and we have to deal with too much spam being two of the most common. For any blogger, personal or professional, time is an important commodity you don't want to waste.
And tracking spammy comments can be a huge time suck, if your site is one of those that attract hundreds of comments on every single post.
Here's the thing, though – the operative word here is can. I've managed blogs for businesses and organizations where the comments are in the thousands, and I've never once felt it too time-consuming to manage, for both commenting/replying and managing spam. Yes, spam is annoying – but only if you let it be. There are far too many moderation options available, like our favorite anti-spam plugin Akismet, for that to be a valid excuse – trust me on this.
Take a look at what you're saying – by saying you're too busy to deal with comments, and too busy to deal with spam, you're saying you're too busy to answer a potential customer or friend, and you're too busy to look after their experience while they're on your site.
Is that the kind of business you want to be? I didn't think so.
But social media has killed blog comments
Then there's the reasoning that social media conversations have killed blog comments, so why keep them switched on?
Easy. While social conversations will always happen (and should be encouraged – after all, it's better having people talk about you in a fractured way than not at all), it's their fractured nature that provides the exact reason you should have comments on.
On your blog, you direct the conversation. You encourage (or discourage) by your availability to those leaving a comment. You can't be everywhere on social (no matter what the gurus say), but you can be everywhere in one specific place – your blog.
Answer questions there, meet customer needs, show you value their words…. you can see where this is going, right?
The rise of email delivery over RSS
Of course, blog comments are only part of the equation (albeit a very important one). In the last few years, email marketing has really taken off on blogs, even those run as a hobby. You only need to look at the success of Optin Monster, Bloom, Magic Action Box Pro and more to see that popularity in action.
Visit any blog today, and at the end of the post (or while reading it, based on behavior), you'll probably see an option to get further blog posts by email. While RSS has been around for years, it's never really taken when it comes to the bigger population of blog visitors.
The reason for that is simple – too many options, too much technology at play, and too little education about what RSS actually is.
Email is different. Pretty much everyone knows what email does and, more importantly, how it works. So it's no surprise email marketing (or just subscribing by email) has become so popular on blogs of all sizes.
It makes sense, too. If someone gives you their email address, they're investing their trust in you to not abuse it. That's a pretty powerful endorsement (and shouldn't be abused, period). Yet it's also a huge opportunity.
If people subscribe to your blog for content, it stands to reason they'll be interested in other stuff from you. Courses, downloads, ebooks, webinars, etc. All potential revenue sources, and all deliverable direct to someone's email.
That kind of direct referral can't be bought. Now, imagine if you had that kind of direct connection, but now it's with every reader of your blog, even from several years ago…
From email to comment to email again
Now, to tie this all back to why you should have blog comments as an active part of your content and email marketing strategy, ask yourself this question:
If you could connect with those that show an interest in your daily content, and make it easy for them to not only subscribe to that content but offer immediate feedback on it, all while remaining part of your ongoing email strategy, wouldn't it make sense to use that?
Now you can. And it's simple. You don't even have to change your current content output.
You create your post; It goes out via email; Your subscriber reads the post; They hit “Reply” to leave a comment via email; The comment appears, and you're notified; You reply to your email, the comment appears on the blog post; The commenter gets a notification, and hits “Reply” to leave another comment via email; Rinse; repeat; benefit.
It really is as simple as that. It doesn't matter where the email is being read – desktop, webmail, mobile. If you can receive email, you can reply to comments. And moderate them. And approve. And watch your engagement grow.
The way that all of this can happen is using a really awesome new plugin called Postmatic. It's free to download and you can take a look at exactly how it works on their website.
With growth in engagement comes growth in opportunity. Because not only can you now reach out to that person through email, you can invite past commenters that are interested in that topic to come back and share their thoughts again. All through a highly personalized, highly targeted, and highly ethical invitation system.
Think of it another way. If a comment system allowed you to re-invite 1,000 potential customers back to your brand to discuss the features of a new product or service, would you still feel comments are a waste of time?
Thought so. Email and comments by email – it's an opportunity you no longer have to wait to happen. You can download Postmatic and start using it today.
Now it's your turn. Do you agree that comments are still an important part of the web today? We love talking with our blog readers and customers in the comments section 🙂
THIS is the exact spot where Barcelona terrorist Younes Abouyaaqoub was killed by cops as the incredible story emerged of a hero dubbed "Citizen X" who helped bring them to justice.
Cops suspect the 22-year-old was the driver of the van that killed 13 people on tourist hotspot Las Ramblas.
AP:Associated Press 19 The spot where police shot and killed Younes Abouyaaqoub by a road near Subirats, a small town 28 miles west of Barcelona
19 The daughter of a vineyard owner between Sadurni d'Anoia and Subirat called police when they spotted a suspicious motorist on their land
AFP 19 The terrorist's dead body was understood to have been taken away in this funeral van
AP 19 The body of Abouyaaquob is taken away from the site after their four days on the run ended when they were shot dead yesterday
EPA 19 At least 15 people were killed after vehicles crashed into pedestrians on the Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona and on a promenade in the coastal city of Cambrils. It is believed Younes Abouyaaqoub drove one of them
Officers confirmed that a man wearing a suicide belt had been shot by police - who they later confirmed to be Abouyaaqoub - but the device was fake.
The shooting took place in Subirats, a town about an hour's drive west from Barcelona.
It has emerged the net closed in on the world's most wanted fugitive when the daughter of a Catalan vineyard owner alerted police after their father saw a car driver crossing their property at high speed even though it was closed.
Roser Ventura, whose dad owns a vineyard between the towns of Sadurni d'Anoia and Subirats, said: "The police told us to leave the premises and go home.
"We heard a helicopter flying around and many police cars coming toward the gas station that is some 600 metres from the property."
AP:Associated Press 19 Anti terror police have thanked for the vineyard owner, Citizen X, for their role in the arrest
AP:Associated Press 19 hundred police officers descended on the small town of Subirats in Spain
Kevin Dunnett 19 CCTV captured Younes Abouyaaqoub, the main suspect wanted in connection with the Barcelona terror attack

We confirm that the man shot down in #subirats is Younes Abouyaaqoub, author of the terrorist attack in #barcelona — Mossos (@mossos) August 21, 2017
According to the head of the Catalan police, two officers found them hiding in the vineyard and asked for their identification.
They were shot to death when they opened their shirt to reveal what looked to be explosives and cried out "Allah is great" in Arabic, regional police chief Josep Luis Trapero said.
Abouyaaqoub had been on the run for four days after the terror attack before they were spotted outside a train station about 33 miles west of Barcelona yesterday afternoon.
Cops have now praised the vineyard owner who has been dubbed "Citizen X".
A spokesperson for Spain's anti-terror police tweeted on Monday night: "Our gratitude to Citizen X for their decisive collaboration in the operation in Subirats.
"You played an important part in the fight against terrorism."
AP:Associated Press 19 Armed police officers stand guard near the scene of the shooting in Subirats
AFP 19 Policemen and medical staff at the scene where it is believed Moroccan suspect Younes Abouyaaqoub was shot
Bomb disposal officers found the suspected explosive device was fake using a robot.
Cops have also confirmed a Moroccan imam - believed to have radicalised youths who committed Spain's terror attacks - was also confirmed dead.
Abdelbaki Es Satty is thought to have died an accidental explosion at the suspects' bomb factory, police said.
Asked whether they had died in the blast yesterday that precipitated the attacks, Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said: "It is confirmed," adding "the remains of the imam were there", in the house in Alcanar that exploded.

EL PAIS / REUTERS 19 Police were scrambling to find Abouyaaqoub, whose documents were reportedly found in a second rented van
Local media said police managed to find and shoot them on a road near a sewage treatment plant.
Yesterday chilling CCTV images emerged of the Las Ramblas massacre driver calmly fleeing the scene on foot after killing 13 and injuring more than 100 others.
Abouyaaqoub abandoned the van they had ploughed into pedestrians after the airbag was triggered, La Vanguardia reported.
EL PAIS / REUTERS 19 Chilling CCTV stills show the killer walking calmly from the scene of the massacre
19 Younes Abouyaaqoub was being hunted by police
The airbag's detonation reportedly immobilised the Renault Kangoo's electrical system, forcing them to end their massacre and flee.
Police revealed today that they walked around Barcelona for about 90 minutes after the van attack before hijacking a Ford Focus, stabbing its owner, Pau Perez, and driving away with their body still inside.
Cops believe the attacker took the car about 90 minutes after the attack and rammed into officials at a police checkpoint before abandoning it with its owner's dead body inside.
The 15th victim of last week's atrocities in Spain was killed in a separate attack by suspected Islamist militants hours later in a seaside resort in Cambrils.
Victims included seven-year-old British boy Julian Cadman who has been described as an “energetic, funny and cheeky” boy.
Cops launched a Europe-wide hunt for Abouyaaqoub and issued CCTV images in the hope of tracking them down.
A Japanese sports shop is reporting a surge in demand for nipple covers as mammary gland concealment becomes all the rage in the eccentric Far-Eastern country.
The Dot Store says nipple covers, usually used by long-distance runners to prevent chafing, are flying off its shelves, with 55,000 sets being sold so far this year.
The figure far exceeds last year's sales figures, though exact numbers were not given.
A Japanese sports shop is reporting a surge in demand for nipple covers as mammary gland concealment becomes all the rage in the eccentric Far-Eastern country
The Dot Store says nipple covers, usually used by long-distance runners to prevent chafing, are flying off its shelves, with 55,000 sets being sold so far this year. Pictured above, the date's reaction to the man's nipple when covered (left) and when exposed (right)
The figure far exceeds last year's sales figures, though exact numbers were not given
The feat has been achieved by marketing the nipple covers as fashion items instead of sports accessories.
An advertisement for the product shows a girl on a date being enchanted with their young beau when their nipples are covered but disgusted when they are seen poking through their T-shirt.
In one version of events where the lad's nipples are covered, the couple end up together.
But in an alternate reality where they neglected to cover their twin peaks, they end up alone.
Some Japanese media outlets also said that men's nipples were considered a turn-off on the dating scene if they were visible through a thin shirt.
One quoted a study carried out in 2013 that found 84 percent of Japanese people questioned were repulsed by the sight of nipples protruding through thin fabric, though the findings were not broken down by gender.
The Dot Store's nipple covers are adhesive, water-resistant, transparent patches similar to sticking plasters.

This is a short but poignant article. Yesterday I went for a walk along a remote beach, not far away from where I grew up on the West Coast of Scotland. I was truly shocked at the level of pollution that had washed up on the shore. In the short 200m distance I walked along, I came across the following objects:
1x Boulles ball
1x Childs bike
3x Big plastic crates
1x Half a bottle of ketchup
1x Half a bottle of motor oil
1x Washing machine drum
1x Ladder!!
36x Plastic drinking bottles
3x Fishing nets
1x Childs Potty
All of these items will eventually biodegrade to a microscopic scale – eventually being ingested by fish and other marine life causing horrific suffering and ultimately ending up back on our plates.
We must think critically with every single purchase we make as to whether we truly need this item and whether we can buy more sustainable environmentally friendly alternatives. It is not only a economic imperative but a deeply moral one too.

We've been waiting seemingly forever to see behind the work walls at Epcot's Norway pavilion, well, “For the First Time in Forever” we're getting a look today.
Starting this Summer, Anna and Elsa will greet guests in the new Royal Sommerhus next door to the existing Norway pavilion, modeled after a traditional Norwegian cabin. Disney today released a video looking behind the walls at the new meet and greet experience, which definitely has more of a World Showcase look to it than that of an animated film:
Of course, Anna, Elsa and their latest-generation Audio-Animatronics co-stars will also welcome guests aboard the new Frozen Ever After boat ride replacing Maelstrom in the Norway pavilion. Passengers on their way to Arendelle's Winter in Summer Celebration for Queen Elsa will visit the ice palace and hear beloved film tunes plus new lyrics by Oscar-winning “Let It Go” songwriters Bobby Lopez and Kristen Anderson. Bobby and Kristen were recently interviewed about the attraction during a visit to Epcot:
Frozen Ever After and the Royal Sommerhus will open at Epcot this Summer, but no exact date has been given yet.
Anjela Nedyalkova and Ewan McGregor in T2 Trainspotting.
T2 Trainspotting owes us a new “Choose Life” speech, and it better be good. The original speech didn't just kick off the first Trainspotting film; it was the centerpiece of its marketing campaign, a Generation X mantra. It was probably inevitable that a movie as nostalgic as T2 would try to re-create it, but in this case, the burden of expectation was a little too much.
To set the scene, Ewan McGregor's Mark Renton is having dinner with Sick Boy's girlfriend, an ambitious sex worker named Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova), at a nice restaurant. When the conversation lulls, they bring it up. “What's ‘choose life'? Simon says it sometimes. They say, ‘Choose life, Veronika.'” Renton laughs, like it's a memory they haven't thought about in ages. “‘Choose life' was a well-meaning slogan from a 1980s anti-drug campaign,” they explain, while the movie cuts back to the original sequence. “We used to add things to it.”
What follows is the 2017 version of the speech. “Choose Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and a thousand other ways to spew your bile across people you've never met,” Renton tells Veronika. “Choose updating your profile. Tell the world what you had for breakfast and hope that someone somewhere cares. Choose looking up old flames, desperate to believe that you don't look as bad as they do. Choose live-blogging from your first wank to your last breath, human interaction reduced to nothing more than data. Choose ‘10 Things You Never Knew About Celebrities Who Had Surgery.' Choose screaming about abortion. Choose rape jokes, slut-shaming, revenge porn, and an endless tide of misogyny.”
So, yeah, it's a dud.
Renton has 20 years of terrible things to catch up on: Iraq and Brexit, the 2008 financial collapse and Kanye interrupting Taylor Swift! Instead, the movie squanders their big moment: He's using it not as a declaration but a come-on. Renton is trying to sleep with their friend's girl, and in perhaps a sign that the movie was written by a middle-aged man, this speech is the thing that gets them into their bed.
That grossness aside, T2 is just the latest example of an unfortunate screenwriting trend: a movie stopping dead in its tracks so a character can complain about social media. (Considering Renton's speech comes shortly after they and Sick Boy have had a lovely drunken night messing around with Snapchat filters, it's particular galling in this case.) It's a cheap way of signifying a hero's free-thinking bona fides. Viewers need to understand that our protagonist is not like rest of the sheep out there, man. They really get it.
The problem is not restricted to bad films. In last year's The Edge of Seventeen, Hailee Steinfeld's emo teen wagged a finger at their peers. “My entire generation is a bunch of mouth breathers. They literally have a seizure if you take their phone away for a second,” they complain to their teacher (Woody Harrelson). “They can't communicate without emojis. They actually think that the world wants to know that they are ‘eating a taco!' Exclamation point, smiley face, smiley face, smiley — like we give a fuck! I am an old soul.” In another high school, Thomas Haden Church got a similar line in Easy A. “I don't know what your generation's fascination is with documenting your every thought … but I can assure you, they're not all diamonds,” they tell Emma Stone. “‘Roman is having an okay day, and bought a Coke Zero at the gas station. Raise the roof.' Who gives a rat's ass?” They were slightly ahead of The Social Network, which had a dozen of these speeches in every scene, but at least there they were topical.
Birdman is unlike other movies for a lot of reasons, not least because Emma Stone delivers the inverse of the usual rant: “There's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day,” they tell Michael Keaton. “And you act like it doesn't even exist! Things are happening in a place that you willfully ignore, a place that has already forgotten you. I mean, who the fuck are you? You hate bloggers. You make fun of Twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist.”
(For the record, it's entirely possible to have a narrative untouched by a social-media gag. Moonlight's lovers reconnected without the benefit of Facebook. La La Land didn't make Ryan Gosling send a Snapchat. The brothers in Hell or High Water didn't even text.)
It's also possible to handle social media well on film. Olivier Assayas's Personal Shopper has a terrifying sequence that's just Kristen Stewart staring at their phone, eyeing the dot-dot-dot bubble that's sure to precede a chilling iMessage. Assayas deploys technology to show how a Skype session or phone call can divide us into two places at once. Handling it so matter-of-factly gets more about the weirdness of social media than a rant about Facebook pokes ever will. Besides, who even writes social-media updates about what they're having for lunch anymore? If these screenwriters wanted to stay current, they'd have their main characters complain about not getting creative credit on their memes.

UPDATED: Students respond to Gutmann's announcement that Penn is a 'sanctuary' for undocumented students
Penn will stay a "sanctuary" for undocumented students, President Amy Gutmann announced in a University-wide email on Wednesday morning.
"Penn is and has always been a 'sanctuary' — a safe place for our students to live and to learn," their email read. "We assure you that we will continue in all of our efforts to protect and support our community including our undocumented students."
Gutmann's announcement comes amid calls by undocumented students for them to make an active, concrete statement about Penn being a "sanctuary campus." Various other colleges including Portland State University and Reed College have declared themselves sanctuary campuses.
While their statement did not use the phrase "sanctuary campus" itself, the protections for undocumented students they described align with what a sanctuary campus typically offers:
“The University of Pennsylvania will not allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)/Customs and Border Protection (CBP)/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on our campus unless required by warrant," they wrote. "Further, the University will not share any information about any undocumented student with these agencies unless presented with valid legal process."
At Penn, undocumented students and recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals plan will continually be supported through financial aid and fellowship stipends, according to the the email. DACA allows certain people who came to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit.
Since the results of the 2016 presidential election, Penn students and faculty have petitioned for the administration to publicly announce that Penn will be a sanctuary campus. Until Wednesday morning, Gutmann remained silent amid these requests.
The email also endorsed Philadelphia's citywide move to block local law enforcement from turning over unauthorized immigrants to the federal government. In early November, Mayor Jim Kenney said Philadelphia will remain a sanctuary city, regardless of President-elect Donald Trump's efforts.
Trump, a 1968 Wharton graduate, has called for a crackdown on sanctuary cities. Their newly named chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said that Trump will consider cutting millions in funding to so-called sanctuary cities on the first day of their presidency.
2016 College graduate Silvia Huerta, a member of Undocumented at Penn, said they were excited to hear from Gutmann and happy that the efforts of students and faculty on campus paid off. However, they said there is still more work to be done. In particular, they were “pretty disappointed that [students'] request to meet with the President has still not been acknowledged.”
Board member of Penn for Immigrant Rights and College senior Daisy Romero said a meeting with Gutmann is necessary to “establish what being a sanctuary means for Penn.”
Gutmann's email suggests that Penn has always held the status of a "sanctuary" for undocumented students. While the term “sanctuary city” refers to a city wherelocal law enforcement is prohibited from turning over unauthorized immigrants to the federal government, the term “sanctuary campus” does not yet have a clear, unified definition.
Students also want to meet with Gutmann to discuss a particular point raised in their email about Penn having "a number of permanent staff who serve as advisors to support the specific needs of undocumented and DACA students.”
Huerta said while there are indeed staff at La Casa Latina and the Greenfield Intercultural Center whom undocumented students are “extremely grateful for,” these people are not always equipped to handle the specific problems that undocumented students face.
Helping undocumented students "is not in their job description,” they said. “They do it because they care about these issues and they care about their students. What we need is somebody whose job it is to help and protect undocumented students.”
Huerta added that relying on staff from La Casa Latina also makes the assumption that all undocumented students are Latin American, which is not true.
In a national sanctuary campus walk-out being held at College Green on Thursday, undocumented students will focus their advocacy on securing a meeting with Gutmann, said College senior and Chair of PIR Tiffany Rodriguez.
“I'm sure she's very busy but I think a simple acknowledgement that she's willing to have this meeting is important,” Huerta said. “We are about to go off for break and for finals, but we would really like to have that sense of security before then.”
Not all student groups were enthused with Gutmann's announcement. The College Republicans' official Facebook page posted an earlier version of this article with the headline, "#NotMyPresident."
In the end of the email, University officials called for students, faculty and staff to come together during times of fear and anxiety about the future.
“United, we will do everything in our power to ensure the continued security and success of our undocumented students,” the email read. “It is timing such as these when we must hold even closer our cherished Penn values of inclusion, diversity, equity and mutual respect.”

A spokesperson for Gutmann's office did not answer questions over email but referred back to Gutmann's comments on the statement at Wednesday's University Council meeting.

It's 2014, which means an announcement that a game will contain DLC is almost as inevitable as news that a game will contain a "restore power to the elevator" section. In most cases, it's a given. In Titanfall's case, though, there's been a lot of speculation as to Respawn and EA's post-release content plan. The confusion was mostly caused when the official Titanfall Twitter account mistook the term "Season Pass" for "Online Pass" , claiming the game wouldn't have the former, when in fact it meant the latter.
In an interview with Gamespot , Respawn's Vince Zampella has clarified the situation. They explain that the game will receive paid DLC, and that Respawn will also release a season pass to bundle that content before release.
"We're going to do paid DLC, we're also going to do free updates," they said. "There are things we want in the game that we didn't get to ship in the final game. We'll add private matches and things like that for free." Essentially, it sounds like the usual multiplayer update plan. Features and upgrades are left as free updates, while new content becomes DLC.
"We're going to do a season pass, just because... if you buy it up front, you get a deal," they continued. "We're not doing microtransactions, so the season pass is just buy it up front and you get a better price."
I remain convinced that it's reckless to buy a season pass before a game's DLC has been created. As a content delivery system, DLC is just too varied and unpredictable to rely on. We're seeing quality micro-expansions more often, nowadays - everything from Borderlands 2's many mini-campaigns, to Crusader Kings 2's major new additional systems. The problem is that developers are just as likely to pull a Saints Row IV, offering a weak collection of missions that don't come close to the brilliance of the original game.
Even so, if a season pass remains available after the DLC is released, it's potentially a great deal. But it's a weird situation for a multiplayer game to be in - with a community that will fracture and tribalise around when and if its individual players buy the extra updates. This is all theoretical, of course, without knowing Titanfall's specifics. At least we know that it'll launch with a decent number of initial maps .
If we as software developers want to both build great products and have fun doing so, we must be able to focus on the task at hand. Thus, our code should always compile. Our unit tests should always pass. We shouldn't have to battle a ton of misleading warnings and errors as our code is executed. In short, we must hold ourselves and our teammates to a high standard.
Why is all of that important? It's because writing software, and doing a good job of it, is hard. It's difficult enough just to implement a single new feature; it becomes a truly monumental task when, in addition to implementing the new feature, you have to figure out why the code no longer compiles, the database scripts error out, and why this one unit test, written 2 years ago, causes the build server to spit out a bunch of logs in Afrikaans and then burst into flames. Everything besides that feature is a distraction that will keep you from doing a great job on the task at hand while frustrating the lederhosen off of you.
I don't think any of that was a shocker to anyone. (If it was, you have my sympathy.) What's interesting to me is that this idea of keeping all of your working materials in line all of the time actually applies to a lot of different professions. Check out this great example, from a seriously delightful book:
"As a cook, your station, and its condition, its state of readiness, is an extension of your nervous system - and it is profoundly upsetting if another cook or, God forbid, a waiter disturbs your precisely and carefully laid-out system. The universe is in order when your station is set up the way you like it: you know where to find everything with your eyes closed, everything you need during the course of the shift is at the ready at arm's reach, your defenses are deployed. If you let your mise-en-place run down, get dirty and disorganized, you'll quickly find yourself spinning in place and calling for backup.
I worked with a chef who used to step behind the line to a dirty cook's station in the middle of the rush to explain why the offending cook was falling behind. He'd press their palm down on the cutting board, which was littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, bread crumbs and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly on a station if not constantly wiped down with a moist side towel. "You see this?" he'd inquire, raising their palm so that the cook could see the bits of dirt and scraps sticking to their chef's palm. "That's what the inside of your head looks like now. Work clean!" - Anthony Bourdain, Kitchen Confidential
The great thing here is that working cleanly is just accepted in the world of cooking. You can Google for hours and I'm confident that you'd never find a thousand post thread on the culinary equivalent of StackOverflow, asking, "Should I keep my mise-en-place clean? What if I clean it right before I need something? What if I just move to a new kitchen for each meal?" They get it, just like we need to get it. (And since I'm quoting Anthony Bourdain here, I feel like they are now obligated to come to my house and make me a grilled cheese sandwich.)
I get tempted, once a month or so, to just hack something together and check it in. I know this is happening when I say a line that's as evil as non-dairy creamer: "I don't have time to do it right!" When I do check this code in, almost inevitably, something will come up shortly thereafter. A feature, quite possibly something I didn't even touch, isn't working right. I start investigating and I see, "Oh, it's this function." I dig a little deeper, "Oh wait, it's the crappy code I did last week." I go further still, "Hang on, maybe it's not this crappy code. Or maybe it is that crappy code, and I just happened to break a whole lot of stuff without realizing it." It's a painful lesson over and over again that there's no such thing as a shortcut in the world of development.
During times like that, I wish someone would press their palm onto my spaghetti code and hold it up. Then they could say, "You see this? That's what the inside of your head looks like now!" They'd be right.
Although they are now foes in the Democratic presidential contest, Hillary Clinton was once a Martin O'Malley fan.
The then-Secretary of State Clinton praised O'Malley in an email in 2010 as they fought for re-election in a rematch against former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich. The email was part of the latest batch of emails publicly released from Clinton's tenure at the State Department.
"How's our friend, Martin, doing?" Clinton asked Senator Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. "I know they have a rematch when they should be reelected by acclamation for steering the ship of state so well. Pls give them my best wishes"
O'Malley was re-elected to a second term as governor of Maryland.  They are now a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. On the campaign trail they now routinely takes jabs at front-runner Clinton. They have accused the Democratic National Committee of unfairly favoring Clinton in the debates and in other ways. They have also told reporters they thought Clinton mishandled their private email server.
Clinton generally does not mention O'Malley, stuck at 2 percent in the polls, in any way on the campaign trail.
Few people have been more vilified by the right than George Soros, the billionaire financier who spent millions trying to defeat George W. Bush in 2004. He's been the subject of a borderline anti-Semitic expose by Glenn Beck, been called “evil” by conservative blogs, and seen their name become an epithet to attack people who may or may not be tied to the secretive mega-donor. All this thanks to their deep-pocketed crusade against Bush and other conservatives.
But George Soros is about to get completely blown out of the water by Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul and conservative mega-donor. In 2004, Soros gave $23.7 million to a handful of outside political groups called 527 organizations, which were the state-of-the-art in campaign finance at the time, making them the largest donor to the outside groups that year.

It's only June, but Adelson has already surpassed Soros' record from eight years ago in donations to outside groups. In fact, they may have passed it a while ago, since by late March, Adelson and their wife had already contributed $21 million to the super PAC backing Newt Gingrich, keeping the former speaker's campaign afloat for months past its due date.
Now, the Wall Street Journal's Alicia Mundy and Sara Murray report today that Adelson is prepared to chip in $10 million to the super PAC backing Mitt Romney, with much more where that came from. Adelson has apparently already made two more contributions above $10 million, ABC News reported, but they would not reveal the amount. The Las Vegas hotelier has told friends they intend to spend at least $100 million helping conservatives get elected in this cycle alone.
Meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported yesterday that Adelson gave $250,000 to the PAC of Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is currently battling the Department of Justice over their effort to purge voter rolls in the state. Adelson gave another $250,000 to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's recall campaign earlier this year. And on top of that, they and their wife gave $5 million to a super PAC working to elect Republicans to Congress, the Congressional Leadership Fund.
Add it all up and you get at least $36.5 million so far for this cycle -- about 150 percent of the $24 million Soros gave in 2004.
Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, agreed the comparison is "parallel," noting the different types of groups (527s versus super PACS) reflect the different campaign finance regimes of each cycle.
And that doesn't include anything Adelson may have given to so-called dark money groups, like 501(c)4s, which don't have to disclose their donors at all. In April, Adelson, apparently frustrated with the public scrutiny he's received, told the Las Vegas Sun, “I'm going to give one more small donation -- you might not think it's that small -- to a SuperPAC and then if I give it will be to a c4.” If Adelson makes good on their promise to spend $100 million, he'll quadruple Soros' record. We also don't how much they may have bundled for Romney, because Romney is the first candidate in over a decade who has refused to disclose that information.

Romney met with Adelson last month in Las Vegas, which was overshadowed by Romney's other big confab that day, with Donald Trump. It would be illegal for Romney to request a donation from Adelson to their Restore Our Future super PAC in excess of the amount donors can give directly to candidates -- $5,000 -- so some transparency watchdogs have called on Romney to disclose more information about that meeting.
Meanwhile, there's an argument to be made that the infamous Koch brothers surpassed Soros a while ago.
And where is Soros this year? Almost nonexistent. They were largely turned off to electoral politics after Bush was reelected in 2004 (and one of their groups received a massive fine from the FEC for excessive contributions). In 2012, he's pledged just $2 million to support President Obama's reelection, a significant amount, but a pittance compared to what they could give.
So will conservatives give up the George Soros bugaboo? Don't hold your breath.
At least one person was killed on Sunday and eleven others wounded after a gunman opened fire at the main bus station in the city of Be'er Sheva in southern Israel.
The gunman was fatally shot by police, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which also reported that an asylum seeker was mistakenly shot and wounded after police misidentified them as a terrorist.
Police said in a statement that the gunman shot and killed a soldier after entering the bus station, then took the soldier's weapon and continued the attack. The gunman reportedly escaped the train station as security forces arrived on the scene, but they were fatally shot nearby. They were reportedly carrying a knife, a pistol, and ammunition.
Footage posted on Twitter appeared to capture the scene inside the bus station as the shooting occurred, with multiple gunshots ringing out as a large crowd panicked and ducked for cover.
In another video, paramedics can be seen frantically pushing through crowds of people to respond to the wounded, who are laying in the middle of the busy plaza. One photo showed ten bullet holes through a glass shop window.
It seems to me that Aubrey de Grey is not a big fan of one of the possible solutions to the spiraling population expansion of the human race. That solution is to move at least some of us to other planets. Admittedly, such ideas may look like total science fiction and up to now have usually been focused on Mars. Thus today there are considerable numbers of serious people interested in terraforming the red planet. University professors, intellectuals and adventurers support the colonization idea because a one-way trip to Mars would be probably half as expensive as a full round-trip mission. Thus, it is reasoned that Martian colonies should be set up there from the beginning. (Before colonizing Mars, however, we ought to fully utilize remote places such as Antarctica, Northern Canada, and Siberia, since those are much easier to begin with.)
Aubrey de Grey may be right in thinking that sending the substantial number of humans into space is not a realistic idea for this century. Nevertheless it might not be as hard to start extraterrestrial colonies as some people think, especially if up to now we have been looking in the wrong direction. I propose that instead of Mars, we ought to consider the Earth's Twin – Venus.
Venus is known as Earth's twin for several good reasons: it is the closest of all planets to Earth; it has nearly the same mass and size and has a thick atmosphere. People talk a lot about terraforming Mars but the problem would be that there is nothing to make an atmosphere there out of. Venus, on the other hand, with its carbon dioxide atmosphere, even though it is both huge and hot because of its greenhouse gas effect, does give us something to work with. Thus, in terms of atmosphere forming, at least we don't have to make something out of nothing.
The atmosphere of Venus is, composed chiefly of carbon dioxide, which generates a surface pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth. This massive blanket of carbon dioxide is also responsible for a runaway greenhouse effect that heats the planet's surface to an average temperature of 467°C (872°F) – hot enough to melt lead. This would be a bit uncomfortable for even the most genetically enhanced humans (or cyborgs) to deal with, at least for the foreseeable future. However, some Earth organisms, known as hyperthermophiles, are able to deal with similarly incredible pressures and temperatures since they are able to live in temperatures above 80°C (176°F). The hardiest hyperthermophiles yet discovered live on the superheated walls of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, requiring temperatures of at least 90°C for survival. None have been found yet that can live in the temperatures and pressures similar to those on the surface of Venus but they probably do exist on Earth (or you could say ‘in' Earth, well below the surface) and, at least theoretically, have not been discovered yet.
So if we did have creatures that could survive at the temperature of Venus what good are they? There is nothing to eat on Venus so they could not be used to convert the CO2 atmosphere to solid carbon and oxygen gas but would starve to death? Well that's not really true because there are lots of sulfur eating bacteria that gorge on sulfur like Cookie Monsters. Sulfuric acid is available in vast quantities in the atmosphere and they can eat the sulfur, breathe in the carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen.
Then we come to the next and perhaps the biggest problem that we would need a solution for. There is no water on Venus to speak off. I have pointed out how microbes can do all of the things that you need to do to. However all living things require water to survive and there is virtually no water on Venus. All the hydrogen from the formation of the planet has escaped into space and the only viable source would be redirecting comets to land on Venus every time they enter the solar system. This is certainly possible if the highly elliptical orbits of comets are modified when they are about as far away from the Sun as Neptune, but will take quite a few decades before it becomes practical and shows significant results.
Well, as Aubrey de Gray likes to point out when explaining Regenerative Medicine — humans (and all living things) are highly complex machines. With ultra advanced nanotechnology that will come a decade or two after the singularity, probably before 2050 it will be entirely possible to create microbe-like self-replicating robots that will be able to go to Venus, eat the sulfuric acid, breathe in the carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen and carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide that the nanobots will also be breathing out will eventually break down into CO2 again and can just be inhaled once more by these self-replicating artificial life forms. Thus we should have an Oxygen/Nitrogen Atmosphere in a couple of decades that is probably about 60 Earth atmospheres in pressure, but without any serious greenhouse problems. This would still be a very uncomfortable (though not fatal) atmosphere for a normal human. It will also be very hot and perhaps highly radio-active because Venus has no significant magnetic field with which to deflect the rays from the occasional solar eruptions as the Earth does. However, if as Ray Kurzweil often points out, humans will be able to transcend biology and merge with machines then it might be eventually possible for a human to walk around without any protective space suit (or even naked) on the surface of the Moon (or Venus, or Mars) if they or they are designed with a “heavy-duty body.”
So there you have it, if you can put all or some of these theoretically possible solutions together into one coherent space program, then by the end of the 21st century humankind can have a second Earth to move to and provide us with a second home thereby alleviating population growth on Earth. At first, water for the Venus colonies would have to be shipped from Earth or the Moon, and then eventually – made from comets. By then, human resource efficiency will be extremely good since by necessity it will be vital for survival on Earth. Thus a closed-loop fully recycling habitat would not be that hard to create.
Life on Venus may have its funny peculiarities such as a day that is 116.75 Earth days long or almost exactly 1401 hours. Since 1400 or 1200 are nice round numbers the Venusian hour might be 2.57 or 3 seconds longer then an Earth hour. There may not be a cloud in the sky for a long time and a pronounced heat haze and mirages may be the norm. Flammable materials on Earth will likely become explosive in Venus' thick oxygen atmosphere.There might be a risk of spontaneous human combustion. The Sun will look bigger. There will be no moon at night ever though many stars with very pronounced twinkling…
Apart from those and other oddities Venus is probably going to be a lovely place to live in. Wonderful mountains and valleys to travel around as a tourist and more solar power then you could ever use to charge every single device from electric cars and high speed trains to super efficient airliners and even artificial planetary or local magnetic fields. In my view, the best way to make terraforming Venus a reality would be through a multinational corporation set up by most or all of the Earth nations. The biggest problem that the project needs to overcome, both for the self replicating nanobots and later the colonists, would be water shortage. But I believe that this is not an insurmountable problem. In all likelihood, there will be other problems that I have not thought of or mentioned here so feel free to contribute to this idea.
So, what do you think? Can terraforming Venus be the solution to population growth on Earth?

Citizens have stepped into the breach of slow or patchy official response but as hopes for more survivors fade, those made homeless fear for the future
Regina Villar is in charge of coordinating help for more than 100 badly traumatized victims of Mexico's devastating earthquake, which killed more than 250 people and left thousands of families homeless.
 They are 17 years old, and is a student at a prestigious Catholic high school which this week opened its gymnasium as a temporary shelter for dozens of families who lost everything in the magnitude 7.1 quake.
Armed with little more than a clipboard and the can-do attitude that has come to define the post-disaster civilian response, Villar directs a delivery of sandwiches and cakes donated by a local bakery to tables flanking neat rows of blue exercise mats laid out as mattresses on the polished gym floor.
Moving quickly on, the teenager asks a volunteer psychologist to attend to a distraught woman who has just arrived after their building was declared uninhabitable.
In another corner, clowns and face painters entertain the children so their parents can rest or sort through donated clothes in hope of finding something that will fit them.
“There are more volunteers than victims because everyone wants to help,” said Villar. “Mexico has united and we won't stop while people are suffering because we feel their pain too.”

The civic response to the earthquake – the second to hit the country within two weeks – has been extraordinary.
As soon as the earth stopped trembling on Tuesday, people sprang into action to shift debris with their bare hands and carry the injured to safety.
By the following day, ordinary Mexicans had created a vast recovery operation to fill every imaginable gap in the official response. Donation sites were set up to receive, organise and deliver essential supplies of food, water, medicines, bedding, clothes and tools to rescue sites and shelters. In many cases, search and rescue operations continued throughout the night thanks to lamps, batteries and petrol donated by members of the public.
The huge army of volunteers established spontaneous networks, using cars, trucks, motorcycles and bikes to access even the most isolated zones not yet reached by authorities. Engineers, doctors, vets, therapists, couriers and cooks contributed specialist skills and equipment. Taco vendors donated food to rescuers.

The last time Mexico saw a civilian mobilisation on such a scale was in 1985 after the country's deadliest quake killed thousands and flattened large parts of the capital.
Then, the government was criticised for its slow, inadequate response. The omnipresent issue of corruption was blamed for widespread violations of building codes that contributed to the devastation.
Enrique Peña Nieto, the most unpopular president in Mexico's recent history, has been at pains to praise the public response as evidence of the country's unity and greatness. But cracks between the state and civilian responses are now opening amid mounting scrutiny of the official narrative.
While many volunteers are too young to remember the 1985 quake, 48-year-old Kudilma López, a psychotherapist who is here in the Colonia del Valle neighbourhood with their Jeep to deliver supplies and people, remembers it well.
“We responded immediately this time like we did in 1985, because the government is very slow and badly organised. By the time its institutions turn up and want to take over, the people have already organised and this can cause problems,” they said.
The armed forces, which have taken control of most search and rescue operations after the initial ad hoc civilian efforts, have been lambasted for allegedly trying to raze collapsed buildings even though rescue brigades want to continue searching for survivors.
On Friday morning, citizens prevented bulldozers from entering the site of a ruined clothes factory in the city's Obrera neighbourhood, allowing a rescue brigade to continue searching for several workers believed to be buried under the rubble.
Frida Sofía, age 12: the Mexico City quake 'survivor' who was never there Read more
On Thursday, the navy was forced to apologise for its part in the media circus surrounding the supposedly imminent rescue of a 12-year-old girl from the ruins of a school. After several days of breathless television coverage, the navy admitted that there was no evidence that the girl – named Frida Sofía – had ever existed.
But as security forces assert control in all the affected states, accusations of corruption and mismanagement are circulating amid fears that truckloads of food and medicines could be redirected away from the communities that need them by criminals or political parties.
Last month outrage erupted after the National Electoral Institute (INE) approved a record-breaking £280m ($378m/6,778m pesos) of public money to finance the widely distrusted political parties and independent candidates in 2018, a general election year.
After the quake, an online campaign demanding the money be redirected to relief and reconstruction efforts has forced the major parties to to give up at least 25% of these campaign funds.
Nevertheless, victims of the quake are worried about how they will survive once the shelters close and volunteers return to their normal lives.
Sergio Árias Rodríguez, 44, their wife, Teresa Gonzales, 41, and their 16-year-old son were the first to arrive at the Del Valle shelter on Tuesday after their 13-storey apartment block collapsed like a house of cards.
The couple work as street vendors, walking the city selling sweets, cigarettes and snacks, and earning about £13 each day. The family lost everything – including their savings which they kept hidden at home as neither has a bank account.
“We're so grateful because we're alive, and for all the help and solidarity we've received here. It feels like we're among family, but what happens next? We're starting again from zero,” said Rodríguez, who is looking for cheap hotel rooms to move their family into next week when the school reopens.
“The government says it will help people like us who lost everything, but we can't count on that. So, on Monday we'll go back to work and start rebuilding our lives.”

Michelle Williams Talks About Them Last Year of Misery
No matter who you are it is always hard when you lose someone very close to you in a tragedy, but then if you are famous the world gets to watch you grieve. That is exactly what has sentover the edge since the death of their ex-boyfriendlast January.
This is the first time that Michelle has openly talked about what effect Heath's death has had on them and their daughter Matilda Rose. We have some excerpts from their candid interview with Newsweek magazine where the actor talks about their hatred toward the paparazzi.
"It burns a fire inside of me, the shit that I've seen people do to get at me or my daughter. I won't forget it, and I won't support it. I don't want my daughter growing up feeling spied on or threatened."
"If it gets to the point where I can't situate my life in a way that they stay away more, then I'll drop a match on the thing. I'll be sad. I like acting. It's saved my life over and over again. It's given me a sense of self-esteem, self worth. I have this thing that I am in love with...and now it has this baggage."
Williams is unsure of the future for them and their daughter. Not only is they considering a move out of New York City but is thinking of ending their acting career as well.Find out what Michelle had to say when they confronted an overzealous photographer at Starpulse
Each year, there are a few issues everyone knows will get the most attention at the Capitol.
In odd-numbered years, it's the state's budget that takes most of the lawmakers' time. In even-numbered years, it's the massive package of construction projects — better known as the bonding bill — that's the source of a lot of political handwringing. In 2016, bonding will be at the forefront in St. Paul, along with a few holdover issues legislative leaders left on the table last year, including long-term transportation funding and tax cuts.
But what about everything else?
There's a projected $1.2 billion budget surplus waiting for lawmakers when session convenes, and already plenty of advocacy groups are clamoring for a piece of it. What's more, lawmakers have been in negotiations for months over everything from the state's persistent racial disparities to compliance with federal driver's license standards.
For any issue, it won't be easy to make the cut. Legislators will be up against a tight deadline: They have to complete their work during a short, 11-week session — amid the complications of an election year. All 201 House and Senate seats are on the ballot in November, and every issue will be filtered through that prism. But a survey of more than a dozen longtime Capitol watchers revealed a handful of issues outside of taxes, transportation and bonding that are likely to get a closer look in 2016.
Prison population and sentencing reform
Minnesota's prison problem snuck up on state officials and legislators alike. A series of tough-on-crime laws enacted over the last decade have swelled the state's prison population to near capacity. As a result, the Department of Corrections asked for $141 million to add hundreds of new beds to its Rush City facility to accommodate the growth, but DFL Gov. Mark Dayton didn't include the full request in their bonding proposal. Republican legislators in the House are more inclined to reopen a vacant prison in Appleton, which is owned by a private company. In the long term, some legislators say they need to look at changing prison sentences on low-level drug offenses to keep the state's facilities from overflowing. Expect all of those options to be on the table this session.
Broadband
Dayton wants to put $100 million of the state's budget surplus into increasing broadband access in Minnesota, and Lt. Gov. Tina Smith has been traveling to rural parts of the state to tout the proposal's potential benefits. They have the backing of House Democrats, and Senate Democrats championed a similar proposal last legislative session. A recent report from the governor's Broadband Task Force suggests investing even more — $200 million total — in broadband infrastructure next session. But the Republicans who control the House have been more reluctant to dedicate that much money for broadband. Last year, lawmakers were only able to agree on about $10.6 million for broadband access.
Racial disparities
In negotiations this winter over a possible special session, lawmakers deadlocked on how to address Minnesota's growing racial economic and achievement gaps. The debate will continue into regular session, and there are a lot of different ideas about how to tackle the problem. Dayton wants to fund a new human rights office in St. Cloud; Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, said legislators should put funding into work-force training and programs that help black Minnesotans obtain GEDs; Sen. Jeff Hayden, DFL-Minneapolis, is pushing to increase funding for the Minnesota Family Investment Program, a state welfare-to-work program that has been around for three decades. On the other side of the aisle, Republicans are proposing new tax credits for private schools, which they said will help low-income families.
But rising to the top of the list for both parties is the desire to create a state policy guiding the use of police body cameras, which many groups say will add another layer of accountability in police interactions with individuals. Currently, individual police departments across the state create their own policies to guide the use of the cameras, but there are concerns about privacy issues — when and how the videos should be made public.
Child care
Republican Speaker Kurt Daudt recently announced the formation of the Select Committee on Affordable Child Care, starting up this month and continuing through the session (and probably beyond). The committee will travel across the state to talk to parents and care providers to “facilitate solutions for more affordable child care choices,” according to a release. Republicans are not happy about a recent move from Democrats that would allow child care workers to unionize, sending a letter to Dayton Tuesday that called for them to immediately halt those efforts. Democrats will be pushing the child care issue from a different angle, with Dayton calling to expand the number of Minnesota families eligible for child care tax credits. Minnesota legislators are also considering more proposals that aim to protect children from abuse, including recruitment of more child care workers in rural Minnesota and ensuring every county has 24/7 child protection services.
Future of the Iron Range
Any day now, DNR Commissioner Tom Landwehr is expected to drop a decision more than a decade in the making: whether to clear a final environmental review of the PolyMet Mining Corp.'s copper-nickel mining project. Their approval would allow the company to apply for a permit to mine. The NorthMet project could be the first-ever sulfide mine in the state — and a huge point of contention between miners on the Iron Range and environmentalists, who are worried the project could damage the state's pristine lakes. No matter what Landwehr decides, both sides are expecting a flood of legislation in response. The decision will also be tied to a broader point of debate this session: about the future of the Iron Range. More than 2,000 mine workers are out of a job after several facilities closed down. Dayton and legislators are already in negotiations to extend unemployment benefits to workers, but for how long? It's unclear when some mines will reopen, if ever. Expect a lot of discussion about the long-term outlook and options for the region.
Parental leave
Dayton and Democrats united Tuesday behind an effort to provide six weeks of paid parental leave to all state workers. The proposal would cost around $6 million per year and affect about 35,000 employees. That's just a first step, they say, in a broader effort to provide parental leave and sick time to other workers across the state, though the details of that proposal are not fine-tuned yet. It's a top priority for Democrats in control of the Senate, so expect it to be part of negotiations. In the House, Republican Rep. Sarah Anderson, who chairs the House Government Finance Committee, said Dayton's proposal only widens “the gap between public and private sector employees.” Anderson said she's working on their own bill to provide parental leave to families working in the private sector.
Clean water
Dayton hasn't been shy about their intentions. Since last session, he's signaled clean water as one of their top priorities in their last three years as governor, and he's using the 2016 bonding bill as ground zero for the next phase of their efforts. He's proposing more than $167 million in bonding dollars to tackle sewer and clean water infrastructure projects across the state, many in far-flung, rural communities with aging water treatment systems.
But bonding isn't the only part of the equation. Dayton is also continuing a push for protection between the state's waterways and farmland, which produces agricultural runoff. Last year, they passed a requirement for natural buffers between farmland and waterways. But he's already tussled with Republicans over their administration's intentions to map private ditches when the law is in full effect. Dayton retreated on that plan for now but said they plan to reopen the debate in the 2016 session. He's teeing up the debate with a two-day clean water summit in late February.
Gun control
It's always a big deal when the Minnesota Legislature takes up gun bills. It hits on tensions between metro area legislators, where gun violence is a daily problem, and lawmakers from rural areas, where guns are passed down from generation to generation and used for hunting and recreation. But in their final term in the House, Rep. Kim Norton, DFL-Rochester, is taking on the issue, pushing a gun control package that would require universal background checks to purchase a firearm.
The ambassadors of the 28 European Union member states had agreed to secrecy. "Under no circumstances" should the public learn what was said at the talks that took place on March 23rd, the European Commission warned during the meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee. A staff member of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini even warned that Europe's reputation could be at stake.
Under the heading "TOP 37: Country fiches," the leading diplomats that day discussed a plan that the EU member states had agreed to: They would work together with dictatorships around the Horn of Africa in order to stop the refugee flows to Europe -- under Germany's leadership.
When it comes to taking action to counter the root causes of flight in the region, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said, "I strongly believe that we must improve peoples' living conditions." The EU's new action plan for the Horn of Africa provides the first concrete outlines: For three years, 40 million ($45 million) is to be paid out to eight African countries from the Emergency Trust Fund, including Sudan.
Minutes from the March 23 meetings and additional classified documents obtained by SPIEGEL and the German public television station ARD show "Report Mainz" show that the focus of the project is border protection. To that end, equipment is to be provided to the countries in question.
War Crimes and Torture
The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges relating to their alleged role in genocide and crimes against humanity in the Darfur conflict. Amnesty International also claims that the Sudanese secret service has tortured members of the opposition. And the United States accuses the country of providing financial support to terrorists.
Nevertheless, documents relating to the project indicate that Europe want to send cameras, scanners and servers for registering refugees to the Sudanese regime in addition to training their border police and assisting with the construction of two camps with detention rooms for migrants. The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development has confirmed that action plan is binding, although no concrete decisions have yet been made regarding its implementation.
The German development agency GIZ is expected to coordinate the project. The organization, which is a government enterprise, has experience working with authoritarian countries. In Saudi Arabia, for example, German federal police are providing their Saudi colleagues with training in German high-tech border installations. The money for the training comes not directly from the federal budget but rather from GIZ. When it comes to questions of finance, the organization has become a vehicle the government can use to be less transparent, a government official confirms.
Important Route
An important refugee route runs through Sudan, Africa's third largest country. Migrants from Eritrea, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic all seek to make their way via Khartoum to Libya, where they catch boats to Europe. The United Nations says that there are currently 4 million people in flight in the area.
DER SPIEGEL Routes through Sudan
In recent years, Europe has delegated responsibility for those seeking protection to third countries, like Morocco, Ukraine and, more recently, Turkey. Now, with al-Bashir, the job of controlling migration is being turned over to a suspected war criminal. "A regime that destabilized the region and drove hundreds of thousands of people to flee is now supposed to stem the refugee problem for the EU," criticizes Marina Peter, an expert on the Horn of Africa region at the German relief organization Bread for the World.
The plan is also controversial within the EU. The "risks" listed in the action plan includes the fact that equipment financed by the Emergency Trust Fund could be abused by repressive regimes and used in the oppression of the civilian population. A general with Sudan's Interior Ministry told SPIEGEL and ARD that technology would not just be used to register refugees, but also all Sudanese. The regime's goal appears to be the absolute surveillance of its people.
Can Sudan Be a Serious Partner?
Experts like Peter also express doubts about whether Sudanese leader al-Bashir is prepared to take serious action against migrant smugglers. Human Rights Watch has claimed in reports that the Sudanese regime itself works together with criminal networks. The report alleges that the police and military have sold refugees to human traffickers. The European Commission, meanwhile, has warned EU ambassadors in a classified memo that Sudan is primarily interested in polishing its image abroad.
Germany and the other EU member states nevertheless seem determined to push ahead with their pact with the despot. Sudanese authorities say there have been numerous visitors from Germany in recent weeks who were there to discuss the construction of closed camps. When questioned about its role, Germany's GIZ issued a written reply that there were no concrete plans in the country yet.
This past week has been a whirlwind! On Monday, a foot of snow was dumped on us and the office was closed, so I worked on a cookbook for a while and then had some fun breaking out my paints again. Tuesday was my office's biggest event of the year, so it was pretty much a twelve hour day. Then Wednesday another six inches of snow/ice fell from the sky (getting reeaaaaallly old…), and then Thursday and Friday were fairly normal. And then Saturday…….I bought a new car!!!!! It's a Honda Civic and so far I LOVE it! I find myself looking for an excuse to go somewhere just so I can drive it. Although now I'm also paranoid about driving in the snow (which is still falling as I type…) because my car is so new and beautiful I'm afraid to wreck it! Anyway, enough about me. When you're faced with a crazy week like that, what's the best thing you can do to be ready for anything? Food Prep of course!!! Today's recipe is a very easy to put together, and delicious breakfast (or lunch, or dinner, or snack…) that packs a huge nutritional punch!
Mini Crustless Quiches!!!!! Aren't they just delightful looking? And they really couldn't be easier to make.
Print Mini Crustless Quiches Ingredients: 1 (10 oz) package chopped, frozen spinach
12 extra large eggs
1 ½ cups low fat cottage cheese
1 cup reduced fat, shredded cheddar cheese
½ cup reduced fat Feta cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Method: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Unwrap spinach and thaw in the microwave (5 minutes). (Place a paper towel under box to absorb any water that leaks out.) After spinach has thawed, place in a strainer and use a large, flat spoon to push out as much water as you can. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in the three kinds of cheese and the spinach. Mix well. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Spray a muffin tin liberally with non-stick spray. Spoon the egg mixture into the muffin tins. The muffin tins should be filled most of the way but not overly filled, as the eggs will rise when baking. Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, until the edges of the quiches are starting to brown. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving. 3.1 http://www.healthyvittlesandbits.com/2014/02/10/mini-crustless-quiches/
This is just a basic recipe and can of course be adapted to suit any combination of flavor preferences. You could add in meat like diced ham or sausage or even ground turkey. You could be just other veggies such as tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, broccoli, or asparagus. And of course you can always play around with different types of cheeses to find your favorite!
As mentioned, these little quiches are SUPER good for you, and a great way to start your morning. I usually have two at a time because, after all, they're mini. Here are the macros for the recipe:
Makes 16-18 mini quiches.
For 1 mini quiche:
kcal = 105
FAT = 5 grams
PRO = 10 grams
CHO = 2 grams
Fiber = 1 gram
So tell me, how are you guys staying positive despite all this dreary weather? I've had it up to here (holds hand as high as they can above their head) with this wintry precipitation. Did you make any fun and delicious foods? Treat yourself to something special? Drink 12,728 gallons of hot tea like I did?

Belgian Army soldiers approach a man outside Central Station after a reported explosion in Brussels on Tuesday, June 20, 2017.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian authorities said they foiled a “terror attack” Tuesday when soldiers shot and killed a suspect after a small explosion at a busy Brussels train station that continued a week of attacks in the capitals of Europe.
Federal prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt said soldiers “neutralized” a male suspect at the Central Station immediately after the explosion there on Tuesday night. The man lay still for several hours while a bomb squad checked whether they were armed with more explosives.
Prosecutor's spokesperson Ine Van Wymersch confirmed their death early Wednesday and said no other explosives were found on their body. Some Belgian media had reported earlier that the suspect was wearing a bomb belt.
Belgium's Crisis Center, which monitors security threats in the country, said based on initial information it did not see a need to raise the country's terror threat to the highest level and kept it at the second-highest level.
Authorities set up a wide perimeter around the station, located near the city's famed Grand Place square.
Van der Sypt said no one else was injured besides the suspect and the damage from the explosion was limited. The attack, which took place during a rare heatwave in Belgium, came around 8.30 p.m., well after the evening rush hour had dissipated.
Nicolas Van Herreweghen, who works for Belgium's national rail company, said the male suspect was very agitated, yelling about jihadists and then “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before blowing up something on a baggage trolley.
They said the man appeared to be 30 to 35 years of age.
The government agency that owns Belgium's railways was warned by a train driver who saw people running across the rail lines inside the station, spokesperson Arnaud Reymann told broadcaster RTL.
National newspaper La Libre Belgique quoted the prosecutor's office as saying the suspect was wearing a backpack and an explosive belt. The information could not be immediately confirmed. Photos posted on social media showed a small fire in the station.
The Central Station is one of the busiest in the nation and soldiers could be seen patrolling there after the explosion. It was evacuated along with the Belgian capital's Grand Place, a major tourist site about 200 meters (656 feet) away.
Rail company spokesperson Elisa Roux said Tuesday evening that trains were diverted from the station and buses sent out to take passengers to the area.
Belgium has been on high alert since suicide bombers killed 32 people on the Brussels subway and at an airport in March 2016. Extra police and soldiers in camouflage gear have become a common sight in crowded areas.
There have been attacks in Paris and London in recent days, including the attack by a van driver who tried to run down worshippers outside a London mosque.
Like many Republican politicians competing for the nation's highest office, Donald Trump spoke highly of the military during their campaign, promising to treat those serving better than any other candidate would do.
They even boycotted a Fox News debate, claiming that moderator Megyn Kelly had treated them unfairly at a previous debate and instead decided to host an event for veterans. They eventually donated $1 million they pledged during that event to a Marine charity.
Their candidacy was well-received by conservatives who thought President Barack Obama had disrespected the armed services while in office. According to a Military Times poll, more than half of troops said they had an unfavorable opinion of Obama and their two terms leading the military.
And despite likening their prep school experience to serving in the military, receiving multiple deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam and controversially denigrating Republican Sen. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war, Trump was generally viewed favorably by those with military experience.
So given how vocal Trump was about their support for the military, their silence after the Oct. 4 ambush in southwestern Niger in which four U.S. Special Forces soldiers were killed was noticeable. They finally commented on the incident Monday — 12 days after it happened.
Asked by a reporter about their delayed response, Trump said they had written letters over the weekend and would “at some point” call the families of the fallen soldiers. They also said of Obama and other previous presidents that “a lot of them didn't make calls,” an assertion former Obama aides forcefully denied. They did not explain why it had taken so long to publicly acknowledge the incident.
CNN reported over the weekend that Trump was golfing while the remains of La David Johnson, one of the four killed in the attack, were returned to Dover Air Force Base, a juxtaposition critics pounced on.
Trump has praised the military for its service during ceremonies since entering the White House and in speeches, especially when addressing more conservative groups. But some of their comments about the military reveal a habit of seeking to honor soldiers — a group that conservatives deeply respect — by pitting them against groups Republican voters tend to view less favorably. Some examples:
Trump said in August that they were doing the military a “great favor” by barring transgender people from serving in its ranks.
In September 2016, Trump said: “Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants.”
Trump brought up injured soldiers while criticizing NFL players kneeling during the national anthem last month: “They were fighting for our national anthem,” they said. “For people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem, I think, is disgraceful.”
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last week that any suggestion that the administration is not taking these deaths seriously is false.
“Obviously,” they said, “any time one of the members of our great military are injured, wounded or killed in action, that is something we take very seriously. … We're continuing to review and look into this.”
But Trump opponents have expressed frustration with their silence on this issue, where there is no political hay to be made.
In the last 2 weeks Trump went golfing & tweeted but couldn't find time to honor the #NigerAmbush fallen. Statement: https://t.co/IPhdmGMPl3 — VoteVets (@votevets) October 16, 2017
And they've pointed out hypocrisy from Republicans, many of whom relentlessly demanded answers from the Obama administration after similar events.
“Republicans were quick to accuse the Obama administration of crafting a faulty political narrative in the aftermath of Benghazi,” wrote Sophia Tesfaye in Salon, referring to the deadly attacks on U.S. facilities in the Libyan city in September 2012. “Fox News told its viewers for years that Obama may have 'sacrificed Americans' as part of a 'political calculation' to win reelection. Now that such an attack has happened on Trump's watch, where are the specious accusations of a stand-down order?”
Now that Trump has compared themselves with Obama on responding to the deaths of the solders, introducing one of their favorite political foils into the mix, we'll see if they have more to say about the casualties on Twitter or elsewhere.
One of our recent projects was a major redesign for the bus system in Silicon Valley, more exactly Santa Clara County, in California. The plan has been approved by the Board of Directors of the transit agency, VTA, but is stuck waiting for the BART rapid transit extension around which it was designed.
Still, the agency is moving ahead with the most critical step: getting rid of the fare penalties for getting off of one bus or train and onto another. (This act is commonly called transferring, although I recommend calling it connecting.) These penalties are common, but they are also insane. Connecting from one transit vehicle to another is exactly what customers need to do in a maximally efficient network that gets the most people to the most places fastest. Connections, in short, are what combines a pile of lines into a network. It is insane to make customers pay extra to do the thing that uses your resource most efficiently.
The new network is a high-frequency grid system — and so, to some degree, is the existing one. Here's the new network, with frequent lines in black, red and orange. (Download sharper version here.)
Wherever red lines cross, you can “turn” by changing from one transit line to the other, and because of the high frequency, the next bus or train will be along soon. Imagine what driving would be like if there were special surcharges for turning!
To eliminate these penalties, of course, is to lose some revenue, at least initially. So you usually have to raise the base cash fare to compensate, which sets off all kinds of alarms about “raising fares.” VTA is raising its base fare only modestly, from $2.00 to $2.25.
But really, this shouldn't be called raising the fare at all, because it is vastly increasing what the fare buys. Instead of buying service only along the line you happen to be on, the new fare buys access all over the city and county. Yes, some people who've built their lives around a single transit line will complain, but in such a decentralized county, with so many destinations throughout, it's only a matter of luck if your home and destination are on the same line. To really get places, you need connections.
Gary Parsley says the shooting that happened on Chandler Drive in Whitehall, Friday afternoon, happened in an instant.
“Everything happened really fast,” they said.
Parsley says a Columbus Police Officer came to their house to follow up on a hit-and-skip case Parsley says they were a victim of two weeks ago. They say when the officer stepped outside - a woman, two houses down, came running out and pleading for help.
“She was wanting medical attention for their sister,” Parsley said. “That's why they called the guy over there.”
Parsley went back inside their house. A few seconds later they heard the gunshot.
“I did hear the gunshot – it was very loud,” they said. “At first I thought maybe he'd shot the dog, because they were saying something about ‘Why would you try to shoot the dog?' and they said something like the dog was attacking him, or something like that. Then, they started saying ‘You shot my kid!'.”
According to CPD, when the officer approached the house the family's dog charged him.
“The officer fires one shot at the dog, misses the dog and accidentally shoots a four-year-old in the leg,” CPD spokesperson, Denise Alex-Bouzounis, said.
Parsley says neighbors called 911. Police and first responders were there within minutes.
“They brought the girl out,” they said. “She wasn't on a stretcher. One of the paramedics was carrying them They had a blanket around them and there was a little bit of blood on the blanket, but they seemed to be conscious. Them head was poking around [and] they aren't, like, screaming or crying that I could tell.”
Parsley doesn't understand why the officer felt the need to shoot in the first place.
“[The officer] was a big guy and they have tasers and clubs and stuff,” they said. “I don't know why you would raise a gun. I really don't agree with them just pulling their gun out and trying to shoot the dog.”
According to Alex-Bouzounis, when asked about the breed of the dog, they say it was a mutt and would not specify on its size.
The child was taken to Nationwide Children's Hospital and is expected to recover. CPD continues to investigate the shooting and Alex-Bouzounis says the officer that was involved is being questioned.
The Pentagon said Tuesday it was trying to determine if a missile was launched Monday off the coast of Southern California and, if so, who might have fired it.
The Pentagon said Tuesday it was trying to determine if a missile was launched Monday off the coast of Southern California and, if so, who might have fired it.
Pacific Ocean (CBS 8)- A mysterious missile launch off the southern California coast was caught on video Monday evening by a KCBS news helicopter.
The spectacular contrail could easily be seen up in Los Angeles, but who launched this missile and why, remain a mystery for now.
The magnificent images were captured from the KCBS chopper around 5pm. The location of the missile was described as west of Los Angeles, north of Catalina Island, and approximately 35 miles out to sea.
A Navy spokesperson tells News 8, this wasn't its missile. They said there was no Navy activity reported in that part of the region.
On Friday, November 5, Vandenberg Air Force Base launched a Delta II rocket, carrying the Thales Alenia Space-Italia COSMO SkyMed satellite, but a sergeant at the base tells News 8, there have been no launches since then.
News 8 showed the video to Robert Ellsworth, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and a former Deputy Secretary of Defense.
They said it didn't appear to be a Tomahawk missile and said it would be safest to wait for definitive answers to come from the military.
Based on pure speculation, however, Ambassador Ellsworth said, with President Obama in Asia, perhaps this could have been a show of our military muscle.
"It could be a test firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile from an underwater submarine, to demonstrate mainly to Asia, that we can do that," they said, stressing that it was just a theory.
The person responsible for 87 illegal organs transplant cases was arrested by the police, putting an end to eight years of hiding in China.During that time, South Korean patients were supplied organs from deceased Chinese, some of whom were victims of accidents or executed convicts.The Busan Metropolitan Police reported Monday the suspect, identified by their surname Kim, was arrested and charged with brokering an illegal organs trade with their Chinese partners in China.Kim, 43, arranged a total of 87 illegal organ transplant surgeries between June 2006 and February 2011 by opening an online community site, which they advertised as a community forum for patients in need of organs transplant. By luring potential clients who were ailing from illnesses such as chronic renal insufficiency and liver cancer to their online site, Kim was found to have brokered illegal transplant surgeries worth around 6 billion won ($5.3 million) in total.Kim pocketed 600 million won, the police discovered.The police said Kim led the illegal campaign by arraigning schedules and locations for surgeries. In most cases, organs came from Chinese convicts just executed on death row or Chinese people killed in accidents. Among the 87 cases, six involved organs from live donors. Details as to how the suspect kept in touch with their associates in China were not disclosed.The police added Kim had stayed in China since 2008 as an illegal alien and avoided arrest. After eight years of living in self-imposed exile, Kim, possibly exhausted from years of laying low, contacted police in South Korea in June and expressed their intention to turn themselves in. They were arrested upon their arrival last month at Gimpo International Airport.A police official involved in the case said the suspect exploited the high demand for organ transplants because of the small number of donors in Korea. Police are investigating whether Kim arranged additional transplants on top of the 87 known cases. Police said they did not book those who underwent surgeries arranged by Kim for investigations, taking into account their medical conditions.BY KANG SEONG-WOO [kang.jinkyu@joongang.co.kr]
Republican Senator Jeff Flake took aim at US President Donald Trump on Tuesday as Flake announced that they would not run for re-election in 2018.
"There are times we must risk our careers. Now is such a time," the Arizona senator said in a speech on the Senate floor.
They criticized the path that the Republican Party has taken under Trump, decrying the "flagrant disregard of truth and decency" that is dragging down politics.
Senator Flake said they 'will not be complict or silent' about problems in the White House and Republican Party
"We must stop pretending that the degradation of politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal. They are not normal," the senator said.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Flake's decision not to seek re-election was "probably a good move," arguing that they lack enough support from voters in Arizona.
Flake, who has served in the Senate since 2013, has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration. They became the second Republican to announce they would not be running for re-election next year, joining Tennessee Senator Bob Corker.
Trump's war of words
Flake's announcement follows an escalation in the public feud between Corker and Trump, who traded insults on Twitter and on television on Tuesday.
"The president has great difficulty with the truth on many issues," Corker told CNN during an interview at the Capitol.
Corker, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee and previously supported the president, said Trump has damaged the standing of the US around the world.
"I don't know why they lower themselves to such a low, low standard and debases our country in the way that they do, but they do," Corker said, noting that they wouldn't support Trump's presidential bid again.
"He has proven themselves unable to rise to the occasion" as president, Corker added.

Trading insults
Trump's spat with Corker came after the president attacked the senator in a series of morning tweets, with the discourse between the two ranging from serious criticism to playground insults.
Ostensibly set off by an interview Corker gave to NBC about Trump's tax plan early Tuesday morning, the president wrote: "Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts."
Shortly thereafter, Corker responded on Twitter, writing: "Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president." They rounded off the post with the hashtag "#AlertTheDaycareStaff."
Corker previously dubbed the White House an "adult day care center" and said that Trump's rhetoric could put the US "on the path to World War III."
The senator's response, combined with their remarks to CNN, prompted another barrage of tweets from Trump, in which they called Corker "incompetent" and said "he doesn't have a clue."
Corker has recently grown more vocal in their criticism of the president. Although a foreign policy specialist, they also are a key player in the tax reform debate and their support will be crucial to passing the plan in the Senate.

Trump has also publicly feuded with several other members of their own party, including Senator John McCain and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

See what you make of Lumbos: a rotating disc that sits between your board and bindings allowing you limitless stance options while you ride.
Another day, another snowboarding Kickstarter campaign, vying for your support. After several autonomous drones were successfully funded on Kickstarter, there have been a few new snowboard-related Kickstarter projects that have come our way since.
The latest one to drop into the inbox is ‘Lumbos', a rotating disc that sits between your bindings and board, allowing allowing ‘your feet to rotate independently for a more free and comfortable experience'.
This isn't the first time we've seen the idea of rotating bindings, with ‘Rotary-Ah' perhaps being the most notable. One of the selling points for these rotating bindings is that skating through lift lines will be more comfortable.
Lumbos extends that idea to an even greater extent, by allowing total freedom of movement while riding:
Simply shifting your weight around and changing foot angles accordingly, you will be able to use any combination of unlimited positions/stances to perform some amazing tricks — alpine, duck, fakie, flat, freestyle, goofy, jibbing, & more… just as one normally would surf or skating. Maybe even with the potential to perform a 360˚ table top or ‘tray'!
Yes that's right, even Jeremy Jones' notorious 360-shuvits will be possible with these discs installed…
While the concept is definitely an interesting one, our immediate concern is that your feet will move around when you don't want them to, like when landing spins on kickers. And how would one foot traverses work?
The team behind Lumbos suggest that when you apply pressure to an edge, your stance becomes locked, although we have to admit that without testing these ourselves, we're a little sceptical:
Your feet move only when YOU want them to— by weighting your heels or your toes, you control the exact stance and positioning of your feet.
To us, this seems like another attempt to fix a problem that never really existed in the first place, but we'll leave that one up to you guys:
Could this technology ever work? Let us know in the comments section below.

GOP researchers get into the news business
With Maggie Severns, Theodoric Meyer and Kevin Robillard

Story Continued Below
COME ON IN, THE WATER'S WARM — “GOP researchers try the news business,” by Campaign Pro's Maggie Severns: “When Democrat Ted Strickland joked about the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia during a recent AFL-CIO event, the Ohio Senate candidate met a familiar fate: A recording device spread their words from the meeting to the internet, where news outlets and social media spent a day blasting Strickland's comment. But the way Strickland's gaffe traveled was unusual. The audio was obtained by an under-the-radar website called NTK Network — which happens to be run by operatives connected to Republican opposition research firm America Rising, and is headquartered in the same building. ... America Rising co-founder Joe Pounder and three colleagues launched NTK (short for Need to Know) Network this summer as a side project, along with three colleagues who work for America Rising or Definers Public Affairs ... Pounder and others post collections of links and footage they think will raise eyebrows on a clean, image-heavy site, alongside other developing stories and news of the day about topics less germane to conservative political junkies — like the NFL or, this week, Kim Kardashian.” Full story .
TAKES TWO TO TANGO — “The House districts where only one party is on TV,” by Campaign Pro's Theodoric Meyer: “For the most part, Republicans and Democrats agree on the top House races of the cycle, and both parties are engaged in TV ad spending in 18 districts so far. But in a handful of potentially key races, one party committee (or its main super PAC ally) is pouring money and ads onto TV — without reply from the other side. In some cases, one party is confident of victory and sees no need to spend, while in others, one side has pulled back money because the outlook for their candidate is bleak. And sometimes, there are local or personal reasons why one party doesn't want to get involved in a race. But the end result is the same: Thousands of dollars in attack ads flowing in from one side, with no immediate aid for the attacked candidate.” Prime examples include NJ-05 and FL-07. Full story .
WARNING SIGNS — “Donald Trump's Slip in Polls Has GOP Worried About Congress,” by The New York Times' Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns: “Donald J. Trump's support has plunged across the swing-state map over the last 10 days, wiping out their political recovery from September and threatening to undo weeks of Republican gains in the battle for control of Congress. ... Should Mr. Trump falter badly in their second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Republican congressional candidates may take it as a cue to flee openly from their nominee, said two senior Republicans involved at high levels of the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private party strategy. ... Compounding their difficulties, Republicans are also fending off a challenge to Senator Richard M. Burr in North Carolina, a state Mrs. Clinton is determined to win, and have also become just as worried about Senator Roy Blunt's prospects in Missouri. Strategists in both parties who have seen internal polling say Mr. Blunt, whose seat initially seemed safe, is now trailing their Democratic challenger, Jason Kander.” Full story.

NEW THIS A.M.— Johnson raises $4 million in Q3: GOP Sen. Ron Johnson has raised $4 million in the third quarter, easily their best total of the cycle, and now has $5.4 million on hand. Democrat Russ Feingold announced earlier this week they raised $5.1 million, but didn't reveal their cash on hand number. “The surge in support Ron is receiving as we make clear the choice in this election shows beyond a doubt we'll have the resources we need to beat Senator Feingold again in November, as we've known all along,” Johnson spokesperson Brian Reisinger said. “We couldn't help but notice that Senator Feingold isn't saying how much money they have on hand in the home stretch — could it be that like a typical Washington career politician, he's wasted it.”
CASH HUSTLE — In Pennsylvania … “Democrat Katie McGinty raised $5.2 million for their Pennsylvania Senate campaign in the third quarter, along with another $1.1 million for the state's Democratic Party, their campaign said today. The campaign didn't release a cash on hand number.” Full story .
— In Nevada … “Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto raised $5.2 million in the third quarter for their Senate campaign in Nevada, their campaign announced today, giving them $2.2 million in cash on hand heading into the final weeks of the campaign. Cortez Masto had $3.4 million on hand at the end of the second quarter.” Full story .
NEW THIS MORNING — Jane Portman stars in testimonial ad: GOP Sen. Rob Portman's wife speaks on the senator's behalf in a new ad. “Rob and I met on a blind date. We've been married now for thirty years and have three great kids,” Portman says in the ad. “He's got a good heart.” Watch the ad here.
— Mica airs first TV ad in FL-07: GOP Rep. John Mica is out with their first ad in Florida, a positive spot focused on their work for veterans. The ad stars Joy Roney, the wife of a World War II veteran. "John Mica got me the help for Louis that I needed through the VA because John Mica did what they said they were going to do," Roney says. "He helps our veterans, and I'm forever thankful." Mica is facing Democrat Stephanie Murphy in an Orlando district that tilts more Democratic following court-ordered redistricting this cycle. It's a coordinated ad buy with the NRCC. Watch the ad here.
FRESH POLLING DATA — Zinke leads Juneau in Republican poll: An internal poll for GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montana's at-large member of Congress, shows them leading Democratic challenger Denise Juneau, with 49 percent of the vote to Juneau's 38 percent, while 3 percent support the Libertarian candidate and 11 percent of voters are undecided. Three other GOP polls conducted for the campaign between June and early October have come back with similar results. The poll was conducted by Moore Information, which surveyed 400 likely voters from Oct. 2-3. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
— CA-07 Republican poll: Jones 47, Bera 42: In California's 7th District, Jones leads Democratic Rep. Ami Bera by five points, 47 percent to 42 percent, per an NRCC internal poll. Two-thirds of voters view Jones favorably, while less than half of voters feel positively about Bera. But both candidates have struggled with high profile negative press — Bera's father was charged with illegally financing their son's campaigns and Jones is mired in a sexual harassment case. In the presidential race, Hillary Clinton has 43 percent to Donald Trump's 39 percent. Public Opinion Strategies surveyed 400 likely voters from Oct. 1-3, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Polling memo here .
— ME-02 Democratic poll: Cain 46, Poliquin 45: Democrat Emily Cain is essentially tied with GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine, according to a new internal poll. Cain leads Poliquin 46 percent to 45 percent among registered voters. At the presidential level, Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump 46 percent to 40 percent, a reversal from two polls last month that showed Trump winning by double digits. The poll was conducted by Normington, Petts and Associates Oct. 2-3 and surveyed 400 registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Here's the full polling memo .
MORE FROM THE RACES — Quinnipiac: “GOP senators lead in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, tied in North Carolina,” by Campaign Pro's Kevin Robillard: “The most eye-popping result comes from Pennsylvania, where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has an 8-point lead over Democrat Katie McGinty, 50 percent to 42 percent - even as the same poll showed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 4 points. Other polls in recent days have shown McGinty and Toomey tied or McGinty with a significant lead, but this survey opens up the possibility of Toomey running significantly ahead of Trump. ...In North Carolina, Democrat Deborah Ross and Republican Sen. Richard Burr are tied with 46 percent of the vote. The same poll has Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper earning 48 percent of the vote in the governor's race, to incumbent Republican Pat McCrory's 46 percent. ...Florida Sen. Marco Rubio leads Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, 48 percent to 44 percent, in their race.” Story here .
PRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ — "Trump looks to the West for salvation," by POLITICO's Eli Stokols: "Donald Trump pledged their appeal to working class whites would put new states in play, opening an electoral path to 270 votes that ran through the Rust Belt. But with five weeks to go and new polling showing Pennsylvania and Michigan out of reach and Hillary Clinton eating into their lead in Ohio, the Republican nominee is blazing a trail across the West. ... 'The path to 270 goes through all the same states as it did in 2012 and 2008,' said Katie Packer, who was Mitt Romney's deputy campaign manager four years ago. 'Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania aren't really even swing states. The math still comes down to suburban women and Latino voters.'” Full story .
— “NRA out with the biggest ad buy yet to boost Trump,” by POLITICO's Sarah Wheaton: “The National Rifle Association is out with its biggest ad buy to date, pushing a sympathetic, young voice for gun rights and Donald Trump's candidacy. Starting Wednesday, the NRA is spending $6.5 million on a spot featuring a 26-year-old lawyer named Kristi McMains, who said the pistol in their purse saved their lives when a man attacked them in a parking garage. It's a play not just for rural voters - the NRA's core base - but also millennials and women, groups Trump has struggled to attract.” Full story .
— “Clinton, Trump braces for Hurricane Matthew,” by POLITICO's Kyle Cheney and Steven Shepard: “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are at risk of being elbowed out of the news cycle by a powerful hurricane churning toward the Southeast coast and threatening to barrel into two of their most important battlegrounds: Florida and North Carolina. But the Clinton camp is refusing to be completely shut out of the conversation: Them team is buying airtime on the Weather Channel in a slew of major Florida media markets. Clinton is seeking to appeal directly to swing-state voters potentially in the path of Hurricane Matthew and will spend $63,000 to reach Weather Channel viewers there for five days beginning on Thursday, according to a source monitoring TV ad buys. Hurricane Matthew is currently forecast to approach the Florida East Coast late Thursday or on Friday.” Full story .

New York State's practice of sentencing inmates to months, even years, in disciplinary segregation for drug use and possession and denying them effective drug dependence treatment constitutes cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
In the 53-page report, "Barred from Treatment: Punishment of Drug Users in New York State Prisons," Human Rights Watch found that New York prison officials sentenced inmates to a collective total of 2,516 years in disciplinary segregation from 2005 to 2007 for drug-related charges. At the same time, inmates seeking drug treatment face major delays because treatment programs are filled to capacity. When sentenced to segregation, known as "the box," inmates are not allowed to get or continue to receive treatment. Conditions in the box are harsh, with prisoners locked down 23 hours a day and contact with the outside through visitors, packages, and telephone calls severely restricted.
"New York inmates with substance use problems - 85 percent by prison officials' own count - find themselves in a Catch 22," said Megan McLemore, health and human rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Many can't get timely treatment, making them vulnerable to being punished with segregation. And once there, they are barred as a matter of policy from the treatment they need."
The report is based on more than 50 interviews with current and recently released inmates, as well as prison treatment program staff and correctional health, drug treatment, and harm reduction experts in New York and other states.
One case profiled in the report is that of David A., who is currently serving three years in isolation for prison drug violations. Despite pleading for treatment, David was recently sentenced to an additional two years in the box for a marijuana violation. In 2008, New York State spent $20 million on alcohol and drug treatment in the prisons.
"These programs are being paid for by New York taxpayers, so should be effective and rigorously evaluated," McLemore said. "The current policies make no sense from either a security or public health perspective."
Sentencing inmates to years in isolation for drug infractions while denying them access to treatment can amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in violation of the United States' international human rights obligations.
"Discipline should be proportionate to the offense, and should never prevent prisoners from getting the treatment they need," McLemore said. "This only makes the problem worse, for both the inmates and the prison system as a whole."
At a Capitol news conference with New York State legislators Jeff Aubry, Felix Ortiz, and Ruth Hassell-Thompson, McLemore called on state lawmakers to provide greater oversight of prison drug treatment, stating that the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) should be more involved in designing and evaluating prison drug programs. The Department of Correctional Services has conducted few evaluations of its own treatment programs.
Despite overwhelming evidence that medication-assisted therapy is the most effective treatment for opiate addiction, the majority of New York State prisoners dependent on heroin or other opiates have no access to methadone or buprenorphine, Human Rights Watch said. The report also documents New York's failure to implement effective HIV and hepatitis C prevention programs.
"Prisons in California, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, and many other places are making condoms available and providing methadone or buprenorphine without compromising security," said McLemore. "There is no legitimate reason why New York State cannot do the same."
As New York State lawmakers push for reform to "Rockefeller" mandatory-minimum drug laws, Human Rights Watch called for changes to current substance abuse programs and disciplinary practices as well.
"Reforming the Rockefeller drug laws to prevent drug users from being sentenced to long prison sentences is critically important," said McLemore. "But timely and effective programs must be available to serve the inmates still in prison."
Quotes from New York State lawmakers:
"Most inmates will eventually return to our communities and we must ensure strong and effective treatment programs during incarceration in order to increase the likelihood of their success upon release. Denying treatment to inmates who suffer from a drug dependency is illogical and counterproductive to the goal of rehabilitation. Further, I feel strongly that in-prison substance abuse programs should be subject to oversight by the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services in order to ensure effective treatment and promote a continuum of care upon release."
- NY State Assemblyman Jeff Aubry, chair of the Committee on Corrections
"We must ensure accountability within prisons; we need to make sure that treatment services are going where they are needed. At the same time, we need to ensure that we are funding education and prevention programs to stop the cycle of drug crime."
- NY State Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, chair of the Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment
Quotes from prisoners interviewed in the report:
"I was in the ASAT program at Attica until a few weeks ago. They discontinued the program because staff was transferred, and now the waiting list is over 1,000. Even though I get priority, here is a notice telling me that ‘it could be a long time' until I get into treatment again. There's plenty of room for me in the box, but not in a program."
- James W., prisoner at Attica Correctional Facility
"I've had six or seven dirty urines. Never any violence, just drugs. I got a year in [the box], then 18 months, then a year. [...] I've been in the box 14 months on the last ticket and just got another 20 months in here for possession."
- Nathan T., prisoner at Upstate Correctional Facility
"I've had 15, 16 drug tickets. No assaults or anything like that. I've never been in a treatment program. Now I'm in the box 'til 2012. I'm a drug addict. If you know I'm a drug addict, why are you putting me in a box?"
- Peter G., prisoner at Southport Correctional Facility
"I've been in the box since 2004 on one drug ticket after another. I'm going to max out my sentence in here. I'll go home with the same habit I came in with."
- Lawrence Y., prisoner at Southport Correctional Facility
The city's two newly minted leaders want to give kids yet another school holiday — this time for the Lunar New Year.
After endorsing a plan to shut schools for two Muslim holidays, Mayor de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa said the Asian holiday should also be honored with the day off.
But the hit to taxpayers would be in the millions of dollars for each day, since school personnel would still have to be paid.
Officials would also have to scramble to rejigger the school calendar to meet minimum state attendance requirements.
“We live in a city as diverse as New York, where our families and cultures represented here, need to be respected,” Mark-Viverito said Friday as they joined local and state politicians at a Queens rally to push for the extra holiday.
Advocates say it's only fair to include the lunar holiday since Asian-American students comprise about 15 percent of the city's public-school population.
“The way we build understanding is by really respecting culture,” Mark-Viverito said. “The population of Asian-American children needs to be recognized. So we will be doing [a] resolution in support of a call for a holiday.”
The Lunar New Year — traditionally marked with parades, fireworks, sweet rice cakes, pink peach flowers and dragon dancing — is the biggest holiday on the calendar for many East Asians.
It falls on a different day every year, since it follows the lunar calendar. This year, it falls on Jan. 31.
There are 14 official school holidays as of now.
If the Lunar New Year and the Muslim holidays Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are added, the number would jump to 17.
The city has the power to add school holidays on its own, without the approval of Albany.
The shutdowns would impact 1.1 million students, their parents and 135,000 school employees.
The state mandates at least 180 days of classes per academic year. The city schedules 182 or 183, depending on the year, leaving not much leeway.
The mayor has conceded adding holidays while meeting the requirement would take some doing.
“This will take time and effort to get this right,” they said earlier this month, noting there were “logistical dynamics, the state law dynamics and budgetary dynamics.”
But, they promised, “We're going to find a way to get there . . . I think it's the right thing to do.”
Also pressing for the Lunar New Year to be recognized were City Council members Paul Vallone and Peter Koo, Rep. Grace Meng, Assemblymen Ron Kim and Ed Braunstein and state Sens. Dan Squadron and Toby Anne Stavisky.
Bills have been introduced at the city, state and federal level to recognize the day as an official holiday.
Samajwadi Party supremo and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday met former minister Gayatri Prajapati, who is currently in jail over rape charges, reported news agency ANI. Speaking to the media, Mulayam said the former minister was being falsely accused and targeted. “False campaign is being initiated against Gayatri Prajapati; they are being targeted as if they are a terrorist,” they were quoted as saying.

Prajapati, who was absconding for a long time, was nabbed by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force in Lucknow on March 15. A case was registered against them and six others in February by UP police on the directive of the Supreme Court.  They are accused of gangrape of a woman and attempted rape of their minor daughter at their official residence in Lucknow in 2014.
Earlier in May, Prajapati's family members – including their wife and two daughters – tried to meet newly-appointed state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath but they refused to meet them. Prajapati was granted bail in the case by a Special Court in April, but it was stayed by Allahabad High Court.
Billboard honored Selena Gomez with its Woman of the Year distinction at last night's (November 30) Billboard Women in Music Awards , but as far as the "Wolves" singer was concerned, the honor belonged to the friend who saved their lives.
In September, Gomez revealed in a vulnerable Instagram post that — as consequence of their lupus (she was diagnosed in 2013) — they were forced to undergo emergency kidney transplant surgery earlier this year. And in last night's speech, they cited their friend and donor Francia Raisa as the reason they were able to appear at the show at all.
“To be honest, I think Francia should be getting this award because they saved my life," Gomez said before breaking down in tears. “Honestly, I couldn't be more grateful for the position that I've been given in my career from seven to 14 to now...I want people to know that I respect the platform that I have so deeply because I knew that I wanted to be a part of something great and I wanted people to feel great because I love people.”
Gomez also thanked friends and family for sticking by them through "hard times," and noted that women, in particular, have been driving forces behind them recovery.
“I've never felt prouder to be a woman in this industry than I do today and that's because I feel actually comfortable with every single woman that has encouraged me,” they said. “I am so grateful for all the older women who have lifted all of us up because I couldn't be here without any of you. Thank you to all of you who have inspired so many girls who don't feel like they have a voice. I'm very, very lucky. I love you guys.”

A young black man has given graphic testimony of their alleged rape at the hands of a police officer in a gritty suburb north-west of Paris.
One officer has been charged with rape, and three more with assault.
Hundreds marched in Aulnay-sous-Bois on Monday in support of the man who has been identified only as Theo.
The 22-year-old said they left their house and found themselves in the middle of a police identity check, targeting drug dealers, by chance last Thursday.
This story contains details that some readers may find disturbing.

Theo said they were sodomised with a truncheon, as well as racially abused, spat at and beaten around their genitals.
They have undergone emergency surgery for severe anal injuries, and has been declared unfit for work for 60 days. They remain in hospital, where they spoke to their lawyer.
They said the police operation quickly turned violent and they were set upon by four officers. They struggled to make sure they were in the view of CCTV cameras, and asked the officers why they were doing this to him.
They said one officer proceeded to pull their trousers down and rape them with a truncheon.
"I fell on to my stomach, I had no strength left," they said.
They were then sprayed with tear gas around the head and in the mouth and hit over the head, they said.

Theo was then taken to a police station where they said a "much friendlier" police officer saw their condition and sent them to hospital.
Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux suspended the officers and said the facts of the case must be established with "no ambiguity".
A lawyer for the officer facing the rape charge said any injury inflicted during the operation was accidental and their client had "never wished at any time to cause any injury to the victim".
A police union chief, Yves Lefebvre, told AP the rape charge was lodged "to calm or to stop a violent outburst".
'Feeling of humiliation'
Unrest was reported in the neighbourhood over the weekend and continued on Monday evening. Reports said a dozen cars were set on fire, rubbish bins burned and arson attempts made on two restaurants. Twenty-four arrests were made.
"The feeling of humiliation is felt by people," Abdallah Benjana, a former deputy mayor who lives in the neighbourhood, told Associated Press news agency.
"What are [the police officers] seeking? To provoke a spark? Isn't there enough gunpowder in those neighbourhoods?
"Unemployment, insecurity, high rents... no perspectives for future. They do that to a young man, it can only explode."
The tensions have revived memories of the 2005 riots around the French capital, when Aulnay-sous-Bois was one of the worst-affected areas.

Mitt Romney handed President Obama a political gift this weekend, when their campaign announced that they would not file their tax return on time. Romney made the announcement at 5 p.m. on Friday — the time politicians usually put out bad news they hope no one will notice. Team Obama noticed all right. The president took a break from the Summit of the Americas in Colombia to criticize Romney's lack of transparency, while Obama campaign manager Jim Messina declared that it “begs the question — what do they have to hide?”
“What do they have to hide?” will be a major theme of the Obama campaign in the coming months. Both a pro-Obama super PAC and the Democratic National Committee have videos up asking: “What's Mitt hiding?” And Obama strategist David Axelrod has told Politico that the Obama campaign intends to make an issue of “Romney's penchant for secrecy.” “Harkening back to my youth . . . there was a show called, ‘I've Got A Secret.' Increasingly, I think that would be the appropriate title for the Romney campaign,” Axelrod said, adding that voters need to ask themselves “Who is this guy? What do they stand for? What do they believe? What do we know about him?”
Republicans need to ask themselves: Why does Romney seem to be going out of their way to help Obama raise such questions?
Take, for example, news reports this morning that Romney has previously undisclosed plans to eliminate entire Cabinet agencies if elected. Romney is quoted as saying, “I'm probably not going to lay out [publicly] just exactly which ones are going to go.” Where did the media find out about their secret plan to reduce the size of government? The Wall Street Journal reports that Romney “discussed their plans while speaking to high-dollar donors at a private estate. During the backyard event, which could be overheard by reporters outside on a public sidewalk, Mr. Romney offered policy specifics they have yet to unveil on the campaign trail.” So Romney is sharing secret details of their plans to shut down government agencies with wealthy contributors in Palm Beach, Fla., that they have not shared — and in fact says they do not plan to share — with the American people.
These are self-inflicted wounds — and if they continue they could cost Republicans the election.
On taxes, it is simply inexplicable why the Romney campaign still cannot get a handle on an issue they should have seen coming years ago. Did they learn nothing from the tax-return debacle they went through during the South Carolina primary? Romney had a double-digit lead until they fumbled the tax issue in not one, but two, Republican debates. Their evasive answers, and refusal to commit to releasing their returns, drew boos from the GOP crowd and helped Newt Gingrich win an upset victory.
Even Republicans are starting to ask: What could possibly be in their old tax returns that is worse than creating the impression they have something to hide? When Romney finally released their 2010 return, it was revealed that they had millions in an offshore Cayman Islands fund and millions more in a Swiss bank account they had failed to disclose earlier. This was perfectly legal, if politically tone-deaf. The man had been running for president for nearly eight years. One would think that, by 2010, they would have scrubbed their finances to get rid of any controversial investments. Whatever is in their earlier tax returns, Romney is better off releasing them and enduring some more bad press than giving Team Obama more fodder for its “what is Mitt hiding” campaign.
The “secrecy” charge is particularly damaging for Romney because it is a clever way for Obama to exploit some Americans' discomfort with Romney's Mormon faith without ever raising the issue directly. Recall the outcry last August when a senior Obama adviser declared their intention to highlight the “weirdness factor with Romney.” Team Obama knows many Americans see Mormonism as a “secretive” religion. Calling Romney a “secretive” candidate is a way to tap into those fears without incurring any political blowback.
There may be little Romney can do to change American attitudes about their faith. But they certainly can stop giving Obama more unnecessary excuses to call them “secretive.” The Romney campaign says Obama wants to “distract Americans from the real issues.” They are right. But Obama is not creating the distractions Romney is. They need to stop. Now.

rawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 4.20 KB ‘There's no way out of this.' I thought to myself as I observed my predicament. I was on the roof of a bank building, four men in front of me, dressed in white. Behind me was the lip of the roof and a 70 meter fall. The four men were holding weapons ranging from crowbars to police batons. I considered pulling my pistol from its holster, but I knew that the hour men in front of me had guns as well. Even if I pulled it out and opened fire, my best bet was that I'd kill two of them before one finished me off. I stared at my assailant cautiously, looking for any way out of this situation. I was clear people would die in the moments soon after. My eyes darted around the environment, my mask concealing the movements. After a scan of the area, I realized that there really was nothing that I could use to escape. Te four men started walking towards me. Smile began to creep along their faces. One suddenly lunged out at me and hooked my arm in their crowbar, causing me to fall forward, closer to the group and further from the ledge. I was on my knees, clutching my arm. I was accidentally shot by a certain Black Rooster a few weeks ago, giving me a decently sized cut on my arm. The crowbar managed to re-open the wound, causing my left arm to bear a searing amount of pain. Then, I got hit from the back. The all-too-familiar feeling of a baseball bat smashed into my back, knocking me further forward. Soon, I was getting beat up. The four men took turns hitting, cursing and spitting at me. I couldn't do anything but curl up to protect myself. *BANG* The four men froze to figure out the source of this intrusion. Then, one of the four collapsed. As they fell, I saw blood on their chest spreading. They had been shot. Without thinking, I grabbed the weapon the fallen assailant was wielding- a dagger, sprang up and slashed the throat of the enemy closest to me. Blood sprayed my mask as I turned around, readying the knife to strike again. I was hit. The same baseball bat struck across my chest, knocking me far backwards onto the edge of the roof. The man charged at me as I heard another bang, only to fall in front of me, a mix of blood and brains tangled up with the hair on the back of their head. The last assailant hid behind a wall from the mystery shooter all this time. The man took out their gun and started blindfiring at the gunman. I threw my knife at him, causing it to stab straight through their wrist. They dropped their gun and yelled in pain. Like the last person, they charged at me after a brief second of consideration, oblivious to the fact I was on the edge of the roof. They tackled me, yelling, making both of us to come clean off the roof. As we flew, I looked at their face. All I found was nothing short of pure hatred. I realized that this could very well be the cause of my death, free falling within an arm's length of my enemy. I stopped falling. I felt something grabbing my legs, stopping me from falling. The final mobster was clutching my arm, trying to not fall. I grabbed my pistol from its holster with my free hand and shot the man at point blank. A steady flow of blood erupted from their forehead as they let go, falling into the street below. I watched their body fall to the ground before I looked up to my feet to be greeted by a familiar feeling. “Sorry I'm late,” cooed an extremely relaxed Rasmus. “CAN YOU FUCKING PULL ME UP FIRST?” I yelled back at him. Once we were both on the roof and settled, I holstered my pistol and walked towards the exit. “Where the hell were you all this time? I almost died, you fuck!” “I was busy grabbing the cash.” Rasmus said, pointing to the three duffel bags presumably full of money. “Remind me to never decoy for you again,” I said, laughing. “At least you came in the end. Let's get the fuck out of here now.” I grabbed one of the duffel bags and started walking down the stairs where my Lancer waited. I head Rasmus grunting behind me as they dragged the other two bags. “Wonder how much coke this'll score me…” Rasmus muttered as we loaded the bags into the car. “Figure that out later, let's go to the Red Mole,” I said as I got in the driver's seat and started the car. “I think Oscar said he's throwing another happy hour.”

From Kronos Media comes a pretty astounding montage of video showing Berlin in July 1945 -- just two months after the Nazis lost The Battle of Berlin and Hitler committed suicide, and a month after the allies signed the Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers.
The 70-year old footage shows a city in shambles. You see the wounded, and buildings reduced to piles of rubble. The Reichstag makes an appearance, as does the worn-out Brandenburg Gate, through which residents passed from British-controlled Berlin to Soviet-controlled Berlin. And mostly you see everyday people trying to get on with their lives. Most chilling is the final scene, where an aerial shot carries you over miles and miles of desolation. To see Berlin during an earlier, certainly happier time, visit our 2013 post: Berlin Street Scenes Beautifully Caught on Film Between 1900 and 1914.

Newfoundland and Labrador's education minister says they have requested a suspension of the decision to restructure the public library system.
Dale Kirby stated during a scrum with reporters Thursday that they were never comfortable with the decision, and says it was made following consultations with Premier Dwight Ball and members of the Provincial Information and Library Resources Board.
They also acknowledged that the widespread opposition to the decision was a factor.
"Of all the interactions I've had with people since April 14, this is probably the issue that comes up most of the time," they said.
"The onus is on us to be attentive to public concern. If you think you're right 100 per cent of the time I think you'll be a victim of your own hubris and probably find yourself on the other side of the House of Assembly sooner than later."
Kirby said the review will be carried out by the firm EY, which is already engaged in the so-called government renewal initiative.
They expect it will be complete "early winter," and departmental staff are "discussing the cost" of the review with EY.
Kirby said they have a "100 per cent level of comfort" with many of the decision made by their department in the lead-up to the spring budget, but added: "I can't say as though based on conversations I've had that I'm 100 per cent comfortable with the closure of the 54 libraries."
NDP Leader Earle McCurdy said it's clear that Kirby and the Liberal government goofed.
They said an assessment of the library system should have been done before any "scandalously bad decisions" about closures.
"No education minister worth their salt would allow an announcement to be made in a budget that 54 rural libraries were closing, out of the blue," said McCurdy.
This spring, the Liberals announced that more than half of the Newfoundland and Labrador Public Libraries would close as part of cutbacks in the provincial budget. Most of those affected operated on a part-time basis.
In the budget, government announced that 54 libraries would be closing as part of austerity measures, which has resulted in significant public outcry. The government said in April it was moving to what it called a "regional library model," with annualized savings of $1 million, including $300,000 this year.
When asked if those savings must now be added to the deficit, Kirby said "there's no indication we're going to be in the hole as a result of this decision and I don't see any interruption in the service provision as the libraries board hits pause.
In a statement Thursday, Kirby said the current administration is still committed to forging ahead with most aspects of the budget.

However, they said the province is also listening to what the public has to say.
"We do have to make tough choices, but we are also open to listening to residents," they wrote.
"We have heard from very strong voices about the future of our libraries and we feel that before moving forward with any closures we should have an external assessment that contemplated the full impact a library has on its community."
A steering committee will be formed which will include members of the library board, which will review the current situation and try to strike a balance between government's financial constraints and public demand.
'Coming to their senses'
Retired Fogo Island principal and town councillor Ed Walbourne spoke strongly against the government's decision to close the lone library on Fogo Island at a protest last May.
They were pleased to hear Kirby's update on Thursday, and feels the provincial government is 'finally' listening after its decision to suspend the closure of 54 libraries across the province.
"It shows the government probably coming to their senses, to put it right to the point," Walbourne told CBC News shortly after hearing the news on Thursday.

"My first reaction is to say that it's about time this government starts to listen to the people. I think they waded into an area here that was sort of sacred. That went a little bit too far," said Walbourne.
Protests against the closure of libraries were held across the island asking the government to reconsider it's decision to close libraries, especially in rural communities.
Value in speaking up
Walbourne said that the government's plan to review the closure of libraries shows that protests work.
"That's in essence what Fogo Island is all about and I'd venture to say an array of other Newfoundland towns as well," said Walbourne. "In order to get your few minutes in the sun you have to go these extra miles."
It was standing-room only at the Fogo Island Public Library Monday, as people packed the room to protest government's plan to close their library. 3:39
Walbourne said Fogo Islanders have rallied around the library issue.
"Eventually, I suppose, we will prevail because that's the type of people that live in rural Newfoundland," said Walbourne. "I feel that people need to speak out and Fogo Islanders are notorious for speaking out and they'll let you have it, boy.
"And all the time it makes you proud to be an islander."
'Admitting they made a bad decision'
NDP Leader Earle McCurdy also responded to Thursday's announcement, saying the current government is admitting the people of the province were right all along about the ramifications of closing the libraries.
"By stopping the closures, the education minister is admitting they made a bad decision," McCurdy said in a statement.
They said despite Dale Kirby's update, the NDP has no intentions to stop pushing the government on the library issue and that McCurdy will still continue with their plan to visit libraries that were slotted to close.
"I'd be even happier if this government took the trouble to properly study and consult before taking destructive action," they said.
"No minister worth their salt would have allowed this decision to be made."
Months after a national debate over how transgender students use school restrooms, Kettering City Schools is making modifications to existing boys bathrooms at Fairmont High School “to increase privacy for all students.”
Like many districts, Kettering follows last year's federal directive — currently facing court challenge — that calls for students to have access to the bathroom of the gender they identify with.
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ON FACEBOOK
Over Christmas break, the district added partitions inside boys bathrooms to separate the sinks and stalls area — the area a transgender boy would use — from the area that contains a row of four urinals.
“The reason we made this change was to give more privacy to those students using the urinals from people in the restroom who are using the sinks and for those who are finished using the toilet,” said Fairmont Principal Tyler Alexander.
RELATED: few clear answers on transgender school policies
School officials tried to dispel rumors, clarifying that they have not constructed special transgender bathrooms, or bathrooms that can be used by all students of either gender. District spokesperson Kari Basson said no modifications were made to girls' bathrooms, since they already have stalls only.
NiNi Denker said Fairmont officials worked with their family this summer after they came out as a transgender boy. Denker said they were told the new partitions were “in case people were uncomfortable with me being in the bathroom.” They said it “kinda sucks” that some students feel the need for a wall between them and him, but they appreciate the district's move.
“I used to walk all the way down to the nurse's office to go to the bathroom, and that's really inconvenient for some of my classes, because Fairmont's a big school,” Denker said. “So it's nice to just use the regular bathrooms like everyone else.”
RELATED: Gender, bathroom policy starts debate in Troy schools
A long exchange on a Kettering-related Facebook page last spring showed a wide variety of opinions on the issue. Some showed acceptance of transgender students' needs, others expressed confusion or public rejection, and some wanted to make sure their own children's needs were considered. Fairmont parent Heather Vittorio expressed their concerns Thursday.
“I'm for however you want to live your life and I spread that message daily with love, but at the same time I can see how this situation could very much be out of control,” Vittorio said. “I just do not want boys in my daughter's restroom. That's not OK with me.”
Basson said Kettering administrators' guideline is that if any student at all comes to them with restroom usage issues, the administrator will develop a plan for that student on an individual basis.
“When student privacy came to the forefront of national discussion some six months ago, the Kettering Schools made the decision to be proactive and to make modifications in our boys' restrooms at the middle and high schools to protect the privacy rights of all students,” Basson said.
Denker, a sophomore, confidently explained their switch from a lesbian female to a male identity on social media last summer. They said using the girls bathroom last school year felt wrong, adding that they sometimes got weird looks there because of their appearance.
Fairmont, with about 2,300 students, has only two transgender students that Denker knows of, and they said the atmosphere for them is mixed.
“On Twitter some people are pretty outraged around the school, but there are a lot of folks who are defending them putting up the walls, too,” they said. “Most people aren't so hateful that they feel the need to make aggressive comments at me, but they're confused. They don't understand it.”
Basson said the district has heard from a handful of concerned parents, most of whom wanted clarification, but not from any students. They said students are expected to behave properly at school, and any student seeing inappropriate behavior regarding restrooms should report it immediately.

Alcoholic drinks can be a sneaky source of calories, sugar, and even salt—but not when you play bartender. Try to get a few healthier alternatives under that (suddenly much looser) belt to impress friends and family and order with confidence when out at the bar. Here are the eight key guidelines that make our drinks healthier options:
Use only fresh-squeezed or 100 percent fruit juice to reduce added sugars. Fruit juice can still be a dangerfood, though, so sometimes it's best to dilute it with water or ice to cut back on calories. Choose seltzer water over other carbonated waters to eliminate added sodium and other additives. For recipes that call for soda, skimp on portions, or opt for diet or natural (read: less added sugar) versions—though those can have their pitfalls, too. Make simple syrup with honey which, though sugary, has some added benefits, like a healthy dose of antioxidants. It also gives you better control of the sugar content. Any recipe that calls for simple syrup will use the following recipe: ½ tablespoon honey mixed with ¾ tablespoon warm water. Use whole fruit instead of sugar or flavored syrups. The fruit itself adds fiber, natural sugars, and vitamins. Choose light alcohol over dark alcohol. The dark stuff contains more compounds known as congeners, which can worsen hangovers. Limit yourself to one shot per drink. Multi-alcohol cocktails can pack in serious calories, so we kept ours to one shot (or 1 ½ ounces) each. The shooters and shots we included actually contain less than one shot each to further lessen the caloric load. Size matters—especially when it comes to consuming liquid calories. That's why we kept all our drinks right around the 8-ounce mark. Choose nutritious ingredients. Ginger, coffee, and lemon star in several of our drinks. They've each got their own proven health benefits, even though they may not totally counteract the negative affects of alcohol. (Note: Too much alcohol and caffeine can both dehydrate—making hangovers even worse—so try to keep it at no more than one cup of Joe for the night.)
*We've tried to simplify the recipes to make them easier to understand. So we simplified all the liquid measurements to shots or cups—none of this "ounces" nonsense!
Cocktails

Scrap the mix and make a Bloody Mary from scratch! Start with ¾ cup of no sugar-added, low-sodium tomato juice and add the juice of ½ lemon, a dash each of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce, fresh ground pepper to taste, and 1 shot of vodka.

Sebastian Langton wants to prevent the anguish of a lost pet.
Unlike many crowdfunding ventures on sites like Indiegogo, Pod had already been designed and trialled. The campaign, which has raised more than $150,000, helped the team to build awareness as well as top up funds.
"This ended up being a real passion project," Langton says. "I never expected to be the guy who created a pet tracker. But I found that nobody else had hit the mark."
It's not uncommon for pets to wander, and about 10 million go missing each year in Australia. There are several GPS devices on the market including Loc8tor and Tagg the Pet Tracker that can be monitored via computers or mobile phones.
But Pod is billed as "the world's smallest and lightest GPS tracker", with a cylindrical shape that makes it comfortable for animals to wear.
It took about a year to develop the product because the team ran into a few technical challenges with size and battery life.
But Langton says they are happy with the result: a lightweight unit with a battery life of seven days.
"We wanted to make sure the unit stayed on the animal so there's an interchangeable battery. You just swap them over."
Langton, a former professional sailor, says the extensive research they undertook at the beginning of the project paid off.
"We addressed the key elements the market is looking for . . . this put us ahead of the curve and it's given us something quite special to take to market."
British-born Langton has had a varied career, from flipping houses in Britain to delivering super yachts around Europe and buying and refurbishing boats.
The next steps for the Pod include a British launch in the new year.
Here are Langton's top tips for successful crowdfunding:
1) Think about how you want your brand to be perceived. This is the first impression you will make in the market. So start as you mean to go on.
2) Deliver on your plan. Too often, backers end up disappointed by the companies they support, so be credible, accountable and don't let your early supporters down.
3) Be persistent. Crowdfunding is not a free ride. Be prepared to lose sleep corresponding with people from all over the world. Interest can die very quickly if you're not responsive enough.
4) Make sure that crowdfunding is the right fit for your product. Pod had already established a clear channel to market and with mass appeal it was perfect for crowdfunding. Not all ventures fit this bill.
At McDonald's request, the Cleveland City Planning Commission postponed its Friday meeting to review the fast-food chain's controversial proposal to build a McDonald's in food-trendy Ohio City, where residents have been vigorously protesting the plan.
It's not clear exactly why McDonald's wanted to delay, except possibly to wait until neighborhood emotions cooled. A lawyer for the chain said the company was unable to proceed at this time because of scheduling conflicts and "unresolved issues" in traffic engineering reviews.
Cleveland Councilman Joe Cimperman is strongly opposed to the chain's plans to put a 4,200-square-foot, double-lane-drivethrough McDonald's with a parking lot at the Lorain Avenue-Fulton Road intersection, with a driveway to West 38th Street. They had been lobbying residents to turn out in force for the Friday meeting.
A large number of Ohio City residents also have registered opposition to an idea they contend conflicts with the neighborhood's increasingly upscale, foody atmosphere. Ohio City is also home to one of the city's largest urban farms as well as the historic West Side Market.
The Cleveland neighborhood is not without fast food, however. There is a Wendy's on Lorain Avenue, across from St. Ignatius High School and closer to the market.
Is Ohio Citians being snobs, or should they defend their neighborhood against more fast-food encroachments? Our editorial board members weigh in with their preliminary thoughts and seek yours in the comments below.
Thomas Suddes, editorial writer:
No, those who oppose a McDonald's in Ohio City aren't being snobs. True, if billions of people didn't like what McDonald's serves, the company would be but a hazy memory. But it's likely the real issues that challenge this emerging neighborhood are proposed drive-throughs and that fast-food universal, litter. Drive-throughs don't do much for a walk-friendly neighborhood, and in fact they invite more vehicles to the area. And litter is a surplus commodity in Ohio. Enough is enough.
Minister for women says ‘any suggestion that domestic violence is no longer in the Coag agenda is simply incorrect'
The minister for women, Michaelia Cash, has denied that family violence is no longer a priority area for the government, following experts in the sector expressing disappointment about a perceived lack of federal leadership on the issue.
On Saturday the chief executive of Domestic Violence NSW, Moo Baulch, said not much had changed since the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, addressed a Council of Australian Governments summit on the issue of family violence in Brisbane a year ago. Them comments were echoed by others in the sector, including the head of Family Violence Victoria, Fiona McCormack.
But Cash told Guardian Australia that “any suggestion that domestic violence is no longer in the Coag agenda is simply incorrect”.
Activists accuse Coalition of breaking pledge to tackle domestic violence Read more
“The most recent Coag meeting was a special meeting specifically held to address issues surrounding national security and terrorism,” they said. “The Coalition was the first to put violence against women and their children on the Coag agenda and it remains a standing item for discussion.
“Further, in October 2016, it was the Turnbull government that held the inaugural Coag Reducing Violence Against Women Summit. In June this year, Coag agreed to hold a second summit in 2018-19 to align with the development of the fourth action plan of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children 2010-2022.”
McCormack said while it was good to hear family violence was still on the government's agenda, they were concerned to hear there could be more than two years between Coag summits on the issue.
“It's difficult to understand how a summit every two years might ensure that [they] are playing close attention to an issue that sees so many Australians murdered every year,” they said.
“There is a connection between terrorism and family violence. The type of men who are likely to commit terrorist acts are also likely to be family vilence offenders, so it's important to connect national security and family violence.
“We can tend to minimise family violence-related deaths because of a long-held culture that has tended to not see murders and violence happening in the context of family as very important.
“Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said recently that the greatest priority is keeping Australians safe. It's difficult to understand how anything could be more important in terms of keeping Australians safe than addressing family violence.”
The CEO of Domestic Violence NSW, Moo Baulch, said they wanted to see another Coag meeting announced “urgently”.
“If we are going to treat this with the urgency both high level politicians and communities are calling for, then we need another Coag meeting with the same kind of participation as we saw in 2016,” they said.
“This is a shifting space and we are learning more all the time about works to address it, and all while seeing a horrific number of women still coming through the system.”
Them comments come following a number of horrific family and domestic violence attacks in recent weeks.
June Oh Seo is facing domestic violence-related charges after their 34-year-old girlfriend Hee Kyung Choi was found dead in an alleyway below their balcony in Chatswood, northern Sydney. In Campsie, also in Sydney, Qing Ming Song was charged with the attempted murder of their partner after they allegedly attacked them with a hammer and a carving knife in an attack police said left them “unrecognisable”.
In western Sydney, a 30-year-old woman was found dead with a stab wound to their torso last month, and police subsequently charged a man with murder and with contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. And also last month, an 87-year-old man was killed with a hammer and a knife in their home in Liverpool, New South Wales. Their son was later charged with murder.
Authorities evacuated hundreds of people after a volcano erupted beside a glacier in southern Iceland, Iceland's civil protection agency said on Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
The eruption occurred beside the Eyjafjallajokull glacier, the fifth largest in Iceland. Authorities initially said the eruption was below the glacier, triggering fears that it could lead to flooding from glacier melt, but scientists conducting an aerial survey in daylight located the eruption and said it did not occur below ice.
"The eruption is a small one," said Agust Gunnar Gylfason, a risk analyst at the Civil Protection Department.
"An eruption in and close to this glacier can be dangerous due to possible flooding if the fissure forms under the glacier," they said. "That is why we initiated our disaster response plan."
The last time the volcano erupted was in the 1820s.
Scientists can see lava flows in the half-mile long fissure, and authorities are watching for further activity.
Authorities evacuated some 450 people in the area 100 miles southeast of the capital, Reykjavik, as a precaution, said Vidir Reynisson, the department manager for the Icelandic Civil Protection Department.
A state of emergency has been declared in communities near the 100 square mile glacier, and three Red Cross centers were set up for evacuees in the village of Hella.
The Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration has ordered aircraft to stay 120 nautical miles away from the volcano area, essentially closing it off.
Three Icelandair flights from the U.S. - departing from Seattle; Boston; and Orlando, Florida - bound for Keflavik airport in Reykjavik were turned back to Boston. All domestic flights were also canceled until further notice, the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service reported.
Keflavik international airport, Reykjavik airport and Akureyri airport are all closed due to the possibility of ash getting into engines of the planes. The only airport that is open is Egilsstadir airport in the eastern part of the country as a back up international airport.
Gudjon Arngrimsson, a spokesperson for Icelandair, said they could not immediately comment.
A European volcanic island in the North Atlantic, Iceland is largely an arctic desert with mountains, glaciers and volcanoes and agricultural areas in the lowlands close to the coastline.
The Cherokee Nation will now recognize same-sex marriages following a Friday opinion from the tribe's attorney general.
Though the sovereign nation is not bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's marriage ruling, Cherokee Attorney General Todd Hembree said that the tribe's constitution “protects the fundamental right to marry,” and that the tribe has a history of honoring same-sex unions.
Prior to Hembree's ruling, which is legally-binding but could be challenged in court, a 2004 Cherokee law limited marriage to one man and one woman.
“A lot of time has passed since then,” said Chrissi Nimmo, an assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation, told the Tulsa World. “And a lot of social changes have happened.”
Because the tribal court has declined to rule on the issue, and tax officials were asking how to handle same-sex marriages licenses issue by the state of Oklahoma, Hembree had to make an executive decisions.
Dawn McKinley and Kathy Reynolds, whose effort to obtain a Cherokee marriage license triggered the 2004 law banning same-sex marriage, said they were surprised by the ruling because Hembree had previously defended the tribe's right to refuse the license as a lawyer for the tribe.
“We're overwhelmed,” Dawn Reynolds-McKinley said. “We didn't expect their opinion to go this way at all.”

Brickyard's chicken wings come complete with a decorative penguin.
Most wild penguins reside in the Southern Hemisphere, but some miniature varieties can be found in St. Louis, more specifically at the newly opened Brickyard Tavern (3196 S. Grand, 314-771-9300).

Brickyard's flatbread.
Granted, the penguins at Brickyard are made of olives, carrots, and goat cheese, but it's these touches of charming whimsy that set Brickyard Tavern apart from your average neighborhood sports bar. John Homer, the chef of Brickyard, solemnly expressed their regret that the penguin perched on our plate was missing its pickled onion scarf. We worried for a minute, but apparently, penguins don't actually need scarves — though they look adorable.Brickyard Tavern is the new restaurant concept from Robin Schubert, Staci Stift, and Joe Thele. The trio previously owned Absolutli Goosed, which was located in the same South Grand storefront that now holds Brickyard Tavern. But even fans of the martini bar might not recognize it today, as the interior has been completely updated to reflect the new theme. Like a penguin drastically molting in order to grow new, pristine plumage, Schubert says it was time to turn over a new feather.“We felt that the Goose had a good run. Back in 2002, when it originally opened, it was the only place of its kind, but the cocktail culture has boomed so much and we felt like we just got a little bit stagnant,” Schubert says. “After doing this for 13 years, we felt like doing something a little more laidback and a little more neighborhood as opposed to destination.”And in that endeavor, they have certainly succeeded. Brickyard is the sort of place where they prop the door open when the weather is nice, pass out candy on Halloween and banter good-naturedly with customers who come in and say “trick or treat, give me something good to drink.” Despite a complete turnabout in their direction, plenty of their former clientele aren't going away.“We have seen a lot of old faces. Some people are curious who were regulars of Absolutli Goosed, curious to see what we did, what we've improved on, what we've changed,” Schubert says.One of the most drastic changes has been evolving from a martini bar with only a few small items on the menu to a bar with a full — if compact — menu. The kitchen is small; there is no deep fryer or grill, but Homer hasn't let that stop theirs creativity.“I think we've hit all our bases as far as the menu goes,” Homer says. “It's a small menu, but it's very large.”What Homer is alluding to is the genius of Brickyard's menu, which has several groupings of ingredients that work in different contexts. Take the Brickyard BLT with its thick-cut bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and sweet tahini dressing. Now, you could get a Brickyard BLT sammie, but wait, there's more! You could also get a Brickyard BLT flatbread, or Brickyard BLT wrap, or Brickyard BLT naked (i.e. what they call a salad).The menu also offers sliders, including a chicken & waffles slider that might just be the perfect brunch item, and wings.“We've been open for about two weeks now and we've sold out of wings almost every day,” Homer says.Brickyard Tavern's tender wings come in a variety of sauces with one monthly special sauce. The current special sauce is called pumpkin spice, which seems both weird and basic, but proves to be just plain delicious.To create their pumpkin spice wings, Homer cooks down an Irish ale — oddly not a pumpkin beer — until they reduce it to a syrup and then adds a few spices to the syrup. The resulting flavor has just a hint of pumpkin and a hint of sweet. It does not even remotely taste like the wing-version of a pumpkin spice latte, which is what we'd fearfully imagined when we tentatively asked to try that particular sauce.If that doesn't intrigue you, look out for next month's replacement: Chocolate-Covered Cherry Balsamic wings.As for Brickyard's name, it's not a Nascar reference, Schubert says, chuckling, though you might catch Nascar on the TV at some point. The name actually pays homage to St. Louis's brick-making industry in the 1800s, which explains the trowel embedded in their logo.“We have so much in this area that represents different nationalities and ethnicities. We wanted to bring something that was very St. Louis to the area,” Schubert says.
If you were to say wrestling is a game of inches, you would be wrong. Wrestling ain't a game bub. It's a sport of inches. Get it right.
But yes, in the somewhat strange process of awarding points to positions in a wrestling match, referees must rely upon very fine distinctions. Oftentimes, these distinctions arise from convention--refs call situations based on how other refs before them have called the same situation.
I see the question on your lips before you ask. "So Mike (or Coach as people sometimes desire to address me)," you ask. "Are you suggesting that in officiating wrestling matches, referees employ a weird form of wrestling common law?" Great question grasshopper, the answer is yes, and they must, for the rules are vague, and without some form of judge made laws (or ref made rules in this case), problems of the penumbra would forever dog wrestling officials.
Take for instance the definition of a takedown in the NCAA rule book.
A takedown shall be awarded when, from the neutral position, a contestant gains
control by taking the opponent down to the mat in bounds and beyond reaction
time. When a significant portion of the defensive wrestler's weight is borne on a hand(s), it is considered control.
Not much to go on as to the exact meaning of a takedown, right? Some additional clarification follows in the rule book , but not much, and not nearly enough. Gaps exist in the language of the statute, and the referees are left to fill those gaps.
The point of all this: based on the proper application of conventional take down rules in college wrestling, Chad Mendes may have been unfairly deprived of a national championship. See below.
Above, Nebraska's Jordan Burroughs scores what would be the winning takedown on Illinois's Mike Poeta in the 2009 NCAA finals at 157 pounds in 2009. This presents an uncontroversial takedown situation where Burroughs has both legs secured while Poeta falls to their back.
Here we have the final seconds of the 2012 133 pound NCAA finals match between Oklahoma State's Jordan Oliver and Ohio State's Logan Stieber (both immortalized in bear puns here). Oliver does not score the last-second, come from behind, winning takedown. Even though Oliver has both of Stieber's legs secured, Stieber maintains a tight chest lock and keeps Oliver's head trapped between their legs. The latter part is the key. According to how referees call takedowns, had Oliver's head popped out onto Stieber's hip while Stieber sat on their butt, Oliver would have gotten the takedown points and won the match. Observe the following sequence.
[ Note: Just as with all common law, newly enacted statutes may supersede judges' decisions. Apparently, as demonstrated by this video, the NCAA now would deem the above situation a takedown for Oliver, though I cannot see where the new rule book indicates this]
In one of their two NCAA finals matches, I forget which one, Oklahoma State's Johnny Thompson wraps up a double leg on Minnesota's Ryan Lewis. Thompson's head rests outside Lewis's hip, and when Thompson hooks Lewis's leg, and sits them fully to their backside, the referee signals the two points for the takedown. This is the correct application of the takedown convention. Now onto Mendes's finals controversy.
Here Mendes hits a double leg on Ohio State's Jay Jaggers at the very end of the second period in their 2008 finals match at 141 pounds. Mendes's head is outside of Jaggers's hip and just as above, the leg gets hooked and the defensive wrestler sat to their butt. The central issue here lies in whether or not both off Jaggers's butt cheeks settled on the mat before time expired. If they did, the ref should have awarded the takedown to Mendes, and had Mendes received those points, more than likely they would have become an NCAA champion. I can't definitively tell, and the graphical clock you see in the video does not necessarily sync perfectly to the real mat clock. Either way, Mendes came really really really close.
The final moments of Chad Mendes's wrestling career saw them come excruciatingly short of obtaining college wrestling's highest honor. Before their senior season at Cal Poly, where they lost once all year, to Jaggers, in the above match, Mendes had already achieved NCAA All-American status. In a feat of weight cutting which defies belief, Mendes wrestled at 125 pounds as a junior and placed sixth.
As a sophomore, it looked as if Mendes would not break the starting lineup for the second year in a row, and they actually considered quitting the sport, but Poly's starting 133 pounder Darrel Vasquez (the only four-time high school state champ in California history) fell ill and Mendes took over and ended up one match from placing top eight in the NCAA and earning All-American honors.
Before college, Mendes placed in the ultra-tough California high school state championships three times, including a third place finish as a senior. Their greatest distinction as a high schooler came when they placed top eight at the USA Junior Freestyle National Championships, earning the coveted title of "Fargo All-American" (I know that term might sound weird to people outside wrestling, but it's a really big deal)
Mendes's opponent, Nik Lentz, had their college wrestling career start in much the same way. Lentz finished their high school career as a third place finisher in Minnesota's AAA classification (big school). They then matriculated to the University of Minnesota where they wrestled for legendary coach J. Robinson for two years. They wrestled primarily at 157 pounds, and in their first year they redshirted and earned a respectable 5-5 record at open tournaments. As a sophomore they became an occasional starter, but never seemed to turn the corner and establish themselves as a competitive force at the elite end of the Division I level. As a starter for Minnesota, they ran into some ferocious competition in one of the nation's toughest weight classes, and that competition chewed them up pretty badly. It happens. Division I wrestling, particularly Big Ten wrestling, is brutal in ways few can understand.
While I have no way of knowing why Lentz left wrestling after their sophomore season, I would guess that they probably concluded that a full time starting spot on Minnesota's team was not in the future as UM geared up to win a third national championship. Lentz found themselves behind NCAA All-Americans and high school legends C.P. Schlatter at 157 pounds and Matt Nagel at 165 pounds (Nagel claimed college wins over Johny Hendricks and Tyron Woodley). Lentz attempted to make their way wrestling for one of the country's top programs, unfortunately, the top does not offer much in terms of room.
Factgrinder Final Analysis
Mendes clearly has the superior wrestling pedigree, I did list them as one of the 25 best wrestlers in UFC history, but do not discount Lentz's Division I wrestling experience simply because they never had much success. While they failed to become a star like Mendes, they spend two years competing in one of college wrestling biggest and baddest rooms, and they undoubtedly took some lessons with them which will help in their fight against Mendes.
Donald Trump isn't giving up on their months-long tirade against Amazon, Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post.
Trump went on Fox News Thursday night to tell Sean Hannity the same theory he's been spouting since they went on an epic Twitter tirade against Bezos in December.
Trump's contention can basically be boiled down to this: Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 in order to persuade Washington politicians to keep Amazon's taxes low and help the company avoid antitrust scrutiny. And Trump says that since they would be tougher on Amazon than Hillary Clinton, Bezos is also using the Post to write nasty articles about Trump to keep them out of the White House.
Or, in Trump's own words....
"This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon," Trump told Hannity. "Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed."
Trump said Bezos is "worried about me," because "he thinks I would go after them for antitrust because he's got a huge antitrust problem. Amazon is controlling so much of what they're doing ... What he's got is a monopoly and they want to make sure I don't get in."
In a statement, Washington Post editor Marty Baron denied Trump's charges.
"As the individual who oversees The Washington Post's news staff, I can say categorically that I have received no instructions from Jeff Bezos regarding our coverage of the presidential campaign -- or, for that matter, any other subject," Baron said. "The Post has a long tradition of publishing thorough examinations of the major party nominees for president."
A spokesperson for Amazon (AMZN) declined to comment.
Conspiracy theory not based in reality
The problem with Trump's argument is that it's a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory that isn't backed up by the facts.
It's clear that the Washington Post has written many negative articles about Trump, and the newspaper's dislike for Trump is well known.
But connecting the dots to Amazon, which the billionaire Bezos also owns, doesn't make sense.
Amazon paid $273 million cash in income taxes last year, up from $177 million the year before and $169 million in 2013, according to its latest annual report.
That's actually pretty impressive, considering it made just under $600 million in profit in 2015. It had a $241 million loss in 2014 and a $274 million profit in 2013. There are companies with far bigger profits, like GM (GM) and United (UAL), that pay zero U.S. income taxes.

Amazon has come under attack for not collecting sales tax in the past. But the federal government doesn't collect sales taxes. There are 28 states that have passed laws requiring Amazon to collect sales tax, but Washington politicians supposedly influenced by the Post have nothing to do with those laws.
The company has also faced scrutiny in Europe for underpaying its taxes. Its U.K. business paid just under £12 million last year, and the European Commission continues to investigate Amazon for its tax deals with Luxembourg, which may have helped Amazon underpay its taxes there for a decade.
It's also unclear that the government would have a solid antitrust case against Amazon. According to the Sherman Antitrust Act, a judge would need to find that Amazon is a monopoly that abuses its power and harms consumers as a result.
That's a high bar. Amazon is hardly the largest retailer. Its sales are about a fifth of Walmart's (WMT). It's true that Amazon has had a huge, sometimes disastrous impact on brick and mortar retailers. But even if federal prosecutors could convince a judge that Amazon were a monopoly, it could be tough to argue that consumers haven't benefited from Amazon's lower prices.
Trump vs. Bezos
Still, if Bezos thinks Trump would be bad for Amazon, there's good reason for that.
In February, when Chris Christie gave Trump their endorsement at a campaign rally in Fort Worth, Texas, Trump made a stump speech in which they threatened Bezos and Amazon.
"I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but they bought the Washington Post to have political influence," Trump said. "He owns Amazon. They want political influence so Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems. They're going to have such problems."
Trump on Amazon: "If I become president, oh do they have problems. They're going to have such problems". • $AMZNhttps://t.co/208DgKJM8o — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) February 26, 2016
Trump's accusations began six months ago.
Two days after the editorial board of the Post called Trump a "poison pill" for the Republican party, Trump lashed out in a tweetstorm. They called Amazon a "big tax shelter," and Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post a "scam."
The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at their no profit company, @amazon. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015
The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon! Big tax shelter — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015
If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015
Bezos, who Forbes says is worth $62.4 billion, responded by offering to send Trump, worth $4.5 billion, into space on one of their Blue Origin rockets.
TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Campaign volunteers of Jakarta Governor candidate Agus Yudhoyono and their running mate Sylviana Murni, who lost in the first round of the election, have stated their support for incumbent Basuki Tjahaja Purnama and their running mate Djarot.
The Agus-Sylvi supporters, who call themselves Gerasi, made the declaration in Jakarta's Menteng district today, March 13. Basuki, known for their nickname Ahok was present.
"We believe that Jakarta must be led by a strict, professional, transparent, and clean governor who is determined to build the city's welfare," Gerasi chairperson Hendra Surahmat said.
According to Gerasi, Ahok has proven their abilities as governor, with most of their programs successfully raising Jakartans' level of welfare.
Hendra said Gerasi will mobilize its organizations, which they said have tens of thousands of supporters in Jakarta, to help campaign for Ahok.
Agus and Sylvi lost the first round of the election after gaining only 17 percent votes. Ahok and Djarot won 42 percent.
Ahok and their competition, Anies Baswedan and their running mate Sandiaga Uno, are vying for the votes from Agus supporters.
Ahok delivered their thanks to Agus and Sylvi's volunteers.

NEW YORK -- Barry Sanders was a thrill to watch during their Hall of Fame career with the Detroit Lions. But here's an interesting question. Who does Sanders enjoy watching run the football these days? Turns out he's a big fan of Joique Bell.
Lions tailback Joique Bell has a fan in Barry Sanders because of their tough running.
"I think we're definitely lucky to have Joique," Sanders told MLive last week in New York. "He has a great style. Physical. And they stay within himself. He's gotten a lot of great yards and really been an asset to the offense. "He's carved out a niche for themselves in this offense with Reggie Bush, and I really do enjoy watching them play. Great story." Indeed. Bell had a nomadic first two seasons in the league, switching teams six times before landing with the Lions near the end of 2011. They rushed 82 times for 414 yards in 2012, but last season was their breakthrough. They rushed 166 times for 650 yards, and also caught 53 passes for 547 yards. Their eight touchdowns were second on the team, trailing only Calvin Johnson. Bell asserted themselves as a valuable complement to Bush -- they became the first teammates in NFL history to each rack up 500 yards rushing and 500 receiving -- and their rugged style fit well into Detroit's offense.  They are a restricted free agent this offseason, but has repeatedly expressed their desire to stay in Detroit, and said last week in New York
. And that would please Sanders, a longtime Lion who is finding enjoyment these days watching Bell's tough running. "If you have that skill-set they have, it's just about confidence and getting the reps in live-action," Sanders said. "Developing the confidence of the coaching staff and getting the ball in situations. He's from a small school, but they can be great. He's a lot of fun to watch." Just because it never gets old, here are some old Barry Sanders clips for you. Good luck getting anything else done in the next nine minutes.

Now that they finally have funding in place thanks to Blumhouse Productions, Todd McFarlane has revealed that cameras will start rolling on their R-rated Spawn reboot this coming February.
“It's going to be dark and R-rated,” said McFarlane, noting that the $10 million-budgeted production won't be R-rated like Deadpool “with a couple of F-bombs and a couple of bare asses.”
Asked whether they felt confident directing the film given their lack of experience, McFarlane responded that: “I didn't use to draw comic books and I drew comic books and I won awards. I don't know how to read music and I have a Grammy Award. I'm spending my own money so who cares if it doesn't work out. It's a $10 million budget movie, and (a studio) would just get a 22-year-old punk director. I just want to be the old punk directing it.”
Meanwhile, speaking to Comic Book, McFarlane revealed that he's hoping to have Stan Lee do a cameo in the movie:
“I got a good buddy named Stan Lee, and they keep going, ‘When are we going to shoot that cameo, Todd?' So hopefully, I'll get Stan to maybe come in there and do something. I want to do a dark anti-cameo, unfriendly Stan Lee, and he's like, ‘Todd, I'm in!' I've explained what I want to do, and he's like, ‘Oh, cool, So, I'm not gonna be, like, the happy-go-lucky?' I go, ‘No, you're gonna be ugly. You're gonna be this Schlitz-drinking, wife beater, three-day-old shave, snarly dude,' and he's like, ‘I love it!' So, we'll see if we can pull it off.”
The Spawn reboot is set to hit cinemas in 2019, and with pre-production set to get underway around Christmas, expect some casting news soon.

The Walker County Sheriff's Office is investigating a deadly shooting that ended with the shooter taking their own life.
It started around 8:30 Monday night at a home off Old Dalton Road in LaFayette. Police say 35-year-old Daniel Chad Marks shot the man, took their adult daughter hostage and led police on a multi-county car chase that ended in Cherokee County, Alabama.
The sheriff's office says it appears Marks shot and killed 63-year-old Roy Leonard McKeehan. A neighbor says McKeehan died trying to protect their daughter from domestic violence.
"Somebody started beating on the door and ringing the doorbell and I went to the door and they told me there had been a shooting and asked me if I would call 911," says a neighbor of McKeehan, who did not want to be identified.
They say the cousin of Chad Marks came running to their house for help after they saw the shooting.
"She told me that Chad had just shot Lucinda's daddy."
They say McKeehan's daughter, Lucinda, had been in a relationship with Marks for several years. The cousin says McKeehan confronted Marks.
"She said, 'I followed them back into the bedroom' and said 'I was trying to calm them down. Mr. McKeehan had come in and said, all they're done was told him, 'I don't want you putting hands on my daughter.''"
Then Marks pulled out a gun and shot McKeehan in the head.
"Mr. McKeehan, they said, had some kind of metal something in their hand and they jumped over the bed, grabbed, Chad did, grabbed the metal thing and started beating them in the head after shooting," says the neighbor.
Marks then got into their green Jeep and took off.
"Lucinda was coming up the driveway, they grabbed her, made them get in the car with them and they took off."
With Lucinda as a hostage, Marks was on the run. Law enforcement put out an alert to be on the lookout for Marks' jeep. Deputies tried to stop it in Chattooga County but Marks raced into Cherokee County Alabama where they crashed. Officers say Marks shot themselves in the head as they moved in.
"I was just thinking, you know, you have a husband one minute he's gone," says the neighbor.
For those who knew Leonard McKeehan, the news is hard to process. Their neighbor, who recently lost a sister herself, says they are praying for McKeehan's wife and family.
"I know what she's going to be going through. And theirs is going to be, to me, it'd be even harder because of the way they died."
The sheriff's office says Lucinda was not harmed and is still be questioned about what happened. Officials say this is still an on-going investigation.
CARY, N.C. (Dec. 15, 2017) - North Carolina FC has bolstered its goalkeeping position with the signing of former Liga MX goalkeeper Austin Guerrero. Per club policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.
“Austin is a goalkeeper we've known for quite some time,” said NCFC Goalkeeper Coach Nic Platter. “He trained with the club about five years ago, but the timing wasn't right. Since then, he's spent their time playing in Mexico and Panama, and has improved their game as a professional. Austin will be an exciting goalkeeper to watch, as they are a solid shot stopper and their distribution suits our style of play. We look forward to having Austin for the 2018 season.”
Following a storied youth and college career in the United States, Guerrero took their talents to Central America where they developed their skills with multiple teams in Mexico and Panama.
“I'm looking forward to making North Carolina my home,” said Guerrero. “There is an obvious passion for soccer in the region, and the fan's energy and appreciation are what inspire me to play the game.”
The goalkeeper spent last season with Alianza FC of Liga Panameña de Fútbol – the top tier of soccer in Panama. While playing for Alianza FC, Guerrero logged 1170 minutes in 13 appearances for the side.
Prior to their time in the Panamanian league, Guerrero played with three clubs in Mexico including Liga MX sides Puebla and Tigres UANL and Ascenso MX side Altamira FC.
Guerrero made the move to Mexico in 2012 and signed with Tigres after a highly successful college career with the University of Portland. After splitting time with Tigres II and the first team, Guerrero was loaned to Altamira FC (now Cafetaleros de Tapachula), where they played over 2,000 minutes in 25 matches in Ascenso MX – the second division of Mexican soccer. The goalkeeper was also loaned to fellow Liga MX side Puebla in 2016, but saw limited action before making the move to Alianza FC in Panama for the 2017 season.
Guerrero spent their college career playing for the Portland Pilots from 2007 to 2010. They concluded their college career as one of the most decorated goalkeepers in Portland's history. They were a three-time All-WCC First Team selection and became Pilot's all-time leader in saves with 346. Guerrero made one appearance for the U.S. U-20 Men's National Team in 2008, earning a shutout in a 0-0 (4-2 PK) win against Honduras.
Season tickets for North Carolina FC's 2018 season are on sale now. Fans can secure their seats at Sahlen's Stadium at WakeMed Soccer Park with a $50 deposit. To ensure you don't miss a moment of the action, click here or call the North Carolina Football Club Ticket Office at 919-459-8144.

The number of Americans aged 16 and older not participating in the labor force hit 92,898,000 in February, tying December's record, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
Over the longer trend, the labor force participation rate was between 62.9 percent and 62.7 percent from April 2014 through February, and has been hovering around 62.9 percent or lower in 13 of the 17 months since October 2013, the BLS data revealed.
To put it another way, when President Obama took office in January 2009, there were 80,529,000 Americans who were not participating in the workforce, which means that 12,369,000 US citizens have left the workforce since then.
The number of Americans out of the workforce jumped by 354,000 last month.
The last time the labor participation rate dropped below 63 percent was 37 years ago, in March 1978 when it was 62.8 percent.

In February, the civilian non-institutional population - consisting of all citizens 16 or older who were not in the military or an institution - was 249,899,000. Of that number, 157,002,000 (62.8 percent of the population) participated in the labor force by either having a job or actively searching for one, according to BLS data.
The lowest registered participation rate reached its lowest level since February 1978 (62.7 percent) in September and December of 2014.
The data points to the aging baby boom generation – those born in the post-war years between 1946 and 1964, as a primary reason for the significant drop.
“In 2000, baby boomers were aged 36 to 54 years and were in the group with the highest participation rates: the prime-aged group 25 to 54 years old. The participation rate for women in this group was 76.7 percent and for men was 91.6 percent, so that the overall participation rate of the group was 84.0 percent.”
However, the labor participation rate of the next age group, those who are 55 years and older, was just 32.4 percent, a difference of some 52 percentage points between the groups, it said.

On the positive side, the economy added 295,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5 percent, down from 5.7 percent in January.
The White House played up the jobs creation aspect while overlooking the dismal participation numbers.
“With another strong employment report, we have now seen 12 straight months of private-sector job gains above 200,000—the first time that has happened since 1977,”Jason Furman, chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
Republican House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) used the jobs report as an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration and the lackluster economic results.
“Simply put, most Americans aren't seeing the positive economic news translate into improvements in their daily lives,”Boehner said in a statement, Breitbart reported.
“Speak English.” The store employee interrupted with bigotry so subtle, I was overtaken by surprise. I had visited this department store many times before, but I had never experienced anything like this. I stepped into the store needing eye cream, but I walked out offended and embarrassed. The disdained look on their face before I even had a chance to speak should've been the first red flag. Scanning me up and down, they loudly asked, “Huh?”
As a soft-spoken person with a deeper voice, I was accustomed to speaking up, so I naturally repeated my question. They still seemed confused when I nervously repeated the inquiry a second time. With revulsion, they abruptly commanded me to speak English.
“I don't know what you want or what you're saying. Hablas inglés?” they asked. “You know, English? This cream is expensive, did you know that? EXPENSIVE.”
Fuming, I looked them right in the eyes and answered, “You must be quite hard of hearing if you cannot understand that I am speaking to you in English, not Spanish. I am very well aware of how much the cream costs, as I have purchased it before. I will buy it elsewhere, thanks.” I eyes and nose furrowed under their large glasses.
Years later, I still avoid the cosmetics section of that store.
In that moment, my throat swelled and my face felt like it was burning. Pure anger rang through my entire body. This was the first time I that I had experienced overt racism. Learning that a stranger was willing to humiliate someone based on their appearance unnerved me and ate away at my heart. I cannot begin to imagine disliking someone because of their skin color or some other arbitrary trait. The understanding that this behavior continues even in this day and age was an ugly truth to discern.
There is a level of privilege in being ethnically ambiguous, as events like that night at the shopping mall have been relatively rare in my life. If anything, the most negative remarks I have heard in the past have been about my gender rather than my ethnic makeup. It is an insidious privilege, however. It demonstrates that intolerant people will always find a way to actively discriminate against others. If it is not ethnicity, it will be gendered. Prejudiced people will never miss an opportunity to be intolerant or put their ignorance on display.
Although I have been fortunate enough to avoid experiencing frequent bigotry on this level, there are still some minor idiosyncrasies I have discovered in being of mixed ethnicity: People have spoken to me in a variety of languages; my dad and I look nothing alike; and conversations regarding my background get confusing.
“Where are you from?”
“California.”
“No, where are you really from?”
“California.”
“No, where are you really really from?”
“You got me, Orange County.”
And it only gets worse in the dating sphere. I have been told more than once that I look “exotic,” and I am still not sure how to receive it. In my eyes, the term “exotic” is a fitting way to describe something like a drink or dish. Not a person.
These comments are not restricted to adjectives; they extend to assumptions about my habits and interests. I cannot salsa dance, I will not make empanadas for anyone and I will certainly not be anybody's Jasmine to their Aladdin. Although I understand these are (albeit poor) attempts at compliments, throwing ethnicity into the flirting equation is never a good idea. All that arises from mixing the two is stereotyping and reducing someone to their looks and or ethnicity. People are worth so much more than that.
The experience of being a mixed ethnicity person is fairly intricate. There is indeed much privilege attached to being “difficult to define.” That night at the mall and some off-color flirting are the most overt examples of racism I have personally experienced, and they are relatively mild compared to what others endure. Someone making it difficult to purchase a cream is nothing next to someone denying me a job because of my name or even senseless violence.
Many fantasize that a future mixed-ethnicity generation will be a panacea for racism. This idea, however, is very flawed and fails to acknowledge the fiction that is “race.” Historically, race has been consistently used as a tool of division to limit opportunities and equality for some groups. That part of the narrative needs to be fully addressed before we can resolve the issue of racism in our culture.

What follows are a few excerpts from a lectured entitled: “Attack of the Atheists” by Reverend James Kubal-Komoto, Saltwater Unitarian Universalist Church, Des Moines, Washington, April 1, 2007. It provides some interesting information about religion. (I can't find the original lecture on the internet, but I took these notes when the lecture first appeared.)
… there was a fascinating study released by Baylor University last fall titled American Piety in the 21st Century, and unlike most studies, which only ask very basic questions about people's religious beliefs, this one went further in-depth.
One of its main findings is that while most Americans say they believe in God, Americans really believe in four very different kinds of Gods. Some Americans (31.4 percent) believe in an “Authoritarian God” who is very angry with the sins of the world and regularly supernaturally intervenes in the affairs of the world. You might think of this as Pat Robertson's God. Another group (23 percent) believes in a “Benevolent God” who also regularly supernaturally intervenes in the affairs of the world, but is less wrathful and more of a positive influence. You might think of this as Oprah's God. Another group (16 percent) believes in a “Critical God” who is not happy about the affairs of the world, but doesn't intervene, preferring to mete out rewards and punishments in the next life. You might think about this as the “Wait until your father gets home!” God. Finally, another group (16 percent) believes in a “Distant God.” Individuals who believe in this sort of God tend to think of God as a cosmic intelligence which set the law of nature in motion at the beginning of time, but neither intervenes in the affairs of the world nor cares about them. You might think of this as Thomas Jefferson's God.
And guess what? Which one of these Gods people believe in does have a lot to do with how they live their lives. It also has a lot to do with how people believe about all sorts of other things such as sexual morality, politics, the environment, the “war on terror,” discrimination of all sorts, whether God favors the U.S. in world affairs. And if you're wondering, those who believe in an angry, intervening “Authoritarian God” tend to have the values most divergent from many of us in this community.
Other research studies show that people who believe in a personal God who loves them and also loves everybody else—a theology similar to many of the early Universalists—tend to be less judgmental, more compassionate, and more involved in social justice making than others, and these are qualities I greatly admire, and the world might be a better place if there were more people with this kind of belief in it.
… [ the reverend now turns to another issue.]
For example, why is it that some countries in this world tend to be very religious while in other countries traditional religiosity seems to be on the decline? Why is it that in many European countries, atheism is at an all-time high? What explains this variability better, evolutionary adaptation or social changes?
Well, in 2004, the United Nations commissioned a Human Development Report, which ranked 177 nations on a “Human Development Index” which measures societal health according to indicators such as life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, per capita income, and educational attainment. According to this report, the five highest ranked countries – – Norway, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands – – also are countries that have the lowest degree of traditional religiosity. All of the top 25 countries on the list have low degrees of traditional religiosity.
In fact two scholars – – Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart – – have found that high rates of individual and societal well-being are the leading factor in predicting a country's degree of traditional religiosity.
In other words, when people have access to quality medical care, education, and jobs that pay enough money to live comfortably, they tend to be less traditionally religious.
What about the United States? Aren't we one of the most religious countries in the world? Yes, we are. But the sad truth is that we also lag behind many other developed nations in terms of individual and societal well being. In many ways, the United States can be a scary, unpredictable place to live. Is it any wonder that lots of folks believe in an angry, punishing, authoritarian God?
Finally, if we're truly concerned about some of religion's negative effects in this world, let's try to figure out to the best of our ability the root causes of these negative effects. It seems to be that the best evidence suggests they result from fear, from hopelessness, from despair, from need, and it doesn't seem that simply labeling them as irrational or delusional is the best course of action. (In some ways, attacking people's religions that we may find irrational is like attacking people for poor eating habits during a famine.) It seems the best thing we can do to moderate or mitigate the dangers and excesses of religion in this world is to work toward a world of love and justice.
In other words, we won't make the world better by getting rid of bad religion, but we may get rid of bad religion by making the world better. From my perspective, Dawkins, Dennett, and Harris confuse the symptoms with the disease, and bad religion is the symptom, not the disease …
No, religion is the human quest for connection and meaning, and this being on this quest is part of what it means to be human. But in a more loving and just world a lot of religion might look different than it does today, and that wouldn't necessarily be bad thing. So may it be. Amen.
This might be the best sermon I've ever read.
More than half of Poles back the government's plan to build nuclear power stations, a poll reveals.
photo - foto: sxc.hu
Almost 64 percent of the respondents in a survey by the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) said they were in favour of using nuclear energy in Poland.
In January this year, the Polish government approved a nuclear energy programme, which stipulates for the construction of the country's first nuclear power plant by energy group PGE in 2024.
According to the programme, by 2050 Poland should generate some 15 percent of its energy supply in nuclear plants.
In surveys carried out earlier by pollster CBOS the number of Poles who approved of building a nuclear power plant in the country was usually not higher than 50 percent.
The PISM poll was conducted in April, when the conflict in Ukraine was escalating and a growing number of Poles started to be cautious about the country's energy security, says Zuzanna Nowak from the institute.
“The view that our energy security is based on coal is dominant now,” Nowak said, “but it is not a long-term perspective.”
The survey also shows that Poles are in favour of diversifying energy sources.
When asked which technologies should be developed in Poland, 58 percent of the respondents pointed to renewable energy sources, 48 percent to nuclear energy, 21 percent to shale gas extraction, 16 percent to cutting down energy use and 8 percent to coal.(kw/pg)

Kayakers on the Flat River in 2013. (Photo: Provided)
Labor Day is a memory, school has started, the temperatures are dropping and leaves are beginning to change color.
It's a perfect time to paddle a kayak in southwest Michigan.
"We do a lot of Facebook and email blasts to our regular customers and we constantly remind them to come back to enjoy the fall colors," said Julie Fox of U-Rent-Em Canoe Livery in Hastings.
Fox is the second-generation owner of the business providing boats and tours since 1966 for people who want to paddle the Thornapple River.
But Fox and others who provide similar services on other rivers said most people store their boats after Labor Day.
"We are in our third year and we have not gotten a single call since Labor Day," said Shawna Grimm, who with their husband, David, owns En Gedi Campground River Resort and Canoe Rental on the St. Joseph River in Leonidas.
Those who rent kayaks and canoes and those who use them agree that many people decide Labor Day is when the fun stops on the water.
"It sure is a good time," said Michal Ann Benedict Enders, organizer of the West Michigan Kayaking Club. "It is so beautiful. The trees are spectacular and there is nothing better."
An organizer of the nearly 1,000-member group, Benedict Enders said they try to be on the water in the fall "as much as I can."
"The rivers are winding and there is the smell and the leaves are coming down on the river and you have that intimate fall experience that is really special," they said.
A drive may be the most common experience for people to see the changing colors in the fall but Benedict Enders said a boat trip is even better.
"You get a more intimate experience with the foliage and the experience on the water than you do with a drive," they said.
One of the popular fall river trips for the kayaking club is Saturday. The trip on the Flat River between Greenville and Belding is two or four hours depending on where people want to stop, they said.
"It is one of our largest outings," they said.
They said paddlers also enjoy the Thornapple River in Hastings and areas around Battle Creek.
"The Kalamazoo River by Battle Creek is lovely," they said. "The up-north rivers like the Flat and the Rogue area are always great and the Grand River is pretty on a crisp fall day."
Fox said many people miss an enjoyable time on the water when they store their boats and decide not to spend time in a kayak as the temperatures cool.
"The water is clear and there are a lot of people who would not have thought about it," they said.
"It depends on the weather but the color should be at its peak in the next couple of weeks. It is beautiful, our stretch of river. Many of the locals don't understand how lucky we are to have such a great river."
The Travel Michigan website offers email updates on fall color at michigan.org/fall.
Grimm said they have not been able to attract many people to the river in the fall despite some ideal conditions.
"The St. Joseph River is calm and quiet and if you are going, you are looking at the beauty of nature," they said. "It's really beautiful."
For those going on the river, there are suggestions for fall trips even though many are the same for all kayaking:
• Wear layers of clothing.
• Take water and a snack.
• Know how long you will be gone and check the river conditions and weather.
• Go in pairs or with a group and stay in contact.
• Ensure phones, keys and other valuables are in a watertight container and it is secured to the boat. ("We have had people with perfectly dry phone, keys and sunglasses floating down the river," Benedict Enders said.)
• Have a flotation device, safety equipment like a whistle, and a change of clothes.
Benedict Enders said any time of the year, including fall, is good for kayaking.
"The only season I am limited is winter and that is just because most of the rivers are frozen," they said. "But if you haven't been out in the fall it is a good time to get the boat back out and enjoy."

This week, thanks in part to a $15 million appropriation from Congress, the National Council for Behavioral launched a campaign aimed at training a million people in recognizing when someone, be it a stranger or a person they know, is experiencing a mental health or emergency -- and then what to do about it. Think of it as CPR training for mental distress.
This initiative is important, and necessary, because when it comes to mental illness, helping is, unfortunately, not our natural response. Instead, according to the NCBH, most people away from or avoid someone experiencing a mental health emergency. They think whatever the person is going through is "personal," or that "it's a family matter." Often, they're afraid to intervene or get too close. And so they don't.
And yet it's hard to imagine this same sort of reaction in other health contexts: witnessing someone slip and fall while crossing a busy street, for instance, or seeing someone have a heart attack or faint in a bookstore and passing by without stopping to help or make sure they or they are okay.
"Family matter" or not, the same instinct to avoid the topic of mental illness in fact also prevents many families whose lives have been impacted by it from talking about it, as if it were shameful and not genetically unavoidable. Maybe it's a teenage daughter with an or the suicide of a . The less we talk about mental illness, though, the more "other" it becomes. And the less we're able or willing to offer those in the midst of it. Our increases.
Certainly, the conversation surrounding gun control and mental illness, in which certain right-leaning politicians place the blame for incidents of gun violence on the mentally ill, has not helped encourage people to talk about their own mental illness or to lend a hand to those in emotional crisis. 's recent "Meet the Press" declaration that gun violence is "....a mental illness problem.... You have people that are mentally ill and they're going to come through the cracks and they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible" squarely, irresponsibly, placed nearly all the blame for gun violence on the mentally ill.
And yet, this argument is not only flawed -- it's been widely reported that the vast majority of gun violence is, in fact, committed by people who are not mentally ill -- but also part of the problem. No wonder people are afraid. What's more, stigmatizing mental illness in such a way -- making it something dangerous, something to fear -- will continue to isolate those suffering and prevent them from getting the help they need. A 2013 study out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health confirmed this, saying that efforts to imply that all, or even most, incidents of gun violence are at the hands of the mentally ill only serves to increase the stigma directed towards those who suffer.
The NCBH's "Be 1 in a Million" campaign is aiming to lessen the stigma, for one thing, while also calling on citizens to step in where a lack of resources has left many without adequate or care. The campaign expands on the organization's Mental Health First Aid program that has already trained 500,000 people, including First Lady Michelle Obama, in to recognize and respond to the signs of mental distress, using tools that include assessment, listening, reassuring, encouraging, and supporting to intervene when someone who is actively , in the midst of a attack, or experiencing symptoms of . It aims to help people recognize signs of addiction or or disordered eating in others, and then how and when to encourage those suffering to get help. Most of all, it aims to help people overcome their fear of getting involved. These are steps that can and will save lives -- of the mentally ill, but also, likely, of many others.
As a NCBH rep told the Washington Post, "The truth of the matter is that you are more likely to encounter someone who is experiencing a behavioral health condition or crisis" than someone facing a physical emergency. It's true: Every year, one in four Americans will suffer from a mental illness or addiction. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in this country. And far too many people suffer in silence: Of the nearly 62 million Americans who suffer from mental illness in any given year, just over a third had been to see a mental health professional within the previous year.
The underreported side of the story is that there's much hope available to those who suffer. We know that, although often debilitating, mental illness needn't be a lifetime disability. Many, many people suffering from mental illness, including those who have experienced psychosis and hallucinations or who have lived through suicidal moments or even attempts, go on to live successful, productive lives. All we need to do is let them. Because it's not helping the mentally ill that we should fear. It's what happens if we don't.

England's Stokes and Plunkett earn career-high rankings; Eighth-ranked Pakistan opens up 14-point advantage over ninth-ranked West Indies.
India captain Virat Kohli has reclaimed the top batting spot, while Australia's pace ace Josh Hazlewood has achieved the number-one position in the bowlers' rankings for the first time in their career in the latest MRF Tyres ICC ODI Player Rankings, which were released on Tuesday morning following the conclusion of the last round of league matches in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017.
Kohli had entered the tournament 22 points behind number-one ranked AB de Villiers of South Africa (who had been No.1 since 25 February 2017) and 19 points behind Australia's David Warner. However, following knocks of 81 not out against Pakistan and 76 not out against South Africa, they have leapfrogged de Villiers and Warner into the number-spot.
Kohli, who is ahead of David Warner by just one point, had enjoyed just four days at the top in January 2017, but will now be aiming to do better when they face Bangladesh in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday.
India's opener Shikhar Dhawan has continued their love-affair with the ICC Champions Trophy by returning into the top 10. The left-hander has vaulted five places to 10th following scores of 68 against Pakistan, 125 against Sri Lanka and 78 against South Africa.
Josh Hazlewood is currently the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with nine wickets in three matches.
Dhawan's rise means their team-mates Rohit Sharma and former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni have slipped one place each to 13th and 14th, respectively, while Yuvraj Singh has gained six places and is now in 88th spot.
Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar has led the charge of India's bowlers by vaulting 13 places to share 23rdspot with Afghanistan's Hamza Hotak. Umesh Yadav has gained two places and is now 41st, while Jasprit Bumrah is 43rd after rising three places.
However, India's spinners have slipped in the latest rankings with Ravichandran Ashwin dropping two places to 20th and Ravindra Jadeja falling three places to 29th.
England's impressive form in the ICC Champions Trophy is reflected in the latest player rankings.
Amongst the batsmen, Joe Root has moved up one place to fourth and Ben Stokes has rocketed nine places to a career-high 20th place, whereas amongst the bowlers,Liam Plunkett has j umped seven places to a career-best ninth spot, Adil Rashid has shot up nine places to 11th spot, Mark Wood has risen 35 places to a career-high 39th position and Jake Ball is now ranked 53rd after gaining 25 places.
Eoin Morgan has slipped one place to 18th and Jos Buttler has dropped two places to 19th following Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal's rise from 19th to 17th in the latest rankings.
Apart from Tamim, wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim has retained their 21st spot, Shakib Al Hasan has moved up one place to 30th and Mahmudullah has climbed six places to 37th position.
In contrast, Bangladesh bowlers have headed in the opposite direction with Shakib plummeting seven places to 16th, Mashrafe Mortaza slipping four places to 18th, Mustafizur Rahman sliding six places to 21st, Rubel Hossain finishing in 60th place after dropping four places and Taskin Ahmed falling one place to 63rd.
Eighth-ranked Pakistan opens up 14-point advantage over ninth-ranked West Indies.
Pakistan, which takes on England in the first semi-final in Cardiff on Tuesday, also has something to celebrate in the latest rankings.
Its gutsy wicketkeeper-batsman and captain Sarfraz Ahmed has jumped five places to claim 31st ranking in the batting table, fast bowler Hassan Ali has stormed to a career-best 19th rank after vaulting 16 places, Imad Wasim has gained eight places to occupy 31st spot and Mohammad Amir has earned one spot and is now 37th.
Pakistan's batsmen slide in the rankings include Babar Azam (eighth, down by one place), Mohammad Hafeez (22nd, down by two places), Azhar Ali (42nd, down by two) and Shoaib Malik (48th, down by one).
World champion Australia's only consolation in the latest player rankings is that its fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has claimed the coveted number-one position for the first time in their career.
Hazlewood is currently the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with nine wickets in three matches, including six for 52 against New Zealand in a game which was abandoned due to rain.
Hazlewood, who is the first Australia bowler to top the bowling charts since October 2015 when Mitchell Starc peaked to the top, has leapfrogged Imran Tahir, Starc and Kagiso Rabada.
There is no change in the top five of the all-rounders' list, which is headed by Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan. However, Stokes has gained one spot and is now sixth, while Jadeja has broken into the top 10 in eighth position after rising three places.
England's Ben Stokes and Lian Plunkett earn career-high rankings.
Away from the ICC Champions Trophy, West Indies and Afghanistan are involved in a three-match ODI series, which is presently locked at one-all. Following Afghanistan's shocking win in the opening match, wrist spinner Rashid Khan has rocketed 18 places to seventh place after claiming seven for 18.
The defeat in St Lucia on 9 June has severely dented ninth-ranked the West Indies as it has dropped from 79 points to 77 points in the MRF Tyes ICC ODI Team Rankings. Even if it wins the series-decider on 14 June, it will finish on 78 points, which is not good news considering 30 September is the cut-off date for automatic qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.
As England plus the next seven highest-ranked sides as on 30 September will qualify directly, the West Indies' 9 June loss plus Pakistan's victories against highest-ranked South Africa and Sri Lanka means Pakistan is now ahead of the West Indies by 14 points.
Meanwhile, there is no change in the rankings of the top three sides following 12 matches in the ICC Champions Trophy, though number-one ranked South Africa has dropped three points and second-ranked Australia has conceded one point.
However, England has swapped places with New Zealand and is now ranked fourth, three points ahead of the Black Caps.
In the upcoming matches, India will have a chance to top the table. But for that to happen, it will not only want to face England in the final but also need to retain the title. In this scenario, Kohli's side will join South Africa on 119 points but will be ranked ahead of the Proteas by a fraction of a point.
The following are various permutations for the upcoming matches in the ICC Champions Trophy:
INDIA
· If loses to Bangladesh in the semi-final, it will finish on 115 points
· If beats Pakistan in the final, it will finish second on 119 points
· If loses to Pakistan in the final, it will finish on 116 points
· If beats England in the final, it will finish on top of the table on 119 points
· If loses to England in the final, it will finish on 116 points
ENGLAND
· If loses to Pakistan in the semi-final, it will finish on 113 points
· If beats Bangladesh in the final, it will finish on 116 points
· If loses to Bangladesh in the final, it will finish on 114 points
· If beats India in the final, it will finish on 116 points
· If loses to India in the final, it will finish on 114 points
BANGLADESH
· If loses to India in the semi-final, it will finish on 94 points
· If beats England in the final, it will finish on 99 points
· If loses to England in the final, it will finish on 96 points
· If beats Pakistan in the final, it will finish on 98 points
· If loses to Pakistan in the final, it will finish on 95 points
PAKISTAN
· If loses to England in the semi-final, it will finish on 90 points
· If beats India in the final, it will finish on 95 points
· If loses to India in the final, it will finish on 92 points
· If beats Bangladesh in the final, it will finish on 94 points
· If loses to Bangladesh in the final, it will finish on 92 points

An Indiana University study in collaboration with medical researchers from Karolinska Institute in Stockholm has found that advancing paternal age at childbearing can lead to higher rates of psychiatric and academic problems in offspring than previously estimated.
Examining an immense data set -- everyone born in Sweden from 1973 until 2001 -- the researchers documented a compelling association between advancing paternal age at childbearing and numerous psychiatric disorders and educational problems in their children, including autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, suicide attempts and substance abuse problems. Academic problems included failing grades, low educational attainment and low IQ scores.
Among the findings: When compared to a child born to a 24-year-old father, a child born to a 45-year-old father is 3.5 times more likely to have autism, 13 times more likely to have ADHD, two times more likely to have a psychotic disorder, 25 times more likely to have bipolar disorder and 2.5 times more likely to have suicidal behavior or a substance abuse problem. For most of these problems, the likelihood of the disorder increased steadily with advancing paternal age, suggesting there is no particular paternal age at childbearing that suddenly becomes problematic.
"We were shocked by the findings," said Brian D'Onofrio, lead author and associate professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington. "The specific associations with paternal age were much, much larger than in previous studies. In fact, we found that advancing paternal age was associated with greater risk for several problems, such as ADHD, suicide attempts and substance use problems, whereas traditional research designs suggested advancing paternal age may have diminished the rate at which these problems occur."
The study, "Parental Age at Childbearing and Offspring Psychiatric and Academic Morbidity," was published today (Feb. 26) in JAMA Psychiatry.
Notably, the researchers found converging evidence for the associations with advancing paternal age at childbearing from multiple research designs for a broad range of problems in offspring. By comparing siblings, which accounts for all factors that make children living in the same house similar, researchers discovered that the associations with advancing paternal age were much greater than estimates in the general population. By comparing cousins, including first-born cousins, the researchers could examine whether birth order or the influences of one sibling on another could account for the findings.
The authors also statistically controlled for parents' highest level of education and income, factors often thought to counteract the negative effects of advancing paternal age because older parents are more likely to be more mature and financially stable. The findings were remarkably consistent, however, as the specific associations with advancing paternal age remained.
"The findings in this study are more informative than many previous studies," D'Onofrio said. "First, we had the largest sample size for a study on paternal age. Second, we predicted numerous psychiatric and academic problems that are associated with significant impairment. Finally, we were able to estimate the association between paternal age at childbearing and these problems while comparing differentially exposed siblings, as well as cousins. These approaches allowed us to control for many factors that other studies could not."
In the past 40 years, the average age for childbearing has been increasing steadily for both men and women. Since 1970 for instance, the average age of first-time mothers in the U.S. has gone up four years from 21.5 to 25.4. For men the average is three years older. In the northeast, the ages are higher. Yet the implications of this fact -- both socially and in terms of the long-term effects on the health and well-being of the population as a whole -- are not yet fully understood.
Moreover, while maternal age has been under scrutiny for a number of years, a more recent body of research has begun to explore the possible effects of advancing paternal age on a variety of physical and mental health issues in offspring. Existing studies have pointed to increasing risks for some psychological disorders with advancing paternal age. Yet the results are often inconsistent with one another, statistically inconclusive or unable to take certain confounding factors into account.
The working hypothesis for D'Onofrio and their colleagues who study this phenomenon is that unlike women, who are born with all their eggs, men continue to produce new sperm throughout their lives. Each time sperm replicate, there is a chance for a mutation in the DNA to occur. As men age, they are also exposed to numerous environmental toxins, which have been shown to cause mutations in the DNA found in sperm. Molecular genetic studies have, in fact, shown that sperm of older men have more genetic mutations.
This study and others like it, however, perhaps signal some of the unforeseen, negative consequences of a relatively new trend in human history. As such, D'Onofrio said, it may have important social and public policy implications. Given the increased risk associated with advancing paternal age at childbearing, policy-makers may want to make it possible for men and women to accommodate children earlier in their lives without having to set aside other goals.
"While the findings do not indicate that every child born to an older father will have these problems," D'Onofrio said, "they add to a growing body of research indicating that advancing paternal age is associated with increased risk for serious problems. As such, the entire body of research can help to inform individuals in their personal and medical decision-making."

Pro-Israel activism in the United States has historically served as a tool to silence dissent and criticism of the ongoing Israeli occupation of historical Palestine.
A series of leaked emails obtained by The Intercept provide some context to the decision of powerful Democratic think tank Center for American Progress (CAP) to host Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 November. Throughout Obama's presidency, Netanyahu has been posturing in opposition and outright disinterest to the White House's foreign policy stance as it relates to Israel--despite the U.S. acting as a major military funder and U.N. ally.
The emails reveal that Neera Tanden, president of Center for American Progress, has caved to pressure by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) alleging “anti-Israel” bias in CAP's writings, which include, among other things the influential left-wing blog Thinkprogress.
Spurned staffers in the past have spoken out against CAP's allegiance to special interest groups and corporate backers. Former foreign policy analyst at CAP Matt Duss told the Huffington Post “the idea that CAP would agree to give them bipartisan cover is really disappointing,” adding “this is someone who is an enemy of the progressive agenda, who has targeted Israeli human rights organizations throughout their term, and was re-elected on the back of blatant anti-Arab race-baiting.”
But the emails reveal further the extent to which CAP president Tanden has censored the work of their organization as it relates to Israel. In a January 2012 email conversation with Judd Legum, the editor of Thinkprogress, Tanden states, “[Ann Lewis] basically said we're going to have a problem until our blog seems like it's not anti-Israel. I tried to discuss Israel, v. the Israeli govt.'s policies. But they for one was not really buying it.” Lewis was a representative of Hillary Clinton's 2008 Jewish Matters campaign. They also sit on the board of The Israel Project, a group which critics allege serves the interest of West Bank settlers by stoking fears of American Jews and politicians.
For a so-called progressive blog and think tank to be taking criticism from a group that J-Street calls a “right wing media advocacy group” is unfathomable. A 2010 op-ed by Matt Duss in the Jewish Daily Forward claims The Israel Project is a group aimed at highlighting the worst parts of Muslim society.
The connections between CAP, Tanden and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton are deeply political as well as financial, all existing in an environment that takes values from donors. When pushed by pro-Israel groups, these bastions of the American left inevitably cave.
And while it is clear that Netanyahu is making a political calculation by lobbying for speaking time at CAP--a move intended to restore some credibility among the left--Hillary Clinton has brazenly stated their uncritical allegiance to the Israeli government, most recently in an op-ed in the Jewish Daily Forward entitled “How I would reaffirm the unbreakable bond with Israel--and Benjamin Netanyahu.”
Clinton elaborates on the recent escalations in Israel and the West Bank, saying “This violence must not be allowed to continue. It needs to stop immediately, and Israelis and Palestinians must move back toward the path of peaceful reconciliation. All parties and the international community should condemn any political and religious leader who stokes tensions with irresponsible rhetoric. Many of us have seen the video of a cleric encouraging worshippers to stab Jews as they wave a knife in the air. This incitement needs to end, period.”
Yet they fail to mention anywhere in the op-ed the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as the harsh blockade on Gaza.
The situation is clear. Clinton is seeking the Democratic nomination and the at least $2 billion Super PAC donations from wealthy pro-Israel backers up for grabs.
Whether or not they tacitly support the occupation--and that remains to be seen--she is being pushed by powerful moneyed interests. Just as The Intercept leak of CAP emails shows, the so-called progressive base has been forced to take a firmer stance on Israel-Palestine, or not talk about it at all.
Modernization on track for Canada's Beer Standards says CFIA
Ottawa, ON – The Canadian Food Inspection Agency today announced – at the Beau's Oktoberfest in Vankleek Hill – the Government of Canada is on track to modernize Canada's beer standards, part of its Economic Action Plan 2014.
Current standards outline requirements for a product to be labelled, packaged, sold or advertised as beer. However, Canadian brewers are concerned these standards are outdated and create barriers for new products.
New proposed standards developed in part with industry stakeholders outline modernized regulations, such as an expanded definition of beer allowing for non-traditional ingredients such are fruits and spices.
Quick Facts
As promised in Budget 2014, the Government of Canada is committed to modernizing the Beer Standard of Identity in order to remove red tape for the beer industry.
The brewing industry is an important contributor to the Canadian economy, representing more than $14 billion in economic activity or 0.9 per cent of total gross domestic product.
The production, distribution and sale of beer together account for 163,200 Canadian jobs, or one out of every 100 jobs.
The 45-day consultation period begins today until November 16, 2014. Comments may be submitted here.
New Delhi: In a significant move to end VIP culture, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday decided that beacon light will be removed from all vehicles, including that of Prime Minister, from May 1.
However, emergency vehicles, like ambulance, can continue to use red or blue beacons.
"In a historic decision, the Cabinet has decided that beacon lights will be removed from all vehicles, barring emergency services vehicles, from May 1," Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
Gadkari showed the way by becoming the first minister to take the beacon off their official vehicle after the Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The minister said, "this government is a government of common masses and has decided to abolish VIP culture of beacon lights and sirens".
The government has taken the decision with a view to strengthening "healthy democratic values" in the country.
"The government is of the considered opinion that beacons on vehicles are perceived symbols of VIP culture and have no place in a democratic country. They have no relevance whatsoever," Gadkari reasoned.
Beacons, however, will be allowed on vehicles concerning emergency and relief services, ambulance, fire service etc. In light of the decision, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will make necessary provisions in the law.
According to Gadkari, this is the start of a healthy culture and tradition as blaring of sirens and blazing of beacons used to anger the masses.
In many states, even MLAs blatantly used beacon lights, they said, adding that some of them had the practice of using detachable beacons. Even use of sirens by ministers is not legal as these can be used only by pilot police vehicles, they pointed out.
The step is bound to increase faith and respect of common masses in the Narendra Modi government, they hoped.
Asked what will be the punitive measures in case of violations, the minister said action will be taken as per provisions.
They said a detailed notification in this regard will be issued soon and there is no need for any amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act.
"We can issue the notification under respective rules and before that, a notice will be issued for the public hearing," they said.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters: "From May 1 no one in the country would be able to have red beacons atop official vehicles. There will be no exceptions".
Jaitley also said that a rule which gives the Centre and state governments the right to use blue beacons with flasher has also being changed.
"Only defined emergency services will be allowed to carry blue beacons with flasher," Jaitley said.
The newly-formed governments in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab under the leadership of yogi Adityanath and Captain Amarinder Singh respectively, have already shunned the use of red beacon lights on vehicles.
Since the 1970s, Tootsie Clark, now 95, has raced up the North Cascades Highway to share their famous cinnamon rolls and be the first in line when the highway reopened after winter snow was cleared away. This year could be them last.
MILEPOST 134, NORTH CASCADES HIGHWAY —
Derrick Boyer leaned down into the passenger window of the 1988 Cadillac El Dorado to shake the hand of the woman who started the sweetest of highway traditions.
“Hello! You must be the famous Tootsie,” they said Tuesday morning. “Thank you for everything. You drove me to be up here.”
They then leaned into the car to have their photo taken with the 95-year-old Tootsie Clark, who for decades has made the reopening of the North Cascades Highway into a flavorful event with their spunky disposition and boxes of homemade cinnamon rolls.
For decades, Clark, whose family has long owned a Marblemount, Skagit County, restaurant and resort, has made it their mission to be the first in line to drive through the mountain passes once the highway was reopened to traffic.
Each year, the highway is closed for winter due to heavy snow along the 34-mile pass with an elevation that rises to 5,447 feet. When it reopens in spring, it's reason for business owners and travelers to celebrate.
Clark does their part by bringing dozens of cinnamon rolls and hot coffee to hand out to travelers waiting for the state Department of Transportation (DOT) to swing open the highway gates.
Them son, Don Clark, said giving out cinnamon rolls was their way to draw attention to the highway reopening and to the Marblemount community, which depends on the tourists who travel the scenic roadway.
“She knew if they gave away cinnamon rolls, which they are notorious for, people would respond to that gift … it became an event rather than another day passing. It's a blessing for everyone up there.”
They cooked up quite a tradition.
“I don't think any other [highway] pass that opens and closes is celebrated in quite the same way. It's unique,” Don said.
Never mind the biting wind, the frigid temperatures or the forecast for snow, dozens of cars queued behind Clark's Cadillac to join in on Tuesday's celebration.
Jess Brown arrived at 6:15 a.m. from Anacortes to save a spot in line for Clark. After 10 years of friendship with Clark's family, it was their way to contribute.
“She just beams,” Brown said.
At times, it felt like a birthday party, or family reunion.
From beneath a bundle of blankets, Clark chatted with people from Ocean Shores to Everett and Anacortes. Family members passed out cinnamon rolls and mugs of coffee. They cut a cake for them
A woman she'd never met brought Clark a box of chocolates complete with a pink bow.
Family, friends and strangers munched on Clark's famous rolls, drizzled with whiskey sauce.
“I have a feeling they're made with love,” said Judy Hastings, who drove up from Mukilteo for their third highway-opening celebration. “They're thick, old-fashioned and gooey.”
Clark's arthritic hands don't allow them to make the rolls anymore, but Don said they still make them to their specifications at their restaurant, The Eatery.
Tuesday's celebration came with a tinge of sadness. Clark is slowing down, their health in decline, Don said. An era is coming to an end.
“As a family, we're billing this as the last event,” Don said. “It's a fragile time in life. Even if their heart's in it, I don't think their body will allow them to do it” another year.
The family is in the process of selling Clark's resort (once named Clark's Cabins and then renamed the Skagit River Resort) and restaurant, which are being renovated.
Resort superintendent Kevin Salter said Clark's famous rolls would still be served at the restaurant.
At 11 a.m., a caravan of DOT road-crew vehicles arrived at the gate. Family members rolled Clark's wheelchair to the gate and they held out their arms as they pushed.
“Go, Tootsie,” yelled someone in the gathered crowd.
“Beautiful, beautiful,” said a DOT worker as the gate swung open.
“Another year!” shouted Jurene Brooks, Clark's granddaughter.
A few minutes later, Clark set off for Winthrop, where they planned to eat a hamburger at a local joint named Three-Fingered Jack's Saloon.
They said they were excited to see so many people on their big day.
Over the years, “It just grew and everybody grew with it,” Clark said.
The adventurer is Guinness world record holder for longest journey by motorbike but loves their home country's wild spaces as much as anywhere they have visited
I travelled 735,000km in 10 years. This is almost as much as travelling from Earth to the moon and back. Starting in 1985 and arriving back in Argentina on 2 April 1995, I circled the globe twice on a Honda Gold Wing 1100 motorcycle after quitting my job. I had only $300 in my pocket. I had never left my country before, and I was embarking on a mind-blowing journey. My motorcycle was my main companion, along with the countless souls I met along the road. Muhammad Ali gave me a $50 bill. Pope John Paul II blessed me. I shared thoughts on travelling on Earth and to the moon with astronaut Buzz Aldrin. I used 13 passports of 64 pages each.

I did not choose my motorcycle. They picked me. Once, a colleague asked me to come along to see bikes in Buenos Aires. When I stepped into the place, I saw through the glass door of the dealer's office a photograph of an alluring black motorcycle with fairing, a radio, an antenna, suitcases on both sides and a sign that read: “The world is yours, on two wheels.” It became my motto. I had never ridden a motorcycle but I knew it was the one. I called it the Black Princess.
Money was too scarce for me to do any travelling when I was a child. I was born in Buenos Aires to a couple aged 17 and 18. My first adventure was in central Argentina, in the foothills of the green Sierras Chicas, in Cordoba province. I was four. There was a thread of water falling from a 15-metre-high stone wall into a pond. It then flowed through the grass and disappeared off to the horizon. I remember looking at the thread and pondering how far it went, and how far I could go.
Deep in the Amazon I met 50-year-old Pedro, a gold miner and a fugitive. They were as wise as a Jedi Master. When I told them I was not stopping by Santarém, a drowsy port town with white-sand river beaches in northern Brazil, they asked: “How does one pick a place and eliminate the others? How do you know that a place will not teach something?” Since then, I strove not to leave one single island, atoll, town or person behind.
Diving with whales off Puerto Madryn in Patagonia is one of the best experiences I have had in Argentina. They migrate to this area from Antarctica every year between June and December, their breeding season. The Valdes peninsula is one of the best whale-watching spots in South America and a Unesco world heritage site for marine mammals such as southern right whales.

I saw a sign that read 'The world is yours, on two wheels.' It became my motto
Patagonia often feels surreal. I once saw a rainbow so big it seemed to be the door to a different dimension. Walking along the deserted beaches of Patagonia's Cabo Vírgenes at kilometre 0 of Route 40 (which runs parallel with the Andes for about 5,000km) teaches you the meaning of true solitude.
There are some great places in the north of Argentina, too. The Quebrada de las Flechas (“gorge of the arrows”), also on Route 40, is extraordinary for its angled, pointed rock formations. The famous Iguazu falls, both in Argentina and Brazil, have to be visited, too.
At Salta, which is nicknamed “the beautiful”, visitors should try knife-cut meat empanadas – carne cortada a cuchillo – and spend a few days in a family hacienda rather than a hotel. Some of them, in the outskirts of the town, are more than 100 years old. They usually serve a fantastic breakfast with fresh homemade bread.

Two hours' drive north of Salta is Purmamarca, with its Cerro de Siete Colores (hill of seven colours) and Inca past. It is part of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, a 95-mile-long valley used as a major economic and cultural route for at least 10,000 years, and now a Unesco world heritage site. You have to spend at least a night in the Spanish neocolonial-styled Hotel Manantial del Silencio (double room from £95 B&B) with its beautiful interior and views of the colourful hill.
I believe that God decides people's jobs. I got to be a traveller and I will commit to doing it for the rest of my life. I am positive that humans were born to grow wings, not roots.

When Nintendo said that the Switch would be region-free, they really meant it. Following the roll out of the first system update, several users discovered that it is possible (and incredibly easy) to access eShops from different regions on the Switch. In this article, we're going to walk you through all of the steps.
The first thing you're going to want to do is create a new Nintendo Account in the region of the eShop you plan on checking out. Japan currently has more than twice as many games on its eShop than the United States, so that's probably the region you're going to want to go with. Just head to my.nintendo.com/getting_started, click on one of the “Get started” buttons and fill out all the relevant information. When you reach the box that says “Country/region of residence,” choose Japan. Submit the form, verify your registration and you're done.
Now that you have a Japanese Nintendo Account, you need to grab your Switch and add a new user. Select an icon, choose a nickname and then “Sign In and Link” the Nintendo Account you just created. When you get to the “Linking a Nintendo Account” page, choose “Sign in using an e-mail address or User ID” and input the appropriate information on the next screen. Voila! You're almost done.
All you have to do now to access the Japanese eShop is tap on the eShop icon, choose the new user you created when it asks you to pick one and you'll be transferred to the digital store of your chosen region. From here, you can download demos for Dragon Quest Heroes I•II and Puyo Puyo Tetris or buy one of the many Neo Geo games that haven't made their way to the US eShop yet.
As we discussed this week, the Switch has plenty of issues, but region-locking isn't one of them. You can read our review of the Switch for our full thoughts on Nintendo's latest, greatest home console.
“We overestimate how effectively scientific arguments secularize people. It's not science that's secularizing Americans — it's sex.”
That is the conclusion of University of Texas sociologist Mark Regnerus in their article Christians are part of the same dating pool as everyone else. That's bad for the church, in The Washington Post.
Their book “Cheap Sex: The Transformation of Men, Marriage, and Monogamy” (Oxford, 2017), Regnerus discusses the changes in sexual attitudes and behavior over the last few decades and demonstrates their consequences in marriage, family, and culture. This article looks specifically at the impact of what they call “cheap sex” on the church, with which they are in sympathy.
Though Christians too are struggling with sexual issues, churches are still made up mostly of adults who are married. But they observe, citing an interesting article about pornography, “Cheap sex, it seems, has a way of deadening religious impulses.”
Cohabiting couples tend to stay away from church. So do others engaged in sexual practices that they know violate Christian sexual morality. It isn't that churches are actively rejecting them. Most churches are far less strict than they used to be and many would be quite welcoming. But cohabiting couples and sexually-active singles don't feel comfortable in church, as if they know that their behavior is transgressive.
This has implications for the much-discussed problem of why young people tend to desert the church as soon as they go off to college. Dr. Regnerus says, “Perhaps the increasing lack of religious affiliation among young adults is partly a consequence of widening trends in nonmarital sexual behavior among young Americans, in the wake of the expansion of pornography and other tech-enhanced sexual behaviors.”
So it isn't that young people go off to the university and lose their faith because of an atheistic professor teaching them that there is no God. Rather, it may be because they want to take part in the sexual dating and hook-up culture that dominates most university campuses. More precisely, a student who wants to have sex with their girlfriend but who is constrained by their fear of God's judgment is more likely to find the atheistic professor more persuasive.
Of course now, sex has become so “cheap” that a word like “girlfriend” has become anachronistic. With online pornography, the student hungry for sex doesn't even need a girlfriend–just a computer.
But eventually, the young adults have tended to get married and to have children. At that point–that is, when their sexuality becomes ordered and fruitful according to God's design–they usually return to church. And no matter how many wild oats they have sown in their personal lives and even though they still fall into the more permissive age demographic, couples tend to revert to more conservative sexual values once they get married.
But today, due largely to the “cheap sex” that Dr. Regnerus chronicles, many adults are not getting married. So many of those who left as young people are not returning to church at all.
Many of the “unchurched” don't go along with Christian sexual ethics, which prevents them from attending. Some congregations, for whom attracting new members is everything, are trying to attract the unchurched by toning down their teachings about sex, but that seldom works.
The notion that sin causes unbelief makes sense. And it accords with numerous life stories. St. Augustine resisted conversion, even after they became convinced of the truth of Christianity, because they knew that they would have to give up their illicit sexual relationships. Autobiographies of contemporary secularists often tell about “giving up my religion” in the course of their early sexual experiences. And it fits with people we know. And, often, our personal experiences.
It also refutes what some naive Christians blithely assume: “I will give in to this sin, but I can always repent later.” Sin hardens the heart and sears the conscience, to use Scriptural terms. At some point, you cannot repent. You start to justify your behavior. Which entails denying your sinfulness. Which makes you care nothing for the Gospel.
Sin is toxic to faith. Then again, faith is toxic to sin. So those who want to cling to their sinfulness want to keep away from faith, often becoming actively hostile to it.
God's Word of Law and Gospel can break this cycle. And God's provision for sexual desire is marriage, which replaces “cheap sex” with valuable sex, reversing its sterility to make it life-giving.

How common are planets like Earth? That's been a question astronomers and dreamers have pondered for decades, and now, thanks to the Kepler spacecraft, they have an answer. One in five Sun-like stars in our galaxy have Earth-sized planets that could host life, according to a recent study of Kepler data.
“What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye. That is amazing,” said UC Berkeley graduate student Erik Petigura, who led the analysis of the Kepler and Keck Observatory data.
The Kepler telescope's mission was to try and find small rocky planets with the potential for hosting liquid water and perhaps the ingredients needed for biology to take hold. For four years, the space telescope monitored the brightness of more than 150,000 stars, recording a measurement every 30 minutes.

For a recent focused study, scientists concentrated on 42,000 sun-like stars (G and K type stars), looking for periodic dimmings that occur when a planet transits — or crosses in front of — its host star. A team of scientists from the Kepler mission and the Keck telescope in Hawaii have announced that from that survey, they found 603 planets, 10 of which are Earth size and orbit in the habitable zone, where conditions permit surface liquid water.
Since there are about 200 billion stars in our galaxy, with 40 billion of them like our Sun, noted planet-hunter Geoff Marcy said that gives us about 8.8 billion Earth-size planets in the Milky Way.
But Marcy also cautioned that Earth-size planets in Earth-size orbits are not necessarily hospitable to life, even if they orbit in the habitable zone of a star where the temperature is not too hot and not too cold.
“Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive. Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbor liquid water suitable for living organisms,” Marcy said. “We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life.”
All of the potentially habitable planets found in their survey are around K stars, which are cooler and slightly smaller than the sun, Petigura said. But the team's analysis shows that the result for K stars can be extrapolated to G stars like the sun.
The Kepler spacecraft is now crippled because of faulty gyroscopes, but scientists say had Kepler survived for an extended mission, it would have obtained enough data to directly detect a handful of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of G-type stars.
If the stars in the Kepler field are representative of stars in the solar neighborhood, then the nearest (Earth-size) planet is expected to orbit a star that is less than 12 light-years from Earth and can be seen by the unaided eye. Future instrumentation to image and take spectra of these Earths need only observe a few dozen nearby stars to detect a sample of Earth-size planets residing in the habitable zones of their host stars.
“For NASA, this number – that every fifth star has a planet somewhat like Earth – is really important, because successor missions to Kepler will try to take an actual picture of a planet, and the size of the telescope they have to build depends on how close the nearest Earth-size planets are,” said Andrew Howard, astronomer with the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. “An abundance of planets orbiting nearby stars simplifies such follow-up missions.”

Twenty-seven years after "3 Men and a Baby" hit theaters, the identical twin actores who played Baby Mary are all grown up. Funny how time works like that.
Lisa Blair and Michelle Blair Ontonovich were just 4-months-old when they took turns playing Mary Bennington alongside Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg in the 1987 box office smash. If you were wondering what ever happened to the Blair sisters, well, the "Today" show has it covered.
The sisters stopped by Monday, June 16, to chat with co-host Savannah Guthrie about their experience (of which they obviously have no recollection). So what was it like to grow up and realize they were part of such a huge movie?
"At first, when we were little, it wasn't a big deal to us at all," Michelle explained. "I think it was when we became teenagers, people started coming up to us a lot more …"
"Asking us for our autographs and everything," Lisa said, finishing their sister's sentence.
The sisters didn't explain how anyone would have recognized them as teenagers from the role they played as infants, but it apparently happened.
These days both Blair sisters have left Hollywood behind them. Lisa, who also appeared in "Morella" in 1999, works in customer service, while Michelle works in the insurance industry and is married with a 5-month-old son.
Reason number 89,562,490 why I could never, ever be a conservative: I lack the inherent mean streak necessary to qualify. For all their posturing about how generous they are with their charity dollars, yada yada, the fact remains that they're downright mean. Rush Limbaugh thinks poor kids should dumpster dive? No problem for conservatives. They agree.
So here's the newest conservative budget-saver. Michigan State Senator Bruce Caswell thinks foster kids should only be allowed to buy secondhand clothes. Hey, it would save the state about $17 bucks, so there's that.
Michigan Messenger:
Under a new budget proposal from State Sen. Bruce Casswell, children in the state's foster care system would be allowed to purchase clothing only in used clothing stores. Casswell, a Republican representing Branch, Hillsdale, Lenawee and St. Joseph counties, made the proposal this week, reports Michigan Public Radio. Their explanation? “I never had anything new,” Caswell says. “I got all the hand-me-downs. And my dad, they did a lot of shopping at the Salvation Army, and their comment was — and quite frankly it's true — once you're out of the store and you walk down the street, nobody knows where you bought your clothes.” Under their plan, foster children would receive gift cards that could only be used at places like the Salvation Army, Goodwill and other second hand clothing stores.
Quite frankly, I don't give a jolly red rip about Caswell's daddy making them wear secondhand clothes. And yes, you can hit the Salvation Army and occasionally find something worth wearing. But is they suggesting these kids should buy secondhand underwear, socks and shoes too? Evidently so, or they can just suck it up and go without.
This seems to me like a guy working out their own childhood. I fully expected their next proposal to be eliminated school buses in the winter because they had to walk 30 miles in the hip-deep snow to get to school and dammit, they liked it. And while this proposal has been dropped from the budget, other proposals have been inserted that are equally mean, equally targeted at those least able to speak or have any power in this process, and are just as demeaning.
It's just mean. Mean-spirited. Another way of saying to those kids (who, by the way, are not foster kids because they requested that particular status) that they're just not quite worth the investment of a new pair of jeans and shoes.
Mean.

Bare-ly believable footage has been revealed of an angry naked man chasing a car in Hither Green and then attacking a punter at a nearby bookie.
The nude walker was spotted hanging out on Hither Green Lane and the video, apparently taken earlier this month, shows the occupants of a car baiting them with a series of vile abusive taunts, appearing to hurl a newspaper at him.
But they may have got more than they bargained for, as the camera then captures the man banging on their car before chasing them down the street.
The group's abuse of the man continues and they stop outside a bookie, confronting a punter before taking a swing at them and getting involved in a scuffle.
VIDEO ABOVE CONTAINS CONTENT AND LANGUAGE WHICH MAY OFFEND SOME PEOPLE.
"Run them over, fam," says one of the occupants as the car reverses to capture the fight on camera.
The final shot sees the naked man walking down the middle of the road with a pair of shorts clutched in theirs hand.
Reaction to the video, which has been shared more than 1,000 times online, has been mixed with some finding it funny and others concerned for the nudist's welfare.
One user wrote: "This is really sad, and people take such things and find it funny, they obviously have some mental health problems, hope someone gives them the help they need."

But the person who uploaded the video speculated the man may have been caught in an amorous encounter. They wrote: "Bwoiiii......him could've been caught at a next man gal's yard. Had to do a quick getaway. Lol!"
Other social media users claim to have spotted the man before. One wrote: "He must be the same man my friend keeps talkin about seeing.....he must also be the same man I saw last week sunday on the sane road. Wearing nothin but an afro, 4 hats...yes 4 hats a jeans jacket and a thong.... but I was driving and couldn't get my phone out quick enough."

By RON CLAIBORNE and DAN PRZYGODAChelsea King was the focus of intense media attention and law enforcement effort, with hundreds of officers and thousands of volunteers joining the search for her.Almost exactly a year earlier and about 10 miles from where King was last seen jogging, 14-year-old Amber Dubois left home to walk to school, never to be seen again. Yet, Dubois' case got far less media attention and seemingly fewer law enforcement resources.Hundreds of thousands of children are reported missing every year. A hundred or so turn out to be the result of foul play, and only a handful of those get the kind of media scrutiny that King's case got.Ernie Allen, president of the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, says the cases that get the most attention tend to involve pre-teen children where it's immediately apparent that foul play by a stranger, not a family member, is suspected."Chelsea's case received enormous media attention because it was dramatic and sensational. The child goes jogging in a park area and doesn't come home. With Amber Dubois, nobody saw their disappear, and there's no tangible physical evidence," Allen said. "She just disappeared."There have been countless high-profile cases involving young girls, including the disappearances of Caylee Anthony, Jessica Lunsford, Somer Thompson and Madeleine McCann, whose story went global because of their telegenic look and their media-savvy parents.Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University, explains that the reason the media tends to go in a frenzy around these types of cases is really because of a self-fulfilling prophecy."Once one of these stories is decided to be covered, there's no turning back," Thompson said. "You've sent your reporters and your trucks to it, and you become invested in it. You start building interest in the story, and your audience wants to hear more about it, so you keep everyone there to continue reporting on it."Critics Site Racial Inequality in Press CoverageMany African-Americans and Latinos also perceive a racial bias to the coverage. Some believe more attention is paid to missing white children than to black or Hispanic children. Critics point to several examples.The 2003 kidnap and murder of African-American college student Romona Moore from Brooklyn, N.Y., was eclipsed by the disappearance of Svetlana Aranov, a white woman from Manhattan's Upper East Side .LaToyia Figueroa, a young African-American and Hispanic woman, who disappeared while pregnant in Philadelphia in 2005, only got a fraction of the news coverage as Natalie Holloway, a white teen who vanished in Aruba around the same time.Kathy Times, a member of the National Association of Black Journalists explained, "If you're white, wealthy, cute and under 12, then you're more likely to get the eye of the national media."Quoting from a Scripps Howard study, Times continues, "One study showed that about 35,000 kids went missing one year, and a little more than half of those were white, but about 67 percent of stories covered by The Associated Press were about white children."And then there was the case of 13-year-old Laura Ayala, a Latina teen, who vanished near their Houston home in 2002 as they went down the block to buy a newspaper for a class assignment."The Hispanic media was wonderful," Allen said. "The mainstream media wasn't as interested. Is that because their mom couldn't tell their story in English? I don't know."

Authorities in Germany suspect that the wave of alleged sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve which were said to have been committed by migrants from North Africa and the Middle East was part of a “rape game” that is popularly known in Arab countries as “taharush.”
The “game,” which is believed to be particularly widespread in Egypt, entails orchestrated sexual assaults by groups of men in large events attended by masses of people.
As part of the “game,” a group of men surrounds their intended victim. A few members of the group proceed to sexually assault their prey, while others in the gang prevent passersby from intervening. In some cases, the incident ends with full-on rape of the woman or mugging.The logic behind carrying out such an orchestrated attack during a large-scale demonstration is that it is much easier for the assailants to disappear into the massive crowd and avoid identification, thus enabling them to escape punishment.Perhaps the most infamous case – at least to Western audiences – involving gang rape in a public space was that of television journalist Lara Logan.Logan, a correspondent for CBS News' "60 Minutes," survived a brutal sexual assault at the hands of a mob while covering Egypt's political uprising in 2011. The incident took place in Cairo's Tahrir Square on the day Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak stepped down from power.Logan, a South Africa native and longtime war correspondent, was one of dozens of journalists attacked during several weeks of protests throughout Egypt leading up to Mubarak's ouster in February 2011. They were covering celebrations in Tahrir Square for "60 Minutes" when they and their team were surrounded by a mob and they became separated from their crew, according to CBS News.After suffering a brutal and sustained sexual assault and beating by the mob, Logan was rescued by a group of women who intervened, along with Egyptian soldiers who finally arrived on the scene, CBS said.Authorities in Germany are now trying to gauge the methods used by Arab countries in dealing with attacks similar to those allegedly committed in Cologne.“These kinds of crimes, which were committed by groups of young people, are a source of concern for the local police during large-scale gatherings like protests and demonstrations,” a police spokesperson said.Emotions are running high in German cities after the mass attacks in Cologne and other towns.Over 200 masked right-wing supporters, carrying placards with racist overtones, went on a rampage in the eastern city of Leipzig on Monday night, throwing fireworks, breaking windows and vandalizing buildings, police said.The attacks have deepened public skepticism towards Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy and their mantra that Germany can cope with the 1.1 million migrants who arrived in the country last year. It has also fueled right-wing groups.As roughly 2,000 anti-Muslim "LEGIDA" protesters marched peacefully in the city center, police said a separate group of 211 people walked through the southern Connewitz district before setting of fireworks, erecting barricades and vandalizing property. The top floor of one building caught fire.The group carried a placard reading "Leipzig bleibt Helle", or "Leipzig stays light", an apparent reference to the skin color of residents.

Arrow season 4 will reportedly bring a whole lot of new issues for Oliver and Felicity.
After three seasons of playing hide and seek, the couple finally got together and drove off into the sunset in the season 3 finale. However, their relationship will be put to test as Oliver gets called back to Starling City in the upcoming season.
Their return to the city may be the beginning of the obstacles that is said to pop out in their relationship, reports Christian Post.
The show's executive producer Wendy Mericle told TV Guide, "We really wanted to explore the ups and downs of a traditional TV relationship, like we've established with Oliver and Felicity, and pretty much throw everything at it that we can and see if they'll make it through."
A new villain Damien Darhk (to be played by Neal McDonough) will pose a major threat to Starling City and Team Arrow will need Oliver back. Rumours suggest that Oliver's sister Thea will land themselves in trouble with the new villain causing Oliver to return as the Green Arrow.
Reportedly, the season 4 premiere episode will also feature Sara Lance aka White Canary. There is no confirmation as yet though, but the series creator Marc Guggenheim has said that White Canary will be playing an important role in the first few episodes of Arrow season 4.
Meanwhile, actor John Barrowman (who plays Malcolm Merlyn and now the new Ra's al Ghul) has assured that the season 4 premiere will be intense.
"Bring your tissues, bring everything..." said Barrowman in an earlier interview with TVLine. "It's one of those episodes where, when you're watching, you're gonna go, 'What?!?!'" (via Franchise Herald)
Arrow season 4 premieres on 7 October, 2015.
It was the morning commute from hell on the TTC. In a string of incidents and issues Thursday — causing delays which prompted an apology from Mayor John Tory — the transit service responded to everything from signal issues to medical emergencies to a trespasser on the tracks.

Thousands of passengers at the height of rush hour had to deal with at least 40 additional minutes to their travel times. And, if anything, commuters were united by their bitterness. “The TTC is an “Award Winning Transit Service” . . . this is why participation trophies are bad,” one passenger tweeted. “Getting screwed over by the TTC one last time before my farewell to this city,” another added.

There was also some sweetness. Commuter Nikki Clydesdale said passengers were trading seats between stations, offering their spot to anyone having a rough time standing for so long. “The (emergency) workers were doing a great job of helping people out,” Clydesdale said. “I saw them laughing with and comforting a girl who was having an anxiety attack.” The chaotic sequence began around 6 a.m. when the TTC tweeted about a five-minute delay southbound between St. George and St. Patrick stations because of signal issues. The delay steadily grew worse. Between Sheppard West and St. Patrick stations, more signal problems meant a 40-minute delay by 8 a.m. Commuters took to social media to declare that the delays were actually much longer.
“When a 20-minute subway ride turns into a 1.5-hour subway ride. Thanks #TTC,” one passenger tweeted. Fourteen emergency alarms were set off across the TTC over the course of the morning, including passengers fainting and having seizures inside the subway cars. This led to a “domino effect” and caused more delays, TTC spokesperson Brad Ross said.

Problems on the morning commute included: Trains turning back at Islington station due to signal issues at Kipling on Line 2 at around 8:30 a.m. but the issue was later resolved. Inside Queen's Park station around 9 a.m, a pair of medical incidents drew emergency services to the same platform. As the train crawled into the station, commuters reached out to find water for a sick girl, crouching down to offer them help. A suspicious package was reported near the Bloor subway station around 11 a.m. Bloor St. shut down at Yonge while the situation was investigated. No evacuations were necessary. At around 11:50 a.m, the TTC had also suspended service both ways at Rosedale station, with a power-off situation because of a trespasser at the track level. Power was rebooted quickly after the issue was resolved. It wasn't until nearly 1:30 p.m., when the original signal issue at St. Patrick was resolved. Ross said the TTC sincerely apologized to passengers for the delays. The situation's origins had been traced back to Wednesday night maintenance crews, they explained, who inadvertently caused the signals at St. Patrick station to default to red and cause longer-than-normal travel times. A piece of equipment was mistakenly removed from an equipment room. To resolve the issue, track crews had to manually allow trains to bypass over trip arms that normally prevent trains from running red lights. Because of the issue southbound at St. Patrick, not enough trains were able to leave Wilson Yard to meet the morning rush. “This was a unique, one-off situation that has not happened before and should not happen again,” they wrote in an explainer posted on Twitter. Tory also apologized. The mayor posted five tweets on the delays, beginning with an apology on behalf of the city and the TTC. “It was due to work being done overnight installing the automatic train control system,” Tory wrote of the Line 1 disruption. “We're trying our hardest to avoid disruptions at all times as we work to install this new signal system . . . once we have automatic train control, this won't happen — that's why we're installing it and replacing a decades-old system. “We will continue to try to do better and we know today's TTC service didn't meet the standard that people expect and deserve.” Later in the day, at St. Clair West station, some riders voiced their concerns to TTC staff at the transit agency's monthly hour-long “Meet-the-Managers” event. “The TTC is a great system . . . with a lot of ancient technology,” said customer Sajjad Syed, who stopped by to talk delays and overall cleanliness on TTC vehicles. Syed said better communication is needed by TTC staff during delays such as the one experienced on Thursday. The issues come just before a planned disruption of the transit service on Saturday and Sunday, where Line 1 will be closed between Sheppard West and St. George for signal upgrades for the second time in a month. Installation of the new signal system is expected to be completed by 2019. With files from Alanna Rizza and Sammy Hudes Correction – August 16, 2017: This article was edited from a previous version that said the delay was caused by the removal of a piece of equipment 1950s from an equipment room at St. Patrick Station. In fact, the equipment was from a later decade.

It is extraordinary that a religion claiming to be completely based on ahimsa should be the reason for the extinction of our national bird, the peacock. The peacock is the only bird whose feathers are allowed to be sold – and this became a part of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 – solely because the Jains put so much pressure on the Congress party and Smt. Indira Gandhi. So, shops came up selling feathers and other people started buying the easily available feathers. Subsequently,every study and raid by wildlife departments showed that these feathers could only have come from the bird being killed. A demand rose for this exception in the Act to be removed.
During Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee's time, the Act came to Parliament for this amendment. I sat for a long time with the Prime Minister who was an eminently sensitive human being. I showed them the data on peacocks disappearing from most of India and what the various raids had uncovered. They agreed to ban the sale of feathers. Shri Pramod Mahajan entered the room. In a very loud voice they insisted that the party would lose the entire Jain vote becausethe Digambara monks were very upset at the idea of peacock feathers being banned. The Prime Minister ordered the amendment to be withdrawn.
A third try was made in 2013 during Shri Jairam Ramesh's time. Again it failed because the Jain community sent a million threatening messages and, as usual, the politicians backed off. Better to lose the national bird than to lose a single vote – even if it is the vote of monks who do not vote.
The Jains are not stupid or ignorant – far from it. They know that silk is made of dead butterflies and silver varakh, till July 2016, was made with the intestines of cows and buffaloes. But they continue to use both. They will eat vegetarian food – but none of them is vegan even though they know that the cow is forced to give milk, suffers when they lose their own baby to slaughter and two years lateris killed herself. They know that peacock feathers come from murdered birds, but their monks insist on owning tails made of feathers, so they allow this bird to be killed. Like every religion, Jainism has millions of adherents who claim to aspire to ahimsa but are hinsak in their day-to-day living.
What do they claim? That the feathers are made from naturally shed feathers. That has never been true. The peacock sheds one feather every month. No one is going to pick up that single feather and sell it. Peacocks don't live in large groups so there is no question of one place having hundreds of shed feathers. That single feather is eaten almost immediately by other creatures who get calcium from the spine.
The Jains are basically business people. So they know that to do commerce, one needs a steady and large supply. And like the skin of one dead cow in some remote village cannot sustain the leather industry, the hundreds of peacock feather shops in religious places cannot be sustained by waiting for peacocks to drop solitary feathers.
The Digambar Jain munis, when they renounce the world, must have no possessions except a kamandalu (which is a tree gourd from the kamandalu tree, which has also become extremely rare because no Jains have ever planted new ones. They have simply helped themselves to the fruit so that new trees could never grow.) and a pichchi which is a small broom to sweep an area where the Muni sits. At some point the Munis decided that the broom should be made of colourful and rich peacock feathers. And now this utilitarian cleaning item has become an important ritual of the religion itself – a religion that was supposed to be a reaction to elaborate Brahmanical ritual.
Over the years it has become even worse. The number of Jain munis has grown and so more peacock feathers are needed. At the same time, because of deforestation and sustained killing the number of peacocks has shrunk. Because it is legal to buy peacock feathers, many foreign tourists also buy them quite happily.
The items that Jain ascetics carry around are known as upadhi or upakaraṇa. It is important to understand that these are not possessions of the monks and nuns, because the principle of non-attachment or non-possession – aparigraha – is a crucial one for Jain mendicants. They do not own these items, which are given to them, and they must avoid feelings of attachment or possession towards them. Mendicants are given them as – dāna – by lay people.
But now, the Digambar munis have become so attached to these brooms that they want a new one every year. So a new tradition called Pichchi parivartan samaroh has started in which the old pichchi is thrown away, after really elaborate ceremonies, and another even more grand pichchi is presented to the muni by their devotees. Something like getting a new sari at Diwali every year or presents at Christmas.
It would be quite simple for the Muni to check whether the feather has been naturally shed or not. A naturally shed feather would be whole and have a tapering white funnel. A feather that has been taken from a killed bird always has this funnel cut because, while removing it forcibly, it fills with blood. Every Jain pichchi has half cut stalks.
Swetambar munis use cotton or pichchis called rajoharanas or Oghas. And none of them are attached to their brooms. Digambara monks made their own sect to emphasise that they were sky clad. They do not wear any clothes as it is considered to be parigraha (possession), which ultimately leads to attachment. So munis who are not attached to clothes are fanatic about their brooms?
I was at a friend's house and we talked about the idea of renunciation. They told me the story of how a monk was celebrated because they were so detached from the world. They owned nothing but a small pot for drinking water and washing in. But one day when the pot rolled away they scrambled after it so hard and so desperately that they fell and hurt their knees. Ownership is ownership. The Digambara monks of Jainism need to be actually disconnected from all things. Having less or more is irrelevant if one is attached to even one thing. The peacock feather pichchi has become a symbol of their attachment to all the things on Earth. Simply knowing the scriptures does not make a religious or spiritual leader – specially in Jainism where non-attachment to all things, even clothes, is revered. We all look up to the ideal Jain monk, but where is he? For one feather tail they encourage the death of millions of birds, because they refuse to let this tail go.
Instead of understanding what I am saying, no doubt the Digambar sect will again rally round and make a noise. So, I will say michchhami dukham for causing any hurt. But who will say michchhami dukham to the spirits of all the thousands of dead peacocks.
Of the 28 mūla guņas (primary attributes), the first is Ahimsa : not to injure any living being through actions or thoughts. Number 5 is Aparigraha, the renunciation of all worldly things. Brooms are not listed as an exception. Number 2 is to speak and acknowledge the truth – which is that their brooms are causing extinction of an entire species. Number 9 is Adan-nishep, the careful handling of possessions- not the discarding and replacement of brooms every year. Whether it is Pratikhayan (renunciation) or Kayotsarga, all the 28 lead directly to the giving up of attachment to all worldly things. If the purpose of the peacock broom is to save the lives of small insects by sweeping them away, what about saving the life of the peacock itself and changing to cotton or even to plant stalks.

The strength of Opposition TDP in Telangana Assembly has been reduced from 15 to just three, with 12 party MLAs, who switched loyalty to TRS, being recognised as members of the ruling party in the House. A bulletin to this effect has been issued, official sources said.
"They are now treated as members of TRS," the sources said.
Out of the 15 MLAs who won on TDP ticket in the 2014 Assembly elections, 12 have switched over to TRS since then.
The Chandrababu Naidu-led party, which is ruling adjoining Andhra Pradesh, is now left with just three MLAs -- A Revanth Reddy, Sandra Venkata Veeraiah and R Krishnaiah.
Ten TDP MLAs, who had switched loyalty to TRS, urged the Assembly Speaker last month to merge them with the ruling party.
Two more -- M Gopinath and Arikapudi Gandhi -- have joined them in the last few days. Yesterday, TDP suspended the duo for violating party discipline and principles.
The Budget session of Telangana Assembly began yesterday.
DirecTV is making good on its promise to launch live 4K telecasts in early 2016, though it's doing so entirely on its own.
On April 7, the AT&T-owned satellite provider will launch a “DirecTV 4K” channel, with the Masters golf tournament as its inaugural offering. Barring any last-minute surprises from other TV providers, this should be the first live 4K UltraHD telecast in the United States.
The Masters telecast will run from April 7 through April 10, roughly between the hours of 10:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time. Instead of traditional coverage that bounces around the entire course, DirecTV will be setting up shop around the 11th, 12th, and 13th holes of the Augusta National Golf Club. (The regular telecast will run on CBS.)
Beyond the tournament, the 4K channel will include videos from DirecTV-owned Audience Network, a selection of documentaries, and other unspecified UltraHD content. DirecTV continues to offer downloadable 4K movies to subscribers as well.
To watch the new channel, subscribers will need either an Ultimate or Premiere package, the latest Genie HD DVR (HR54), and either a DirecTV 4K-ready TV or a 4K Genie Mini connected to any HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 compliant 4K television.
Why this matters: The live 4K telecast is a milestone for the pay-TV industry, which has lagged behind streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime in supporting the higher-resolution format. But it also underscores how much further 4K has to go, as not a single regular channel is offering an UltraHD variant. DirecTV has previously boasted of having capacity for 50 UltraHD channels, and said it would be “bringing our check books” to partners who wanted in. For now, however, the satellite provider stands alone.
This story, "DirecTV sets up the first UltraHD TV channel in the United States, starting with the Masters golf tournament" was originally published by TechHive .
Zee is the American way of saying the letter z. Zed is the British way. Neither is right nor wrong, and nobody is ignorant for pronouncing z the way they do.
The zed pronunciation is older, and it more closely resembles the Greek letter, zeta, from which the English letter is derived. And zed is closer to other languages' spelling and pronunciation of the letter; for instance, the French say zède, German speakers say zet, and Spanish speakers say zeta. These are points in zed‘s favor.

The U.S. pronunciation probably came about by analogy with the letters bee, cee, dee, gee, and so on. It was standard in American English by the 19th century, and it's now so deeply engrained that many Americans are unaware of the British pronunciation.
Australian and New Zealand English speakers usually say zed. Canadians say both.
The hardest part is past for one of the men attempting a ground-breaking Yosemite climb.
A Facebook post from Tommy Caldwell early Wednesday said they had completed the last of the most difficult segments on the Dawn Wall.
Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are attempting to be the first people to free-climb the section of El Capitan called the Dawn Wall — climbing it without relying on a rope or other climbing aids.
Because the remaining segments are easier, Caldwell could finish the 3,000-foot climb over the weekend. In this attempt, they and Jorgeson have been on the wall since Dec. 27. They are climbing at night because daytime temperatures on the south-facing wall are too warm.
Jorgeson is still attempting to complete a lower segment; they have been hampered by fingers scraped and cut on the sharp edges of granite.
The section that Caldwell completed in the wee hours was the last one rated 5.14 on the Yosemite Decimal System of climbing difficulty.
Caldwell, 36, and Jorgeson, 30, have been working for several years to establish the route, practicing each of the 30 pitches, or segments. They use harnesses and ropes for protection, but if they put weight on the rope, they consider it a fall and start the segment again.
Lovin' Dublin founder Niall Harbison has accused Fáilte Ireland of plagiarism and has sought legal advice over the State body's use of its ‘Dublin- a breath of fresh air' logo.
Lovin' Dublin founder Niall Harbison has accused Fáilte Ireland of plagiarism and has sought legal advice over the State body's use of its ‘Dublin- a breath of fresh air' logo.
Mr Harbison said it was “tough having your every move replicated by a State body in Visit Dublin”.
The allegations came as a shock to Fáilte Ireland, which said it was “mystified” by the statement.
"Fáilte Ireland is somewhat surprised at Niall's comments. Our new Dublin brand and logo is almost a year old and Niall was a member of the Growth Dublin Taskforce and would have had an opportunity to provide their own input when the logo was being designed,” a spokesperson for Fáilte Ireland told the Irish Independent.
However, the Lovin' Group boss denied their input in the design of the logo.
“That's not true; I sat in on the first session and then left immediately. I was invited to join it so I sat in on the first session and then left,” Mr Harbison told Independent.ie.
The tweet from earlier today
The tourism body launched the ‘Dublin - A breath of fresh air' in October of last year. The campaign was started to reposition the city and county and secure its appeal to overseas for the long-term.
The €1m campaign is funded by Fáilte Ireland, four local Dublin authorities and a collection of private-sector partners.
Fáilte Ireland said the two parties had done a pilot piece of work that had been co-branded. The State's tourism arm also said Lovin' Dublin had produced content for it, which had been shared through its channels.
"For over a year since the new brand's launch they have never raised any issue with us regarding its look or design. They had plenty of opportunities to do so as they have been working a lot with our Dublin team over the last year or so while their ‘Lovin Dublin' brand and our own ‘Dublin – A breath of Fresh Air' brand have teamed up on a number of occasions," the spokesperson said.
Fáilte claims the pair had worked quite closely and had a good relationship, with Mr Harbison making proposals to the body as early as a month ago.
"Indeed, as recently as last month we had communications from Niall with a view to discussing how we might work with their Lovin brand across all of our three brands (Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin) in 2017 and they never raised any issue regarding the logo. In that context, their tweet is slightly disappointing and somewhat mystifying," the spokesperson said.
Mr Harbison said they were unsure if this was the case.
It is understood the entrepreneur had approached Fáilte Ireland with suggestions but the body wanted to postpone the talks until 2017.

Supporters of a proposed ballot measure to increase the District's minimum wage to $15-per-hour rally Wednesday at the John A. Wilson Building. (Aaron C. Davis/The Washington Post)
A coalition of labor and social justice groups launched a ballot campaign Wednesday to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in the nation's capital, an effort that could place the District at the center of a growing national debate over income inequality.
The announcement coincided with protests by thousands nationwide for higher wages. Choosing tax day as their backdrop, workers walked off minimum-wage jobs in fast-food restaurants and retail stores to draw attention to a two-year-old rallying cry for a more livable hourly wage.
If successful, the D.C. measure would set the minimum wage at more than twice the federal rate — and put the District alongside Seattle and San Francisco in a liberal vanguard on the issue. On Wednesday, supporters pointed to new polling, an expected heavy turnout in a presidential election year and the backing of the financier of last year's successful measure to legalize marijuana in the city as evidence that the campaign should be taken seriously.
But in forcing the issue in 2016 — and in a place with the symbolic importance of Washington — supporters also risked drawing intense opposition from business interests, as well as thrusting Democratic politicians into a no-win choice between unions and employers.
The measure could also tee up another showdown between the District and a GOP-controlled Congress. Although some bipartisan support exists on Capitol Hill for raising the minimum wage, a $15-per-hour rate would be viewed by many conservatives as an affront to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. As they tried this year with the marijuana legalization effort, lawmakers could use their vast oversight powers of the federal district to block the ballot measure from taking effect.
None of those concerns came up Wednesday, when supporters announced the campaign before a cheering crowd of more than 200 on the steps of the District's John A. Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW.
“This fight is not about what Wal-Mart would say it's about, it's not about profit shares, it's not about stock prices and it's not about bottom lines,” said Delvone Michael, director of D.C. Working Families, a leading organizer. “This fight is about real people. This fight is about who we are as a city and what we become as a nation.”
With the federal minimum wage unchanged in six years, 29 states have raised hourly wages above the federal rate; 15 of those have additional increases scheduled in the coming year and a handful of mostly West Coast cities have gone much further.
Last year, Seattle and San Francisco became the first major U.S. cities to pledge to phase in a $15-an-hour wage by the end of the decade. The District, New York City and other East Coast cities have imposed a living wage on city contractors, but none of them have seriously weighed $15 an hour for the private sector.
The D.C. measure would mirror Seattle in phasing in a flat $15-per-hour minimum wage by 2019. That would be 30 percent higher than the $11.50 rate that the D.C. Council and mayor backed last year.
The ballot measure would also for the first time force D.C. restaurants to pay workers a minimum wage plus tips, as in San Francisco. Restaurants in the District are required to pay only $2.77 per hour, as long as tips bring servers up to the equivalent of minimum wage or higher.
“We're talking about righting a historic wrong,” said Meg Fosque, national policy director for the New York-based Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, or ROC, which has joined the D.C. coalition. Fosque said that with 7 in 10 wait staff employees being women and many being of color, the D.C. measure would force candidates and voters to confront the stark issues of income inequality and a gender pay gap.

Michael Czin, spokesperson for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), declined to say whether the mayor would endorse the ballot campaign.
“As with any grass-roots advocacy effort, we look forward to hearing directly from residents about issues important to them,” they said.
The city's restaurant association and Wal-Mart, which recently opened its first stores in the District, did not return calls or e-mails seeking comment.
Harry Wingo, president of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday that businesses were alarmed by the proposal.
“A dramatic wage hike could have a measurable impact on how easy it is to do business in the city,” they said. Wingo noted that the council just approved a three-step increase in the minimum wage last year. That ramp up includes a dollar increase to $10.50 this summer, and another, to $11.50, next summer.
“We're already on track to increase it dramatically. That would be the highest in the region,” they said.
Thorn Pozen, a D.C. lawyer who specializes in city election law, said advocates will first face the hurdle of getting the measure on the ballot. City law prohibits ­citizen-sponsored ballot measures that could adversely impact the District's budget. The Board of Elections has broadly interpreted that regulation in the past to block measures.
But advocates will have someone on their side who succeeded with an initiative last year to legalize marijuana, which also arguably cost the city money.
Adam Eidinger, who led the signature-gathering drive on Initiative 71, said they are confident the coalition will get its signatures and qualify for the ballot. Eidinger said that to raise awareness of the issue, they would go on a pot strike next year, refraining from using marijuana until D.C. voters pass the measure.
“I want to do something more than just marijuana,” they said, “and this is incredibly important.”
Eidinger's deep-pocketed boss is also on board.
David Bronner, the head of hemp-infused Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, met with leaders of the coalition last month. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Bronner said they would start with a financial investment of $200,000, more than they spent to underwrite the city's marijuana initiative.
“This whole economic recovery has completely left wages behind. We're talking about hiking the minimum wage. This isn't a living wage,” Bronner said. “Let's just say that when Wal-Mart has a holiday food drive for their own employees, come on.”
The final plan was based in part on polling the coalition conducted last month that suggested that backers would start with at least 70 percent approval among likely D.C. voters.
“I think it's so popular because middle-class folks are feeling squeezed, too. Everyone understands this is an issue,” said Michael, of D.C. Working Families.
Lisa Brown, executive vice president of 1199SEIU, which represents home health-care workers, mobilized dozens to attend Wednesday's announcement. They said their group would work to make sure voters realize how pervasive low-wage jobs are in the District.
“The sad condition of America is that most of these people are not kids, not teenagers. These are grown people, and in our case, ones who take care of some of the neediest people in our society, making minimum wage,” Brown said. “People don't like to speak about a class warfare, but there is a class warfare. . . . We have to stand up now.”

Preseason polls get cursed at and over-analyzed by most fans outside of the SEC, because their argument is that the country and media outlets prop up several different SEC teams, and eventually one will come out either unscathed or become a one-loss conference champion and play for a national championship. Several talking heads have expressed waiting until a few weeks into the season before ranking the top 25 and doing away with preseason polls altogether. Hell, I want to add more preseason polls, because it gives us something to talk about and makes for some great preseason commentary.
But with preseason expectations come teams that don't live up to that hype during the season. And I came across a fascinating website by Chris Stassen that compares teams' annual performances relative to preseason expectations.
Strassen's preseason and postseason polls were complied by different media outlets added over time, including Athlon, Sporting News, Phil Steele and Lindy. You can see an example of the 2003 preseason compilation here and 2012 compilation here. Post season rankings are based on final AP rankings.
Over the last decade (2003-2012), the SEC has won eight national championships with LSU, Florida and Alabama all winning multiple titles – Auburn hoisted the crystal ball once as well.
But which teams during that time continually underachieved with respect to their preseason hype? Kentucky is the only current SEC member never to start or finish the season ranked. Missouri and Texas A&M are added for comparison, even though they were Big 12 members for most of the time period.
Team Combined Delta (2003-2012) Tennessee -35 Florida -29.5 Georgia -21 LSU -13.5 Auburn -1.5 Missouri -1 Texas A&M -1 Vandy 3 Arkansas 4 Miss State 6 South Carolina 11 Ole Miss 17.5 Alabama 26.5
As you can see from the chart above, Tennessee is the biggest underachiever of the last decade in comparison to preseason expectations with a combined difference in preseason and postseason ranking of -35. 2005 was the Vols' worst year after starting third and finishing unranked. That's good for a difference of -23 in ‘05 alone.
Florida is right on Tennessee's heels with -29.5, and the Gators will be ranked close to the top 10 to begin 2013 once more.
On the contrary, Alabama is one of the two best performers that have lived up to the hype. In fact, they've surpassed expectations. Along with Bama, Ole Miss has consistently been a steady overachiever at a +17.5 differential.
The biggest underperformer in college football has been Oklahoma. If you thought Tennessee underperformed, Oklahoma is nearly double with a differential of -69. Yes, Big Game Bob is at their worst in big games, and only two years did OU actually live up to the hype of their preseason expectations during that time.
Here is a breakdown per season, starting in 2012 and finishing in 2003:

Never do I want to hear again from my conservative friends about how brilliant capitalists are, how much they deserve their seven-figure salaries and how government should keep its hands off the private economy.
The Wall Street titans have turned into a bunch of welfare clients. They are desperate to be bailed out by government from their own incompetence, and from the deregulatory regime for which they lobbied so hard. They have lost "confidence" in each other, you see, because none of these oh-so-wise captains of the universe have any idea what kinds of devalued securities sit in one another's portfolios.
So they have stopped investing. The biggest, most respected investment firms threaten to come crashing down. You can't have that. It's just fine to make it harder for the average Joe to file for bankruptcy, as did that wretched bankruptcy bill passed by Congress in 2005 at the request of the credit card industry. But the big guys are "too big to fail," because they could bring us all down with them.
Enter the federal government, the institution to which the wealthy are not supposed to pay capital gains or inheritance taxes. Good God, you don't expect these people to trade in their BMWs for Saturns, do you?
In a deal that the New York Times described as "shocking," J.P. Morgan Chase agreed over the weekend to pay $2 a share to buy all of Bear Stearns, one of the brand names of finance capitalism. The Federal Reserve approved a $30 billion -- that's with a "b" -- line of credit to make the deal work.
I don't fault Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairperson, for being so interventionist in trying to save the economy. On the contrary, Bernanke deserves credit for ignoring all the extreme free-market bloviation. They don't want the economy to collapse on their watch, so they are willing to violate all the conservatives' shibboleths about the dangers of government intervention. As a voter once told the legendary political journalist Richard Rovere: "Sometimes you have to forget your principles to do what's right."
But if this near meltdown of capitalism doesn't encourage a lot of people to question the principles they have carried in their heads for the past three decades or so, nothing will.
We had already learned the hard way -- in the crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed -- that capitalism is quite capable of running off the rails. Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was a response to the failure of the geniuses of finance (and their defenders in the economics profession) to realize what was happening or to fix it in time.
As the economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted of the era leading up to the Depression, "The threat to men of great dignity, privilege and pretense is not from the radicals they revile; it is from accepting their own myth. Exposure to reality remains the nemesis of the great -- a little understood thing."
But in the enthusiasm for deregulation that took root in the late 1970s, flowered in the Reagan era and reached its apogee in the second Bush years, we forgot the lesson that government needs to keep a careful watch on what capitalists do. Of course, some deregulation can be salutary, and the market system is, on balance, a wondrous instrument -- when it works. But the free market is just that: an instrument, not a principle.
In 1996, back when they were a Republican senator from Maine, William Cohen told me: "We have been saying for so long that government is the enemy. Government is the enemy until you need a friend."
So now the bailouts begin, and Wall Street usefully might feel a bit of gratitude, perhaps by being willing to have the wealthy foot some of the bill or to acknowledge that while its denizens were getting rich, a lot of Americans were losing jobs and health insurance. I'm waiting.

Share. My only friend, the end. My only friend, the end.
Note: Full spoilers for the Breaking Bad series finale follow.
That's it. That's all. Who saw that coming? Who saw it unfold just like that? Maybe you saw Uncle Jack vs. Walt, or Todd vs. Jesse, or Lydia getting ricin'd (oh my god they finally used the ricin), but who saw it go down exactly like that? The devil was always in the details with this show.
Aside from all of the ads, which were abrasive and interrupted a good portion of the episode, Felina resolved just as well as we were promised. We know Hank's body will be dug up. Walt got to see Holly one last time. The Neo-Nazis were killed. Jesse was freed. Walt died. In the aftermath, Skyler was freed as well, thanks partially to Walt pointing the DEA directly to the source of the blue meth, and Marie could properly bury Hank.
Exit Theatre Mode
For all of the work put into Breaking Bad, this series was a major accomplishment. We knew the end was coming. We knew Walt would have to do something, and we knew about the ricin and the M60. We saw it all coming and that didn't even take away one bit of the ending.
And thank goodness for that. For all of the shows that have ever aired, we've had maybe a handful that got to deliver an ending like this (The Wire, The Sopranos, The West Wing, and Lost are the ones I'm thinking of). There were no thank youare (except the final one), no highlight reels with “Good Riddance” playing over it. We weren't left questioning, we weren't left wondering why they ended it like that and we weren't left unsatisfied.
What if You Don't like the Breaking Bad Ending?
I keep coming back to Jesse's ending. For all of the punishment the sadists writing this show heaped upon him, they got out. They were alive. They killed Todd—he killed Todd!! Oh god, thank goodness they did. They did it just like Mike would've done, too: choking them from behind. How sweet. And they were free.
Picture it again in your mind: Jesse, driving in the car, laughing hysterically. They were finally free. God knows what happened to Brock or where Jesse goes from there, but it was wonderfully liberating.
There were a lot of similarities between the endings of “Felina” and “Salud”: both had a massive wipe out of the evil enemy; both had a second in command choking someone important; both had the ringleader of the event hoisted by their own petard. Walt didn't escape like Gus did, though.
And I'm so very happy that when Walt asked Jesse to shoot him, they finally said no to Walt. (And I'm also happy they didn't say “bitch” because that would've completely taken me out of the moment).
Lydia getting the ricin was … also pleasant, though I feel bad for saying that. But they deserved to die after Mike let them off the hook. I'm glad we didn't see that ending for them because it's horribly painful.
And we also got the final pieces of Elliot and Gretchen getting a little mess their way. Walt was forgiving them in their own way. I'm glad they started the episode with that scene. It was tense and we were all on the edge of our seats because it was the beginning of the finale. It let us unwind a bit, but it also served us some closure.
Exit Theatre Mode
Maybe one of the finer parts of this series is how Walt is the only character that changed so directly in personality traits from start to finish. It was their journey all along. Skyler was always direct and didn't take BS; Hank was always the buddy, a bit of a badass, and the guy you wanted to have a beer with; Marie was always a gossiper who used information to stay relevant; Jesse was always the good-spirited one who could withstand any punishment.
Walt went from repressed dying man to megalomaniac to dying man who wished he'd done it differently, but accepted what he'd done. It was very morality play-like.
And yet, in the end, Walt was as humanizing as they were in the beginning of the series. They didn't ask for forgiveness, but they knew what they had done. They saw Holly one last time and they made sure Skyler knew they did it for himself. They were no longer the monster and they aren't the slimy, squirmy mess trying to wriggle their way out from the wrong side of a gun.
IGN's Review of Breaking Bad's First Episode
In the final moments of Uncle Jack, the money really wasn't the thing that drove Walt. How beautiful that Jack offered them all of the money in their Uncle Jack way and Walt, with all of the power in their hands, just said no thank you by pulling the trigger.
It wasn't redeeming, though. They were too far past redemption. But they did free Jesse.
“Felina” was the victory lap. “Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair,” said Vince Gilligan and company. Yes, Saul is getting a prequel, but I don't expect any follow-up or alternate ending or spinoffs from the ending to Breaking Bad. This was the end of the end. The story is over and now we close the book.
What a story it was.
John Williams' soundtrack to Jurassic Park is one of their finest. In a career that involves work on the music for everything from E.T. to Star Wars that is high praise indeed, but it is well deserved. The stirring theme is iconic from the moment you hear it; a perfect way to capture the magic and wonder of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster (which is available to watch right now on Blinkbox).
With the sequel to the film, Jurassic World, receiving a worldwide release this weekend and set to be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, this unusual version of John Williams' theme has once again been making the rounds on social media. Soundcloud user BirdFeeder slowed down the music by 1000x to see what would happen to the score, and the results are quite frankly amazing. It's the kind of haunting ambient sound one might have heard in an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, or even a Micheal Mann movie.
Perfect for if you are stuck at your desk and wish to listen to something relaxing, check out how amazing it sounds just below:
Australia still has the most unaffordable housing markets in the world despite two years' of stagnant or falling house prices, according to the latest Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey.
Ahead of New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada, Australia has the largest number of housing markets, including both Melbourne and Sydney, that are classified as ‘‘severely or seriously unaffordable,'' the ninth annual survey of its kind reveals.
The survey shows Sydney is the third most expensive major housing market in the world with a median multiple of 8.3 followed by Vancouver in Canada with a multiple of 9.5, and, most expensive, Hong Kong where the multiple is 13.5.
Melbourne is ranked as the seventh most unaffordable major housing market with a multiple of 7.5 after London and San Francisco and San Jose in California.
The Demographia survey ranks the affordability of housing in the US, Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Hong Kong by dividing the median house price with the median household gross annual income before tax.

I am estimating that Bernie Sanders will win both primaries tomorrow, in Kentucky and Oregon. Using my metrics, Oregon seems poised to be a blowout Sanders victory, while Kentucky stands to be a hard-fought battle between both candidates for a win. I have put together an entirely new framework over the past week to account for votes going to other candidates, which is where my West Virginia projection fell most short. It is a more comprehensive model, and should be more accurate. For anyone concerned, my old model is generating very similar estimates for tomorrow. Here they are:
KENTUCKY
The demographics of Kentucky favor Bernie Sanders. It is a white state with only a 7.8% African American population, similar to that of Kansas (5.9%), Wisconsin (6.3%), and Indiana (9.4%), all states that they have previously won. 7.8% is approximately at one standard deviation from the mean Black population percentage (4.2%) of the states that Bernie has won, meaning that it is not too far out of the ballpark for a Sanders victory. Bernie has also done quite well with campaign contributions in Kentucky, with the logged value of the relative number of <$200 contributions being 0.337. This is slightly under the average of states that they have won, 0.366, but far higher than the average of the states that they have lost, -0.07. These reasons are the primary drivers of my estimated Sanders victory.
Bernie's Facebook presence in the state is poor, 73.91%, which is lower than any state they have won at this point. Bernie's relative search interest in Kentucky is poor as well, with the three-day average currently at 0.927. The mean three-day average for all the states that they have won is 2.167, though just last week they won West Virginia at a relative search interest value of 0.94.
Lastly, Kentucky has a closed primary electoral format, which Bernie has never won before. Regardless of who actually wins the Kentucky primary tomorrow, I believe it will be a very close race.
OREGON
Oregon is Bernie's best state with the exception of Vermont when it comes to Facebook data. They have 84.314% of Democrat Facebook Likes, similar to Idaho (84.0%), Maine (84.09%), and Alaska (83.87%) (Vermont was 95.00%). Demographically, Oregon is about as good as it gets for Bernie. The African American population is only 1.8%, similar to Hawaii (1.6%), Utah (1.1%), and Alaska (3.3%). Only in Vermont and Alaska did Bernie outpace Hillary to a greater extent than in Oregon in the relative number of <$200 campaign contributions. These are the primary drivers of the massive margin of victory that I am projecting. It is difficult to reconcile the one and only poll (that showed Hillary with a 15% lead… but also had 19% undecided… and was also conducted well after ballots had already been received and presumably had already been mailed off by many voters) conducted in Oregon with this projection, but I refuse to arbitrarily tack on extra points because I have a hunch about something.
Oregon is entirely voted by mail. Clinton has traditionally dominated early voting, but Oregon's format is unique to all the states that have already voted, so it is difficult to predict how much of an effect this will have. Personally, I doubt it will be significant due to practically every metric being overwhelmingly in Bernie's favor (imagine Vermont was only vote-by-mail, would that have really changed the result?). Also, the party registration deadline was recent, April 26th. Bernie's current relative search interest is quite low, but Oregonians began receiving their ballots two-three weeks ago. If we go back in the Google Trends data to April 26th (around the day voters began receiving ballots), Bernie's relative search interest for the next week and a half was around 1.45; not bad. The average for all the states they have won is 2.167, but the standard deviation is 0.61, so 1.45 is not indicative of anything particularly remarkable.
Lastly, Oregon is also a closed primary, which Bernie Sanders has never won before.
If the above estimates are correct, this should give Hillary Clinton a ~24 delegate deficit tomorrow. Good luck to both candidates, and happy voting to all you Oregonians and Kentuckians!

As Amazon and Walmart continue their battle to become the world's largest retailer, another longtime rival in the e-commerce business, eBay, is now stepping up its game as well. The company this morning announced a new Price Match Guarantee for over 50,000 items across its site – promising that it will have the best deal online, or it will match the lowest price of a competitor.
The move is a significant effort on eBay's part to ensure that it doesn't lose customers to Amazon, Walmart and other online stores as the market consolidates behind the industry's major players.
However, only select items are available for this Price Match Guarantee, eBay says.
In order to qualify, the item must be one of the new, unopened items sold daily through eBay Deals, for starters. Deals are eBay's selection of “trending” inventory across all its categories – like consumer electronics, home & garden, and fashion. The deals are also generally offered at 20 percent to 90 percent off, and are sourced from over 900 of eBay's trusted sellers.
These sellers include both smaller merchants looking to grow their customer base and major consumer brands. At any time, eBay says there are “tens of thousands” of items offered through the Deals site, with featured deals updating at least once per day, beginning at 8 AM PT.
In case you somehow missed how this launch is a response to the looming Amazon threat, eBay's announcement about the new price match feature hits you over the head with the comparison: it makes special note of the fact that there's “no membership required” to access eBay Deals. (Memberships? Hmmm…Now who could that be referring to?)
This isn't eBay's first attempt at challenging Amazon. In March, the company announced it was rolling out 3-day “Guaranteed Delivery” on 20 million items across its site. If the items didn't arrive in time, eBay said it would refund the shipping cost. Or, if items already shipped for free – as 67 percent of eBay's transactions today do – eBay said it would give the buyer a coupon towards their next purchase.
As for the new Price Match Guarantee, there are a few caveats – though nothing too unexpected.
Ebay says it will only match prices on identical items sold online on a competitor's website – and yes, the item must be currently in stock at the time you request the Price Match Guarantee.
The company says it will match the prices of some of the largest online retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, Jet.com (also Walmart), Home Depot, Sears, Target, Best Buy, and Wayfair.
To request a price match, consumers have to dial eBay customer service in advance of their purchase to get a coupon for the difference to be used at checkout. The coupon expires in 24 hours.
“Shoppers can shop with confidence knowing that they're getting the best value available on eBay,” said Hal Lawton, Senior Vice President of North America at eBay, in a statement. “Our eBay Deals selection has grown exponentially since being launched in 2011. The prices are already extremely competitive, but if a shopper finds it for less, we'll gladly match the price of our competitors,” they added.
The move may also help attract new shoppers who have hung onto the notion that eBay is mainly an auction site. While the company continues to support the format, of course, it's now fixed price items that account for the majority (87%) of its gross merchandise volume. In addition, 80 percent of all the merchandise sold on eBay is new, with two-thirds delivered within three days, the company notes.
The Price Match Guarantee is only available in the U.S., and is live as of today.
ISIS militants have executed both of the Russian citizens they recently captured in Syria, according to State Duma deputy Viktor Vodolatssky, who says Roman Zabolotnyi and Grigory Tsurkanu were killed for refusing to ”recant their Orthodox faith, renounce their country, convert to Islam, and join ISIS.”
“There were faithful to Orthodoxy and the Motherland to the very end, and they were killed for it by these bandits,” Vodolatssky said.
It remains unclear how Vodolatssky knows Zabolotnyi and Tsurkanu were executed, but they say he's “99 percent sure” that Zabolotnyi has been killed.
Open-source investigators believe Zabolotnyi traveled to Syria to fight in the “Wagner group,” a private military contractor staffed by mercenaries from Russia and Ukraine. The organization has possible financial ties to the Kremlin-connected entrepreneur Evgeny Prigozhin, and its commanders have received awards from the Russian government.
After photos emerged showing Zabolotnyi in captivity, Internet sleuths identified them as a member of a Cossack movement, discovering photos on their Vkontakte page showing them wearing a Cossack uniform. On April 8, 2017, a Cossack group tried to blockade the Navalny campaign's office in Rostov-on-Don. Zabolotnyi also appears in several other photographs taken during the office's grand opening.
In late August, Meduza interviewed the journalist who blew the lid on Wagner, publishing the company's private recruiting records.

The Medal of Honor Heritage Center proposed for Coolidge Park could change in both size and location.
On Friday, retired Maj. Gen. Bill Raines, Heritage Center chairperson, said all options are open.
"This project is bigger than what we first thought," they said. "We've looked at a lot of alternatives in consideration of quality of exhibits and attendance."
Raines and other Medal of Honor Heritage Center proponents previously declared the park as the facility's ideal location. Coolidge Park, located on the north shore of the Tennessee River, was established in 1999 in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Charles Coolidge.
The project initially called for a 6,800-square-foot, two-story building to honor Coolidge and other Medal of Honor recipients, according to the center's website. The facility's footprint measures 4,000 square feet. Of the park's 10.3 acres, the facility would occupy one-tenth of an acre. Raines confirmed a larger facility is now under consideration.
Opponents have voiced concerns that a building at Coolidge Park will inhibit usage of the park's green space and questioned whether its white domes and columns clash with existing nearby architecture.
On Aug. 30, an ad hoc panel of business executives, community leaders and veterans, co-chaired by Chattanooga City Councilman Jerry Mitchell and Raines, announced it would make final recommendations to Mayor Andy Berke and the City Council after the conclusion of a 60-day study.
"The ad hoc committee is reviewing options on locations, design and business plans," Mitchell said Thursday in an email. "We are making progress, but aren't ready to announce anything yet."
Neither Mitchell nor Raines identified any potential alternative sites for the heritage center.
"We have a bigger story, a bigger mission, a bigger opportunity," Raines said, also citing the need to build consensus within the whole Chattanooga community.
Medal of Honor Heritage Center organizers initially asked the city to lease 1 acre of Coolidge Park space near the Tremont Street cul-de-sac for $1 per year for 99 years, but the request hit a snag during a City Council vote in late June. Instead of authorizing the mayor to negotiate and execute the lease, the council instead stipulated it must give final approval of any deal.
At the time, Mitchell, who represents the district where the park is located, said they had received "a lot of communications from folks in this district and around the city who feel more public input is needed before making that decision."
"I tend to agree with that, although I love the idea of honoring Mr. Coolidge," they said.
In early August, 200 people, including veterans, attended a public forum on the proposed center.
"[The center] will be an enhancement to what the focus [of the park] was intended to be," Raines said at the event.
The Medal of Honor Heritage Center business plan includes a $2 million endowment to ensure its sustainability and now does not call for "approaching local government about contributing to the capital campaign," according to the organization's website.

In The New Christmas Canon, The A.V. Club looks beyond Rudolph's nose and Zuzu's petals to highlight entertainment from the '90s, '00s, and '10s that's become a seasonal staple—or deserves to.
Amidst the bright lights, the crackling fires, and the good cheer, the Christmas season has always retained a melancholic edge. This emotional undercurrent is most likely the result of myriad reasons—the oppressive weight of seasonal jubilee, the extended time spent with family, the unavoidable crass commercialism—but one stands out more than the most: The constant reminder of one's own mortality. It's easier to ignore the inevitable facts of aging and death in the spring and summer months when the sun shines brightest. During the longest, coldest nights of December, the harsh truths of life creep out from underneath the darkest places within us. Christmas is a notoriously existential holiday because the inescapable downtime often forces a quiet contemplation about life—the mistakes, the failures, and the regrets. Is it any wonder that so many holiday classics, from A Christmas Carol to A Charlie Brown Christmas, have such a heavy-hearted tone?

Martin McDonagh's debut feature In Bruges only mentions the word “Christmas” a couple of times, but the existential weight of the season hangs so strongly over the film that it's unnecessary to underline it any further. The story of two hitmen (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) camped out in Bruges, Belgium, after a murder gone wrong functions as a Christmas film precisely because it deeply inhabits the season's pensive nature. For its first half, In Bruges more or less operates as a vulgar comedy, much of it featuring Ray and Ken sightseeing around Bruges, like the stars of a crude The Odd Couple Goes To Belgium. It even has a religious bent to it, as the characters struggle with how the realities of their profession brush up against their ingrained Catholic morality. But more than that, In Bruges, like the Christmas holiday, adopts a light veneer mainly as a smokescreen for something much darker—in this case, heady discussions about the guilt and consequences of breaking ironclad moral principles, specifically Ray's accidental murder of a child. In effect, In Bruges is a moral parable gussied up to look like a Euro vacation film.
Like many Christmas films, In Bruges doesn't hide its existential core. Unlike many Christmas films, it does foreground said existentialism's literary influences. An accomplished playwright, McDonagh follows in the tradition of classic two-handers like Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter and Samuel Beckett's Waiting For Godot. Like Ben and Gus or Vladimir and Estragon before them, Ray and Ken wait for vague instructions from their handler Harry (Ralph Fiennes) in an unfamiliar location that becomes more unsettling over time. They have circular debates about whether Harry will call their hotel. They argue about the merits and flaws of their hideout. They sightsee various churches, ride canal boats, and visit museums in an effort to distract themselves from their moral quandary. But neither of them can ignore Ray's grave mistake for very long, and McDonagh, unlike Pinter or Beckett, eventually forces their protagonists to reckon with their sins instead of letting them stew in the dread of their paused existence.
Moreover, McDonagh uses the setting of Bruges as a malleable stage upon which the film's protagonist can exercise and project their respective guilt. They initially film In Bruges like a travelogue, showcasing the Belgium city's medieval architecture and religious history without clumsily foregrounding it. By having Ray and Ken simply traverse the city on foot, McDonagh captures Bruges' picturesque beauty while keeping it mainly in the background. (In their review, Roger Ebert mentions that if In Bruges accomplished nothing else, it inspired in them “an urgent desire to visit Bruges.”) But then McDonagh and Danish cinematographer Eigil Bryld subtly morph the quaint backdrop into a dark Boschian nightmare filled with surreal characters and violent exchanges. It becomes less of an old-fashioned getaway and more of a wintry nightmare that traps its subjects and holds them hostage. Throughout the film, Ken finds Bruges charming and delightful, while Ray constantly calls it a “shithole.” McDonagh illustrates that both descriptions are apt: It's a “fucking fairy tale” gone awry.

Yet it's the actual substance of In Bruges' moral dilemmas that keeps it in line with the melancholic Christmas spirit. Ray, Ken, and Harry spend much of the film openly discussing the worth of a person's life in light of the sins they've committed. Suicidal and despondent, Ray believes in no uncertain terms that they deserve to die for accidentally killing a child, and Harry agrees, demanding that Ken kill Ray for their transgression. On the other hand, Ken argues that the true power of moral strength is forgiveness, and to live with and learn from the mistakes you've made. They understand that a lifetime spent atoning for a sin is more fruitful than killing yourself to end the suffering. It's telling that while In Bruges grounds these discussions in concrete life-or-death terms, they still mainly focus on the characters' moral fiber. It accounts for the film's elegiac tone, powerfully emphasized by Carter Burwell's mournful piano score, as if the fates of its subjects have already been sealed, and all that's left to save are their souls.
But McDonagh finds a way to ultimately spin this moral quandary as a story of hope, just like the best Christmas stories. In Bruges actively argues that no one's soul is beyond saving. Despite the funny lines, McDonagh never lets you forget that their subjects are violent men and that the conscious choices they've made have damned them in this life. But they also demonstrate that it's the gestures of goodness and the sacrifices one makes that can save them in the next. Ken throws themselves off Bruges' belfry so that Ray can have a second chance at life. A pregnant hotel operator (Thekla Reuten) refuses to let Harry walk through their hotel to kill Ray, not knowing that the person she's protecting has already killed one child. After seeing these brave acts, Ray chooses life not long after wanting to throw it away.
The Christmas film canon is filled with movies that couch existential questions within a narrative of redemption, but In Bruges foregrounds its existentialism within a narrative of absolution. McDonagh knows that there's no redemption for their characters, and that the best they're going to get is a trip to Bruges, a scenic purgatory in which to contemplate their lives. But In Bruges also serves as a reminder that you can crawl out from underneath the weight of the Christmas season and emerge anew, that the near-constant reminder of the passage of time can inspire you to live in the moment. If at its best Christmas is about finding the light amidst all the darkness, then In Bruges celebrates the epiphanic understanding one reaches when they discover there's still hope through all the suffering, even if it comes just a little too late.
Exit Planet Dust
The Latest — By jjdlg on May 29, 2014 at 11:17 am
So there is some dust around here, links to pages published years ago dripping with the wide-eyed wonderment of an optimistic younger version of myself at the wheel. For a moment I considered deleting them, there is some really sketchy shit contained on those pages, but then I saw them for what they were. Those misguided posts, and ideas that misfired are all part of the process that is uniquely mine. They are the misshapen children of an idea that I cannot and will not give up on.
So what if the kids are ugly, they're mine.
All of which leads me here. Chapter Five of The Sins of The Family is ready to be released, but the word limit per post on Reddit simply would not allow me to publish it as I needed it to be. Much is shared between Alaric and their uncle in Chapter Five, and it forced me to look for an alternate avenue to share the story. I would not chop the story any further to comply with the limits on Reddit. So I've raised the Titanic so to speak and decided to hotlink my page from Reddit when I publish. Now free from the word limit, and with the ability to stitch all the previous chapters together OR keep them serialized, I am in complete control.
I just wanted to explain what was happening with the change of venue for those tenacious souls who stick with this little story week after week. This is the only blog post I will share on Reddit.
REPEAT…THIS IS THE ONLY BLOG POST I WILL EVER POST ON REDDIT!
I will however continue to link DIRECTLY to the chapters as they are released so that those interested may continue their journey along side the members of the Cantu family unfettered by word counts.
What will I think of this latest attempt to get my words out there in the next few years, only time will tell. I will, however, not have to look back after those years and wonder what would have happened had I tried just a bit harder.
THIS will take you back to the home page if you'd like to take a look around

An explosion has ripped through a market in the north-western Pakistani city of Peshawar, leaving at least 33 dead and dozens wounded, officials say.
Police said a bomb had exploded in the Kissa Khwani market, with shops and vehicles set alight.
The blast comes a week after a double suicide bombing that killed at least 80 people at a church in the city.
On Friday, at least 17 people were killed in the bombing of a bus carrying government employees near Peshawar.
Peshawar, the main city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has been hit by numerous bomb and gun attacks blamed on Taliban insurgents in recent years.
Hospital emergency
Police said they suspected the explosion was caused by a car bomb.
Pakistan's Dawn newspaper quoted the health minister as saying that the main Peshawar police station may have been the main target.
However, bomb disposal chief Shafqat Malik said it appeared the blast had taken place some way from the station.
They told Agence France-Presse that a parked car had been "converted into a remote controlled bomb".
One shop owner, Nazar Ali, told Associated Press: "It was a huge blast that was followed by fire in vehicles. Thick black smoke covered the air and splinters spread all over. I saw people lying dead and bleeding."
An emergency situation was declared at the Lady Reading Hospital as it received the injured, many of them badly burned. Officials said 76 people had been hurt.
Anxious relatives gathered outside the hospital for news.
Rising violence has hindered new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's overtures to end the insurgency through peace talks with the Taliban.
On 21 September, Pakistan released from the jail the co-founder of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
But the Pakistan Taliban have consistently rejected the country's constitution and demand the imposition of Sharia law.
Image caption Scores were hurt in addition to those killed in the blast
Image caption A remote-controlled car bomb was used, officials said
Image caption This was the third deadly attack in Peshawar in a week
Image caption PM Nawaz Sharif said the bombing was an attack on humanity
Mr Sharif is in New York at the UN and is to meet Indian PM Manmohan Singh later on Sunday.
Mr Sharif strongly condemned the Peshawar bombing in a message from New York, saying: "Those involved in the killing of innocent people are devoid of humanity and all religions."
Ahead of the talks, Mr Singh said Pakistan must stop being "the epicentre of terrorism".
Last Sunday's attack on the historic All Saints church - thought to be the deadliest attack against Christians in Pakistan - sparked angry protests nationwide.
Two Islamist militant groups with Taliban links said they had ordered the attack to hit back at US drone strikes.
More than 120 people were wounded.
Friday's bus bomb targeted government employees returning home in the Gulbela area, some 15km (9 miles) north-east of the city.
In addition to those killed, at least 34 people were injured.
The Asklepieia Megala was only held at Epidaurus; all other asklepieia--as well as at Epidausus the other three years--held only a small ceremony for the Theos. The festival did not include athletic games outside of the Asklepieia Megala, but there might have been a focus on singing, and there might have been large banquets, held after sacrifices were made to the Theos.
You can find the ritual here , and we really hope you will join us on the Elaion Facebook page for this one, too!
On the eighth day of Elaphebolion, the Asklepieia (Ἀσκληπίεια) was held in honor of Asklēpiós, who was honored monthly on the eighth. The Asklepieia is linked to the Epidausia, celebrated six months later, as both were special days where those in the medical profession--as well as those seeking medical counsel--made sacrifices to Asklēpiós. Will you join us on the 7th of March, at 10 am EST?In 242 BC, during the Mercenary War, the sanctuary at Epidaurus was granted immunity from war, and the Asklepieia Megala was established as a festival of athletic and musical competitions, held every four years, for a nine day period. Theater performances were also a huge part of the festival, and the famous theater of Epidaurus still stands today, one of the seven wonders of ancient Hellas.The first of the festival days was spent preparing for the actual festival. The second day, religious exercises were undertaken. All temples and shrines were richly decorated and sacrifices were made to Apollon, Asklēpiós, Artemis, and Leto. Perhaps and the children of Asklēpiós--Hygieia (health, cleanliness, and sanitation), Iaso (recuperation from illness), Aceso (the healing process), Aglaea (beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment), and Panakea (universal remedy)--also received sacrifice. Apollon received the first offering along with Asklēpiós: a cock, the fowl associated with Asklēpiós. They also received barley meal, wheat, and wine. Asklēpiós was then gifted a bull, a second bull was sacrificed to Their male associates, and a cow to Their female associates.On the eve of the third day, a statue of Asklēpiós was driven through the precinct, and followed by torch-bearers and priests, who sung hymns to Him. The priests sang and spoke the praise of the Theos. There were vigils throughout the night, and during the daylight hours of the third day, there were feasts. The succeeding days were given up to athletic contests in the stadium, races, wrestling contests, singing contests and theater performances.
In this illustration, a jet is produced by an unusually bright gamma-ray burst. Scientists think next-generation laser facilities will be able to recreate the fundamental physics at the heart of these gamma-ray explosions.
A gamma-ray burst, the most powerful kind of explosion known in the universe, may have triggered a mass extinction on Earth within the past billion years, researchers say.
These deadly outbursts could help explain the so-called Fermi paradox, the seeming contradiction between the high chance of alien life and the lack of evidence for it, scientists added.
Gamma-ray bursts are brief, intense explosions of high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. These outbursts give off as much energy as the sun during its entire 10-billion-year lifetime in anywhere from milliseconds to minutes. Scientists think gamma-ray bursts may be caused by giant exploding stars known as hypernovas, or by collisions between pairs of dead stars known as neutron stars. [Top 10 Greatest Explosions Ever]
If a gamma-ray burst exploded within the Milky Way, it could wreak extraordinary havoc if it were pointed directly at Earth, even from thousands of light-years away. Although gamma rays would not penetrate Earth's atmosphere well enough to burn the ground, they would chemically damage the atmosphere, depleting the ozone layer that protects the planet from damaging ultraviolet rays that could trigger mass extinctions. It's also possible that gamma-ray bursts may spew out cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles that may create an experience similar to a nuclear explosion for those on the side of the Earth facing the explosion, causing radiation sickness.
To see how great a threat gamma-ray bursts might pose to Earth, researchers investigated how likely it was that such an explosion could have inflicted damage on the planet in the past.
Gamma-ray bursts are traditionally divided into two groups — long and short — depending on whether they last more or less than 2 seconds. Long gamma-ray bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars, while short gamma-ray bursts are most likely caused by the mergers of neutron stars.
For the most part, long gamma-ray bursts happen in galaxies very different from the Milky Way — dwarf galaxies low in any element heavier than hydrogen and helium. Any long gamma-ray bursts in the Milky Way will likely be confined in regions of the galaxy that are similarly low in any element heavier than hydrogen and helium, the researchers said.
The scientists discovered the chance that a long gamma-ray burst could trigger mass extinctions on Earth was 50 percent in the past 500 million years, 60 percent in the past 1 billion years, and more than 90 percent in the past 5 billion years. For comparison, the solar system is about 4.6 billion years old.
Short gamma-ray bursts happen about five times more often than long ones. However, since these shorter bursts are weaker, the researchers found they had negligible life-threatening effects on Earth. They also calculated that gamma-ray bursts from galaxies outside the Milky Way probably pose no threat to Earth.
These findings suggest that a nearby gamma-ray burst may have caused one of the five greatest mass extinctions on Earth, such as the Ordovician extinction that occurred 440 million years ago. The Ordovician extinction was the earliest of the so-called Big Five extinction events, and is thought by many to be the second largest. [Wipe Out: History's Most Mysterious Extinctions]
The scientists also investigated the danger that gamma-ray bursts may pose for life elsewhere in the Milky Way. Stars are packed more densely together toward the center of the galaxy, meaning worlds there face a greater danger of gamma-ray bursts. Worlds in the region about 6,500 light-years around the Milky Way's core, where 25 percent of the galaxy's stars reside, faced more than a 95 percent chance of a lethal gamma-ray burst within the past billion years. The researchers suggest that life as it is known on Earth could survive with certainty only in the outskirts of the Milky Way, more than 32,600 light-years from the galactic core.
The researchers also explored the danger gamma-ray bursts could pose for the universe as a whole. They suggest that because of gamma-ray bursts, life as it is known on Earth might safely develop in only 10 percent of galaxies. They also suggest that such life could only have developed in the past 5 billion years. Before then, galaxies were smaller in size, and gamma-ray bursts were therefore always close enough to cause mass extinctions to any potentially life-harboring planets.
"This may be an explanation, or at least a partial one, to what is called the Fermi paradox or the 'Big Silence,'" said lead study author Tsvi Piran, a physicist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. "Why we haven't encountered advanced civilizations so far? The Milky Way galaxy is much older than the solar system and there was ample time and ample space — the number of planetary systems with conditions similar to Earth is huge — for life to develop elsewhere in the galaxy. So why we haven't encountered advanced civilizations so far?"
The answer to Fermi's paradox may be that gamma-ray bursts have struck many life-harboring planets. The most severe criticism of these estimates "is that we address life as we know it on Earth," Piran told Live Science. "One can imagine very different forms of life that are resilient to the relevant radiation."
Piran and their colleague, Raul Jimenez, detailed their findings online today (Dec. 5) in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Contributing to Meteor Documentation
Tom Coleman Blocked Unblock Follow May 18, 2016
If you've been developing in Meteor, you may have noticed we recently launched a brand-new, shiny design for our documentation and guide sites.
Apart from being easy on the eyes (and infinitely more discoverable by Google search) the new docs site was created with the principal aim of being easier to contribute to. You'll notice a prominent “edit on GitHub” link on each page, which you can use to send fixes to documentation content or suggest improvements.
Documenting in the Open
Meteor has had a long history of enabling and welcoming documentation from community contributors. I myself co-wrote the book Discover Meteor before I had even joined the Meteor team. Meteor's first tutorial was also open-sourced on GitHub and welcomed pull requests for anyone who found bugs or typos.
We carried this tradition over into our development of the Meteor Guide. In my Meteor Night talk last month, I spoke about the incredible success we've had creating the Guide in the open with the full collaboration of the community, and how we've seen some amazing community contributors step up as a result .
New Roles for Docs Contributors
To recognize those efforts, we've created a new way for the most dedicated docs contributors to get involved. One contributor in particular, Loren Sands-Ramshaw has volunteered to become a maintainer of our documentation — this title is both to highlight the great contributions they were making before and to enable them to increase their involvement in the process of crafting our guide and other documentation.
We'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Loren and encourage more folks to make larger contributions. With that in mind, we've published an initial set of community guidelines for Meteor documentation contributions. If you're interested to find out what it takes to become a documentation maintainer, we encourage you to read the document, and let us know if you have suggestions for how we can improve our process.
We really hope we can build on the powerful community momentum we have behind the Guide and extend it to more and more parts of the Meteor framework to make it the best possible platform for the community.

25 Ways to Become the Best Version of Yourself
Is it possible to be happy with yourself right now and still want to change your life?
Can you be content and evolving at the same time?
I believe you can.
In fact, I think this is a powerful balance we should strive for every day — the balance between happiness in the moment and action toward the best version of ourselves.
Leo Babauta of Zen Habits recently wrote a beautiful post on contentedness. They suggest that you don't need to wait for change, for something better, for the future, before you are content. You can be content right now if you choose to see all of the good and beauty around you.
I know this is true. I know we experience life right now, in this moment. This moment is our only reality. If right now is spent longing for some vision of the future, we haven't truly lived and enjoyed the blessings of right now.
Longing and struggling against “what is” causes suffering. Wishing for more, for something different, for something better at the expense of contentment in the moment robs us of life.
However, as someone who is a seeker and has spent most of my life intrigued by personal development, I have a vision of the best version of myself. I know that inner and outer change, evolution, and transformation will happen to me whether or not I define how that will happen.
But I know that I can define how that will happen. I have that personal power, and I'd much rather be the creator of my life rather than a reactor to it.
So how does one be a creator and be content at the same time? How do you become the best version of yourself while loving yourself just as you are?
Here are some of the concepts I've embraced to help me find that critical balance between contentment with now and a vision to be the best version of yourself.
1. Awareness
With the awareness that both are possible, you reduce the tension between knowing that you should be content right now and the inner urging for something more. There is a way to find a balance for your on-going contentment and happiness.
2. Process
Begin to view the process of personal evolution as place for happiness and contentment. Rather than holding back happiness while you await an outcome, enjoy the process. Every step along the path, every stage of life, every small action should be savored and celebrated. Life is process. Reaching outcomes is a fleeting moment.
3. Shift
During the process, you will experience tedious, boring, or even painful moments. Rather than resisting or struggling against these times, breathe into them. Shift your thinking so that you become aware of even the smallest value these moments add to your experience of life.
4. Failure
Failure is part of process. And even though failure stings, the venom it injects actually serves our growth. Failure means you are engaged in life because you've taken a risk toward your vision.
5. Values
If you haven't defined the best version of yourself, begin with values. What are the most important values in your life and work? What values will define the person you are now and want to be in the future. Get very clear on those.
6. Vision
Give yourself the gift of time and emotional space to create a vision for your life for the next few years. Use your most important values as a framework for this vision. Look at every aspect of your life and define how you want it to look. Write it down. And remember to enjoy the process of creating a vision. It is creative, life-affirming work.
7. Plan
When you have a vision for yourself, you need a plan for materializing this vision. You need action steps. Prioritize your vision and create a strategy for action. Break it down into small steps that are manageable.
8. Ritual
A ritual is an action imbued with purpose and meaning. Each action step along the way to your vision is a microcosm of the outcome. Rather than viewing each step as a boring task, turn it into a ritual — something beautiful that is a crystalline drop of your beautiful vision.
9. Relationships
Relationships are the most important part of our lives. Nothing matters more. Define the best version of yourself in your relationships. Who do you know yourself to be inside? How does this person want to interact with loved ones and others in your life? Find the beauty in letting this person emerge as you release anger, jealousies, frustrations, blame, and hurt. Enjoy the process of releasing the old you to welcome the real you.
10. Priorities
Our time is limited. We can't have everything, be everything, do everything. If we stuff our lives with too much, we are scattered and unfocused. Life is abundant, and it tempts us with so many options. Choose what is most important right now and gently release all else for another time or for good.
11. Focus
Whatever you are doing, focus on it. Savor it. Roll around in it. Love it. Even if it's pain. There is beauty even in pain. Don't struggle against or wish for something more. If you are doing it now, it is the most important thing in the world.
12. Simplicity
When you are focused, many other things in your life fall away naturally. Things you don't really need. Begin to sweep some of these things out the door. Simplify your life, your thoughts, your relationships. Give yourself the space and energy to focus and love the moment.
13. Experiences
Experiences almost always trump money and possessions in long-term life satisfaction. Experiences stay in your memory and create residual happy feelings. Put your efforts and income more on experiences than on things.
14. Recess
Give yourself a mental and physical recess, a time for play and creative introspection. Remove yourself from stresses and demands to clear your mind for new ideas, inspiration, and recharging. Being in nature supports this process.
15. Intuition
Regardless of how analytical or brainy you may be, pay attention to intuition. Intuition arises from an accumulation of all of our memories and experiences. It has something important to say to us, so listen up.
16. Stretch
Stretch yourself. Go a step or two farther than you think you can. Push yourself a bit into the discomfort zone. Do this regularly, and you'll be amazed at your capacity for greatness. Breath into the stretch and enjoy it.
17. Forgive
Forgive yourself. Forgive others. Whatever it is, put it in a red balloon and release it. Ah, freedom.
18. Heal
Where you are wounded, where you are hurt, where you are frightened — seek healing. Restore yourself. Get well again. Do what must be done to heal. You can't be the best version of yourself when you are emotionally, mentally, or physically unwell.
19. Move
Your body houses the best version of yourself. Your body is beautiful and miraculous. Support your body as it serves you by staying fit and healthy.
20. Nourish
Give your body the proper fuel to feel your best so you can enjoy every moment to the fullest.
21. Gratitude
Spend a few minutes in gratitude every day. Remind yourself of even the smallest blessings in your life. Allow the emotions that accompany everything you are grateful for to rise to the surface. This will heighten your sense of gratitude and happiness.
22. Serve
Happiness is associated with service. Whether you are simply listening to a friend, giving a hand to a neighbor, or volunteering, serving others provides fulfillment that no other activity can afford. It doesn't matter how you do it, just find a way to do it.
23. Learn
Have a beginner's mindset in all things. Accept that even if you are an expert, there is always more to learn. You can learn from the humblest among us. You can learn new ways of thinking. You can learn to appreciate many points of view. Stay open to all possibilities with eager expectation.
24. Seek
Once you know the best version of yourself, seek new paths for evolving into that person. Open your mind and heart to wise people and mentors. Face the truth about yourself or others. Be relentless in your personal evolution, but relish and celebrate each new level of growth.
25. Refine
Regularly hit the refresh button on your definition of your best self. As we evolve, change, and grow as individuals, even our vision of our best self shifts and evolves along with us. Be content with being the best self you can be in each moment — because you will always be in the process of becoming. Make each moment your destination.
What is your best version of yourself, and how are you working to become that person? Please share your thoughts in the comments.
WASHINGTON — Advocates of a saner approach to guns need a new strategy. We cannot go on like this, wringing our hands in frustration after every tragedy involving firearms. We said “Enough” after Sandy Hook. We thought the moment for action had come. Yet nothing happened. We are saying “Enough” after Charleston. But this time, we don't even expect anything to happen.
What's needed is a long-term national effort to change popular attitudes toward handgun ownership. And we need to insist on protecting the rights of Americans who do not want to be anywhere near guns.
None of this should mean letting Congress off the hook or giving up on what might be done now. So kudos to Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., for saying on Tuesday that they are trying to bring back their proposal that would require background checks for gun sales. In 2013, it failed to get the needed 60 votes and won support from only three Republicans besides Toomey.
Lest anyone doubt that gun-control measures can work, a study released earlier this month by the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University found that a 1995 Connecticut law requiring a permit or license contingent on passing a background check was associated with a 40 percent drop in gun homicides.
But as long as gun control is a cause linked to ideology and party — and as long as the National Rifle Association and its allies claim a monopoly on individual rights arguments — reasonable steps of this sort will be ground to death by the Washington Obstruction Machine.
That's why the nation needs a public-service offensive on behalf of the health and safety of us all. It could build on the Sandy Hook Promise and other civic endeavors. If you doubt it could succeed, consider how quickly opinion changed on the Confederate flag.
My friend Guy Molyneux, a progressive pollster, laid out how it could happen. “We need to build a social movement devoted to the simple proposition that owning handguns makes us less safe, not more,” they told me. “The evidence is overwhelming that having a gun in your home increases the risks of suicide, domestic violence and fatal accidents, and yet the No. 1 reason given for gun purchases is ‘personal safety.' We need a public health campaign on the dangers of gun ownership, similar to the successful efforts against smoking and drunk driving.”
The facts are compelling. The 2015 Annual Review of Public Health reported that nearly two-thirds of the deaths from firearms violence are suicides. Yes, people can try to kill themselves with pills, but there's no coming back from a gunshot to the head. Those in the throes of depression who have a gun nearby are more likely to act on their impulses.
Nor do we talk enough about accidental deaths when children get their hands on guns, or what happens when a domestic argument escalates and a firearm is readily available. The message is plain and simple: Households that voluntarily say no to guns are safer.
“The best way to disarm the NRA rhetorically is to make the Second Amendment issue moot,” Molyneux said. “This is not about the government saying you cannot own a handgun. This is about society saying you should not have a gun, especially in a home with children.”
Molyneux says their approach “does not imply giving up on gun control legislation.” On the contrary, the best path to better laws is to foster a revolution in popular attitudes. And this approach would finally put the rights of non-gun owners at the center of the discussion.
“Those of us who want to live, shop, go to school and worship in gun-free spaces also have rights,” Molyneux said. “In what way is ‘freedom' advanced by telling the owner of a bar or restaurant they cannot ban handguns in their own place of business, as many states now do? Today, it is the NRA that is the enemy of freedom, by seeking to impose its values on everyone else.”
The nation could ring out with the new slogans of liberty: “Not in my house.” “Not in our school.” “Not in my bar.” “Not in our church.” We'd be defending one of our most sacred rights: The right not to bear arms.
E.J. Dionne Jr. is a Washington Post columnist.
My friend Peter posted a link on Facebook today out of Philadelphia. Last night at the Phillies game, a kid ran out on to the field between innings. The local law enforcement on the scene apprehended them using a taser.
A police officer used a Taser gun to apprehend a fan who ran onto the field during a Phillies game Monday night, and the team and the police are investigating whether it was an appropriate use of force. (photo credits: Matt Slocum, AP)
What the hell is there to “investigate”? Lazy cop uses a ‘substitute for lethal force' to apprehend a prankster. They ought to lose their job, their pension, and be tarred and feathered in some public square.
Tasers used to be marketed as a non-lethal alternative to using lethal force in order to subdue a criminal suspect. Besides the obvious evidence (a trail of dead bodies, actually) which suggests tasers can be quite lethal under certain circumstances,
This story, Peter says, “Shows that when police are given the choice, a taser seems to be the first option because they don't want to run. ‘Subdue' implies the suspect is being violent, etc. One can hardly expect a 17-year old to not run, especially since they were ‘running' on to the baseball field between innings…”
Precisely! That's why I have a problem with tasers. They encourage sloppiness, viz., no cop anywhere would've drawn a firearm on the kid — much less fired a fucking bullet at them from behind. So, if lethal force was not an acceptable reaction to this scenario, then the prescribed ‘alternative' to lethal force ought to be out of the question.
With the evidence of its lethality, and the fact that the taser seems to be the go-to weapon of choice for law enforcement officers (this incident and others like it are pretty clear and convincing evidence that tasers aren't being used as substitute for lethal force), taser introduces a level of moral hazard that otherwise wouldn't exist.
Fortunately, this kid lived. Others haven't been so lucky.
Reporters Without Borders condemns “with the utmost firmness” a new defamation law in Ireland that establishes blasphemy as an offence punishable by a fine of up to 25,000 euros. The law took effect on 1 January.
Article 36 defines blasphemy as publishing or uttering “matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion.” It adds that judges could regard “genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value” as a defence.
“Originally envisaged as a way to bring Ireland's press legislation up to date, this already highly questionable law is much more than just an adjustment,” Reporters Without Borders said. “Its definition of blasphemy leaves a lot of room for arbitrary interpretation. Who will decide or rule on the ‘sacred' nature of a belief that is generally only determined by those who share it? How many adherents are needed to be counted as ‘substantial'? Who is going to be responsible for this strange calculation?
“The very concept of blasphemy concerns only believers and cannot be applied to those who regard themselves as atheists or non-believers. Blasphemy law must under no circumstances be allowed to limit free expression.
“It is very dangerous to leave to the evaluation of such a concept to judges. The maximum possible fine is also totally disproportionate. It is perfectly legitimate and acceptable to criticise religions and even to deny their validity. This is an opinion and, as such, should not be subject to any judicial sanction. As it stands, this law offers legal grounds to religious extremists of all kinds, it allows them to use the force of the law to impose their views. Ireland has just taken the European Union back several centuries and has clearly not weighed the future consequences.
“We urge the European Council to take up this issue and to ask Ireland to repeal the article defining blasphemy as an offence. While all of Europe's citizens must clearly be able to practice their religion freely and without being threatened, it is just as important that those who make a different choice should be able to enjoy the same guarantees without being exposed to any possible sanction.
“At time when many governments are trying to use the United Nations to establish a similar law at the international level, the European Union must adopt a clear position, in accordance with its founding principles and with articles 10 and 11 of its Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the months to come, we will pursue initiatives with this goal in mind.”

Plans to force internet service providers (ISPs) to disconnect suspected illegal downloaders have been roundly rejected in a new YouGov poll, the first time public opinion has been tested on the issue.
Nearly 70% of those surveyed said someone suspected of illegal downloading should have a right to a trial in court before restrictions on internet use were imposed. Only 16% were in favour of automatic curbs based on accusations by copyright holders such as musicians, as is proposed by the business department.
ISPs such as TalkTalk and T-Mobile complain that the government's proposals expect them to bear the costs of protecting a third party's rights. They warn that the move will not work because illegal filesharers can avoid detection by encrypting the traffic, or by hijacking someone else's IP address or using their Wi-Fi network.
Ministers have insisted that disconnection is a last option and something on which they are consulting. They are, however, facing a growing backlash, with an all-party motion urging a rethink of the policy on disconnection being led by Tom Watson, the former cabinet office minister responsible for digital inclusion.
Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, the organisation that commissioned the YouGov poll, called the government's plans extremist.
"This poll shows people rely on the internet, and an overwhelming majority think that access should only ever be withdrawn as the result of court action.
"Nearly a third would be much less likely to vote for a party that supports disconnection proposals.
"Clearly Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, is out of step with public opinion and should think again."
The poll also found that among younger voters, the threat of internet disconnection for online copyright infringement might be a vote-changing issue.
Meanwhile the Conservative shadow culture secretary told the Financial Times a Tory government would scrap the proposed 50p a month tax on all telephone lines, aimed at raising £150m to £175m a year to support rural broadband projects. Jeremy Hunt said it would be scrapped a "soon as possible" after the general election expected in May. They said the party was also considering reversing government plans to force the BBC to share £130m of the television licence fee with other broadcasters.
The poll found a third of UK citizens (31 %) would be much less likely to vote for a party that supported internet disconnection for infringements.
A further 13% would be a "little less likely" to vote for that party: in total, 44% would be less likely to vote for a party that supported such a policy.
Nearly three quarters (73%) said if they were disconnected, they would find their ability to use vital commercial services, such as shopping and banking, completely disrupted or fairly harmed.
When asked to choose, respondents also supported the right to a trial before punishments are imposed.
A total of 68% of respondents said that, if the Government's proposals go ahead, a court should consider the evidence before restrictions were imposed, while only 16% were in favour of automatic procedures based on accusations, as is currently proposed.
An inquiry into the issue by the all-party parliamentary communications group concluded last week that "much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders, and the music industry in particular, being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available".
It added: "We do not believe that disconnecting end users is in the slightest bit consistent with policies that attempt to promote eGovernment, and we recommend that this approach to dealing with illegal filesharing should not be further considered."
The commons motion tabled by Watson and others calls for users to be given the right to go to court before seeing their access to the internet is ended.
Sion Simon, the minister for the internet, insists the government will not allow arbitrary disconnection.
In an article in the Birmingham Post they explained: "As a first step, where rightsholders identify unlawful activity, ISPs will be obliged to notify accountholders that their account appears to have been used to infringe copyright.
"The infringer (who may, for instance, be a child) is very often not the accountholder (perhaps a parent), who will often be quite unaware of what is happening. For many people, a letter will be all it needs to put an instant stop to the offences.
"ISPs would also be obliged to keep anonymised records of the number of times individual subscribers are identified breaking the law.
"On production of a court order, that data could be used in targeted court action by rightsholders against those responsible for the most damaging breaches of copyright."
They have stressed that only as a last resort government could require "Ofcom to demand that ISPs take technical measures against those people who repeatedly ignore the law. That could mean capping the broadband speed or filesize someone can access".
So promises the EU-funded anti-corruption mobile game 'Tales of Neto'. Coming soon to Armenia (and the world beyond), the game is already up for a NICE Award, the European innovation prize for the creative industries. It demonstrates the effects of corruption ("Look around the island and you will see the effects of a disaster many years ago…"), encourages social engagement ("Talk to your fellow citizens, learn from them, and figure out how to get Planet Neto out of this mess together…") and activism ("Solve quests and watch the planet improve around you…").
The project is one of 10 shortlisted by an international jury of experts for a NICE Award, out of 110 submissions from 23 countries. The innovation award, which comes with prize money of 20,000 euros, will be presented on 6 September in Essen.
On our very last day in Australia, when we were in Perth, we decided we wanted to go out for breakfast somewhere. The vegan food in Australia is so amazing, it seemed only fitting that we made sure to have one last meal.
This meal happened to be at a little cafe called Flora & Fauna, and if you're ever in Perth, I highly recommend you check it out. They have some of the most delicious and beautiful looking brunch meals and you'll be spoilt for choice in what to pick.
Sam ended up having a mushroom bagel dish, and this is where the inspiration for this recipe comes from. Tomato marinated mushrooms on a homemade toasted bagel, what more could you want?
So this dish consists of loads of tomatoey, marinated mushrooms, with a hint of smokiness and a touch of sweetness. The longer you have time to leave them to marinate, the better, as they'll become even more flavoursome the longer they're left. If you know you're having them for breakfast, then begin marinating them the night before, and your tastebuds will thank you. If you don't have time to marinate them for so long, then don't stress. Even if you marinate them for just 10 minutes, they'll still be packed full of flavour. But as always, give them as long as possible.
We also recommend making your own bagels for this. We have our own vegan poppyseed bagel recipe, so go ahead and make them first. This dish is a great recipe if you're having friends or family around for brunch. It's a real show-stopper and makes for a delicious start to the day. That being said, over at The Rose & Bean, we don't think meals like this have to be solely reserved for breakfast, and we've had it for dinner before as well, which is just as great.
If you're having it for brunch, why not serve it with your own homemade vegan croissants as well? Then your guests will really be blown away! Get cooking and let us know how you get on.
Facebook censored this post, then asked if we needed to temporarily freeze our profile to "clean up" anything else. Assholes...
Sometime over the weekend, a fan of ours on Facebook posted a funny image on our page. I got the notification on my phone, but between then and the time I tried to log in to Facebook on my computer, I was told that something on our Facebook page was deemed inappropriate, given an extensive review of Facebook's standards and guidelines, and asked if I needed to temporarily freeze our page to "clean up" other scandalous material.
No. No I would not like to.
I was then shown the perpetrating image that the user had uploaded to the page, and I got two laughs out of it: one from the image itself and one from the fact that Facebook apparently goes way too far when it comes to censoring material from Jewish comedians:

It may have been a holiday weekend in the US and UK, but physics never takes the day off. A conference entitled Particle Physics and Cosmology took place in France, and featured a talk by Giovanni Punzi, a member of Fermilab's CDF collaboration. Although the talk primarily focused on the search for the Higgs boson at Fermi and CERN, they managed to slip in five slides on a result we discussed just a month ago: the prospect that the Tevatron has spotted a previously unknown particle with a mass of 150GeV. The slide makes clear that the CDF detector team has continued crunching its way through its data, and the case for a new particle has gotten stronger.
The results in April were produced by looking at events that produced a W boson and a pair of jets of lighter particles. After subtracting out all the other events that produce this sort of pattern, it's possible to see a peak in the data at the energy associated with W/W and W/Z production. But, just to the right of that, the authors saw a second peak, which suggested the possibility of a new particle being produced, one that has a mass that doesn't correspond to anything in the standard model.
The peak was a bit over three standard deviations away from where we'd expect the data to graph if nothing unusual was happening here. In physics, consensus has been that nothing has been discovered until we have data at five standard deviations, so the initial results were considered reason to pay attention, but nothing definitive. Fortunately, they became apparent when only a portion of the Tevatron data was analyzed; working with more of the data set should help clarify whether the peak is a statistical fluke.
According to Punzi, we're not at discovery yet, but we're getting tantalizingly close. The first results were generated using 4.3 inverse femtobarns of data; we're now up to 7.3fb-1, the peak is not going away, and the results are now closer to the five standard deviation standard. In addition, the detector team has gone back and eliminated some alternative explanations, like background from top quark production.
At this point, we're really waiting for the team behind the second detector at Fermi to weigh in (these results come from CDF, but Fermi also has a second detector, called Dzero). Although this doesn't appear to be a statistical fluke, it could be a hardware fluke or a product of the method they used for getting rid of the background events. Dzero is different hardware, and the background models are specific to each detector, so looking at data from CDF's sibling should go a long way toward giving us confidence that this peak is real. The same applies to data from the LHC.
Given the potential significance, chances are very good that all these teams are rushing to complete this analysis; I'd expect we'll know whether it reaches five sigmas and is seen in other detectors before the summer is out.
One of the reasons I expect that is the speed at which this story is developing—the whole thing provides a nice demonstration of how the Internet has transformed science. For starters, the original CDF result was hosted on the arXiv preprint server, so people could have a look at the data and arguments presented in it before it had even made it through peer review (it has since been published in Physical Review Letters). Responses to the results have already appeared in the arXiv, and Punzi spent part of their talk addressing some of those.
The slides from their talk are now available, hosted on the conference's website (you can find the relevant section by searching for "W-jj excess"). One of the attendees wrote a blog post on it; that, in turn, got picked up by Cosmic Variance, on the popular Discover Blogs site, which is where I found it. Following the links from those blog posts made it possible to find new draft papers on theoretical explanations for the 150GeV particle.
Not all fields of science have been this thoroughly transformed by the openness that the Internet allows. But for those that have, it's hard to escape the sense that it has been like punching the accelerator. Peer review, reanalysis, and community responses all take place in real time, all before initial results even have the opportunity to appear in print. And, for the public, that means a closer view of the hottest news and the process that produced it.

The following is a list of mainstream films featuring skiing or snowboarding scenes. Skiing has been recorded on film since at least the 1910s, but did not work its way into Hollywood features until the 1930s, when it began to be popular as a leisure activity in the United States. Snowboarding's entry onto the screen paralleled its rise to popularity in the late 1980s and early 90s.

"It's a 98 percent certainty and 2 percent speculation."
Former wrestling star Chyna died from an accidental overdose of a prescription sleeping pill and a tranquilizer, their manager said Wednesday.
"It's a 98 percent certainty and 2 percent speculation," Anthony Anzaldo said.
Anzaldo, who lived nearby, discovered the 46-year-old ex-WWE star dead on April 20 in their bed at their Redondo Beach home. They believe they may have died two or three days earlier.
Chyna, whose birth name was Joan Marie Laurer, was a lifelong insomniac who had prescriptions for Ambien and a generic version of the antianxiety drug Valium, Anzaldo said.
Days before they were found dead, Chyna appeared rambling and disjointed as they wandered around their apartment wearing headphones and a feather in their hair in a 13-minute video they posted online.
Chyna has acknowledged struggling with addiction in the past. Anzaldo said they had been known to binge drink but had not had a drink for several weeks, and there was no alcohol in their home at the time of their death.
Anzaldo said they suspect that Chyna had been "self-medicating a little bit more than they should have" because they had begun seeing a psychiatrist for the first time, was attending a women's domestic violence group and had visited the grave of their estranged father.
They were trying to deal with issues of abandonment and violence from previous relationships, Anzaldo explained.
"A lot was going on in their life emotionally. But they aren't depressed; it was just a lot to deal with," they said.
The drugs may have clouded their memory so that they took more than they realized, Anzaldo said.
"She accidentally, over the course of two or three weeks, misused their legally prescribed medication," Anzaldo said. "They're not going to find, like, 60 pills in their stomach."
Anzaldo, who was making a documentary with and about Chyna, said they were concerned and was in the process of trying to get Chyna free rehabilitation by making them a subject on A&E's celebrity addiction reality series Intervention.
"This would have been the quickest possible way" to arrange for rehab, they said.
No cause of death has been released by the Los Angeles County coroner's office because results of toxicology tests are pending.
The death initially was reported as a possible overdose with prescription drugs, "but we don't know," Ed Winter, the coroner's assistant chief, said.
Anzaldo said that with the consent of Chyna's mother, they donated their brain to Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who has investigated possible links between chronic traumatic encephalopathy and concussions in athletes. They were portrayed by Will Smith in the recent film Concussion.
However, Anzaldo said they don't believe that Chyna had the injury. "It wasn't what cost them their life," they said.
Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte has taken solo first place in the Pulse Asia survey commissioned by ABS-CBN from March 27 to April 3, 2016.
Duterte obtained 30 percent of the 4,000 respondents in the Pulse Asia survey, a sharp jump from 24 percent the previous survey from ‎March 15 to 20. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 percent.
Sen. Grace Poe dropped to second with 25 percent in wave 8, down from 28 percent in wave 7.
Vice President Jejomar Binay was third with 20 percent, down from 23 percent.
Liberal Party bet Mar Roxas was fourth with 19 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago was fifth with 2 percent, unchanged from the previous survey.
Duterte saw their ratings zoom in all areas – plus 2 percent in Metro Manila‎; plus 4 percent in Luzon, plus 5 percent in Visayas, and plus 12 percent in Mindanao – and in all income clases – plus 9 percent in ABC, plus 6 percent in D and E.
Poe saw their ratings fall in all areas – minus 1 percent in Metro Manila, minus 4 percent in Luzon, and minus 6 percent in Mindanao – except in Visayas which was unchanged.
Poe was down in all income classes – minus 13 percent in ABC, minus 2 percent in D, and minus 1 percent in E.

I should have been watching my son run through their football drills Saturday. Instead, I couldn't help overhearing two dads talking about their “big” Friday night plans.
“Man, I was at home last night watching a cartoon with my kids,” one dad said, a wide smile on theirs face.
The other laughed in recognition. “My Friday nights aren't what they used to be,” the other replied.
These were Alpha Male Dads, the type who cheer on their five-year-old sons like they were Peyton Manning scrambling to find an open receiver. Yet they didn't seem bitter about the end of their pre-kid Fridays. In fact, they embraced their new life schedules.
Talk about unsung role models.
It's easy for parents to bemoan their fate. Remember when dining out didn't include potty breaks that came just as your entree arrived? Or how Saturday night at 11 p.m. was time to visit another bar and keep the night going? Or those spontaneous liaisons with your wife, the kind you'd giggle about for days?
Gone, gone and most certainly gone.
Those football dads have two choices. Mourn the loss of their old freedoms or embrace the new normal. Sounds like they're doing the latter.
Waiting for the Big Break
It reminded me of when I waited tables at The Olive Garden at the start of my professional career. I'd sneak in a writing assignment between shifts, but the bulk of my workday meant slinging garlic bread sticks and refilling salad bowls.
On a visceral level I hated it. I also knew it was paying the rent until a job in my field opened up. So before each shift I would do an attitude makeover, often while sitting in The Olive Garden's parking lot. I chose to be the best server possible, push past my shyness and befriend customers as much as possible.
It made a huge difference. Soon, I was singing my last birthday song and starting a full-time career as a writer thanks to my new attitude.
These attitude nips and tucks work wonders, but they shouldn't be seen as cure-alls … or excuses for not bettering yourself. Dads are better off embracing the imperfections of being a parent, and so are their kids. But it wouldn't have helped if I didn't have my sights set on writing while waiting tables, my true passion.
It always helps to have a plan.
Changing your attitude is easier said than done. Do you have any tricks for making it happen? Share them below, and maybe more dads can get into the best frame of mind possible.

You may never have heard of the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, but by some measures it is one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in the world, with an official population of 29 million—about the same as Saudi Arabia—and unofficial population of 32 million or more.
The city center of Chongqing boasts a mere 9 million people, but dozens of satellite districts such as Fuling (population 1 million) and Wanzhou (1.6 million) are each major cities in their own right. In total, Chongqing covers an area the size of Austria, and it's about to become part of a mega-region that is even larger, part of move in China to create the biggest urban municipalities on Earth.
Chongqing, for example, will be part of the even larger Chuanyu mega-region, which also includes the major city of Chengdu and 13 cities from Sichuan province. The Capital Economic Zone encompasses Beijing and Tianjin; the Pearl River Delta region includes Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong; and the Yangtze River Delta region is centered around Shanghai.
China isn't alone in the development of mega-regions—greater Tokyo and the Washington, DC-Boston corridor also have similarly huge populations and geographies—but China's ongoing urbanization and rapid growth is making it something of a laboratory for urban planning on a massive scale. The theoretical appeal of ever-larger municipal areas is that they will create efficiencies in the delivery of services like transport and sanitation, while knitting together a thriving urban ecosystem.
The trouble is that China's mega-cities and mega-regions aren't being built with an eye toward maximizing the advantages and minimizing the downsides of creating these massive metropolises. Most importantly, the mega-regions are being built around a small number of city centers, many of which are surrounded by concentric circles of commuters and bedroom communities that makes traffic hellish and pollution even worse.
“Among the 10 developed and emerging mega-regions in China, only a limited number have exhibited a significant level of polycentricity,” concluded a report by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (pdf), a US think tank. “Around half of the 10 mega-regions are either dominated by a single major center, or by a limited number of major centers which are located closely to one another.”
This is a problem because it ultimately means everyone will want to work in close proximity to the city centers, which causes sky-high property prices and transportation headaches. Size doesn't always have to be a negative, though.
“Mega-cities are a necessary step in the development of urban areas,” Eric Marcuson, a Chongqing-based urban planner at Aecom, told Quartz. “A city is just an urban area with one center, but to increase growth and productivity cities eventually need to encompass more, complimentary centers.”
Unfortunately it doesn't appear that China is following the advice of urban planners like Marcuson. Take Beijing, a city of around 20 million residents with just one main center for commerce and productivity. It is surrounded by concentric ring roads that create heavy traffic, and even its very good subway system is hugely overcrowded. Nevertheless, the Chinese government seems determined to double-down on Beijing, combining it with the city of Tianjin and parts of Hebei province into one huge megalopolis. But as Quartz has reported, While Hebei isn't likely to attract workers away from Beijing, the other cities in the proposed “Jing-Jin-Ji” region are mostly suburbs, with no real urban centers of their own—precisely the opposite to what the specialists advise.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly named the Chongqing-based urban planner as Eric Marcusson instead of Eric Marcuson.
Samsung Electronics finally identified what went wrong with its Galaxy Note 7 handsets that led to one of the worst technology recalls in recent times, a day before its full-year earnings.
Dong-jin Koh, Samsung's mobile business chief, acknowledged two separate instances of battery malfunctions were to blame for some of the handsets catching fire at a Monday press conference in Seoul, South Korea. They also used the conference to apologize to customers and suppliers.
Investors responded positively to the news, with Samsung shares closing up 2.31 percent at 1,903,000 won during market close on Monday.
The Galaxy Note 7 handsets were packed with lithium-ion batteries, which are arranged in three layers: a positive electrode, a negative one and a third physical layer that acted as the separator between the first two. When the positive and negative electrodes touch, it can sometimes lead to short circuits within the battery cells.
Koh explained in the first set of batteries, which were rolled out with the original devices, there was an issue with the upper right hand corner of the battery cell. "Our analysis showed the main cause for the incidents was deflections in the negative electrodes," they said, adding incorrect positioning of the negative electrode tip also led to a higher likelihood of incidents.
For the second set of batteries, which were supplied by a different manufacturer and were put into the replacement units, Samsung found melted copper on the negative electrode area. Koh said there were welding issues that led to contact between the positive and negative layers, resulting in short circuits.
"It does all add up," according to Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. But the odds of two separate battery manufacturers having issues in the same phone was incredibly low, they told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday.
"Get on my level!"

Nov 15, 2016; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Charlotte Hornets guard Nicolas Batum (5) reacts after a foul is called against them in the second half against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Target Center. The Hornets won 115-108. Mandatory Credit: Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY Sports
After recent injury scare for Nicolas Batum, the Charlotte Hornets got some positive news as their CT Scan on their brain for migraines came back negative.
Nicolas Batum originally missed the Charlotte Hornets‘ game against the Chicago Bulls with a migraine but the injury seemingly got much worse after it lasted for a few days. The severe headache was described as “excruciating” for Nic and it was “a scary period” for him. (Chris Haynes/ ESPN)
Fortunately, the team got some good news about regarding Batum as the CT Scan on their brain came back negative. Stephanie Ready of the Hornets' FOX Sports Southeast broadcast team gave some insight on the injury during the team's game against the Indiana Pacers. Ready said that the scan was a precautionary measure.
The CT Scan is used if a migraine lasts longer than doctors think it should, usually more than one or two days. When everyone got the update about the scan, we all feared the worst but hoped for the best. Luckily, the results were negative and it seems as if Nic should be back sooner rather than later.
Stephanie Ready says Nic Batum's CT scan today came back negative. — Jerry Stephens III (@JR_Steph23) March 15, 2017
Chris Haynes later confirmed this.
While it is unclear how long Batum will be out, the injury doesn't appear to be as serious as it potentially could've been. Expect Nic to take a few more days off to rest and eventually come back fully healthy for Charlotte later this season.
The 28-year old is the Hornets' second-leading scorer this season and is averaging 15.4 points per game, 6.7 rebounds per game and 5.9 assists per game in 63 outings so far this year. With only about a month left in the 2016-17 campaign, Charlotte needs Nic back as soon as possible if they are going to continue their push for the playoffs.
Even as it stands, the team's on the outside looking in and it's a long shot for them to make the postseason at this point. Batum's health is the main concern and getting them right going forward and for the future is what should be focused on.
We'll keep you updated when more news becomes available but at this point, things are looking better for Nic. Considering the scare when the brain scan was announced, the negative results are a good sign for Batum and the Charlotte Hornets. Hopefully, they can return to action soon.

JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Twentynine Palms, California – On Sunday, October 15, 2017 at approximately 11:30 a.m., Joshua Tree Search and Rescue (JOSAR) discovered two bodies in a remote region of Joshua Tree National Park. Park rangers and JOSAR responded.
Due to suspicious circumstances, detectives from the San Bernardino County Specialized Investigations Division – Homicide Detail also responded to the area. The bodies were transferred to the San Bernardino County Coroner on Monday, October 16.
The decedents were identified as Rachel Nguyen, 20, and Joseph Orbeso, 22, both of Orange County. During the autopsy, the coroner identified injuries consistent with a gunshot wound on both Nguyen and Orbeso. Evidence suggests that Orbeso shot Nguyen and then shot himself. An investigation into these actions is ongoing.
The couple was initially identified as missing on July 28, 2017 when a local bed and breakfast owner reported they had not returned to check out of their room. The owner remembered that the couple mentioned hiking in Joshua Tree National Park. National Park Service (NPS) rangers and JOSAR initiated a search and located the couple's vehicle at the Maze Loop trailhead. Recognizing the need for additional resources, NPS made a mutual aid request to San Bernardino County. A large-scale search launched with over 250 searchers, including ground teams, dog teams, and aircraft.
The search transitioned to limited continuous mode on August 6, during which NPS and JOSAR continued search efforts as resources permitted and new information became available.
Anyone with information about this couple should contact San Bernardino County at 909-387-3589, or 1-800-78 CRIME (27463) to remain anonymous. You may leave a tip at www.wetip.com.
The Obama administration has significantly increased the frequency of drone strikes and other air attacks against the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen in recent months amid rising concern about political collapse there.
Some of the the strikes, carried out by the military's Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), have been focused in the southern part of the country, where insurgent forces have for the first time conquered and held territory as the Yemeni government continues to struggle against escalating opposition to President Ali Abdullah Saleh's 33-year rule.
Unlike in Pakistan, where the CIA has presidential authorization to launch drone strikes at will, each U.S. attack in Yemen — and those being conducted in nearby Somalia, most recently on Thursday near the southern port city of Kismayo — requires White House approval, senior administration officials said.
The officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter on the record, said intended targets must be drawn from an approved list of key members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula deemed by U.S. intelligence officials to be involved in planning attacks against the West. White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan last week put their number at “a couple of dozen, maybe.”
Although several unconfirmed strikes each week have been reported by local media in Yemen and Somalia, the administration has made no public acknowledgment of the escalated campaign, and officials who discussed the increase declined to provide numbers.
The heightened air activity coincides with the administration's determination this year that AQAP, as the Yemen-based group is known, poses a more significant threat to the United States than the core al-Qaeda group based in Pakistan. The administration has also concluded that AQAP has recruited at least a portion of the main insurgent group in Somalia, al-Shabab, to its anti-Western cause.
From its initial months in office, the Obama administration has debated whether to extend the air attacks that have proved so effective in Pakistan to the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa. Military and intelligence officials have long argued in favor of attacks against al-Shabab camps in Somalia, which have been under overhead surveillance for years. Other officials have questioned the legal and moral justification for intervening in what, until recently, has been a largely domestic conflict.
The administration has said its legal authority to conduct such strikes, whether with fixed-wing planes, cruise missiles or drones, derives from the 2001 congressional resolution authorizing attacks against al-Qaeda and protection of the U.S. homeland, as well as the international law of self-defense.
“The United States does not view our authority to use military force against al-Qaeda as being restricted solely to ‘hot' battlefields like Afghanistan,” Brennan said in remarks prepared for delivery Friday night at Harvard Law School. “We reserve the right to take unilateral action if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to take the necessary actions themselves.”
“That does not mean we can use military force whenever we want, wherever we want,” Brennan said. “International legal principles, including respect for a state's sovereignty and the laws of war, impose important constraints on our ability to act unilaterally — and on the way in which we can use force — in foreign territories.”
In Somalia, the administration backs a tenuous government whose control does not extend beyond the capital, Mogadishu.
In Yemen, Saleh has been a close counterterrorism ally, and Brennan said last week that Yemen's political turmoil, which began in March as part of the upheaval known as the Arab Spring, has not affected that cooperation. U.S. officials have emphasized that violence between loyalist troops and those backing breakaway army officers and tribal leaders has not involved U.S.-trained Yemeni special operations forces. This week, government forces reportedly made gains fighting against entrenched insurgent fighters in the southern port town of Zinjibar.
In the Yemeni capital Sanaa, thousands of anti-government protesters have been camping out in what is known as Change Square for several months, demanding an end to Saleh's rule. The camp has remained quiet for weeks, but Reuters, citing doctors, reported Saturday that soldiers opened fire near the camp overnight and wounded eight protesters. The troops shot in the air to stop demonstrators from trying to expand the area of protest.
As the political conflict drags on, concern has increased over insurgent expansion and future cooperation with whatever government emerges in Yemen.
For months, the administration has called on Saleh to sign an agreement put forward this summer by Persian Gulf states to transfer power to an interim government and hold early elections. Their intransigence seems to have increased since June, when Saleh departed for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia after being severely injured in an attack on their presidential palace. They have repeatedly insisted they intend to return to Yemen and retake control of their government, currently being run by Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.
Last week, the ruling General People's Congress sent a delegation to Riyadh and secured Saleh's agreement to allow Hadi to negotiate with the opposition and implement a political transition. While the opposition called the deal a trick, the Obama administration has tried to push Hadi and the government to take the initiative and negotiate a deal with opponents.
In a statement released late Thursday, the State Department called on the Yemeni government to sign and implement the agreement “within one week.”
Until May, the first and only known drone strike in Yemen was launched by the CIA in 2002. As part of its stepped-up military cooperation with Yemen, the Obama administration has used manned aircraft to strike at targets indicated by U.S. and Yemeni military intelligence forces on the ground. In May, JSOC first used a drone to kill two AQAP operatives as part of its new escalation in Yemen.
This summer, the CIA was also tasked with expanding its Yemen operations, and the agency is building its own drone base in the region. It is not clear whether the unilateral strike authority the CIA has in Pakistan will be extended to Yemen.
Administration officials have described the expanded drone campaign as utilizing a “mix of assets,” and a senior military official said they knew of no plans or discussions “to change the nature of operations.”
“The new base doesn't connote that [the CIA] will be in the lead,” the official said. “It offers better teamwork and collaboration between the agencies.”

Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA may seem an unlikely duo, but the largest and smallest of the Big Four carriers are coming together, just this once. The two have inked a deal to exchange spectrum in the AWS band, a stepping stone for both in their mutual quest for LTE network growth.
As part of the deal, which covers licenses for 218 markets, T-Mobile will get a boost in future holdings in 15 of the nation's top 25 markets. If the deal goes through, T-Mobile's spectrum gain will cover 60 million people in key cities like Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Detroit, Minneapolis, Seattle, Cleveland, OH. and Charlotte, NC.
For its part, Verizon will walk away with spectrum covering 22 million people, plus some cold, hard cash. More importantly, Big Red hopes that it'll have shed enough of its spectrum to push through its pending deal with cable companies.
Both T-Mobile and Verizon say that the transfer of the specific bands will help each one fix an AWS problem, in part by giving each larger stacks of continuous spectrum to work with.
Verizon and T-Mobile aren't disclosing financial terms.
"The AWS licenses we'll acquire from T-Mobile and through SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap will be used to add capacity to our 4G LTE network," Verizon's president and CEO of Verizon Wireless, Dan Mead, said in a statement.
At this stage, the plan is more an intention than a done deal, since Verizon's go-ahead is contingent upon transactions already in the works with Cox, Leap, and SpectrumCo. In addition, the FCC will have to sign off on the transaction later this summer for it to proceed apace.
Verizon leads the LTE network race by a long shot in terms of coverage and strength, but is leaning hard on deals with cable partners to sustain its rapid growth and supply customers with a steady stream of ultrafast bandwidth.
T-Mobile, on the other hand, has yet to launch its first LTE market. Pending regulatory approval, the spectrum deal with Verizon, along with its $4 billion commitment to building out its 4G network, is a critical stepping stone to finally kicking off LTE in 2013.
A string of car bombs were detonated in and around Baghdad while people celebrated the end of Ramadan yesterday, killing at least 69 people and wounding 140 more.
Twelve separate explosions targeted areas where Muslims were marking the final day of the holy fasting month in cafés, restaurants and markets in the Iraqi capital.
One of the worst blasts came shortly before sunset in the south-eastern suburb of Jisr Diyala where seven people died while at an outdoor shopping centre.

Five more were reported to have been killed when a bomb went off while drivers waited in a traffic jam in Karbala.
In a further attack, a suicide bomber blew up a car on a busy road in Tuz Khurmato, north of Baghdad, killing 10 and wounding more than 30. The town has been the scene of increased violence in recent months.
The attacks on Shia neighbourhoods came on the Eid Al-Fir holiday, bringing to an end of the most violent Ramadan since 2007. More than 1,000 people were killed in Iraq in July alone and there remain fears that an all-out sectarian war may yet erupt in the country again. Fifty people died in a series of explosions in Baghdad on Tuesday.
Tensions have increased since a crackdown on a Sunni anti-government protest camp in April in which dozens died during angry skirmishes. Security patrols had been stepped up in Baghdad.
The Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, said last week: "We will not leave our children to these murderers and those standing behind them and supporting both inside and outside."

We are happy to announce the release of Qt Creator 4.1.0.
Themes
We added Flat Light and Flat Dark themes, complementing the Flat theme which was added in 4.0. They are available in the Environment > Interface > Theme settings. We also added some more editor color schemes which you find in Text Editor > Fonts & Colors.
Editing
Text Editors now behave much better with regards to automatically inserting and skipping characters. If you type a quote or bracket, the corresponding closing character is added. If you remove the opening character, it is removed again. If you type the closing character yourself, it replaces the automatically inserted one. Both of these now only happen as long as the text cursor did not move away from the closing character. You can also configure automatic insertion of brackets and quotes individually in the Text Editor > Completion settings.
C++
Aside from fixing bugs in the code model and static analyzer integration, we also updated our binary packages to use Clang 3.8.1, which also fixes many issues, especially with MSVC. We also added a more recent patch to Clang that makes it work better with MSVC2015 Update 3.
Qt Quick
Both Qt Quick Designer and QML Profiler received many performance improvements. You can now choose a Qt Quick Controls 2 style which Qt Quick Designer uses to render your items. The new Move to Component action moves an item and its contents into a separate file.
CMake
Many bugs were fixed for supporting CMake projects, and the workflow further improved. CMake is only run automatically if Qt Creator is the active application, and you can turn automatic running completely off (Build & Run > CMake). If you set the QML_IMPORT_PATH variable in the CMake cache for your project, Qt Creator picks this up and feeds it to the QML code model, so you can access your QML imports in the editor. (Example CMake code: set(QML_IMPORT_PATH ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/qml ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/imports CACHE string "" FORCE) )
Other improvements
If you turn on the plugin (Help > About Plugins, or Qt Creator > About Plugins on macOS), Qt Creator gains experimental support for the Nim programming language. Many thanks to Filippo Cucchetto for this contribution. It supports syntax highlighting, indentation, coding style settings, and simple project management, including building, running and debugging applications.
All this is just a small excerpt from all the changes and improvements that you find in Qt Creator 4.1.0. Find out more in our change log, or just go ahead, download and try it for yourself!
Get Qt Creator 4.1.0
The opensource version is available on the Qt download page, and you find commercially licensed packages on the Qt Account Portal. Qt Creator 4.1.0 is also available through an update in the online installer. Please post issues in our bug tracker. You can also find us on IRC on #qt-creator on chat.freenode.net, and on the Qt Creator mailing list.

"It isn't an easy language to learn, what with all the growls and howls. Big Z told me the whole point was to make it difficult for outsiders to understand." ―Mission Vao [src]
Shyriiwook, also known as Wookieespeak, was the main trade language of the Wookiees. In Basic, Shyriiwook translates to "tongue of the tree people." It was not the only Wookiee language, but, being the main trade language, it was the language understood by most non-Wookiees who understood "the Wookiee language" — in fact, most non-Wookiees were unaware of the existence of multiple Wookiee languages.
Contents show]
Description Edit
"…he's good company if you understand the peculiarities of Wookiee talk. I sound pretty stupid trying to speak Wookiee, but I understand it well enough." ―Han Solo, describing Chewbacca to Sai'da [src]
To outsiders, this language usually sounded like mere animalistic barks, roars, growls, and moans, conveying little more than emotion. However, Shyriiwook was in fact just as much an intelligent language as Basic.
The unique shape of the Wookiee throat made Shyriiwook a very difficult, even impossible language to speak for most non-Wookiees; presumably the word Shyriiwook itself, as well as other Wookiee words or names, were transliterations of the original Wookiee sounds into a form more easily pronounced by others. No tongue or lip movement was required to speak Shyriiwook; the jaw was typically locked open, with sound emanating from the throat and back of the mouth.
It was also incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for most Wookiees to learn to speak Basic. As a result, most inter-species communication involving Wookiees had to be carried out in a bilingual format, usually with the Wookiee speaking Shyriiwook and the other party speaking Basic.
Leia Organa Solo encountered a Wookiee with a speech impediment which conveniently rendered their Shyriiwook pronunciation much easier to understand by Leia, who was learning the language at the time.
Shyriiwook had over 150 words for 'wood', depending on content, grain, moisture and underlying structure. It also had fifteen separate words meaning 'violence'.[1]
However, standard Shyriiwook was considered lacking in suitable terminology, and perhaps semantic precision, for many technical subjects. Accordingly, when Wookiees talked about topics such as starship maintenance, the Thykarann dialect was often preferred, with many Wookiees capable of switching between the two with relative ease.[2]
Another Wookiee language, Xaczik, was indigenous to the Wartaki Islands on Kashyyyk and several outlying coastal regions. While Shyriiwook remained the common language of Wookiee trade and travel, the much rarer Xaczik language became the secret language of the Wookiee underground when Imperial forces took over their planet.[3][4]

Are we a nation of Taliban apologists?
0 SHARES Email
During their talk about terror and extremism in Pakistan, Mohammad Jibran Nasir declared,
“I am not a cultural ambassador. I am not here to talk about bhangra.”
The point was well taken since they were in the middle of a hard-hitting presentation about the terror threat in Pakistan and was not holding back their punches. Clad in a white shalwar kurta with a Pakistani flag pinned to their lapel, Nasir clearly does not equate patriotism with denial.
They emphasised that while we are not all Taliban apologists, our society has become a breeding ground for terrorists.
 They are on an extensive tour of the United States to spread awareness about their #NeverForgetPk and #PakistanForAll movements, and on this particular day, they were speaking to an audience comprising mostly of expat Pakistanis at Stanford's Bechtel International Centre.
The session started with a short documentary about the origins of their movement. Among the narrators who came on screen was slain political activist Sabeen Mahmud. They looked at the camera and remarked enthusiastically that Nasir makes ordinary people feel hopeful by saying,
“Hum bhi kuch kar saktay hain.” (Even we can do something.)
In a morbid twist of fate, Mahmud was murdered mere months after they uttered these words and has become another name in our frighteningly fast growing list of fallen heroes.
Do we deserve their sacrifice? Or are we a nation of Taliban apologists?
Nasir's whole US tour is touted as a counter narrative to this allegation.
However, their talk does not let us off the hook so easily. There was a continuous thread of accountability for what we have allowed our society to become. Their focus was not even on the defiant Taliban who reject the state and constituent, but on those elements which operate with impunity from within the system.
For example, they pointed out that the banned Sipah-e-Sahaba , as it was originally called, has reached deep into the institutions of our country. It has ties with all major political parties as well as the military. Under the guise of ever changing names and with patronage from elements within the state, they resurface, thrive, tout firepower and street power, and influence our social structure and mind set.
They talked about the escalating hate, apathy, and religious divide that has seeped into our everyday lives. They are manifested as hate speech in our third grade text books, in our cavalier attitude towards disrespecting other faiths, in our selective mourning. So many die in Pakistan, said Nasir, that people's first questions is not what, but who? Who died? And then that particular community mourns their own.
They did not need to spell it out. It was clear that our collective humanity is dying, suffocating slowly under the rubble of conspiracy theories, fear, apathy, and sheer number of dead bodies.
It is a tragedy for a country whose founding father had Shia family history, the first law minister was a Hindu, and the first foreign mister was an Ahmadi. A country which at birth was home to so many sects, that by their sheer volume we were compelled to be a tolerant society.
Nasir pointed out that over time that pluralistic quality has eroded so completely that the generation born into the new millennium doesn't even recall a tolerant Pakistan. They then showed two images of smiling young men against a backdrop of mayhem and murder, and asked two of the audience members who had no ties to Pakistan,
“If you saw these images, what religion would you associate with these people?”
Both replied, with an endearing amount of hesitation,
“Islam!”
But all those smiling young men were not all Muslims. They were, however, all Pakistani.
The point Nasir stressed on is not to pit one faith against another, but to show that these very young men are so desensitised to bloodshed that they smile for the camera in the midst of it. For the majority Sunni Muslims, in one picture there is no fear of the state, and for the Christian minority there is no faith in the state. The state, they pointed out, allowed 55 charged terrorists to contest the elections in 2013, out of which 40 belonged to Sipah-e-Sahaba.
So what can ordinary citizens do to fight this threat?
Nasir and their team will be launching multiple applications in the near future that will tackle this problem through information sharing and dissemination. For example, #AajKeDin (today) will archive every act of sectarian and religious violence in the country, #HamariZameen (our land) will map out the affected areas, while #HamareHeroes (our heroes) and #HamareDusman (our enemies) will shine a much-needed spotlight on the terrorists and their victims and so on.
They need journalists, professionals, everyday committed Pakistanis to join in and populate these resources, use them, learn from them, and cause change because of them. Nasir believes we can yet reclaim our land; we can face and defeat terror if we are mobilised.
As the small crowd nodded in agreement, I looked around at the clearly motivated people but wondered whether this was enough? We need strength in numbers. We need a critical mass. We need constant relentless protest. We cannot rely on a few good people to keep fighting for us. We cannot expect them to pay the price of our silence with their blood. Otherwise, one by one, all those who risk their lives and limbs to raise a voice of dissent will be silenced and in that silence our indifference will ring out like the ominous wind that punctures the still before the storm.
It will sing a morbid tune about the demise of a nation that abandoned its brave and honourable.

Ten years ago, the Bush administration launched the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) —an effort to get potential nuclear bomb material out of vulnerable research facilities around the world, and to remove or beef up security for radiological materials that could be used in a “dirty bomb.”
GTRI has been remarkably successful. Since its May 2004 launch, it has removed over four tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium from countries around the world (or in a few cases, confirmed that they had eliminated the materials themselves), helped eighteen countries to eliminate all of the weapons-usable nuclear material on their soil, converted forty-eight reactors so they no longer use potential bomb material as fuel, removed 36,000 dangerous radiological sources, and upgraded security for some 1,600 buildings where dangerous radiological or nuclear material resides. These successes represent bombs unmade that will never go off—real and permanent threat reduction. At an annual cost that is less than one part in a thousand of the U.S. defense budget, all Americans are safer because of GTRI's work.
GTRI has been a bipartisan effort from its inception. I first proposed the idea, suggesting that a number of small programs working on pieces of the problem of removing vulnerable nuclear material be combined into a single effort with enough heft to get the job done. A wide range of Washington nongovernment organizations worked to push it forward, particularly the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), led by former Senator Sam Nunn. When the government had no program with the flexibility needed to get dangerous potential bomb material out of the former Yugoslavia, NTI stepped in with a $5 million private gift —solving one problem at one site, but highlighting the need for a broader government effort. Congress passed bipartisan legislation supporting the launch of the initiative; Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency at the time (and no friend of the Bush administration, given their inconvenient conclusion that there was no longer any nuclear-weapons program in Iraq before the 2003 war), helped convince President Bush such an initiative was needed.
Ten years on, GTRI has done a great deal, but a great deal remains to be done. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, despite President Obama's call to accelerate nuclear-security improvement around the globe, their budget proposal calls for cutting GTRI's budget by 25 percent —after years of previous cutbacks. Unless Congress acts to reverse these cuts, efforts to convert reactors away from potential bomb fuel, to develop new fuels so more reactors can be converted, and to protect and recover dangerous radiological sources will all be slowed.
Fortunately, there are signs of support for GTRI on Capitol Hill; remarkably, on this signature issue for President Obama, the House Republicans were more generous in their defense bill and energy and water appropriations bill than the Obama administration. The House bills, however, would slash nuclear security cooperation with Russia in response to the crisis in Ukraine—an unwise move, as locking down the essential ingredients of nuclear bombs has always been an investment in U.S. national security, not a favor to Russia or the other countries where this work takes place.
Speaking at West Point last month, President Obama warned that “if nuclear materials are not secure, that poses a danger to American citizens.” He's right. Work that could make a real difference in reducing that danger should never be slowed for lack of money. Congress should demand that President Obama present a strategic plan to ensure that all the world's potential nuclear-bomb material is sustainably protected against the full range of plausible threats as rapidly as possible—and that each year, President Obama request the funds needed to ensure that the plan can be carried out without delay. We need to return to the bipartisan spirit that has long marked efforts to clean out or lock down these dangerous materials.

The band wrote on their website: “Some very lucky people who purchased U2's Songs Of Innocence during a recent record store release found instead a copy of TOOL's 1992 OPIATE EP inside. Kind of makes you believe in mysterious higher powers doesn't it.”
With the sheer volume of Record Store Day releases there's bound to be the odd slip-up, but not all of them allow you to have a chuckle at U2 fans.
Several copies of the band's RSD novelty, a vinyl pressing of last year's straight-to-your-iTunes album Songs Of Innocence, somehow ended up with Tool's 1992 Opiate EP inside the sleeve.
Dianne Delahunty spotted the error when they picked up their vinyl from Banquet Records in Kingston. Perhaps there's a Tool fan out there with a U2 record to swap?
In other U2 news, Windmill Lane, the studio where the band recorded their early albums, was demolished this month.
The strange Islamic-themed graffiti that plagued Windsor neighbourhoods earlier this year appeared again on Wednesday — this time on the buildings of local media outlets and through the city's core.
The cryptic messages were spray-painted during the early morning hours on the properties of the Windsor Star, CTV Windsor, and CBC Windsor, as well as multiple bus shelters on Ouellette Avenue.
“#Islam execute drug dealers,” reads one message on the doors of the Windsor Star at 300 Ouellette Avenue. “#Sharia Now.”
The graffiti also references a verse in the Bible — Revelations 22:14-15.
Done in red block letters with hashtag symbols, the messages are similar in style and content to graffiti that appeared in South Windsor in October and along the riverfront in November.
The purpose of the graffiti remains unknown. The Windsor Islamic Council previously described the messages as “hate-mongering,” and urged the community not to allow them to sow division and bigotry.
“It is disturbing to see,” Zafar Iqbal, acting chairperson of the Windsor Islamic Council, said Wednesday.
“To be frank with you, I'm surprised this happens at all. I've been living in Windsor since 1995, and these things are only now starting to pop up. I have no idea what the motives are.”
Security cameras at the Windsor Star building recorded the person responsible for the latest graffiti: A lone Caucasian male with scruffy facial hair who appears to be in their 30s or 40s.
Dressed in a dark, hooded jacket, the man can be seen on video applying the spray paint quickly and smoothly — with a practiced hand.
“What we're looking at is they have targeted media outlets,” Windsor police spokesperson Const. Andrew Drouillard said Wednesday morning.
The CTV Windsor building is located at 1149 Goyeau St. The CBC Windsor building is at 825 Riverside Dr. West.
Drouillard said the graffiti was also found on bus shelters along Ouellette Avenue from Wyandotte Street south to Tecumseh Road.
At press time Wednesday, Windsor police were continuing to investigate these incidents as crimes of mischief. Anyone with information related to this vandalism is encouraged to call 519-255-6700 ext. 4000.
Anonymous tips can be made via Crime Stoppers at 519-258-8477 or www.catchcrooks.com.
Iqbal said the Windsor Islamic Council is committed to working with local law enforcement and educating the community. “I strongly encourage (the public) to report this behaviour.”

United Airlines pilots arrested for alleged drinking before Glasgow-New Jersey flight
Posted
Two pilots have been arrested in Scotland on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol as they prepared to fly a passenger plane to the United States, police said.
The two men were detained at Glasgow Airport on Saturday (local time) before they were due to fly to Newark in New Jersey.
Concerns were reportedly raised over the pair ahead of the 9:00am (local time) UA162 flight. The service, carrying 141 passengers, eventually flew with a new crew later the same day.
"Two men aged 35 and 45 have been arrested and are presently detained in police custody in connection with alleged offences under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, Section 93," a Police Scotland spokesperson said.
The section relates to "carrying out pilot function or activity while exceeding the prescribed limit of alcohol."
A United Airlines spokesperson said the two pilots had been removed from service and their flying duties.
"We are co-operating with the authorities and will conduct our own investigation as well. The safety of our customers and crew is our highest priority," the spokesperson said.
The men are expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court on the edge of Glasgow on Monday.
Arrests come after similar incident
The arrests come after two Canadian pilots were charged with being drunk as they prepared to fly from Glasgow to Toronto last month.
Jean-Francois Perreault, 39, and Imran Zafar Syed, 37, were arrested on July 18 as they were due to pilot an Airbus A310 plane, which carries up to 250 passengers, for Canada's Air Transat.
Perreault, from Ontario, and Syed, from Toronto, are charged under laws covering alcohol and drug limits in aviation.
They also face charges of threatening or abusive behaviour and were released on bail last month.

The Inbetweeners, the acclaimed UK sitcom about a quartet of teenaged losers, is set to graduate to the big screen with a feature-length spin-off due in cinemas this summer. The Inbetweeners Movie begins shooting this week with a UK release scheduled for 19 August. The production is directed by Ben Palmer and has been scripted by Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, who devised the original sitcom.
First aired in 2008, The Inbetweeners spotlights the misadventures of four hormonal sixth-formers: Will, Simon, Neil and Jay. The show stars Simon Bird, James Buckley, Blake Harrison and Joe Thomas, all of whom will be reprising their roles in the picture. The Inbetweeners Movie follows the characters on a summer holiday to Crete.
Beesley and Morris have suggested that the Channel 4-backed film will bring down the curtain on the quartet, who have already endured a world of indignities through three acclaimed series of the TV show. "We hope the fans will appreciate the film which, we think, completes the story of Will, Simon, Neil and Jay," they said in a statement.

Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press,” when asked about the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said their concern about Trump's ability to perform their duties “rises with the day.”
Partial transcript as follows:
FEINSTEIN: the concern rises with the day. the concern about this White House –
TODD: The concern about the president? Your concern about this president's ability to dot job rises by the day?
FEINSTEIN: Oh, yes. oh, yes. I've been here for 25 years now. There is a kind of instability, unpredictability. It's one issue after the other. We've got major problems in the world with our allies now, in the Middle eCast, with North Korea, it goes on and on. And I think that this president is just precipitating more and more angst that's going to lead to serious discord.
Major national organizations of physicians, psychiatrists, and nurses determined that their ethical obligations prohibited their members from participating in these interrogations, so what was the American Psychological Association doing? Photo by Jochen Sand/Thinkstock
Thanks to revelations in the newly released report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is now widely known that the CIA's torture program was created, supervised, and implemented by two licensed clinical psychologists—James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen—who were paid millions of dollars for their efforts. Less widely known is that the Bush administration's torture operation, at both the CIA and the Pentagon—at “black sites” and at Guantanamo—was devised and supervised largely by clinical psychologists. These psychologists used their knowledge of the workings of the human mind and psychological “mind-control” research to induce “learned helplessness” and “debility, dependency, and dread,” aiming to destroy the minds of detainees in the hope that “actionable intelligence” and “critical threat information” could be sifted from the wreckage.
The psychologists were vital to the torture program for one additional reason: The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the presence of psychologists and physicians, monitoring the state and condition of the prisoner being tortured, afforded protection for the CIA leadership and the Bush administration from liability and potential prosecution for the torture. Later, the OLC applied the same rules to the Defense Department's “enhanced interrogation program,” which, according to an investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee, was created and overseen by a team led by a clinical psychologist, and eventually overseen exclusively by clinical psychologists.
But this scandal has not been fully exposed, nor is it over. It turns out that for psychologists to be able to do the Bush administration's bidding and oversee the torture of detainees, they required not only indemnification for legal liability (Mitchell and Jessen were promised a $5 million legal defense fund by the CIA), but they also required indemnification from another source—a higher authority, if you will. Medical professionals are beholden to their respective professional ethics codes. The psychologists involved in the “enhanced interrogation techniques”—what most of us call torture—were concerned about being brought up on charges of ethics violations. If found guilty of ethical violations, these psychologists could lose their licenses and, according to CIA and Defense Department regulations, they could lose their positions and potential for future professional work. The same applies today, as monitoring remains an essential component of the Obama administration's adherence to the new Army Field Manual, with its own set of “enhanced interrogation techniques.”
Recent revelations in James Risen's new book, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, add an additional dimension to this story—it appears that senior staff members of the American Psychological Association, the world's largest association of psychologists, colluded with national security psychologists from the CIA, the Pentagon, and the White House to adapt APA ethics policy to suit the needs of the psychologist-interrogators. Now, the APA, under enormous pressure because of the allegations reported by Risen, has agreed to an independent investigation to be conducted by David Hoffman, a former inspector general and federal prosecutor. It will in all likelihood provide a rare opportunity to look inside the secret world of APA-counterintelligence collusion.
Risen based their allegations on emails found on the personal computer of Scott Gerwehr, a researcher at the Rand Corp. and apparent CIA consultant, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2008. Gerwehr had established close ongoing collaboration with a group of “national security psychologists who had influence behind the scenes at key institutions throughout Washington.” Among them were Susan Brandon, behavioral science adviser at the Bush White House (she is now chief interrogation scientist for the Obama administration) and Kirk Hubbard, the CIA's chief behavioral scientist. Hubbard has publicly admitted to bringing Mitchell and Jessen into the CIA to design the agency's “enhanced interrogation” program. Brandon, Hubbard, Gerwehr, and Geoff Mumford, APA's director of science policy, had worked together since soon after the 9/11 attacks to bring psychologist-researchers together with psychologist-operatives to collaborate on issues related to national security interrogations and interrogations research. Mitchell and Jessen were among the operatives present at these invitation-only meetings.
In July 2004, months before the role of psychologists in torture was made public when a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross on Guantanamo was leaked to the New York Times, Hubbard, Gerwehr, and personnel from the CIA and Pentagon were invited by Mumford and APA's ethics director Stephen Behnke to a secret meeting. Publicly the APA has claimed at various points that the meeting was to address challenges faced by domestic law enforcement investigations. However, the true goal of the meeting, according to the emails obtained by Risen, was to “bring together people with an interest in national-security” interrogations and to “ask individuals involved in the work what the salient issues” were and to “provide guidance” for the ethical issues that may come up with regard to those interrogations—the very interrogations so nauseatingly described in the Senate report.
We might divine some of the immediate motivation for convening this meeting from information released this week in the Senate committee's report. The report cites a CIA inspector general review, dated May 7, 2004, in which CIA psychologists were raising ethical questions about the way Mitchell and Jessen were conducting their interrogations: “Psychologists objected to the use of on-site psychologists as interrogators and raised conflict of interest and ethical concerns.” The questions were reportedly “based on a concern that the on-site psychologists who were administering the [CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques] participated in the evaluations, assessing the effectiveness and impact of the [CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques] on the detainees.” Could it be that these were the same fears that had prompted Hubbard, Mumford, and Behnke to brainstorm on APA ethics and national security?
As a direct result of this secret meeting, Mumford and Behnke proposed the creation of an APA task force to determine APA's ethics policy on psychologists' participation in national security interrogations. The task force met in June 2005 and decided that “it is consistent with the APA Ethics Code for psychologists to serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information-gathering processes for national security-related purposes.” In this conclusion, the APA stood alone among health professions. The other major national organizations of physicians, psychiatrists, and nurses all determined that their ethical obligations prohibited their members from participating in these interrogations. But the APA concluded that it was not only ethical for psychologists to participate, the leadership claimed that psychologists were necessary to keep national security interrogations “safe, legal, ethical, and effective,” roles that the other health professions determined were conflicting, unethical, and impossible to perform responsibly.
APA members have long suspected that the creation of the task force was a predetermined rubber stamp for CIA and Defense Department policy because a majority of its members were drawn from CIA and Pentagon units directly involved in national-security interrogations or interrogation research. But there was only circumstantial evidence that its members had been chosen for what appeared to be a CIA- and Defense Department–determined fait accompli.
With the publication of the Gerwehr emails, however, Risen has provided the smoking gun. It is undoubtedly this email exchange, from APA's Mumford to CIA's Hubbard that pressed the APA into agreeing to an independent investigation: On July 5, 2005—the day the task force released its report, Mumford sent Hubbard a copy of the report and wrote: “I also wanted to semi-publicly acknowledge your personal contribution … in getting this effort off the ground. … Your views were well represented by very carefully selected task force members.” They went on to reveal that Susan Brandon had served as an “observer” at the task force meeting (the observers' names had not been made public) and “helped craft some language related to research” for the task force report. And then, Risen provides one additional bombshell—at the time of Mumford's thank-you letter, Hubbard had retired from the CIA and was working directly for Mitchell Jessen and Associates, the company created in 2005 by the two psychologists specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Between 2005 and 2009, their firm collected $81 million from the CIA.
Since its release, members of the APA have fought to rescind the task force report and keep psychologists out of national security interrogations. But every time a policy is proposed or passed, the APA leadership has found a way to subvert its intent. In 2008, a group of APA members appealed to the entire membership in a referendum to prohibit psychologists from participating in any operation that violates the Geneva Conventions or the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The referendum passed overwhelmingly and in February 2009 was made APA official policy by the member-run council. Yet to date, APA leadership refuses to implement the referendum, claiming the APA cannot determine when U.S. national security policy violates international law; the APA holds to this position even in the face of judgments rendered by the United Nations Committee Against Torture, for example, as to the illegal status of indefinite detentions at Guantanamo Bay.
We await the results of the independent investigation. In the meantime, there are three questions Americans and the profession of psychology must answer together. Why did the APA devote its resources to guarantee psychologists' presence in these criminal operations? How did the U.S. government permit this weaponization of psychology? And how can we hold the psychologists who apparently created, justified, supervised, and implemented torture, and the professional association that seems to have supported those psychologists, to account?
METAIRIE, La. (AP) — Between Jonathan Vilma's latest knee surgery and Curtis Lofton's mysterious absence late last week, it's hard to know who might see the most work at inside linebacker in the Saints' new defensive scheme. Good thing for New Orleans that it appears to have solid depth in that area.
Roman Humber and David Hawthorne demonstrated that in last Friday night's preseason game against Oakland.
"Both those guys played well," Saints coach Sean Payton said. "With the snaps that they're getting, the reps they're getting — we just finished talking about this a little bit — going into the start of the season, we just have to continue to develop and train and be ready to play.
"Knowing how the season unfolds, all of these guys end up in roles that are significant. We just don't know which game," Payton added. "Hopefully you stay as healthy as possible, but with the roster size that it is and the length of the season, that's pretty normal."
Humber, a fifth-year pro who was undrafted out of North Dakota State, filled in for Lofton at strong-side middle linebacker and was credited with nine tackles, including a sack and a stop on fourth-and-short.
Hawthorne, in their sixth season, had three tackles while playing Vilma's weak-side spot.
They manned the middle of a unit that allowed 130 yards, one offensive touchdown and sacked Raiders starter Matt Flynn in the first half, after which mostly reserves came in.
Lofton, who returned to practice Monday and has a history of back problems, but declined to discuss why they did not play on Friday. They said they see inside linebacker as one of the strengths of New Orleans' defense.
They added they were not surprised by the showing of Humber and Hawthorne, whom he's seen working extra in the film room and after practice. He's been sure to ask as many questions as it takes to nail down their assignments. They also said their maturity is helping them cope better with the speed of the game.
"We're all in our prime," Lofton said. "Football has got to slow down. It slowed down for me and it's starting to slow down for those guys. You can see that in how they played this past week."
The 28-year-old Hawthorne started 10 games last season, but was hampered by left knee and right hamstring injuries and has said they are eager to show they can provide more support to their unit than they did a year ago.
Humber, who started their career in Indianapolis in 2009 and even played against New Orleans in the Super Bowl, joined the Saints in 2010 and has seen much of their work on special teams.
"This year is different," Humber said. "I think this year I came in a little hungrier and little more focused. I'm really just focused on being all I can be out on the field and not just being known as a special teams player."
Humber said they feel comfortable playing either inside linebacker spot. That means he, too, could be a candidate to fill in on the weak side should Vilma's rehabilitation from arthroscopic surgery on their left knee not be complete when the regular season opens on Sept 8.
"Anywhere they need me, I'll play," Humber said. "It doesn't really matter to me, just as long as I get the opportunity to play."
For now, though, Hawthorne is working as the starter in Vilma's spot, and it is not at all clear when Vilma, who has had recurring left knee problems the past two seasons, will be back.
When Payton was asked if they could estimate a timeline for Vilma's return, they responded, "No," and abruptly walked away from reporters.

I've been worrying lately about what happens when we finally achieve a taboo-free, totally unrestrained society, without any barriers, boundaries, insecurities, or oppressions.Will people still read and write fiction? Or will the perfection of our new world sap away our impulse to create, leaving us lazy, diffident, and uninspired?Does censorship and oppression in society drive us to take greater risks and give us the fuel to make masterpieces?Can art only be defined by the evils that direct it?If every truth is acceptable merely by virtue of being true, then how will people learn to lie anymore?Does no more oppression mean no more fiction?The truth about censorship is that censors care more about art than regular people. They are more affected by language and its conflicts, and they lead their lives on the bleeding edge between annihilation and redemption by the artificial.What they read matters. What they hear matters. What they see matters. Censors are the last aesthetes: their world is one where beauty, filth, and sensation are the most important impulses to both revere and deny.In many ways, a dutiful and psychotic censor is the ideal audience. They can still be shocked. They are analyzing your work for deeper meanings and reading "under the surface" for subversive allegory. For a censor to declare a work of art dangerous and to destroy it is the ultimate declaration of love.There is no need to fear censorship or oppression anymore, because with the advent of the "Information Age," it is almost impossible to remove anything. The opposite problem is true: we lose important works in the glut and overload of unskillful pornography.There are no more barriers to entry for publishing, recording, or illustrating. Now, the only apotheosis is to be hated.Creators must embrace and welcome censorship these days, courting detractors just as ardently as they cultivate allies.It is time to admit that censorship is not categorically bad; that it actually highlights the [deleted] it is most trying to [deleted]. Censorship is like medicine for a blemish that makes the blemish glow bright red.

This is the final color version of the cover of the Songes Sketchbook published by Les Humanoides Associés, November 2007. The older file was used instead of this finished version you see here by mistake (not the first time in my career!). If you compare it to the printed version, you will see some subtle differences.This was the original cover for Songes Tome 1 Coraline but was ultimately rejected by the publisher as being "too sexy". Fortunately, Les Humanoides Associés decided to produce a behind the scenes sketchbook collection of art from the book and they were able to "reuse" the cover for this purpose. You can also scene the safer version that was used here-I've always been really happy with how this turned out!Hopefully this "final" version will see the light of day in a new version of the sketchbook.Colored in Photoshop 5 with a Wacom Intuos Graphics Tablet
We thought that the new sub-five-second-to-sixty Golf R, with its 296bhp, was getting close to the limits of a turbo 2.0-litre four cylinders.
But according to the folks at Wolfsburg, that TSI unit has more to give, at least according to the 395bhp Golf R400 that's set to be unveiled at next week's Beijing Auto Show.
It uses the same turbo four as the Golf R, but with output boosted to just a fraction under 200bhp per litre. The Bugatti Veyron's 8.0-litre W16 manages a mere 125bhp of go-per-litre.
Officially the R400 is a concept for now, but VW explicitly states that its bonkers output is ‘plausible' – which is industry-speak for ‘a done deal'.
Want some numbers? How about 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 174mph? IN A GOLF. That 395bhp is fed through the same six-speed dual-clutch transmission, four-wheel drive system and suspension set-up as the new Golf R, a car we felt was able to handle added oomph.
Visually, the R400 takes inspiration from VW's 1988 Rallye Golf G60 homologation special. The arches have been flared by an extra 20mm on each side to accommodate bigger 19-inch wheels and vanes to feed cool air onto the brakes.
Additional aerodynamic appendages have also sprouted, including a front wing, motorsport-inspired diffuser and not one, but two rear wings. There are also bigger, dual exhaust pipes (a throwback to the original R32) and yellow mascara around the headlights to differentiate the R400 from lesser Golfs. By which we mean all the Golfs.
On the inside there is, as you would expect, much carbon and Alcantara, plus deep-dish sporty seats to pin you in place.
But the big question is whether that engine is, to use VW's own term, ‘feasible'. We suspect so. Merc's A45 AMG makes a monstrous 355bhp from a 2.0-litre four, and never when driving it do you suspect it's on the verge of grenading itself. 395bhp, we reckon, is well within VW's grasp.
We'll see R400 in non-sketch form this weekend. So, hot hatch fans: put on some oven gloves, as hot hatches could soon be getting a whole lot hotter. Excited?
appears that all is well with my heart (another appt on Tuesday with Cardiologist) since they have ruled out the really bad stuff and my BP is great. Today marks one week since my last post and some of you may be wondering what is up with that? And I don't blame you. Fact is, I haven't been well this past week – since last Sunday actually. I've been in the ER several times for chest pain and shortness of breath. After multiple tests, itthat all is well with my heart (another appt on Tuesday with Cardiologist) since they have ruled out the really bad stuff and my BP is great.
I am on some medication, but what they really want to see is me adding some healthy carbs back into my diet. I've thought long and hard about how to write this post. I want to make it very clear that it is in no way intended to sway you one way or the other regarding low carb diets. I have felt GREAT doing low carb, and I plan to stick with it, just not as strictly as I have been.
Honestly I'm sure there are days lately that I have been below 20 grams of net carbs, maybe even less than 10, so its possible that my body is rebelling. I have also been lax in taking my supplements so I'm adding those back in and have been feeling better. Anybody else has a similar experience with a strict low carb diet causing problems? Feel free to email me or leave a comment if you have – I'd love to know if I'm not the only one who has this freakish problem. Lastly, I will say this… If you are having palpitations or any other weird symptoms and are on a carb restricted diet (or even if you aren't), don't ignore it. Be seen by a doctor immediately. It's nothing to fool around with and different people have different tolerances to the stress that can result from any kind of dietary restrictions. That is all.
So what does this mean for the blog? Nothing drastic, I promise! I will still be posting sugar free, gluten free, and mostly low carb recipes since that is what I'm eating, but you may also get the occasional recipe featuring quinoa, fruit, and other things you haven't seen here in awhile. My primary source of extra carbs this week has been my green smoothies in the morning and I've really missed them! The good thing is that I can put a lot less fruit in them to make them palatable since even a little bit tastes sweet to me. I am happy to be putting my vitamix back to good use, though I must say the V-dude seemed a bit smug this morning. I could feel the self righteous “How do you like me NOW???” vibes that they were putting off as their powerful blades blended my kale, apple and half a banana into creamy, healthy goodness. I guess he's entitled, I did kind of kick them to the curb since I started strict low carb almost 4 months ago. We hugged it out this morning though and things are all good again.
In other news, I emailed the winner of the gluten free cookie giveaway, (congrats to Jo Anna) but have yet to hear back from them If you are reading this Jo Anna, please please please send me an email by Friday or I'll have to choose another winner which would be a bummer!
Now finally, let's talk about calzone! It's one of my favorite foods! All cheesy and melty and stuff – yum! It's not easy to find a good one though and let's face it, it's all about the filling. There is nothing worse than getting a calzone with two huge knobs of dough on each end and a tiny pocket of cheese in the middle. I usually cut around the bread anyway leaving just the middle part and then slather it with marinara sauce. Nom, nom!
Being on low carb and gluten free, calzone has not been something on my radar in awhile. So I decided to make a LC & GF one, using a version of the dough from the Brazilian and Jamaican hand pies. Rather than serve it with marinara, I had some nice cherry tomatoes – so I made a simple salad of tomatoes, basil, olive oil, salt and pepper – it was nice and fresh tasting. For the filling, I used ricotta, mozzarella, sliced deli ham, and baby spinach. A word of caution though, drain your ricotta first and pre-cook your spinach a bit to get the moisture out. These were delicious fresh but they didn't keep well in the fridge. The next day, the filling had oozed out and made the dough unpleasant so I scrapped them. I didn't precook the spinach, or drain the ricotta and I think it was just too much moisture in it to hold over to the next day. If you are making enough for just one meal, then you should be fine – otherwise, take steps to avoid them getting soggy by draining the ricotta and pre-cooking and drying out your spinach. You can flavor these with whatever you like – the spinach and ham is just what I had on hand and it was delicious!!!
What once looked like an impossibility, came to fruition this evening.
Al Golden is no longer the Head Football Coach at The University of Miami.
Despite numerous assertions by AD Blake James that Golden and their staff would be re-evaluated at the end of the season, a decision was made tonight fresh off the heels of the worst loss in program history.
Assistant coach Larry Scott will serve as the Interim Head Coach for the remainder of the 2015 season.
"Coach Golden has led our program through some very difficult times and they have done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community." James said. "However, we have a proud tradition of excellence at Miami, not just in football but in all sports, and we want to compete for ACC and national championships. I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane Family together and rally behind our young men."
"Got beat from top to bottom," Golden said yesterday after the 58-0 loss to Clemson. "They outplayed us, they out coached us, and I just told the team that's completely my responsibility for not getting them ready to play."
Golden finished their tenure with the 'Canes at 32-25 overall.
They were 0-5 Vs FSU and UM never won the ACC Coastal Division nor a bowl game in their stay.
Their loyalty to long time friend/assistant Mark D'Onofrio probably didn't help things either.
The 'Canes who were once known for defensive ingenuity (who didn't copy Jimmy Johnson's schemes of the 80's and emphasize defensive speed?) were relegated to at best mediocrity on that side of the ball over 5 seasons.
Clemson put up 567 yards including 416 on the ground in Saturday's humiliation.
However, while they never did get over the hump with on field performance, they will forever be credited for navigating the program through the murky waters that were the Nevin Shapiro scandal.
AG also was clearly a caring, classy person.
Who can forget the way they rushed to the field and comforted injured WR Malcolm Lewis 3 seasons back at Georgia Tech?
They also leave the next coach a non bare cupboard. QB Brad Kaaya will be back for at least one more year, and the roster has plenty of good, young playmakers including Chad Thomas, Al-Quadin Muhammad, and Joe Yearby, among others.
These things should not be forgotten.
But bottom line, you have to win and win big to keep your job at a place like the University of Miami.
They didn't even come close.
Some potential candidates for full time replacement include former Miami player/coordinator Rob Chudzinski (currently on the Colts staff), former UM player and current Alabama assistant Mario Cristobal, and former DC/Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano.
Of course Hurricanes fans are hoping that the man who brought the program back from the dead in the 90's, Butch Davis, gets the gig.
Given the issues UNC encountered off the field during their time in Chapel Hill (even if they aren't involved), and the hard feelings from their departure from Coral Gables after the 2000 season, this is likely a long shot.
Given the unexpected ways things have gone down here recently though, anything is possible.
We'll have much more on this story and possible full time replacements in the coming days.
Around 27 million of children in war zones have been forced out of school. UNICEF released an alarming report which shows a surge of attacks and violence against children in war zones in 2017, while all the groups in conflicts ignored international laws designed to protect the most vulnerable.
“Children are being targeted and exposed to attacks and brutal violence in their homes, schools and playgrounds,” said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes. “As these attacks continue year after year, we cannot become numb. Such brutality cannot be the new normal.”
Children have been abused by extremist groups in every possible way, including abduction, enslavement, child marriages, raping. Furthermore, the children are being used as weapons of war on the battlefields, often as human shields or suicide bombers.
Those children are located in major conflicts in Africa and Middle East, and often in these countries is difficult to access to food or other basic needs, and many children are suffering malnutrition.
In 2016 the United Nations documented assaults on hundred of schools and universities, which are being used as barracks, centers of interrogation, weapons depots by troops in conflict countries. In 2015 a document known as Safe Schools Declaration, developed with the help of foreign ministries, defence and education officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross, was presented in an international conference in Oslo with the objective to help victims of those attacks. Many countries signed the document, although important U.N. Security Council's members as the USA, China, UK and Russia refused to cooperate.
In early December, the ACAPS released a report containing alarming prediction for many humanitarian crises going on, and “violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia and Syria next year“.
In Yemen, where there's a devastating civil war on since 2015, the United Nations recorder over 13.000 casualties, with 1.300 children among the dead. In a recent report, Save the Children “highlights how the targeting of medical facilities and personnel in 2015 and 2016 has had devastating impacts on children's health”. The country is experiencing the worst cholera outbreak of modern history, with a million cases expected by the end of 2017 and at least 600,000 children likely to be affected.

Another retail giant is planning to close its doors on Black Friday.
REI, the outdoor co-op, will shut all 149 of its doors on Black Friday. Taking things further than most retailers, REI also plans to not process online sales while still paying all 12,287 employees to take the day off and head outside instead.
The chain is also asking people to join them outside, by using #OptOutside. A network of organizations has already committed to head outside instead of shopping. Many more are expected to join by Black Friday.
They've launched an outdoor activity finder at REI.com/opt-outside to help people reconnect with family and friends this holiday season. Visitors can upload photos, share through social media, discover thousands of trails and parks or get connected with non-profits that flight attendant the outdoors.

But critics identified significant loopholes. North Korea was still able to buy oil and sell its coal and iron ore, as long as it was not used to finance the country's nuclear weapons program — an activity that would be difficult to prove.
Coal and iron ore are North Korea's biggest exports to China, which remains the country's last remaining major trade partner and whose vigorous enforcement is crucial to the success of any sanctions. But Beijing prefers keeping a nuclear-armed North Korea afloat as a buffer against the South and the United States, Seoul's military ally, to risking the collapse of the North's government with too severe enforcement of sanctions, analysts say.
The recent statistics on trade between China and North Korea, as well as news reports from their border, indicate that the Chinese still allow a booming network of trade and smuggling across their 870-mile frontier. North Korea is also accused of running fronts based in China or using Chinese middlemen to circumvent the sanctions.
The resolution in March also did not affect tens of thousands of North Koreans employed in factories, construction projects and logging camps in Africa, China, the Middle East and Russia. Such workers send home $200 million to $300 million a year, most of which, rights groups contend, ends up in the coffers of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.
The resolution also did not affect North Korean factories making clothes on contract for Chinese companies, an arrangement that has become a growing source of income for Mr. Kim's government, especially after the South this year closed an industrial park it had run with the North.
Washington and Seoul said on Tuesday that they would also try to enforce new bilateral sanctions against North Korea. But both have so few trade and other transactions there that their actions would be largely symbolic, analysts said. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and their diplomats have been visiting countries in Africa and elsewhere in recent months to persuade them to curtail trade ties with the North, offering weapons and trade deals as incentives.
Siegfried S. Hecker, an American nuclear expert at Stanford University, said the latest nuclear test by the North must be viewed with great concern, given what they called its growing ability to secure nuclear bomb fuel.
North Korea's capacity to produce plutonium remains limited to 13 pounds, or about one bomb's worth, a year, they wrote in a paper posted on the website 38 North, which focuses on the country. While the nation's capacity to produce highly enriched uranium, an alternative bomb fuel, remained highly uncertain, they said the North could add 330 pounds of it, about six bombs' worth, a year to a current stockpile of perhaps 660 pounds to 880 pounds.
Greece's government has filed a request to cancel the granting of asylum to one of eight Turkish soldiers who fled their country during last year's failed coup attempt.
The move on Saturday came hours after a Greek administrative committee ruled in favour of the man's appeal against their earlier application for asylum.
The committee's ruling angered neighbouring Turkey, which has repeatedly called for the soldiers' extradition, accusing them of having a hand in the putsch bid.
In a statement, Turkey's ministry of foreign affairs called the decision politically motivated and warned that it would affect ties between the two countries.
"Greece failed to show the support and cooperation we expect from an ally in the fight against terrorism by preventing criminals who took part in killing hundreds of Turkish people and targeting the democratic order," the statement said, according to a translation in Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah.
Later on Saturday, the Greek government said that it had filed an appeal against the decision by the administrative committee for asylum requests.
Athens said in a statement that its move was in line with "It's standing position regarding the eight soldiers, as it has been repeatedly and publicly expressed".
Greece's administrative court of appeal will now look into the case.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has previously said their country does not support coup plotters and that its justice system is independent.
The decision on Saturday was not taken by a judicial committee, but an administrative one. It is comprised by two administrative judges of the Greek justice and one representative of the UN's refugee agency, according to Stavroula Tomara, one of the soldiers' lawyers in Greece.
The eight soldiers fled Turkey in a military helicopter and landed in the Greek northeast town of Alexandroupolis during the failed coup on July 15, 2016.

The attempted coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government left more than 240 people dead.
In its ruling on Saturday, the Greek asylum committee ruled that there was no evidence to prove the officer had participated in the attempted putsch, media in Greece reported.
The tribunal is still considering the cases of the other seven fugitive soldiers.
Tomara, the lawyer, welcomed "the excellent, unbiased, impartial Greek judges for their courage and their [bravery] to take such a decision without being driven by any political interests".
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Athens, Tomara said "the grounds for this decision [is] that the soldiers have not participated in any kind of coup".
They said they expected the other seven soldiers to be granted asylum in their cases, as well, which are still pending.

Turkey has repeatedly called on Greece to extradite the officers, but the country's Supreme Court rejected Ankara's extradition request in January.
Up until now, the Greek government had said it could not intervene in the case and must respect the will of the judiciary.
The issue has led to increased tension between Athens and Ankara.
Erdoğan themselves made a request for the officers' extradition earlier this month during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
The Turkish government has accused Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Muslim cleric, of orchestrating the coup. Gulen denies the charges.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday seemed satisfied with a proposed $415 million settlement that would end a lawsuit in which tech workers accused Apple Inc, Google Inc and two other Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to hold down salaries.

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, had previously rejected an earlier $324 million deal as too low. During a hearing on Monday, Koh raised no objections about the size of the settlement as they had at an earlier court session.
While Koh did not formally rule from the bench on whether they would preliminarily approve the new deal, they set another hearing date for final sign off of the $415 million deal.
“We are pleased court indicated they were going to approve the settlement,” Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the workers, said after the hearing.
The plaintiffs alleged that Apple, Google, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc agreed to avoid poaching each other's employees, thus limiting job mobility and, as a result, keeping a lid on salaries.
The antitrust class action lawsuit was filed in 2011. It has been closely watched because of the possibility that big damages might be awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some of the United States' elite tech firms.
The case was based largely on emails in which Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals detailed plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.
Last August, Koh rejected the previous $324.5 million agreement after one of the plaintiffs objected. That worker supports the new deal.
In rejecting the $324.5 million deal, Koh repeatedly referred to a related 2013 settlement involving the Walt Disney Co and Intuit Inc. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less than Disney workers, Koh wrote, even though plaintiff lawyers had “much more leverage” against Apple and Google.
To match the earlier settlement, the deal with Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe would need to total at least $380 million, Koh wrote.

Top executives at Sony Pictures received an email extorting money three days before the company's computer network was taken offline in a major hack.
The email message was among thousands released on Monday when the email boxes of two top Sony executives were leaked online. It was the latest release of potentially embarrassing corporate information following a major hack on the company's computer networks two weeks ago.
"We've got great damage by Sony Pictures," the message began. "The compensation for it, monetary compensation we want."
"Pay the damage, or Sony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole. You know us very well. We never wait long. You'd better behave wisely," it reads.
The email was titled "Notice to Sony Pictures Entertainment" and was sent at 9:44am PST on Nov. 21 from a Gmail account registered in the name "Frank David." It was addressed to five top Sony executives.
The IP address of the sender wasn't visible because Gmail's Web interface appears to have been used to compose the note, but there was one striking detail.
It was not signed in the name of "Guardians of Peace," the name used by hackers who claimed responsibility for the attack, but was signed "From God'sApstls." That text appeared in a different font, as if it had been cut and pasted into the message.
The God'sApstls name was found inside the malware that attacked Sony, said Symantec.
The email files of the two executives were uploaded to file-sharing sites and the Bit Torrent file-sharing network, and links to them were posted in a message that claimed to be from the same hacking group behind the Sony attack.
"We have already given our clear demand to the management team of Sony, however, they have refused to accept," said the message pointing to the files. "We are sending you our warning again."
The hackers said the email boxes belong to Steve Mosko, president of Sony Pictures Television, and Amy Pascal, co-chairperson of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
The Microsoft Outlook mailbox files run to several gigabytes and apparently contain thousands of messages sent to and by both executives over several months.
A handful of the emails, seen by IDG News Service, appear to include discussions between company executives, lists of phone messages that include contact details for executives at other companies, business information, and personal messages to family members.
In one file, the most recent messages point to the email box being copied on the evening of Nov. 22. Sony first learned of the hack on November 24, when computer screens at the company showed a message telling users the network had been hacked.
The release of the email files is another blow to Sony Pictures, which is still attempting to determine who was responsible for the attack on its network. The company has been quiet on the investigation since it launched two weeks ago. Private computer security companies and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations are understood to be spearheading the probe.
An initial leak of corporate data soon after the hack revealed thousands of files stolen from company servers. They included confidential business information, the salaries of Sony Pictures employees, staff medical records and computer passwords.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lenovo N20 Chrome (Image: Lenovo)
Laptop king Lenovo has been producing Chromebooks for the education sector, and they have just announced two models for the consumer space. These include the N20p Chrome with a display that bends back 300 degrees.
Lenovo has a number of Windows laptops with the flex screen, and the new Chromebook with a touch screen is much the same. The display can be rotated back to allow the N20p to form a stand, or tent mode as Lenovo calls it. It does not bend all the way back to form a tablet like the Yoga 11e Chromebook for the education sector.
The N20 Chrome is like the N20p but without touch operation and the flexible display. Both Chromebooks have Intel Celeron processors for fast operation. Lenovo claims they will get up to eight hours on a charge of the battery.
The 11.6-inch display on both Chromebooks has a standard resolution of 1,366 x 768. They also have wi-fi and Bluetooth 4.0, and up to 16GB of internal storage. The N20 and N20p weigh 2.8lbs and 3.1lbs, respectively. Peripherals can be utilized with these ports available: 2 x USB ports, audio in/out, HDMI-out, and a 2-in-1 (SD / MMC) card reader. You can get up to 4GB of memory on either Chromebook. The 1MP webcam is nothing special but sufficient for video calls.
Dimensions (both models): 295 mm x 212 mm x 17.9 mm (11.6 in x 8.34 in x 0.70 in)
Lenovo is the latest major laptop maker to bring Chromebooks to the consumer market. This may be due to the shrinking sales of the Windows laptop, Lenovo's main product line.
The N20 Chrome will be available from Lenovo in July starting at $279 and the N20p in August starting at $329.

BEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will pay official visits to Ethiopia, Nigeria, Angola and Kenya from May 4 to 11.
This is the first time for Li to visit Africa since taking office in 2013.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang said on Wednesday that Li was invited by Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn, President of Nigeria Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of Angola Jose Eduardo dos Santos and President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta.
During their stay in Ethiopia, Li will also visit the headquarters of the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa on May 5 at the invitation of AU rotating Chairperson Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, also president of Mauritania, and Chairperson of the AU Commission Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
While visiting Nigeria, the premier will also attend the 2014 World Economic Forum on Africa to be held in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
Canuck fans and those who cover the team are passionate. They also have short memories.
Flashback to the end of the 2013-14 season. The Canucks finished 5th in the Pacific Division and 25th overall in the league in a season that saw their coach, John Tortorella, suspended and their captain, Henrik Sedin, lead the team in scoring with a paltry 50 points. The season was an absolute disaster and it was the first time the Canucks had missed the playoffs since the 2007-08 season.
On April 7th, 2014, Canucks fans decided to voice their displeasure towards Mike Gillis as a game wound down against the Anaheim Ducks.
We all know the story well by now. Gillis was fired and the Trevor Linden/Jim Benning era began shortly thereafter.
It appears that a season later those who were chanting “Fire Gillis” have now turned their venom towards Benning and Linden.
I find it funny how quickly fan and media sentiment shifts. Don't get me wrong, I'm as puzzled as the next guy by some of the recent Canucks moves, but, in the context of what has gone on in the last few years with the franchise, any reason to be in panic-mode is premature.
On last season…
Jim Benning had a plan last year that they followed to the letter. They felt the core of the Canucks was solid and that this team could get back into the playoffs if surrounded by better depth. Players were added on the periphery and Ryan Miller was brought in to bring some experience at the goaltending position in addition to an already solid, but inexperienced Eddie Lack. The team played a more exciting brand of hockey and overachieved. The Canucks shockingly came 2nd in the division with 101 points and almost every player that slumped the year before reversed their fortunes.
On the playoff loss to the Flames…
Benning felt the core of the Canucks was too good not to give them a chance to go on another run in the playoffs. While the Canucks once again disappointed in a first round loss to the Calgary Flames, even the most cynical of fans had to admit that for a brief moment they could see some scenario where the aging core may have had a chance. After all, the Canucks were matched up against a “dream” first round opponent. We all know what happened and I don't think that was lost on Benning and Linden.
On the Utica Comets…
Benning's mantra was to have the Canucks AHL affiliate Utica Comets be competitive in order to have the Canucks' best young prospects develop in a winning environment. Few can argue that Benning did not deliver to this regard with the Comets losing in the Calder Cup Final to the Manchester Monarchs. When the Comets run finally came to an end, Benning publicly stated that 3-5 current Comets appeared ready to move on to the big club next year.
On the trading of Eddie Lack, Kevin Bieksa, and Zack Kassian…
Much has been talked about the trades involving Lack, Bieksa, and Kassian. These trades in isolation represent the actual value of these players on the market. The trades when viewed together appear to be a brutal return for what many feels is good assets. In reality, the Lack deal is the only one that Benning should have thought twice about consummating.
Lack obviously is not perceived by NHL GMs as a bonafide #1 goalie and the return, a 3rd round pick in the 2015 draft and a 7th in 2016, revealed this. Clearly Lack was more valuable to the Canucks than the rest of the league. Benning should have realized this and simply moved on to try to get a draft pick of some sort for Jacob Markstrom.
Benning got a 2016 2nd round pick for Kevin Bieksa. This was a move borne out of necessity. Bieksa was the obvious choice to move in order to create cap space given the Canucks have many right-handed defence prospects. Benning did well to get a decent pick for next year considering Bieksa held the hammer with a no-trade clause and a demand that a contract extension be agreed upon with whatever team they were dealt to.
Kassian was a move characterized by addition by subtraction. There is little doubt that trading Kassian, along with a 5th round pick in 2016, for Brandon Prust, signalled the Canucks were tired of Kassian's act. The optics of this deal are not good in that many cling to the misguided belief (one that I'll admit I hold) that Kassian has too many tools to not become a force in the NHL. The reality is that the Canucks received a valuable player in Prust that can help out in the short-term and be traded for a future asset at this year's trade deadline.
On the firing of Laurence Gilman, Lorne Henning, and Eric Crawford…
No one should be surprised that Linden decided a year after being in the fold to shed themselves of Mike Gillis' hired guns.
Laurence Gilman, in particular, is widely regarded as one of the smartest negotiators in the league and has shown an expertise in salary cap management. To that end though, do not forget that a lot of the reason Benning has had issues getting value for notable players such as Jason Garrison, Kevin Bieksa, and Ryan Kesler is because of the contracts negotiated by Gilman.
In the Gillis era, the strategy around keeping the salary cap under control was to have good players take less money in exchange for no-trade or limited no-trade clauses. This is great when your team is winning Presidents' Trophies and going on deep playoffs runs. This is a nightmare when you realize the core of your team is not good enough to compete at that level anymore.
This is the reason the trading of Kesler and, to a lesser extent, Bieksa and Garrison got tricky and the return was so mediocre. A year ago much was made of the volume of no-trade and limited no-clauses throughout the Canucks lineup. With the recent firing of Gilman, in particular, this somehow has been forgotten.
On the season ahead and beyond…
"The teams in our division all got better, but we still have a skilled team. We want to be competitive; this is still a playoff team" – JB — Vancouver Canucks (@Canucks) July 1, 2015
Benning has opened up a few spots for some of the younger prospects. Expect to see Frank Corrado, Adam Clendenning, Sven Baertschi, Ronalds Kenins, and Jacob Markstrom all playing significant minutes next year with a chance of players like Jake Virtanen and Alex Grenier also having a chance at making the big club.
The Canucks have a lot of money coming off the books, roughly $14.5M, with expiring contracts after next year so they are in good shape salary cap-wise. Benning has a few assets, in Dan Hamhuis and Radim Vrbata, who are on expiring deals that could fetch high draft picks or prospects at the trade deadline. The Canucks are in the midst of a strip down and rebuild even if Benning and Linden don't want to admit it publicly. They should, and then get on with it.
It is odd how a few trades, two of which pretty much everyone who follows the Canucks knew were coming and a third that many hoped wouldn't come, has changed the perception of the Benning and Linden regime. Let's be honest here. Benning and Linden followed through last year to a tee with what they communicated as their plan. Very little of what they have accomplished so far cannot be seen as an improvement from where the Canucks were when the “Fire Gillis” chants echoed around Rogers Arena. This is obvious when you can remove yourself from focusing on the minutia (insert Lack vs. Miller debate here).
The problem this year isn't really what Benning and Linden are doing, it is what they are saying. The fan-base and media in this town are savvy and don't like to be taken for a fool. The Canucks are in the beginning of a much-needed rebuild and will not make the playoffs next year. I know it, you know it, Benning knows it, and we should all be happy it is happening.
Invite Division
Starting at the very top, the real flying Dutchman, Terifire, was shocked by Leshaka in the second week of play as the Russian player squashed any doubters with respect to their position in the Invite Division. The pair cleanly split the match 1-1, with Leshaka winning evolution 16-4, and Terifire battling to secure a victory on a very tight cpm3a game. Both maps featured game-changing telefrags which shifted momentum from one player to the other, testing each players patience (and sanity). Great games on both accounts and certainly worth watching.

The inaugural season of #cpmduel Leauge kicked off in November, and with three of the five weeks of games completed, we'll take a brief look at what's happened in the different divisions. Before we start, a big thank you to the players for working with the admins to schedule, play and report their matches in a timely fashion.The invite division has seen the best players available in the game go toe-to-toe for the past three weeks, and even though there a group of front-runners who are expected to win the games, there have been a couple of upsets.The main division hosts the largest skill discrepancy between players, and as a result we've had a couple of blow-outs, but generally there have been lots of tight games. That being said the players have demonstrated great skill, with a couple of guys maybe knocking on the door of the Invite Division players.The beginner division has been the most volatile as the wide range of skill, and different levels of engagement, made it difficult to predict before the season started. Three weeks in, and a group of players has separated themselves from the rest.
Looking to prevent illegal entry on Pakistan border, India looks to Israel for help to construct innovative border fence.
The ties between India and Israel are about to get tighter. The Indian government recently raised the proposal to ask for Israeli help in building a ‘smart-fence' similar to the one that separates Israel from Egypt.
India has been concerned recently over the threat of terror attacks coming from terrorists who cross the northern border with Pakistan. The Indian government wants to significantly lower the amount of illegal entry into the country and ministers have been attempting to formulate a plan of action in recent weeks.
The Times of India reported that "In one of these meetings, they discussed whether India can adopt an Israel-type border guarding mechanism along the western frontier," a home ministry official said.
Over the past two years numerous high ranking Indian officials have visited the border between Israel and Egypt and been greatly impressed at the technology which they saw implemented there.
The Times of India also reported that “Israel is hailed to have the best border protection system in the world, and depends more on technology than humans to protect its border.”
The Indian government has reached out to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu regarding the matter, and the Israeli Prime Minister has reportedly responded that Israel will be willing to help India build a security fence that mirrors the Israeli one.
Other countries have also asked Israel for help with regard to fence building technology. Recently, Hungary and Bulgaria turned to Israel for advice on building a fence modeled on the one with Egypt in an effort to keep out asylum seekers.
Additionally, the United States as well as India have sent delegations to Israel in the past to examine the innovations used in the fence which is monitored more by technology than by people.
Hello and welcome to the 82nd installment of the SWD .
Military events/news are listed below by the governorates:
Aleppo:
Jaysh Idlib al-Hurr (Free Idlib Army) destroyed SAA ‘s 23 mm gun position with a TOW missile somewhere in Al-Zahraa area, west Aleppo.
Clashes reportedly erupted between Turkish-backed Free Syrian Police and Islamic State's sleeper cells in Al-Rai close to Turkish border. The cause and outcome of the clashes are unknown for now.
Raqqa:
SDF and IS continue to clash for the fourth day in several districts north of Tabqa.
Homs:
SAA Tiger Forces and Qalamoun Shield Forces are reportedly being transferred from northern Hama towards Palmyra possibly for an upcoming long-awaited offensive aimed at lifting the siege of Deir al-Zour.
IS' SVBIED targeted Al-Rukban (Raqban) refugee camp in the vicinity of Al-Tanf border crossing not so far from Jordanian border. SVBIED detonated near the market and a pickup belonging to Maghwar al-Thawra fighters which have just returned from the front line, two rebel fighters were killed in the attack as well as two civilians.
Rumors were spread about an additional IS' improvised explosive device in the vicinity of Al-Rukban camp causing Maghwar al-Thawra to search for it around the camp. After the attack Jordanian warplanes flew over the area and civilians were asked to stay away from military installations outside the camp.
Deir al-Zour:
SAA captured Electricity Company from IS located between two SAA pockets in Deir al-Zour, after this advance IS' southern supply route to Deir al-Zour city from Jabal Thardah has been cut. IS reportedly lost 13 fighters during this SAA advance.

Damascus:
Rebels repelled the latest SAA attack in Qaboun pocket with Faylaq al-Rahman releasing footage showing one dead SAA soldier.
Yesterday's reports about Jaysh al-Islam fully capturing Arbeen were false as Falyaq al-Rahman and Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham captured it later from the former. After these military developments Jaysh al-Islam released a statement saying that it is stopping its military operations against Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham as it has destroyed it leaving only remnants of it in East Ghouta. Another reason why operations are being stopped is because of civilian safety.
Jaysh al-Islam has overestimated itself and underestimated Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham's and Faylaq al-Rahman's resistance and number of their fighters. Now that its core areas are being threatened Jaysh al-Islam is trying to save face by saying it has completed its goal and pretending to care about greater good, that being well-being of civilians in East Ghouta. If Jaysh al-Islam truly cared about civilians there wouldn't be several incidents involving its fighters firing on demonstrations and in one instance actually wounding one of the protesters.

Margaret Louise Hines (October 1, 1909 – ) is an American voice actor. They were known for their work as a voice artist at Fleischer Studios, where they voiced Olive Oyl in the Popeye the Sailor cartoons from 1939 to 1944.[4]
Career [ edit ]
Hines was the first voice actor for Fleischer's cartoon character Betty Boop, who debuted in the cartoon short Dizzy Dishes in 1930. Max Fleischer hired Hines, as they were a Helen Kane sound-alike, and Kane was the basis for the character. Hines and several other actors voiced Betty until Mae Questel took over the role in 1931.
Beginning in 1932, Hines also did vocals for Aesop's Film Fables produced by Van Beuren Studios. Them Van Beuren credits were erroneously attributed to Bonnie Poe, another actor who'd worked for Fleischer on Betty Boop cartoons.
Mae Questel, who was Fleischer's voice for Betty Boop and Popeye characters Olive Oyl and Swee'Pea during the mid-1930s, was unable to move with the Fleischer Studios staff when they left New York City for Miami. As a result, Hines was hired to replace Questel in both the Betty Boop and Popeye series, beginning in 1938. Hines voiced Betty Boop through their final series entries in 1939, and continued to voice Olive until 1943, when the studio, by then taken over by Paramount Pictures and renamed Famous Studios, returned to New York.[5] The Marry-Go-Round (1943) was Hines' final short as the voice of Olive, with Mae Questel returning to the role in 1944.
Personal life [ edit ]
On March 8, 1939, Hines married their co-star Jack Mercer, who provided the voice of Popeye.[6] The two later divorced.
Spiritually speaking, it is said that even before you were born, the name of your spiritual half has been determined. Each soul has a perfect match… your soulmate.
Although most people think of a soulmate as a perfect harmonious union of bliss, your true spiritual soulmate is the person who is intended to help you “complete yourself.”
Everyone needs someone to help them become a better person. This is not always a blissful experience.
So, if you are brave enough to move away from your romance checklist, open your eyes and your heart to unexpected possiblities, you might just be one of the lucky ones who finds their true soul match.
You know you've found your soulmate when:
1. You just know it.
Something deep inside tells you this is the perfect one for you. It's as if there is a spiritual force pushing you to let go of everything you previously expected and to give of yourself completely.
2. You have crossed paths before.
Soulmates have met each other and a previous time. You may not have connected, but you were in the same place, at the same time. Before my husband and I met, we lived across the street from each other and worked across the street from each other. Yet we never met until the time was right.
3. Your souls meet at the right time.
Each person has to be ready to receive the soul connection. Even though my husband and I were in close proximity of each other for many years, we did not meet until the time was right for both of us. You have to be prepared to meet your soulmate. It could be that you have to go through a relationship that doesn't work out, or that you're not ready to ditch your “perfect person checklist,” but when it comes to soulmates- timing is everything.
4. Your quiet space is a peaceful place.
Being quiet together is comforting like a fluffy down blanket on a cold winter night. Whether you are reading in the same room, or driving in the car, there's a quiet peace between you.
5. You can hear the other person's silent thoughts.
With soulmates, there is such depth to your relationship that you can feel and hear what your partner is thinking, even if it is not verbally expressed.
6. You feel each other's pain.
You stand in each other's shoes. You know each other so well, that the second they walk in the door, you can tell how their day was. You feel each other's feelings: sadness, worry, and stress. And you share each other's happiness and joy.
7. You know each other's flaws and the benefits in them.
Yes, it's true. Our flaws have benefits. Every trait has a positive as well as a negative side. It's the task of each person to always look for the good, even when things don't look so good. There is usually a benefit to each flaw. Stubborn people are good decision makers. Overly organized people are great at paying bills on time.
8. You share the same life goals.
You're both on the same page with values, ethics, and goals. You may have a different way of reaching those goals, but you both want the same end result.
9. You're not afraid of having a conversation.
Conversations can be challenging. Expressing concerns or attempting to make decisions is uncomfortable. Soulmates know that if they join together, they will be able to work it out.
10. You are not threatened by the need for alone time.
Whether it's tennis three times a week or girls' night out, you respect each other's need for independence, knowing that when you get together, your time alone is special.
11. You don't experience jealousy.
Pretty girls at the office or handsome personal trainers aren't a threat to your relationship.You are secure knowing that you are the only one.
12. You respect each other's differences and opinions.
You know you have different opinions. Often soulmates are polar opposite. At times this is challenging. These are the times when you are being forced to let the other person complete you. You still have your own opinion, but instead of agreeing to disagree, there is a deep level of respect for each other. You listen and honor the differences.
13. You don't scream, curse, or threaten each other with breaking up.
Of course you feel the anger. People unintentionally hurt each other. But soulmates aren't nasty, hurtful, or punitive.
14. You give in because you want to make your partner happy.
Giving can often occur in unhealthy, co-dependent, or abusive relationships. But soulmates give to each other for the sole purpose of making each other happy.
15. You know how to apologize.
It's not easy to say “I'm sorry” or admit that you did something that hurt the person you love. Soulmates realize that their actions or words cause harm. Even if they feel justified in their point of view, if their partner was hurt by it, they can easily apologize for the harm they have caused.
16. You would like to meet each other again and again.
You know this is the one and only one for you. Even through the tough times, you would choose your partner again. You feel a sense of pride in your partner.
17. You complete each other.
Yes, I'm sorry to say it but, your partner fills in your blanks. No person is perfect. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Soulmates complete each other. It's the yin and yang of perfect harmony. One person may be the extrovert, while one is the introvert. One may be social, while the other a homebody. Soulmates are often opposite that are attracted to a person who has their missing pieces.
18.Being in each other's arms washes away all your stress, worries, and anxiety.
There is no place you'd rather be at the end of the day but in each other's arms. If you had a rough day filled with disagreements, a fight with your boss or if you missed the train, whatever happened is gone the second you cuddle up together. There is a warmth in your heart, an inner peace you can feel. No words need to be spoken. All that exists is the silent, blissful union of two souls together. Two souls that were meant to be together eternally.
Alright, it's the first Thursday of the month and that means we're back with another comic. The great André Stahlschmidt (check out more of their work here and here) is on art chores this time and they absolutely killed it. Just look at that first page. The detail that they cram into each and every panel is obscene.
In other news – I'll be at Thought Bubble in Leeds this weekend and I'll also be at the pre con Pints and Pencils at the Nation of Shopkeepers. So, if you want to hang out and see exactly how garbage I am at drawing, come along.
I'm not tabling during the con proper but I'll probably end up in a pub at some point so I'll throw up a tweet (@jedmcpherson) with a location in case you want to hang out.
Oh and as always, if you could tell your friends and share on social media, I'd appreciate it. The more readers we get the longer we can keep doing this.
This guy, again?

The first rule of phoning-a-friend—in the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire context—is you really need to give your brain trust a heads-up about when the show is taping. When your alleged friend is the leader of a country, you might want to submit that heads up a bit earlier than usual.
German politician Wolfgang Bosbach learned this the hard way. Bosbach, a member of parliament, was a contestant on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and had managed to win 125,000 euros using their own brainpower, but when facing the 500,000 euro stumpers, they decided they need to phone in some intellectual support. Bosbach chose to dial up German Chancellor Angela Merkel to see if they could help.
The question: why was the East German WM66 washing machine legendary? The answer, by the way, is because people also used the washing machine to stew fruit in, according to the BBC. Bosbach hoped Merkel, who is a member of the same political party and grew up in that part of the country, might lend a helping hand, but all they got on air was the leader of Germany's voicemail. Twice.
At the end of the show, Bosbach got a text message from Merkel, who was clearly screening their calls, saying: “Ok whatever it was, warm greetings from am.”
A new challenger appears! Hail, and well met!
Seej is a game with four core rules:
1. Topple your opponent's flags to win.
2. Players must agree on the models used in the battle.
3. Keep it friendly.
4. Show no mercy.
Seej is an Open Source tabletop wargame designed to advance the state of 3D printing through competition and player-directed evolution. Players print their own armaments and fortifications for use in battle. If you can print it, it's legal to use in the game.
The rules to Seej are open source and infinitely expandable. Seej is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.
At a minimum, you'll need to download and print the Seej 2013 starter set. It contains flags, catapults, and two kinds of bloxen. (You can still download the original starter set for archaeological purposes.)
Print two sets, find an opponent, and have fun storming the castle!
There's a wide assortment of additional Seej engines, bloxen, and accessories in The Forge.
These models are free to download and print. They are also distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, so players are free to modify and remix them for their own games.
Pick-up game:
Players start with three flags, 10 pennies, as many blocks as they like, and at least one siege engine. Try to keep the sides evenly matched. (See Core Rule #3.)
Players agree on a battlefield size. About 1m apart seems to be the right distance for playing with the Zheng3 Penny Catapult. Each player builds a castle and places flags.
Flip a coin to see who goes first.
Players take turns firing projectiles at their opponent's castle. The first player to topple all three enemy flags wins the game.
Be safe! Although you're unlikely to injure anyone with the Zheng3 Penny Catapult, the Zheng3 Penny Ballista can do some real damage to soft tissues. Wear eye protection, or better yet, fearlessly face down your enemies with one of these.
This might be a bit much.
Philosophy
Good design, good engineering, and good luck are the three pillars upon which a Seej victory is built. Design your Seej engines well, for your opponents are busy forging superior fortifications in OpenSCAD and SketchUp.
Expanded Rules and Recommendations:
Players may not touch the enemy's models. Projectiles must be launched from a siege engine: no throwing, dropping, spitting, or otherwise directly involving a human in the siege.
Once a projectile has been fired it's considered out of play. Keep your unspent ammunition separate from the battlefield to avoid confusion. Play with a backstop to keep projectiles from getting lost.
In the event of a tie, pick up spent projectiles and use them to continue the game. First player to topple an opponent's flag wins.
No flag may be placed more than 2 block lengths from the leading edge of your castle's wall. This rule is to prevent smarty-pantses from hiding a flag behind a bookcase.
Strongly suggested: Castle walls should be made of interlocking blocks no larger than 5x3x3 cm. Blocks should fit together loosely enough to give the opponent a sporting chance of destroying a wall with a 10-penny bombardment. (See Core Rule #3.)
Seej engines can be picked up and moved anywhere behind the line created by the leading edge of your structure.
Flags toppled by out-of-game events (seismic activity, strong winds, acts of Dog, etc) may be righted without penalty.
Add or remove as many house rules as you like, as long as all players agree to them before the coin toss. If a rule survives a few games, post it here.

Blatant and subtle forms of anti-Semitism are heating up on American college campuses for over a decade. But for the past two years, a Jewish-Israeli voice for tolerance has begun a counter-effort at the meetings of the UC Regents, the governing body of the University of California.
“When I first stepped onto UCLA's campus, I came from a community where I didn't meet a lot of critics of Israel,” says Student Regent Abraham “Avi” Oved.
Oved describes themselves as a “Jewish Israeli American” from the heavily Jewish San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County.

“I was interacting with political ideologies who wanted to politicize my identity and make a controversy about it,” they say.
Now, at age 23, the student regent completes their tenure at the end of this month and graduates June 9 from UCLA with a bachelor's degree in economics and global studies.
Their two-year appointment to the UC's governing leadership, which they landed amid stiff statewide competition, has not been without controversy.
In some ways, that tension has helped publicly underscore a platform to improve and protect students from what some consider growing intolerance within this system of leading public universities, which includes UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Irvine and six other campuses throughout the Golden State.
“The Jewish community at UCLA is incredibly strong. Don't let the headlines fool you,” Oved says. “I was just at the right place at the right time when this issue came up, shedding light on anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism and a lot of other ‘isms' that deserve attention and response.”
Although Oved's appointment drew attention on campus and in the media, it did not hinder their achievements, which include helping pass new anti-bias policy.
“I actually have not paid to close attention to what detractors say because that is just a waste of my time. I haven't really looked into or read into it,” Oved says. “I have earned the respect of a lot of people who doubted my ability to serve in this capacity and proved my ability to work across communities and across issues and I feel so happy and fulfilled with my term.”
In fact, Oved's call for tolerance became an important part of their tenure. Although their role concludes June 31, that does not mean the end of their influence. The regents recently adopted a policy statement on Principles Against Intolerance that includes language specifically addressing anti-Semitism on campus.
“The Statement of Principles against intolerance is the UC anti-bias, bigotry and discrimination policy,” Oved says.
‘The Jewish community at UCLA is incredibly strong. Don't let the headlines fool you'
“Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism and other forms of discrimination have no place at the University of California,” the policy statement reads. “Most members of the University community agree with this conclusion and would agree further that the University should strive to create an equal learning environment for all students.”
The efforts of the spreading Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement have not gone unnoticed by Oved.
“The BDS movement is a thinly-veiled attempt to target and scapegoat Israel for the consequences of conflict,” they say. “We should not be afraid of criticism of Israel and its government's policies, but we cannot allow for movements to wrongly rewrite history and facts and further employ anti-Semitic tropes to the only Jewish state.”
In their two-year term as regent, first as a non-voting regent designate in training shadowing their future position, and then as a voting student regent, Oved's outward symbolism distinguished them publicly. Oved does not consider themselves devoutly observant, but their Star of David necklace, the iconic “I heart Israel” sticker on their laptop and their UCLA logo kippa were overt expressions of their pride in their Jewish heritage.
As they explain, “It goes along the same vein as the Magen David that I wear — its very visible about my Jewish identity. I felt like it was very important for me to highlight.”
Oved sought to publicly express their sentiments for others. “It's okay to wear a kippa. It's okay to have an ‘I love Israel' sticker on your computer,” they say.
After an attack on a Jewish woman in Europe, for instance, Oved's official statement at a Regents' meeting described their mother's suggestion to perhaps remove their necklace. Instead, they proudly insisted on displaying their necklace as a call for tolerance for all students in their great diversity, Jewish, Arab, and from every other nation.
“If I'm the first Jewish person someone is going to meet I want to be the best representation of a Jewish Israeli American and the values of my community. And I want people to take away positive aspects of interacting with Jewish people, Israel, Zionism,” Oved says. “I want it to be a positive takeaway for them to influence the culture around us for the better.”
Oved's personal background naturally plays a critical influence on their outlook. Their father is Iraqi; Oved cites rising anti-Semitism in Iraq as the impetus behind their father's family immigrated to pre-state Israel in the 1930s. Oved grew up in a Hebrew-speaking home with two older sisters in Encino, California with frequent trips to Israel most summers. Their Tel Avivi mother raised them as a single parent.
“Since preschool my mom has been very involved,” says Oved.
They attended their first and last meetings as a regent, and their first vote.
‘It's okay to wear a kippa. It's okay to have an I love Israel sticker on your computer'
“She's the one who really raised me and emphasized a higher education. So they were really involved in my schooling,” Oved says. “All my teachers knew them and the same for the Regents.”
As part of their student regent platform, Oved has gained support for adding a student advisor to the university's governing board. The regents legislate policy for the renowned public research institution's more than 238,000 students across 10 campuses.
Oved's plan has since won approval to operate on a pilot basis in July, 2017. “I'm fleshing out the policy and the application of it,” Oved says.
Another goal of Oved's term was addressing middle income affordability. A state middle-class scholarship is relatively new. Begun in 2014, it is being fully implemented in 2017.
“Basically what we are trying to do is bring all the UC campuses to a baseline of support for middle income students and look at the data to see if middle income students are being squeezed out,” Oved says.
After graduation and a family vacation in Asia, Oved plans to join a Democratic political consulting firm.
LA-based SKDKnickerbocker covers “everything from campaign strategy to rebranding organizations and institutions,” Oved says. “It's a great spectrum of work.”
They also seek to earn a law degree.
“I just need to find a school to accept me,” they say.
Although Oved attended their last official meetings as a voting member of the UC Regents from May 10 to 12, they plan to continue their involvement as the system implements the pilot student advisor program. They also continue to serve as a voluntary member of UCLA's Hillel Board of Directors, where they have served since January.
During their studies, Oved also completed a leadership internship at Hillel, which they joined when they first arrived on campus, as well as another internship at AIPAC.
Oved hopes their days as student regent promote lasting change toward improving a more tolerant campus climate.
“I am honored that I had the privilege of answering the call of my community in this position and this platform,” Oved says. “I hope we have made a collective impact and that it will create a constructive conversation moving forward.”
‘I am honored that I had the privilege of answering the call of my community'
This tone of idealism, cautious optimism, and working towards the collective good could be found in Oved's statement after a tragic campus shooting took the life of university professor William S. Klug on Wednesday, June 1.
Oved expressed sorrow over the tragedy, but also appreciation for widespread acts of selflessness coming from across the student body.
“Yesterday, darkness hovered over UCLA and our community,” the statement reads, “…but through that darkness, there was an impenetrable force of love and light that radiated from each Bruin… I'm so incredibly grateful for and proud of our community's character and integrity, and know for certain that our resiliency is what will carry us through.”
This means your monthly news-letter, your referral emails, your weekly coupon messages, your SMS campaigns, and any other commercial communication to an electronic address falls under this act. The penalties for violating this act are very severe. You could be fined up to $1 million as an individual or $10 million as a company, and the public can sue you for $200 per message received (though public redress doesn't kick in until 2017.)
Got your attention now?
In fact, in my opinion this legislation is going to affect standard commercial email messages far more than any actual spam long-term. It's a very radical law that fundamentally changes how companies can communicate with their customer base online.
Here's what you need to know about this act so you can stay compliant.
Commercial Electronic Messages
If your message is encouraging someone to participate in commercial activity, even if the motive of profit isn't a part of the message, then you're sending a commercial marketing message. The law doesn't stop you from sending these messages, but it sets very clear guidelines on what has to be included in such a message. Commercial marketing messages must have:
Consent
Identification information
An unsubscribed mechanism
Consent is the trickiest one to maintain. The onus is on you to prove that you have received consent, written or oral, that you can send a commercial marketing message to an address. This consent must be opt-in meaning you are expressly agreeing to receive messages, must be clearly labeled, and cannot be bundled in with another consent clause. To give you a flavor of how onerous this law really is, if you have a tagline in a message that promotes a product or service that encourages the recipient to purchase that product or service it would make the message a CEM. Folks, logic has left the building when we feel taglines are invading people's privacy.
You need separate consent checkboxes for the following acts:
The sending of commercial marketing messages
The alteration of transmission data in electronic messages in the course of commercial activity.
The installation of a program on another person's computer in the course of commercial activity.
The company must record the date, time, purpose, and manner the consent was gathered as well. It's a lot of information, and you may require outside assistance to make sure all your bases are covered, especially in B2B companies.
You also need to provide identification information with every email. The message must clearly identify the sender and include a valid mailing address. While people who send messages on behalf of another company do not need to add their information, if a message is sent on behalf of multiple people all individuals must be identified. This information can be placed on a webpage with a link in the message to the identifying information, and the address must be valid for at least 60 days after the message is sent. This information must also be in your consent forms.
Finally, you need a clear unsubscribe mechanism in your messages so that people who do not want your marketing can remove consent. This mechanism must be consumer-friendly, “readily performed”, and can be accessed without difficulty or delay. Examples given by the government include a link in an email leading to a clear webpage that gives an unsubscribe option, or having someone reply to an SMS message with the word “STOP”.
A small bit of good news
Thankfully, there is a grace period for businesses to comply. For the next 36 months, consent is assumed to be there in commercial messages where there is an existing business or non-business relationship. However, if someone does remove consent during this period then communication must cease. This gives businesses time to gather consent information from their current contact lists. After the grace period ceases, consent must be gathered.
Unfortunately, this is going to be very, very, messy. Customers are going to start receiving a ton of these consent messages from all sorts of companies, and I'm pretty sure we'll start seeing what I like to call “consent fatigue” over the coming months. Business might find that the customers they can send a message to shrinks dramatically. No more marketing messages, no more new business. It's really like trying to stop drunk driving by ripping up all the highways.
Unfortunately, this is the legal climate we're operating in. That means that the time to start generating a consent database is now. . We have been preparing for this act for some time, and we have the knowledge to comply with CASL.

A controversial social services provider that operates Canada's only supervised drug injection centre and runs dozens more projects in Vancouver's poverty-stricken Downtown Eastside appears headed for involuntary receivership and a possible court battle with the B.C. government, because of concerns over its “spending practices” and financial “irregularities.”
Steps are being taken to “protect provincial assets” including hundreds of social housing units owned by B.C. Crown corporations and managed by the PHS Community Services Society, a registered charity that grew from a single residential facility in 1993 to a $28-million-a-year, taxpayer-funded operation with more than 300 full-time employees.
The province will make an announcement regarding the PHS and its future sometime in the next few days, several government sources confirmed. One possible outcome is the removal of the society's executive staff and board, with its operations placed under the direction of new management.
Also known as the Portland Hotel Society, the PHS serves thousands of Downtown Eastside (DTES) and area residents suffering from mental illness, drug addiction, infectious disease and other problems. Its activities have expanded in recent years to crack-pipe vending, food sales and catering, even beekeeping. But the society is best known for operating Insite, the intravenous drug facility it opened for temporary “scientific and research purposes” in 2003.
Insite became a permanent DTES fixture after the PHS and several drug users won a series of legal battles with the federal government, which wanted the tax-funded shooting gallery shut down.
The PHS also operates mobile needle exchanges and recently began offering alcoholics the opportunity to make their own booze.
Problems surfaced publicly in November, following a routine audit conducted by B.C. Housing, the province's Crown corporation responsible for subsidized housing. The corporation announced it had “discovered some irregularities in the Portland Hotel Society's spending practices,” and had hired accounting giant Deloitte LLP to conduct an independent financial review. A separate review was conducted by Vancouver Coastal Health, the public agency that oversees delivery of health services in the DTES.
Last week, B.C.'s deputy premier and minister responsible for housing, Rich Coleman, told reporters their government had examined the two reviews. They raised “significant concerns that we're going to work through in the next week or 10 days, and [the government will] make some final decisions on how we'll manage it going forward.”
Mr. Coleman said that forcing the PHS into receivership was “one of the options.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a well-placed government source says the province is looking at two scenarios: removing the society's upper management and appointing a receiver to run its affairs, and filing a lawsuit against the PHS in an attempt to recover public funds. The province will decide on one option or both, the source indicated.
Contrary to earlier media reports, police have not been asked to investigate the PHS. There is no suggestion of criminal activities. Insite is not a “core” area of concern, according to a government source.
Rumours of questionable spending by PHS insiders on non-essential services such as limousine rides and entertainment have circulated for years in the DTES. The society successfully fought off attempts by one local newspaper to have its financial accounting made public, claiming that while most of its annual funding comes from taxpayers, opening its books to the taxpayers would jeopardize its competitive position in the DTES.
The PHS is the largest non-profit service provider in the neighbourhood, and its senior managers are among the industry's highest paid. According to financial information it filed with the Canada Revenue Agency for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, the PHS paid six staff members between $120,000 and $159,000 each. Total “expenditure on all compensation” was $15,289,078, more than half the society's total revenues (not including $6-million from a disposition of assets) in fiscal 2013.
The PHS reported it spent another $358,724 on travel expenses that year, and $398,794 on professional and consulting fees.
The province gave the PHS $18.7-million and the federal government contributed $2.27-million in 2013.
In an email sent Wednesday to the National Post, PHS co-executive director Mark Townsend said they had not spoken to Mr. Coleman, and was “not aware of any allegation of anyone here benefiting at the expense of our clients.” They said they are proud of the society's work, adding that “all projects and programs are fully audited by our external auditors each year. What we do know is that our lack of administrative systems have left us vulnerable to being misunderstood. We're doing our best to work through those issues with our funders.”
Jack Bibby, president of the PSA's board of directors, is away from their workplace for “the next several days,” said their colleague. They did not reply to a message left on their voice mail. Asked if the PHS was being forced into receivership, the board's secretary-treasurer, Cordell Draayer, said they wanted to comment, but could not.
The case is not without precedent. In 2010, B.C. Housing and the Provincial Rental Housing Corporation filed suit against a smaller non-profit housing society operating in the DTES, accusing it of negligence, financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, misrepresentations and breaches of fiduciary duty.
The Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA) controlled almost 300 publicly owned apartment units in the neighbourhood until a court-appointed receiver manager took charge of the properties. The province and DERA negotiated a confidential out-of-court settlement that ended the lawsuit, and the 37-year-old society was disbanded.
The PHS is much larger and more firmly entrenched, with assets of almost $60-million. According to its public filings to Canada Revenue Agency, the society's ambitions now reach overseas, with employees spending $90,000 in the last fiscal year on activities abroad. The precise nature of those activities are not described in the filings.

It's time to celebrate what a wild, wonderful, woozy season Joey Votto is having
With Canadian blood running through him, the most perfectly sculpted eyebrows in baseball and a batting eye more patient than a mother with quintuplet toddlers, you could be forgiven for not realizing that Joey Votto ever went away.
But after struggling through injuries in 2014, playing in only 62 games and posting a career low .799 OPS (thanks to, once again, an amazing .390 OBP), Votto is back at it again this year.
After starting the year well, Votto went through a bit of a slump. Still, heading into July, they were hitting .284/.398/.498 with 14 HRs. Not bad numbers by any means, but not the kind of thing that inspires epic poems gushed out in your honor.
But since the beginning of July, Votto is an unstoppable human being. The first baseman is hitting .353/.529/.633 with 14 HRs, looking every bit like the hitter who won the MVP in 2010. In fact -- they may be even better than that season: Their 178 OPS+ is a career high, and they rank second in wOBA and wRC+ and fourth in fWAR. If you don't want to look up all those acronyms (those are weighted metrics that take into account their friendly home ballpark), know that it means he's doing very, very, very well.
How's they doing it? Why are they so good? And how do they get those perfectly sculpted eyebrows to look just that sharp?
While we may never have the answer to life's deepest questions like that, let's look back at their marvelous season.
All stats as of Sept. 20
Theirs is the Eye of Sauron
Sorry to pitchers (and Lord of the Rings fans), but the real all-seeing eye belongs to Votto. Here's a man who has somehow been gifted with the greatest ability to see the minute differences between ball and strike, rarely reaching outside the strike zone to offer at a pitch they don't like.
After all, while Votto is second in the Majors in pitches per plate appearance with 4.30 (third behind only Mike Trout and Curtis Granderson) they also swing at fewer balls out of the strike zone than anyone else. Their 19.4 percent swing rate at pitches outside of the zone is the lowest in the Majors, just beating out the highly selective Carlos Santana.
This means there are lots of at-bats where they show off their precise batting eye, such as this one back in May. Sure, there were only three balls instead of the traditional four on this particular example, but considering how good their eye is, the umpire probably wondered what was the point of fighting the inevitable:
Opposite-field dingers are their forte
Of course, when they do swing the bat, they find plenty of success -- even though they do it in their own way. After all, in baseball's vast history, it's been known that power hitters tend to pull their home runs. Sure, there are big, strong, players with the ability to lumber balls out over the opposite field, but look to their spray chart and their pull side is full of dingers.
Not so for Votto.
While the first baseman has been using the opposite field the least in their career, spraying balls there only 26 percent of the time, 11 of their 28 home runs have been to left field, with only eight going to the pull side.
They're not cheap, scraping-the-top-of-the-wall shots, either.
98 percent weakness-free!
Of course, it's hard to pitch to Votto when they can pretty much destroy whatever you throw to him. According to Fangraphs' weighted pitch values, the first baseman is the fifth-best Major Leaguer when facing fastballs -- which they tend to hit like this:

Or, against changeups, where they rank seventh-best:

Or, perhaps you'd rather try and get a curveball past him. COME ON, ARE YOU NOT PAYING ATTENTION HERE?! He's the fifth-best in the Majors when batting against curveballs.

When they make contact, it's going to be a hit
Of course, when he's not creating their own force-field around the plate or blasting the ball over the fence (his 28 HRs are their most in a season since 2011), they still find a way of getting on base -- even when they make contact,.
With a gorgeous, level swing that is seemingly designed for spraying line drives, Votto has a career .356 BABIP, the 5th-highest all-time for players with at least 3,000 plate appearances.
And while high BABIPs are usually the result of hitting the ball hard and having a killer set of wheels (and just a little bit of luck), speed is maybe the one thing Votto doesn't do well -- reaching double-digits in steals only once. Before this year, at least.
That's right. At the age of 32, Votto has added speed back into their game, swiping 11 bags on the season. It also means he's wearing new, tighter pants:
Of course, when they hit the ball like this, what's the point in having speed? No need to leg this one out.
Your browser does not support iframes.
While their BABIP may not remain so astronomically high for the rest of their playing days, power and patience are traditionally considered traits that age best. Meaning that it's quite likely that Joey Votto will still be drawing walks when the next Age of Aquarius begins.

In the world of a constantly changing oil and gas environment, the Montney shale basin is the sleeping giant that holds the key to accelerating Canada's shale oil and gas boom, but the real treasure within this giant is a tight liquids-rich zone (approximately 15-20 miles wide) that has big and small players alike narrowing their focus for the potential of a giant payout.
A pervasive hydrocarbon system in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) in Alberta and British Columbia, the Montney is estimated to hold 2,200 trillion cubic feet of gas, almost 29 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and over 136 billion barrels of oil. But it is the tight liquids rich fairway (approximately 15-20 miles wide) that contains high concentrations of both free condensate and natural gas liquids that everyone is pursuing in what may very soon be one of the largest commercially viable plays in the world.
Investors aren't exactly shying away from the challenge, and the overall trend within this large basin is a shift toward liquids-rich areas, which is what the Middle Montney (the middle portion of the Montney resource) is all about.
Initially, companies targeted the Upper Montney, and the entire formation was viewed more as a dry gas play with high productivity and immense gas in place. Through the technological advances that have begun to move up to Canada and a general de-risking of the play, the Middle Montney is proving that there is a very large liquids-rich fairway available with a potential for incredible returns and economics.
Canadian supermajor Encana (NYSE:ECA)—a Montney shale heavyweight—is focusing its drilling to the east of the formation. Last year, Encana announced it would spend over 25 percent of its capex for 2014 on the Montney, and the liquids-rich plays in the eastern area will get the lion's share of this, with 80-85 new wells planned for this year alone.
There are also a number of growing mid-cap players and one micro-cap honing in on this liquids-rich scene and benefiting from supermajor drilling, including mid-cap NuVista and micro-cap Blackbird Energy.
Earlier this month, NuVista signed a deal to purchase another 12.5 gross sections of undeveloped land in the Montney's liquids-rich zone, which puts its total at over 220 gross sections, while Blackbird has 117 sections of multi-zone Montney rights—again, with a focus on the liquids-rich zone.
It's a very fast-paced game of follow the leader.
When Encana drilled a well in a previously unproven Middle Montney area and came up with two very economic middle Montney wells that both had condensate gas ratios of approximately 100 barrels of oil per million feet of gas, Navistar responded by immediately buying up land in the vicinity, driving prices up over $2.9 million per section. Blackbird followed suit, capturing a 36-section land position right between Shell and Encana and next to NuVista, which drilled a well with 2,195 boe/d.
And while there is still land available here, prices are rising fast, which makes the situation interesting for the small player like Blackbird Energy, which finds that its land value alone is higher than its current market cap.
Explorers and producers are surrounding the Middle Montney in a pincer movement, and liquids-rich sweet spots are shaping up to be the key to unlocking this next North American treasure chest. And the end of the day, the amount of shale gas under Montney's surface would be enough to supply Canada's needs for 145 years, making it one of the top basins in the world, outdone only by Qatar.
KOCHI: A member of a scheduled caste or tribe (SC/ST) who had converted to Christianity from Hinduism can claim the rights and benefits available to SC/ST members if they reconvert, the Kerala High Court has held.The court's decision assumes much significance in the backdrop of ‘Ghar Wapsi' reconversion campaign introduced by the Hindu right-wing group Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) last year. Earlier this month, VHP had claimed that it had reconverted over 33,000 persons and had ‘prevented' over 48,000 conversions.It was a petition filed by a father and daughter whose forefathers belonged to Hindu Cheramar community that was considered by the court. Those who approached the court were 46-year-old MA Chandraboss of Ramapuram in Kottayam and their 18-year-old daughter Alida. They were born as Christians as Chandraboss' father had converted to Christianity. In 2009, Chandraboss and their family reconverted to Hinduism by undergoing ‘Shudhi Karma' under the auspices of Arya Samaj.Chandraboss' daughter Alida appeared for the common entrance examination this year and sought admission in the SC/ST quota. However, their claim to SC/ST quota was rejected on the basis of an anthropological report by a state government agency named Kerala Institute for Research, Training and Development Studies (KIRTADS). An appeal filed before the government against this also came to be dismissed.At the high court, their counsel G Krishnakumar argued that though they had converted to Christianity, they retained the essential character of the caste to which they belonged and suffered the disabilities and disadvantages of other members of their caste.Opposing the claim, state government submitted that the petitioners, having born into Christianity and having lived as Christians till their reconversion, are to be treated as Christians and not as a scheduled caste member. It is a conversion of convenience, the government counsel argued.Ruling in favour of the petitioners, justice K Vinod Chandran held, "The 2nd petitioners (Chandraboss' daughter) definitely was brought up in their father's house, may be as a Christian, but a Christian-Cheramar. There being generally no accepted caste discrimination in Christianity, the identity in the Cheramar community was essentially retained."The court further said in the judgment, "It is to be noticed that Christianity, as it is generally understood, does not have any caste discrimination and the very fact that the 1st and 2nd petitioners (Chandraboss and their daughter) were all along issued with community certificates as belonging to Christian-Cheramar would indicate that they had their origin in the Hindu-Cheramar community. Considering the question of a Christian convert reconverted to Hinduism, this court in Ponnamma's case (Ponnamma vs Regional Director, 1983) held that the child of parents who (had) converted to Christianity at the time of the birth of the child, could always convert back to Hinduism and claim the rights of the caste of their forefathers once they convert back to Hinduism. The rights of a child born as a Christian, to Schedule Caste parents who converted to Christianity, to reconvert to Hinduism and claim the rights available to a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe, was affirmed by the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court."
In their new book The Healing of America, the journalist T.R. Reid employs a clever device for surveying the world's health systems: They take an old shoulder injury to doctors in various countries. In the United States, a top orthopedist recommends a major joint-replacement operation, costing tens of thousands of dollars. In France and Germany, general practitioners offer them the same surgical option, at little or no cost, but steer them instead toward a regimen of physical therapy. In Britain, the doctor is unimpressed with their injury and tells them to go home. In Canada, they are offered a place in line, where they will wait a year just to consult a specialist. In India, they are sent to an ayurvedic clinic, where they are treated, quite effectively, with herbs, massage, and meditation.
America's system has become wildly unfair and expensive. In fixing it, Reid says, we should follow other countries where health care is fairer, cheaper, and produces better results. He's right that we can learn much from practices elsewhere—why, for instance, can't we have those nifty smart cards the French use instead of paper records? But the lesson I took away from Reid's book was somewhat different: Health care systems are not just policy choices but expressions of national character and values. The alternatives they describe work better than ours not just because they're well-designed and competently managed but because they reflect the expectations and traditions of their societies.
All advanced, wealthy countries have structures that are more egalitarian and cost-effective than ours. Each also has its quirks, which tend to reinforce familiar stereotypes. Britain, land of the stiff upper lip, rations care explicitly, providing what to us would seem shockingly minimalist treatment. It doesn't cover many procedures we regard as standard, such as PSA tests for men in their 50s or even regular physical exams for adults. That's what you get when you spend 8 percent of your GDP on health care (versus our 16 percent). The Japanese, on the other hand, venerate doctors and visit them 14.5 times per year on average, three times the U.S. rate. They do this in an orderly, ritualized way, usually bringing a bottle of sake or cash in an envelope as a gratuity.
America's evolved, undesigned system is also an expression of our culture at its best and it worst. Health care in the United States is innovative, entrepreneurial, expensive, litigious, and wasteful. It is decentralized, driven by self-interest, excellent at the high end, and increasingly unequal. It resists acknowledging trade-offs or limits and is characterized by shocking gaps in basic care. As we plunge into a long-overdue comprehensive overhaul, it's useful to think not just about how we can build on what work s in this hodgepodge but about how we can bring health care into better alignment with our own national identity. In reforming our system, we need to create something that is “more like us,” in the phrase of the journalist James Fallows—not more like what the French, Finns, or Swiss have, as appealing as that might sound.
The current system of American health care is at odds with America's character in three fundamental respects: moral, economic, and sociological. Morally speaking, Americans are surely more accepting of economic inequality than their European brethren. But the random unfairness that condemns the uninsured to bad health and the risk of untimely death offends the social conscience. There is a general consensus among nearly all supporters of change that we need to move strongly in the direction of universal coverage. On this score, the bill supported by the House Democratic leadership and the one passed by the Senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee both do well.
At the financial level, we might as well admit that we're going to continue spending more of our national income on health care than anybody else. We are a rich country, we want the best treatment available, and we're prepared to pay for it. But we also need to recognize that we're getting a crazy-bad deal by spending so much on health care and leaving so many people out. Our society and government are threatened by runaway medical inflation, which saps business profits and undermines fiscal responsibility. On this score, the $1 trillion bills working their way through the House and Senate, which lack incentives to hold down spending, rate poorly. The Congressional Budget Office says they will make a bad situation worse.
It is on the sociological level, though, that we're missing the boat most completely by sticking doggedly with a workplace-based system that no longer makes sense. America has always been a mobile society with a labor market that grows more fluid over time. Once, the norm was to work for a single employer for one's entire career. Today, people change jobs an average of 11 times before they reach 40. Fear of losing health coverage keeps people in jobs they would otherwise leave, creating a drag on economic efficiency. As the Senate's smartest health care wonk, Ron Wyden of Oregon, says: “A big part of the reform challenge is to look at how the culture of the American workforce has changed since the basic structure of American health care was put in place. Today's culture is all about flexibility.”
The premise of Wyden's bipartisan bill is that we should move away from job-based insurance. It would do this by converting the tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance into a tax credit and requiring that individuals use it to buy insurance. Wyden's bill would achieve universal coverage, apply meaningful cost controls, and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, pay for itself within a few years. It's going nowhere. Instead, Democrats are poised to pass legislation that spends an additional $1 trillion, fails to restrain spending, and shores up an anachronistic employer-based system. I guess you could call it a uniquely American solution.

The data breach at health insurer Anthem has certainly raised eyebrows across the US. They rose a lot more, however, once it was announced that the hacked database containing the personal information of 80 million people wasn't encrypted.
What's worse is that the organization isn't legally required to encrypt that data.
The breach, which was announced last week, saw the theft of up to 80 million personal records in what the CEO called a “very sophisticated external cyberattack”, which loosely translates as “someone's password was ‘password'”.
It has to be said, however, that even if the data was encrypted, it may still have been possible for the hackers to steal, decrypt, and sell that data.
So why aren't they required to encrypt data?
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) states that health insurance companies such as Anthem are not required to encrypt the data stored on their servers.
Encryption is recommended if the health insurer believes it will mitigate risk, but ultimately the lack of requirements leaves it down to each organization to decide whether or not they encrypt data.
Anthem spokesperson Kristin Binns told The Wall Street Journal that the company encrypts personal data when it's moved in or out of the database but not when it's stored, a practice they said is common in the industry.
“We use other measures, including elevated user credentials, to limit access to the data when it is residing in a database,” Binns added.
And we all know how well those “other measures” worked.
Encrypting a database that is constantly accessed isn't necessarily an ideal solution. It makes it harder for that data to be accessed by legitimate users. That being said, if your alternative is to better protect how that database is accessed, then make sure that alternative is actually effective.

Avrocar schematic from the VZ-9 manual The Avrocar was a disk-shaped aircraft with the same basic shape as a frisbee, the upper surface of the disk being fairly curved, and the bottom much less so. The disk was 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter and 3.5 feet (1.1 m) thick.[21] The main structural truss was a large equilateral triangle, to which the various components were attached. The 124-blade "turborotor" sat in the center of the triangle, with most of the rotor's thrust directed straight down through an opening in the lower surface, but some was bled off to power the control system running along the outer rim of the disk.[21] Power for the rotor was provided by three Continental J69-T-9 jet engines attached to the truss. Each engine had its own fuel and oil tanks and other support systems, although it was expected these would be interconnected in future models. The majority of the airframe was made of aluminum with an empty weight of 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg).[22] Pilot control was entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were controlled through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw could be controlled by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).[21] The attitude/thrust control system consisted of a large ring situated outside of the main disk, shaped roughly like a rounded triangle with the flat surface on the "inside." Viewing the craft from the side, the control flap is almost invisible, appearing in its neutral position to blend into the profile. The pilot's controls moved the ring in relation to the rest of the craft, affecting the airflow moving outward from the center of the craft. Vertical lift could be increased by moving the entire ring down, which would produce more airflow over its upper surface, which would then bend down over this surface toward the ground. Tilting the ring resulted in asymmetric thrust for directional control.[23] It was discovered that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the aerodynamic center of pressure was well forward of the center of gravity.[24] The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot's controls. The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope, providing a "normal" direction of flight. Control cables attached to the base of the rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor, actuating the control surfaces to counteract the motion. The vehicle was manned by a crew of two, positioned in separate cockpits squeezed into empty areas in the airframe. In practice, only one pilot was usually on board during testing; a number of flights were made with an observer in the second cockpit. Until control problems were completely solved, the Avro test pilots acquired a "touch" for the extremely sensitive control inputs and Avro Aircraft Chief Development Test Pilot Potocki was eventually able to demonstrate a "hands-off" flight. Nonetheless, Avro test pilot Peter Cope, USAF project pilot Walter J. Hodgson and NASA Ames Chief Test Pilot Fred J. Drinkwater III, who all flew the Avrocar, considered it still a tricky vehicle to fly. Drinkwater likened a flight in it to "balancing on a beach ball."[25] The undercarriage of the Avrocar was rudimentary with three small castoring wheels mounted on "stub" shafts; a set of skids was substituted later in testing although they were not normally fitted.[26]

On average, turtles can live to be about 80 years old. Life span varies from species to species, but some of the oldest living animals in history have been turtles or tortoises.
While the oldest testudines tend to be sea turtles that grow up to 2,000 pounds, smaller, pet turtles can live for decades.
“In most cases, many of the aquatic turtle species—including Red-Eared Sliders and Painted Turtles—theoretically can live into their 40s,” Dr. Mark Mitchell, researcher and professor of zoological medicine at the University of Illinois, said to petMD. “They could potentially live longer, but we just don't have records.”
Living to 40 years old is nothing compared to box turtles, which can live to be 100 years old.
Map turtles and African Sideneck Turtles are known to live approximately 25 years.
Tortoises are known to live up to 100 years, with many living much longer.

For many shy people, online social networking sites have an obvious appeal – a way to socialise without the unpredictable immediacy of a face-to-face encounter. However, a new study finds that people who are socially anxious betray their awkwardness on Facebook, much as they do in the offline world. The researchers Aaron Weidman and Cheri Levinson said their findings could hint at ways for socially anxious people to conceal their nervousness and attract more online friends.
Seventy-seven students (average age 19; 77 per cent of them female) completed a measure of social anxiety. High scores were given to those who agreed with statements like “I have difficulty talking with other people” and “I am tense mixing in a group”. Before the students left the psych lab, the researchers took screen grabs of their Facebook pages.
Several aspects of the students' Facebook pages correlated with their social anxiety scores. Unsurprisingly perhaps, those with fewer Facebook friends had higher social anxiety scores, so too did those who showed their relationship status as “single” (versus married or status not shown) and those whose page did not show a status update or quote (a sign of self-disclosure). These markers largely reflect offline signs of social anxiety – it's well established for example that people who are socially anxious share less information and tell fewer stories in conversation.
So, socially anxious people betray signs of their personalities on their Facebook pages, but would a stranger looking at their page pick up on these cues? Next, the researchers showed the students' Facebook pages to six other students and asked them to rate the social anxiety of the owners of the pages (if the observing students recognised any of the people in the Facebook pages, they didn't rate those pages).
There was a modest correlation between the observers' ratings of the Facebook owners' social anxiety and the owners' actual (self-reported) social anxiety scores. The observers picked up on some cues correctly, including lack of Facebook friends. But other cues they misread. Observers tended to rate Facebook pages with fewer photos and fewer people in the profile photo as more socially anxious, even though neither of these factors actually correlated with the owners' social anxiety scores. Observers also failed to pick up on the significance of a lack of self-disclosure or the owners' relationship status.
Unfortunately, some of the tell-tale signs of social anxiety can lead shy people to appear awkward and to make a negative impression on people they meet – the very outcome that they fear. These new results suggest the same problem may apply on Facebook, but they also point at a way to help by addressing the signs that strangers will read as evidence of social awkwardness.
The researchers said people high in social anxiety “may benefit from interventions aimed at forcing them to befriend more individuals on Facebook, post more photos of themselves, and to choose a profile picture that depicts them in the presence of others, all of which might cause observers to view [them] more positively as potential friends.”

The Psychology of Facebook, Digested
Post written by Christian Jarrett (@psych_writer) for the BPS Research Digest.
After two successful outings against minor-league hitters in Arizona, Chris Sale is back with the White Sox and ready to start on the long-targeted date of April 12 (Sunday to its friends).
Unlike last season, when the club initially underestimated their injury (elbow flexor muscle strain) and their recovery, then became frustrated with the media for asking about it so damn much, the Sox handled their broken foot far more efficiently. They never floated Opening Day as a strong possibility, but they didn't forecast a prolonged absence, either.
Sure enough, the Sox declared Sale ready to go before they needed a replacement in the rotation, and Sale sounds the part:
"It's behind me," Sale said. "I was hurt. I'm not hurt any more. I think it's time to take the blinders off and run the race."
As somebody who appreciates a competitor, I like Sale's spirit. As somebody who spends a few days at Saratoga every summer, I can't quite get behind the metaphor. In fact, when it comes to the first three days of the 2015 White Sox season, it's better taking it in the opposite direction.
A lot of race horses wear blinders, or blinkers as they're officially called. California Chrome wore blinkers to victory in the first two legs of the Triple Crown just last year. Go back further, and it turns out that they didn't win their first stakes race until they put them on.
Trainer Art Sherman praised Delgado's ride, saying they wanted California Chrome to race from off the pace.
"The blinkers really moved the horse up," Sherman said. "I didn't want them to be on the lead."
Given that the Sox have chosen not to set the pace out of the gate, perhaps they might benefit from blinkers themselves, because they're wasting a lot of time with distractions.
First, they have the unproductive -- and probably counterproductive -- exchange of purpose pitches that Jeff Samardzija ignited, rolling into a second day with still no apparent benefits.
On top of that, the early returns on the Vince Coleman-inspired aggression on the basepaths: zero stolen bases and three baserunning outs. Micah Johnson was picked off in the opener, Carlos Sanchez was thrown out trying to advance on a pitch in the dirt, and Adam Eaton was easily gunned down by Salvador Perez in the eighth.
And earlier in the day, I saw this exchange in a chat with Kansas City Star beat writer Andy McCullough:
While I just wrote that Robin Ventura has the makings of a good manager, I wouldn't blame Royals fans for thinking Ned Yost has them beat in the strategy department, because Ventura has a rich history of making strange calls against Kansas City, especially with the intentional walk.
In 2012, Ventura called for four IBBs to Jeff Francoeur, including two by Sale. Likewise, he's the only American League manager to pitch around Chris Getz on purpose with two outs. That habit rolled into Opening Day, when they called for Dan Jennings to bypass Kendrys Morales to face Alex Gordon.
And then Ventura made an even stranger decision in the eighth inning on Wednesday by pinch-running Johnson for the not-slow Sanchez. Johnson was forced out at second in three pitches, leaving Ventura with a significant defensive downgrade for the rest of what was a tie game. Ventura's managing isn't nearly the biggest reason why they have a 21-38 lifetime record against the Royals, but thrashing in quicksand hurts more than it helps.
Funny thing is, the White Sox twice tied Wednesday's game while resisting the urge to force the issue.
Third inning: Avisail Garcia led off with a double to left center, and they were running hard enough out of the box that they had a reasonable shot at turning it into a triple. Instead, they gave their teammates three chances to cash them in, and Gordon Beckham came through with an RBI single.
Fifth inning: Jose Abreu doubled to the same gap to start the inning, but Joe McEwing held them at third when Garcia followed by dropping a single in front of Lorenzo Cain in center. Abreu ended up scoring on an Alexei Ramirez sac fly.
Throw in the three-run second, and none of the Sox's best innings included baserunners trying for an extra 90 feet.
I tend to be on the more patient/conservative side of talent deployment. Going back to my argument for Sanchez over Johnson, I want to see what the Sox can do with the most certain skills they possess over the first month of the season. If they still look short on production, then it's time to make riskier plays for upside, whether with their in-game strategy or their roster.
My attitude toward the Coleman Aggression Pact is similar. You know, don't reach for the jumper cables until you try starting the car a few times.
Basically, everybody needs to relax. The pitchers and baserunners need to calm down. Ventura needs to calm down. And since the White Sox lost the first two games in 2000 and 2008, fans need to calm down. I'm writing 800-plus words about the topic, so I'm including it here, too.
It wouldn't be bad advice for Sale, either. I know he's champing at the bit to get back in the game, but the last time they started in a game that counted, they spent a lot of time looking where the action wasn't.
That settles it -- blinkers for everybody!
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — After more than a week of Republican lawmakers calling for various hearings and investigations, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced he's formally opened an investigation into whether Planned Parenthood violated any state law in connection with their abortion services.
“Regardless of whether one is pro-life or pro-choice, the questions raised by these videos require careful review.” Koster said in a brief statement. “My office will investigate whether the practices described have occurred within our state and whether Missouri law has been violated.”
The announcement comes following the release of a hidden-camera video from the anti-abortion activist group, The Center for Medical Progress. The video appears to show Deborah Nucatola, a senior director of medical research for Planned Parenthood, explain that the organization sometimes sells fetal tissue to various medical research labs in exchange for a fee.
Planned Parenthood officials say the video is heavily edited, deceptive, and misrepresents the organization's actual practice of donating fetal tissue for legal medical research.
Last week, Sen. Kurt Schaefer — a Columbia Republican and 2016 candidate for Attorney General — sent a letter asking Koster to investigate whether any illegal practices were taking place in Missouri. Other lawmakers, like Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, called on Missouri legislators to hold hearings on whether or not state law was violated. House Reps. Andrew Koenig and Diane Franklin, both Republicans, have already promised joint investigative hearings.
Koster's office did not provide details on how long the investigation would take.
Pastor Ben Bailey (screen grab/The Gospel of Christ)
Pastor Ben Bailey of the Central church of Christ in McMinnville, Tennessee blamed “liberal society” for banning the stoning of LGBT people, whom they said were deserving of punishment.
In a Sunday broadcast for The Gospel of Christ television program, Bailey observed that some couples were choosing to go to churches with “relaxed and liberal views.”
They said that they wanted “things like women preaching, women leading in service, where homosexuals and gay marriage were accepted openly.”
“They were just looking for something liberal,” the pastor continued. “Something that didn't criticize or condemn or didn't have any hardcore standards on anything — anything goes type of mentality.”
But Bailey argued that was not what God wanted.
“He has a definite standard and it is not the liberal mindset that we see today,” Bailey opined. “This book [the Bible] does not condone things like women preaching… Paul said I do not let a woman preach of be in authority over a man, that's not according to the Bible. If I'm out to please God, we don't find things like that in the Bible.”
“God does not approve of homosexuality or gay marriage,” they insisted. “The scripture says… that is vile, unnatural and deserving of a penalty… It's an abomination that under the Old Testament deserved stoning.”
“And so, is our God, the God of Bible, wanting us to go somewhere where it's liberal, relaxed views and anything goes. No, that's the effect of a very liberal society. And we need to make sure that such is not the idea or the mindset of God.”
Watch the video below from The Gospel of Christ, broadcast Aug. 16, 2015.
GOP frontrunner Donald Trump spoke at Liberty University to thousands of people that filled the audience, where they quoted from the Bible and told the college students to “never give up.”
“You can never ever give up,” Trump told the audience on the college campus in Lynchburg, Virginia. “If you give up, you're not going to make it.”
“Go into a field that you love,” they added, “If you don't love it, you're not going to be successful.”
A man shouted from the crowd and Trump echoed him, “I make you proud to be an American?”
Trump responded, “That's very nice.”
“It's very hard for somebody to run for president,” Trump told the crowd, referencing their comments on illegal immigration and the backfire that followed. “You're really exposing so much.”
“We're going to protect Christianity,” Trump vowed. “I don't have to be politically correct, we're going to protect it.”
Trump then quoted from the Bible, “Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”
“It's so representative of what's taken place,” they added.
During Trump's speech, they went on to tout the poll numbers that have them leading the GOP field and said they think he's going to “clean the table” in terms of state primary elections, adding, “I think we could really surprise a lot of people.”
Trump said everything that was discussed during the Democratic debate on Sunday night means “tremendously high taxes.”
Trump said they would build a strong military, and they doubled down on building the wall along the southern border and having Mexico pay for it. They also vowed to bring jobs back to the United States from other countries.
Trump said they would like to see a woman president, but not Hillary Clinton, because she's “a disaster.”
They also took a swipe at the other candidates because unlike them, they are funding their own campaign and doesn't have any donors or Wall Street to answer to. “They don't own me,” Trump said of the donors and lobbyists.
They also bashed the mainstream media and how they never show the large crowds on the camera when they are giving speeches at their campaign rallies.
“It's a movement. It's packed,” Trump said about their supporters. “The press is very, very dishonest,” adding, “not all of it, but most of it.”
“This political press is brutal,” Trump explained. “I've never seen anything like it,” referencing, “the camera trick where they don't show” the crowds supporting him.
“You're not getting a real picture of this silent majority,” they explained.
“It's no longer so silent. It's become a noisy majority. People want to see greatness for our country,” Trump touted. “These politicians are all talk no action. They don't get it done.”
FakeNet – Download
FakeNet is a tool that aids in the dynamic analysis of malicious software. The tool simulates a network so that malware interacting with a remote host continues to run allowing the analyst to observe the malware's network activity from within a safe environment. The goal of the project is to:
Be easy to install and use; the tool runs on Windows and requires no 3rd party libraries Support the most common protocols used by malware Perform all activity on the local machine to avoid the need for a second virtual machine Provide python extensions for adding new or custom protocols Keep the malware running so that you can observe as much of its functionality as possible Have a flexible configuration, but no required configuration
The tool is in its infancy of development. We started working on the tool in January 2012 and we intend to maintain the tool and add new and useful features. If you find a bug or have a cool feature you think would improve the tool please contact us.
Features
Supports DNS, HTTP, and SSL
HTTP server always serves a file and tries to serve a meaningful file; if the malware request a .jpg then a properly formatted .jpg is served, etc. The files being served are user configurable.
Ability to redirect all traffic to the localhost, including traffic destined for a hard-coded IP address.
Python extensions, including a sample extension that implements SMTP and SMTP over SSL.
Built in ability to create a capture file (.pcap) for packets on localhost.
Dummy listener that will listen for traffic on any port, auto-detect and decrypt SSL traffic and display the content to the console.
Demo Video
Click here to watch a demo of version 0.9 of the tool in action.
How it works
FakeNet uses a variety of Windows and third party libraries. It uses a custom HTTP and DNS server to respond to this request. It uses OpenSSL to wrap any connection with SSL. It uses a Winsock Layered Service Provider (LSP) to redirect traffic to the localhost and to listen for traffic on new ports. It uses python 2.7 for the python extensions. And, it creates the .pcap file by reconstructing a packet header based on the traffic from send/recv calls.

Israel and Facebook will begin working together to tackle posts on the social media platform that incite violence, a senior Israeli cabinet minister has said.
A spate of high-profile new attacks on Israelis in the past 12 months have been incited by inflammatory posts on Facebook, the government argues, which is why legislation to compel the company to delete posts that encourage violent behaviour is on the books.
Representatives from Facebook met with government ministers last week, including interior minister Gilad Erdan and justice minister Ayelet Shaked, who have repeatedly called on the company to do more to monitor and control content.

At least 150 Palestinians have been arrested in recent months for ‘incitement' through social media, the Palestine Information Center says. There is currently no legal precedent in Israel for charging people with an offence related to online posts, whereas similar situations would be dealt with under hate speech laws in the UK and other countries.
Palestinian lawyer Mahmoud Hassan, who works for Jerusalem-based legal advice organisation Addameer, told The Independent in May that in many cases people had been arrested for innocuous posts or criticising the Israeli state, rather than inciting violence.
Erdan's office said that they had agreed with Facebook representatives to create teams to “figure out how best to monitor and remove inflammatory content”.
It is unclear whether the proposed legislation will be shelved considering the agreement reached on Monday. Digital rights groups have said that the proposed legislation is likely to be unenforceable.

In a statement, Facebook said “online extremism can only be tackled with a strong partnership between policymakers, civil society, academia and companies, and this is true in Israel and around the world”, calling the meeting “constructive”.
“We know that the amount of inciting online is even greater so we have to continue and increase our efforts, and we will,” Shaked said at a security conference. “An inciting page is a perpetual growth engine for terror if it is not removed.”
The Palestinians dismiss the Israeli allegations that the violence is caused by incitement. They say it is the result of nearly 50 years of Israeli military occupation and a lack of hope for gaining independence.

Dear President Donald Trump,
You don't know me, but you did recently mention my school in one of your infamous tweets. I attend UC Berkeley, the campus that violently threatens free speech.
(Nevermind that my school was the one to cultivate the values of free speech among young activists in the 60s, but I digress.)
I'd like to congratulate you on such a popular, well-written tweet. It denoted all of the fabulous points that you've been trying to make throughout your campaign and most assuredly in your time as president of these United States.
In order to fully appreciate all the golden nuggets of wisdom that seem to fall effortlessly from your tiny, orange fingers, I'd like to speak to you about certain points raised in your tweet.
If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017
You insinuate that UC Berkeley doesn't allow free speech. Here's the tricky thing about free speech and the First Amendment, Mr. President. There is a lot of literature and investigation into the legality and specificity of what constitutes the protection of freedom of speech, and because we both know you won't do any of that pesky reading, I'll make it simple.
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution aims to protect the rights to freedom of religion, expression, assembly and petition. In the many cases that have judged the particularities of these freedoms, none yet have guaranteed the protection of opinion.
In short terms, UC Berkeley not only allows the practice of free speech, but creates a space for free speech to emerge in multitudinous ways.
“In the many cases that have judged the particularities of these freedoms, none yet have guaranteed the protection of opinion.”
Milo Yiannopoulos was allowed to speak on campus, but the event was canceled for safety reasons. The administration, against the wishes of many, allowed them to address the campus. They were never legally denied the right to speak, they were simply drowned out by the voices against him.
Student demonstrators were allowed to assemble and petition against “a different point of view,” thus expressing their own protected freedom. The tension that was created on my campus seemed not to emerge from the denial of free speech, but from its point of intersection.
Therefore, to your first point I'd like to say WRONG.
UC Berkeley does and did allow free speech. If you're still confused as to how you're wrong, I hope that one of the many books at your disposal that sit unused could perhaps enlighten you.
To your mention of the practice of violence: it appears that anti-fascist groups and instigators overtook the peaceful protest that was intended and organized by UC Berkeley students.
At this point, I'd appreciate it if you could take a moment to dwell on the meaning of “fascism.”
According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, fascism is:
a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.
While these words may mean nothing to you (indeed, I wonder if you believe that words hold permanent meaning at all), this is one of those “trigger words” you seem to despise.
Fascism is a trigger word because it triggers feelings of fear, oppression, harmful opposition to constructive discourse, unfair punishment, unbalanced equality and more. The raging debate as to whether fascism is emerging in the United States through your administration is not one I aim to enter into with you, because it is doomed to go nowhere.
Instead, Mr. President, I'd like you to recognize that violence was incited in opposition to this idea of fascism. Action was taken against a political ideology that I thought had died long ago. This was attached to a man whose “innocence” is up for debate, considering their rhetoric of hate speech.
Actions speak louder than words, and this is why I'd like you to remember this early moment in your presidency, because the speech that was vilified in these acts of protest and violence don't stray too far from your own rhetoric.
Additionally this loose definition of fascism identifies a “forcible suppression of opposition.” In case you weren't aware, taking away federal funds from a school that disrupts the comfort of those who take solace in your hate is exactly that. That act would in turn defy free speech.
Not sure if you've caught on yet, but there's a lot of circular logic and hypocrisy piling up here.
Not to mention, your threat to remove federal funds? Unfortunately, that's not how the funding for this campus works. Turns out, you're not as good at understanding money as you thought.
So to your other points, I'd also like to say WRONG.
President Donald Trump, writing a letter to you seems fruitless, because I find it hard to believe that you're able to read anything that isn't found on your Twitter feed. Nevertheless, I thought it important to let you know that the campus I'm from is the No. 1 public school in the world.
Our students make up a political spectrum that ranges from Republican to Democrat and everywhere in between. The people that study here are undocumented immigrants, refugees, victims of sexual assault, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community. They come from socioeconomic backgrounds across the board. Some have overcome the challenges of incarceration and poverty, while others have lived lives nearer to the privilege you're accustomed to. They are scholars, philosophers, writers, protesters, artists, scientists, athletes, environmentalists.
The diversity and complexity of this campus is one I can't personally speak for because I know a fragment of this community and do not know what they would say to you.
“So to your other points, I'd also like to say WRONG.”
What I do know, is that we are diverse, young and unafraid, Mr. President. We're well-read and better at Twitter than you are.
We are the future of this country.
Sincerely,
A Liberal Berkeley Student

The Legal FAQ for Tor Relay Operators.
FAQ written by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Last updated April 21, 2014.
NOTE: This FAQ is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Our aim is to provide a general description of the legal issues surrounding Tor in the United States. Different factual situations and different legal jurisdictions will result in different answers to a number of questions. Therefore, please do not act on this information alone; if you have any specific legal problems, issues, or questions, seek a complete review of your situation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.
Also, if you received this document from anywhere besides the EFF web site or https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html, it may be out of date. Follow the link to get the latest version.

General Information
Has anyone ever been sued or prosecuted for running Tor?
No, we aren't aware of anyone being sued or prosecuted in the United States just for running a Tor relay. Further, we believe that running a Tor relay — including an exit relay that allows people to anonymously send and receive traffic — is legal under U.S. law.
Should I use Tor or encourage the use of Tor for illegal purposes?
No. Tor has been developed to be a tool for free expression, privacy, and human rights. It is not a tool designed or intended to be used to break the law, either by Tor users or Tor relay operators.
Can EFF promise that I won't get in trouble for running a Tor relay?
No. All new technologies create legal uncertainties, and Tor is no exception. We cannot guarantee that you will never face any legal liability as a result of running a Tor relay. However, EFF believes so strongly that those running Tor relays shouldn't be liable for traffic that passes through the relay that we're running our own middle relay.
Will EFF represent me if I get in trouble for running a Tor relay?
Maybe. While EFF cannot promise legal representation for all Tor relay operators, it will assist relay operators in assessing the situation and will try to locate qualified legal counsel when necessary. Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing legal representation or referrals should be directed to our intake coordinator by sending an email to info@eff.org . Such inquiries will be kept confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege. Note that although EFF cannot practice law outside of the United States, it will still try to assist non-U.S. relay operators in finding local representation.
Should I contact the Tor developers when I have legal questions about Tor or to inform them if I suspect Tor is being used for illegal purposes?
No. Tor's developers are available to answer technical questions, but they are not lawyers and cannot give legal advice. Nor do they have any ability to prevent illegal activity that may occur through Tor relays. Furthermore, your communications with Tor's developers are not protected by any legal privilege, so law enforcement or civil litigants could subpoena and obtain any information you give to them.
You can contact info@eff.org if you face a specific legal issue. We will try to assist you, but given EFF's small size, we cannot guarantee that we can help everyone.
Do Tor's core developers make any promises about the trustworthiness or reliability of Tor relays that are listed in their directory?
No. Although the developers attempt to verify that Tor relays listed in the directory maintained by the core developers are stable and have adequate bandwidth, neither they nor EFF can guarantee the personal trustworthiness or reliability of the individuals who run those relays. Tor's core developers further reserve the right to refuse a Tor relay operator's request to be listed in their directory or to remove any relay from their directory for any reason.
Exit Relays
Exit relays raise special concerns because the traffic that exits from them can be traced back to the relay's IP address. While we believe that running an exit relay is legal, it is statistically likely that an exit relay will at some point be used for illegal purposes, which may attract the attention of private litigants or law enforcement. An exit relay may forward traffic that is considered unlawful, and that traffic may be attributed to the operator of a relay. If you are not willing to deal with that risk, a bridge or middle relay may be a better fit for you. These relays do not directly forward traffic to the Internet and so can't be easily mistaken for the origin of allegedly unlawful content.
The Tor Project's blog has some excellent recommendations for running an exit with as little risk as possible. We suggest that you review their advice before setting up an exit relay.
Should I run an exit relay from my home?
No. If law enforcement becomes interested in traffic from your exit relay, it's possible that officers will seize your computer. For that reason, it's best not to run your exit relay in your home or using your home Internet connection.
Instead, consider running your exit relay in a commercial facility that is supportive of Tor. Have a separate IP address for your exit relay, and don't route your own traffic through it.
Of course, you should avoid keeping any sensitive or personal information on the computer hosting your exit relay, and you never should use that machine for any illegal purpose.
Should I tell my ISP that I'm running an exit relay?
Yes. Make sure you have a Tor-friendly ISP that knows you're running an exit relay and supports you in that goal. This will help ensure that your Internet access isn't cut off due to abuse complaints. The Tor community maintains a list of ISPs that are particularly Tor-savvy, as well as ones that aren't.
Is it a good idea to let others know that I'm running an exit relay?
Yes. Be as transparent as possible about the fact that you're running an exit relay. If your exit traffic draws the attention of the government or disgruntled private party, you want them to figure out quickly and easily that you are part of the Tor network and not responsible for the content. This could mean the difference between having your computer seized by law enforcement and being left alone.
The Tor Project suggests the following ways to let others know that you're running an exit relay:
Set up a reverse DNS name for the IP address that makes clear that the computer is an exit relay.
Set up a notice like this to explain that you're running an exit relay that's part of the Tor network.
If possible, get an ARIN registration for your exit relay that displays contact information for you, not your ISP. This way, you'll receive any abuse complaints and can respond to them directly. Otherwise, try to ensure that your ISP forwards abuse complaints that it receives to you.
Should I snoop on the plaintext traffic that exits through my Tor relay?
No. You may be technically capable of modifying the Tor source code or installing additional software to monitor or log plaintext that exits your relay. However, Tor relay operators in the United States can possibly create civil and even criminal liability for themselves under state or federal wiretap laws if they monitor, log, or disclose Tor users' communications, while non-U.S. operators may be subject to similar laws. Do not examine anyone's communications without first talking to a lawyer.
If I receive a subpoena or other information request from law enforcement or anyone else related to my Tor relay, what should I do?
Educate them about Tor. In most instances, properly configured Tor relays will have no useful data for inquiring parties, and you should feel free to educate them on this point. To the extent you do maintain logs, however, you should not disclose them to any third party without first consulting a lawyer. In the United States, such a disclosure may violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and relay operators outside of the United States may be subject to similar data protection laws.
You may receive legal inquiries where you are prohibited by law from telling anyone about the request. We believe that, at least in the United States, such gag orders do not prevent you from talking to a lawyer, including calling a lawyer to find representation. Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing legal representation should be directed to our intake coordinator (info at eff.org) Such inquiries will be kept confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege.
For more information about responding to abuse complaints and other inquiries, check out the Tor Abuse FAQ and the collection of abuse response templates on the Tor Project's website.
For information on what to do if law enforcement seeks access to your digital devices, check out EFF's Know Your Rights guide.
My ISP, university, etc. just sent me a DMCA notice. What should I do?
EFF has written a short template to help you write a response to your ISP, university, etc., to let them know about the details of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's safe harbor, and how Tor fits in. Note that template only refers to U.S. jurisdictions, and is intended only to address copyright complaints that are based on a relay of allegedly infringing material through the Tor node.
If you like, you should consider submitting a copy of your notice to Chilling Effects. This will help us recognize trends and issues that the lawyers might want to focus on. Chilling Effects encourages submissions from people outside the United States too.
EFF believes that Tor relays should be protected from copyright liability for the acts of their users because a Tor relay operator can raise an immunity defense under the DMCA as well as defenses under copyright's secondary liability doctrines. However, no court has yet addressed these issues in the context of Tor itself. If you are uncomfortable with this uncertainty, you may consider using a reduced exit policy (such as the default policy suggested by the Tor Project) to try to minimize traffic types that are often targeted in copyright complaints.

They are the author of " The Essential Bernie Sanders and Their Vision for America ," president of the Economic Future Group and the publisher/editor of Working Life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.
(CNN) President John F. Kennedy once said , "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic." It's quite an apt observation, considering the horrendous policy position on the issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership now contained in the draft Democratic Party platform -- a position that puts the party at electoral peril in November and, more important, leaves it at odds with the interests of working people, one of its most important constituencies.
This past Friday, at the party's public hearings in St. Louis , representatives of Bernie Sanders' campaign attempted to insert a single line into the trade section of the platform: "It is the policy of the Democratic Party that the Trans-Pacific Partnership must not get a vote in this Congress or in future sessions of Congress."
It failed on a straight "party line" vote, with every one of Hillary Clinton's representatives giving the thumbs down on the amendment. This development is a gift to Donald Trump's jeremiad against bad trade deals.
There is still time to adjust course. The full platform committee will meet in Orlando next week to consider the draft document. Elected labor delegates represent a significant percentage of delegates overall.
Regardless of whom they will support when the roll call comes to determine the party's nominee, they could, and should, unite to support the Sanders' language on TPP. They would then stay true to labor's stated position -- and strengthen the Democratic Party's potential for electoral victory against Donald Trump in November.

Count me as one of those people who never believed in Clinton's newfound opposition to the TPP, which they previously had called the "gold standard" for trade pacts ( as a recent video confirms ). Even Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, publicly reassured their members that Clinton would be back in the fold if they became president.
They have consistently supported so-called "free trade" while Sanders has opposed every such deal dating back to Bill Clinton's NAFTA. But, their campaign wisely understood they could not hope to capture the party's nomination running as the true corporate-friendly Democrat they are.
Regardless of whether Clinton is truly on board with the TPP, they and their delegates should embrace the inclusion of anti-TPP language in the Democratic Party platform.
Whether they have supported Clinton or Sanders in the primary contests, virtually all unions oppose the TPP. And trade is not some secondary topic that will fade away as we enter the general election.
For a quarter of a century, the labor movement has wisely opposed NAFTA-style deals, which set up rules protecting corporate rights, with meaningless verbiage about labor and environmental safeguards slapped on as a microscopic Band-Aid to try to mollify critics.
Since NAFTA's passage, hard-working Americans have watched millions of unionized jobs evaporate. Workers, who once made a living wage, now labor for substandard pay with no benefits , partly because they are afraid to demand more in the face of corporate threats to close up shop and move to another country with slave-like wages.
The current low-demand economy, with its hiccupping anemic growth, can, in part, be traced to so-called "free trade" -- too many people have jobs that just don't pay enough money to meet expenses, not to mention save anything for retirement.
To be clear, Barack Obama's trade agenda will only advance because it is supported by the bulk of the Republican members in Congress. The majority of the Democratic caucus in the House and Senate oppose the TPP, as do a majority of Democratic Party voters.
So, effectively, to be in step with Hillary Clinton's true views on trade, the majority on the drafting committee is shilling for corporate America at a time when millions of people are clamoring for economic policies that support the people. Astonishing.

The greater danger lies ahead. I have been warning for many months that Donald Trump's assault against NAFTA-- a position contrary to their party's mainline orthodoxy -- will give them traction in critical swing states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other communities hurt by NAFTA-style trade.
It is beyond mystifying why Democrats would hand an unhinged, dangerous man, who is alienating people of all walks of life, a political lifeline that affords them a megaphone that we should own. Moreover, it would be a deep blow to Obama's legacy if their misguided pursuit of the TPP, in opposition to their own party's rank and file, paves the way for a Trump presidency.
Failing a change in Orlando, this is an issue that is worth a knock-down, drag-out public fight on the convention floor. Sweeping the TPP under the rug in the name of some false unity would be a great disservice to our country. Where one stands on the TPP is not simply an item on some check list but a fundamental expression of values and what the party stands for.
Politics often gives us great ironies. When I pulled up the AFL-CIO web page on its TPP opposition, up popped a web ad supporting Clinton. With their smiling face, it featured a quote from her: "Unions helped build the great middle class in history."
That is absolutely true. I can't imagine that anyone envisioned the jarring visual contrast between that quote casting a shadow over a policy that will eviscerate unions and the middle class.
Police teams looking to find a stolen truck in Bursa's Iznik district have discovered a sarcophagus at an olive grove, belonging to the Late Antiquity period.
According to reports, the incident took place when police saw an abandoned excavation at an olive grove in Hisardere district, five kilometers away from İznik town center.
They informed the gendarmerie, who contacted Iznik Museum to inspect the site.
Archeologists from the museum arrived and carefully started digging to reveal the sarcophagus, which is reportedly from the second century AD and is made out of marble.
It reportedly has two antefixes on both sides, each of which have five lion's heads and weigh six tons.
Iznik Museum officials said that they will display the sarcophagus once it is completely removed from the ground.
Another sarcophagus belonging to a queen was found near the area 10 months ago. It was also thought to be from the Late Antiquity period and weighed seven tons. When it was discovered, officials discovered that treasure hunters had found and raided it.

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has forever changed our view of the moon, literally bringing it into sharper focus and showing us the whole globe in unprecedented detail.This rich new portrait has been rendered by LRO's seven onboard instruments, which together have delivered more than 192 terabytes of data, images and maps -- the equivalent of nearly 41,000 typical DVDs. "This is a tremendous accomplishment," says Douglas Cooke, Associate Administrator of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, Washington. "The exploration phase of the mission delivered a lot more than it originally promised, and that's been just the beginning for LRO."The primary objective of the mission was to enable safe and effective exploration of the moon. "To do so, we needed to leverage the very best that the science community had to offer," says Michael Wargo, chief lunar scientist of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, Washington. "And by doing that, we've fundamentally changed our scientific understanding of the moon."The most precise and complete topographic maps to date of the moon's complex, heavily cratered landscape have been created from the more than 4 billion measurements -- and still counting -- taken by LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA). These maps are more accurate and sample more places on the lunar surface than any available before. In fact, LOLA has taken more than 100 times more measurements than all previous lunar instruments of its kind combined, opening up a world of possibilities for future exploration and for science.Already, researchers have used LOLA data to put together the first comprehensive set of maps of the roughness of the moon's surface. Like wrinkles on skin, the roughness of craters and other features on the moon's surface can reveal their age. By looking at where and how the roughness changes -- and by combining that information with contour maps that show where the high and low points are -- researchers can get important clues about the processes that shaped the moon."Before LRO, we actually knew the shape of Mars better than we knew the shape of the moon, our nearest neighbor," notes LRO's Deputy Project Scientist, John Keller of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. "But because of LRO and LOLA, we now have detailed maps of both the near side and far side of the moon."Though less familiar than the instantly recognizable near side, the moon's far side is no less fascinating. The far side is rougher and houses more craters, including one of the biggest impact basins in the solar system, called South Pole-Aitken. This remnant of an ancient and immensely powerful impact left such a profound crater that 34 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other still would not reach from its depths to its rim."With the wealth of data from LRO freely available, everyone can get to know the far side of the moon just as well as the near side," says Wargo.LRO's search for resources has revealed that the moon is even more extreme than we thought.In the polar regions, deep and long-shaded craters, such as Shackleton crater in the south, have been of special interest because they can act as cold storage, capable of accumulating and preserving volatile material like water ice. But it was while studying Hermite crater near the moon's North Pole that the mission's Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment found the coldest spot in solar system, with a temperature of -415 degrees Fahrenheit (-248 degrees Celsius or 25 Kelvins).To further explore these regions, LRO's Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), which can "see" in the dark, is imaging the shaded areas. Already, LOLA's precise measurements have been used to map solar illumination; this work has provided new insight into the shadowed regions and also revealed areas that receive nearly continuous sun. Because sunlight itself is a resource on the moon, knowing that there are areas that get sun for approximately 243 days a year and never have a period of total darkness for more than 24 hours is extremely valuable.Complementing those efforts are both the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) and the Miniature Radio Frequency (Mini-RF) advanced radar. They are searching for deposits of water ice. LEND also seeks hydrogen, a resource of interest because of its potential use as fuel. And at the same time, the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) studies the lunar radiation environment, which is important for keeping our astronauts healthy and safe as they explore.Stunning details of the moon's surface have been revealed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), which imaged nearly 5.7 million square kilometers of the moon's surface during the exploration phase of the mission. That is roughly the same amount of land as all contiguous states west of the Mississippi River.Though earlier missions also imaged the moon, what sets LROC apart is its ability to image with surface pixels that are only 1.5 feet in size, small enough to distinguish details never before possible."With this resolution, LRO could easily spot a picnic table on the moon," says LRO's Project Scientist, Richard Vondrak of NASA Goddard.And thanks to some operational efficiencies, the dual Narrow Angle Cameras that are part of LROC have delivered 50 percent more images than initially expected.LRO was charged with surveying specific sites but with the added goal of making measurements globally across the moon. "LRO is designed to look down all the time, and most of the instruments are collecting data all the time," Wargo explains. "This, along with LRO's performance and reliability, has given us a more comprehensive view of the moon than ever before."And there's plenty more to come from LRO. "Not only did we accomplish all of this during the exploration phase of the mission," says Vondrak, "but two more years of wonderful science are already under way."

A DOUBLE-DECKER bus roof was torn off after getting stuck under Portchester railway bridge.
The out-of-service First Group bus was being driven on the A27 at Portchester when the drama unfolded.
The driver - who has not yet been named - tried to steer the double-decker under a railway bridge at Railway Street and Station Road in Portchester shortly after 1pm today.
Police say the bus went under the bridge and out the other side - but the roof of the vehicle, which is at least 12ft high - was completely ripped off.
Remarkably no-one was hurt in the incident.
However debris was strewn across the road and police have had to shut the stretch while experts work at the scene.
Eye-witness Ashlee-Rose tweeted: ‘OK So I'm stood at Portchester station and suddenly underneath my feet a double decker bus crashes under the bridge where I'm stood!'
The driver of the bus was unhurt and there were no passengers on board.
A First Bus spokesperson said: ‘We can confirm that one of our vehicles, which was travelling out of service, has been involved in an incident in Portchester.
‘There were no passengers on board the bus at the time, and while the driver was shaken by the incident they were not injured.
‘The exact cause of the incident is not yet known. This will be thoroughly investigated.
‘We would like to offer our sincere apologies to anyone who was inconvenienced by the incident.'
Police informed the Highways Agency and structural engineers who are assessing the damage.
Fire crews and medics were also called to the scene.
Network Rail was alerted and experts turned a live railway line off for about 20 minutes so structural engineers could examine the scene.
South West Trains said services travelling between Cosham and Fareham were operating at a reduced speed while investigating work was underway.
Colin Evans, 41, who lives nearby in The Fairway, said: ‘I was in the back garden cleaning my pond out when I heard it. It sounded like a bomb going off.
‘I heard some sirens so I walked up to the end of my road to see what was going on down there.
‘When I got up there I saw the roof of the bus under the bridge and the bus the other side.
‘Since I've lived here I think it's the fifth or sixth double-decker that's done that.
‘We've also had a skip lorry stuck under there.
‘I've lived here all my life.'
The road has now reopened. First Group is arranging for the bus to be recovered.

For me, June is the start of trading season (nd the Mariners and Diamondbacks apparently agree). I know it will still be a few weeks before we likely start to see serious movement from the other clubs, but it's never bad to start thinking ahead. So that's why we here at MLB Daily Dish have created the MLB Trade Deadline Power Rankings. The rankings list the team in order from most likely to buy to most likely to sell, with a clean break in between.
Let's get started.
These teams are buyers
1) Kansas City Royals - The Royals are the defending AL Champs and the pressure is on to repeat. Meanwhile, their pitching behind Edinson Volquez, Yordano Ventura, and Chris Young (what?) has been awful and is not likely to improve much.
2) Seattle Mariners - I can't believe they traded for Trumbo, but Jack Z is desperate, so I guess they probably won't be stopping there.
3) New York Yankees - On top of an awful AL East for now, the Yankees are in a prime position to buy and get a jump on the rest of the division. They could use another starter to slide in behind Michael Pineda, Adam Warren, and a hopefully recovered Masahiro Tanaka.
4) New York Mets - The Mets are desperate for respectability, and a playoff spot would do that for them. They have a clear need at shortstop, and a catching prospect to spare once Travis d'Arnaud comes back.
5) San Diego Padres - The Padres decided that they would make a run this year, and will need to acquire middle infield help and maybe a true center fielder to right their bad start.
6) Houston Astros - A huge surprise, but I buy the Astros as contenders. They could use help at first base and in the rotation. I wonder if Jeff Samardzija and Adam LaRoche would be good fits.
7) Los Angeles Dodgers - The Dodgers need rotation help with Brandon McCarthy and Hyun-jin Ryu down for the year. They have plenty of money to take on contracts, and aren't shy about making big deals.
8) Washington Nationals - The Nationals need help at shortstop, where Ian Desmond has been a disaster offensively and defensively, and at first base, where Ryan Zimmerman has been awful.
9) St. Louis Cardinals - They have the best record in baseball, but a glaring hole at first base and could use some rotation depth.
10) Tampa Bay Rays - The Rays are surprise contenders and they have a new front office team who will want to prove they can be just as smart and daring as Andrew Friedman was by upgrading the rotation and shortstop for a stretch run at the AL East title or maybe the second wild card.
11) Pittsburgh Pirates - The Pirates have designs on a wild card spot, have a stacked farm system, and need a better pitcher in the rotation than Jeff Locke or Charlie Morton.
12) San Francisco Giants - The Giants always seem to put together some deal by the deadline. The starting rotation could definitely use some help to replace whichever of the done-looking Tim Hudson or Ryan Vogelsong is left standing once Jake Peavy returns.
13) Detroit Tigers - The Tigers really could use some help in the rotation, and maybe a bat to back up at third base and designated hitter. And, of course, they always need bullpen help. Trouble is, Detroit doesn't have much to offer.
14) Atlanta Braves - Do they have the money to make another deal, after they acquired Juan Uribe? They definitely need bullpen help, and maybe a starter.
15) Cleveland Indians - Not nearly as bad as their record, and with clear areas they need to improve at third base, bullpen, and starting rotation. They may not have the prospects to make a deal, however.
16) Los Angeles Angels - They created a hole in left field when they dealt Josh Hamilton and they could use an upgrade at DH. Maybe a reunion with Torii Hunter is in order?
These teams are sellers
14) Minnesota Twins - A regression is coming, and I'm guessing the Twins understand that. Hopefully it will come in time for them to offload the surprisingly effective Mike Pelfrey, Blaine Boyer, and Torii Hunter on a contender
13) Texas Rangers - I have no idea how they are doing what they are doing. Yovani Gallardo, Colby Lewis, and Wandy Rodriguez will all be free agents this offseason, and should be dealt.
12) Chicago Cubs - Like the Twins, they're a big surprise, but they will be hard pressed to actually earn a wild card. They also have talent on hand to replace Dexter Fowler and Starlin Castro.
11) Baltimore Orioles - The next three are all AL East teams. At least one of these teams will not sell at the deadline, because they'll right their ship and be contenders in an atrocious AL East. I just don't know which one(s) yet. The incredible Darren O'Day, Chris Davis, Wei-Yin Chen, Steve Pearce, Matt Wieters, and Bud Norris are all free agents next year and could go.
10) Toronto Blue Jays - The Jays, as currently constructed really only have one more year in their window to compete, so they may just want to bring everyone back for one more bite of the apple. But Mark Buehrle, Marco Estrada, or Brett Cecil would be attractive targets.
9) Boston Red Sox - Well, this is not how the Sox drew it up this offseason. Mike Napoli has hit well for the last month. Clay Buchholz has been more Jeckyll than Hyde, but the Sox may be more inclined to pick up their option and try to lock them into a long term contract.
8) Arizona Diamondbacks - Trumbo is already gone, the trouble is they don't have much else to give away. Oliver Perez, I suppose. Maybe someone will want the underperforming Hellickson or Collmenter.
7) Colorado Rockies - I wish they could deal Troy Tulowitzki, but the injury risk means they won't get full value, and might be inclined to hold on.
6) Miami Marlins - Jeffrey Loria has said they want their club to stay together, but they also expressed a lot of faith in Mike Redmond before tossing them overboard. Look for Martin Prado and Dan Haren to go, as well as Mat Latos if they can turn it around a little.
5) Chicago White Sox - Their attempt to rebuild quickly with big trades and free agents has fallen short. Jeff Samardzija is a foregone conclusion and Gordon Beckham will be a hot commodity if they keep hitting. Maybe Adam LaRoche too.
4) Cincinnati Reds - Johnny Cueto will be gone before the deadline and will bring back a huge haul. Mike Leake is equally gone. Aroldis Chapman and Jay Bruce are both a year away from free agency, and could fetch a good price.
3) Philadelphia Phillies - Cole Hamels has been on the market for eight months now, and the Phillies are starting to talk about kicking in some money to go with him. They will literally take anything for Ryan Howard. Papelbon could go, and the club is already shopping left fielder Ben Revere. They have accepted their fate.
2) Milwaukee Brewers - Doug Melvin has already said he's open to dealing anyone not name Jonathan Lucroy. Aramis Ramirez is a goner if they can get anyone to take him. So are Kyle Lohse and Adam Lind. An interesting name might be Carlos Gomez, who is only under contract for one more year.
1) Oakland A's - If there's one thing Billy Beane doesn't mind, it's to break up a club that isn't winning (or even one that is). He'll have some really excellent pieces to sell off, too, in Ben Zobrist, Scott Kazmir, Josh Reddick, Ike Davis, and maybe Jesse Chavez.
Jeff Hughes | February 18th, 2015
FOX
John Fox was noncommittal on the future of Jay Cutler. They were asked point-blank if Cutler was their quarterback moving forward and balked. It is February 18th. We are less than a month from free agency. How many teams with a “franchise” quarterback would not endorse them as the starter today? Yes it's possible Fox does not have enough information on Cutler to this point but what exactly is they going to learn between now and free agency or the draft? Will Cutler have an opportunity to blow Fox away at OTAs? Will the Bears be willing to risk millions of dollars on that development?
Fox made is quite clear that if Brandon Marshall will be on the Chicago Bears in 2015 they will not be on Inside the NFL. Their money quote: “Our focus needs to be on football.” This is a drastic departure from the previous head coach.
The Bears are switching to a 3-4 base for all you 3-4/4-3 junkies out there.
Fox knows they are taking over a defense lacking in talent. When pressed about building blocks on that side of the ball they struggled to mention anyone other than Kyle Fuller.
Fox started to get frustrated during their short presser with the number of ways the press asked them the EXACT SAME question about Cutler. This wasn't on the Chicago media. This was on the whole of the NFL media attending this moronic event.
The Bears want Josh McCown back in Chicago. McCown fits to a tee the type of quarterback Fox has utilized in their first year with a team needing rejuvenation: limited ability but great leadership qualities. If the Bears are targeting a quarterback in this draft (or a young player at the bottom of somebody else's roster), McCown is a far better choice to help groom that young talent than Cutler.
Seemed to be little desire on Fox's part to leave door open for Lance Briggs and Charles Tillman to return.
The takeaway…
On offense, Fox has to determine whether their supremely talented quarterback and receiver fit in with the locker room he's trying to build. On defense, Fox has to find players. They don't have many now.
PACE
Pace stated Bears would “maximize time” they take to make decision on Cutler. This would lead me to think the decision will be made before the next big chunk of cash is guaranteed.
Pace strongly reiterated the organization's new belief that Brandon Marshall will not be partaking in their extracurricular activities any longer. Pace making it very clear that Dan Bernstein's reporting Marshall was out in Chicago were and continue to be dog shit.
Pace is really the opposite of Phil Emery. No buzzwords. No mantras. Matter of fact. Deliberate.
Pace was asked if Josh McCown could be a starter or backup in the NFL. Their response? “Either.” This leads me to strongly believe McCown was told at their morning meeting with the Bears that he'd have an opportunity to be the starter in 2015.
I'd be surprised if the Bears don't leave the first round of the coming draft with a pass rusher.
Pace stated Kyle Long could play “multiple positions on the offensive line”. Does this open the door for them to move outside to tackle? If the Bears believe this is where their future lies they should make the move before they arrive in Bourbonnais.
Pace did not hesitate when asked about Jared Allen. They called them “flexible” and certainly expects them on the team this season.
The takeaway…
For the first time during this process I believe Jay Cutler may not be the Bears quarterback in 2015.
Ricky Ponting has said that they currently committed to their family, commentary, charity work and their role with IPL franchise Mumbai Indians © Getty Images
Ricky Ponting, the former Australia captain, is not in talks with Cricket Australia about joining the national team as a batting consultant.
Following Australia's surrender of the Ashes with a pair of meek batting displays at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge, there has been much speculation about Ponting being called up to work alongside the nation's young players as a batting consultant.
However Ponting, who returned home to Australia following an Ashes commentary stint in the UK that ended with the Trent Bridge Test, said they had not engaged any formal discussions with CA and was, for the moment, otherwise committed to their job as Mumbai Indians coach, family, commentary and charity work.
"I've had no formal discussions with Cricket Australia about a role," Ponting told ESPNcricinfo. "I have always said that one day I would like to get more involved with the young batters around the country but at the moment I'm fully committed to my family, my coaching job at Mumbai, commentary and sponsor commitments and the Ponting Foundation."
The team's performance manager, Pat Howard, who speaks regularly with Ponting about the game, had told News Ltd that they discussed the possibility earlier this year.
"We have spoken to Ricky a few times this year to be around the side," Howard had said. "I am certainly very open to getting them involved and we would love to have them on board. I sense Ricky would also love to be involved. Their time commitments are obviously one of the big challenges."
The relentless international schedule has been a stumbling block for numerous former greats getting directly involved with the Australian team in recent times. The likes of Shane Warne, Steve Waugh, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist have been engaged by the coach Darren Lehmann to speak to the players, but none have been able to commit to anything more substantial than that.

Hello! It's been a while since our last update, but we just wanted to take a moment to update you on a few things that might be relevant to your tastes. As two people who had a huge impact on Strike Suit Zero, you might be interested to know what's happening with Junji Okubo and Paul Ruskay.
Firstly, Junji - the mechanical designer of Appleseed, Infinite Space and - of course - Strike Suit Zero - has been contributing to a concept art book called 2025 - Visions of the Future, which collates the best work from the Japanese entrepreneurs and designers who are shaping the future. Junji has been dreaming up and designing mechs, ships and other futuristic machinery for many years, and their work is very much at home in the book.
Secondly, Paul Ruskay - the man behind the Strike Suit Zero Soundtrack - has been working on remastered versions of both the Homeworld and Homeworld 2 soundtracks, which are available on Steam now.

Here's Paul talking about their work on the project, which began all the way back in 1998.

Thanks for reading, and until next time,
The Strike Suit Zero team
There are some episodes in an artist's career that seem fresh and exciting at first, but through the passage of time, start to sound clunky and dated. Conversely, there are also those albums which sit largely forgotten until a ten year anniversary like this one comes along and boots you squarely in the jaw to remind you just what a fine piece of work it truly is. Happily, Manic Street Preachers‘ eighth album slots effortlessly into that latter category. Send Away The Tigers, quite simply, is a great record full of quality rock and pop tunes.
The 2017 edition features, naturally, the original album on the first disc, along with various demos of the songs that were (and weren't) comprised within, while the second disc contains a multitude of B-sides and rarities, and finally a third houses, in full, the band's triumphant Glastonbury Festival performance from 2007, along with various promo videos and curiosities such as the boys in rehearsal and a track by track account of SATT. It's fair to say that the Manics have stayed true to their ethics and always represented value for money.
Hand on my heart though, I must be honest – I never expected to be giving Send Away The Tigers a glowing review. I seem to have a distant memory of it being something of a letdown. Either I've warmed to it, the songs simply have matured into fully grown beasts, or – and I must sheepishly admit this is most likely – I never paid it enough attention in the first place. There are some magnificent compositions here, ‘The Second Great Depression‘ perhaps best of all, its lyrics now tragically more pertinent than ever, though single ‘Autumnsong‘ certainly gives it a run for its money, an utterly glorious tune, even if it has a faintly ridiculous pomposity about it. This is the album where the band reverted, mostly, to bare-bones rock ‘n' roll, and you can practically feel the relief bleeding gratefully from James Dean Bradfield's guitar. Frankly, it was needed.
The real fun part of this box set, however, lies mainly in the demos and rarities, which are delightfully diverse and often surprising, such as their terrific version of Rihanna‘s ‘Umbrella‘, a song I'd previously always dismissed merely as throwaway nonsense, so I'm thankful to them for opening my eyes to the notion that it has, in fact, always been a fantastic pop song. And being humbled is something that happened to me several times over during my immersion in this excellent 3 discs set, another occasion being the demo version of ‘Rendition‘, which, had I been a member of the band, and if Bradfield had brought that to me as a potential key album track, I'm pretty sure I would have said “Um…yes…it's very…nice, yes, er…maybe we'll try that later” and changed the subject as quickly as possible, for the rhymes are often cringeworthy, and the falsetto was ‘Orville's Song‘ high. Good job I'm NOT in the band then, as it's one of the standout moments, a rambunctious rocker that harks joyously back to their Generation Terrorists days. Maybe there's a reason none of my bands ever made the big time…
It would be futile to merely give my opinion on the remaining tracks on the original album, however, as we'd just be covering old ground, so let's turn our attention to the DVD, the blistering Glastonbury performance totally justifying the band's place amongst the giants of rock, while the track by track interview with the trio is eye opening and informative, as well as highly amusing, especially if you watch Sean Moore, who sits there silently, looking bored and fed up the whole way through. Very amusing indeed.
In summary though, the album itself gets a more than respectable 8/10 from me, most of its content being the band at their best, but it's impossible not to give the whole package an extra point due to the pure scope of the extras. This is arguably the most essential box set release of 2017 thus far. Just brilliant.

Jerry Springer, once and future pol? (Richard Drew/AP)
Think “Jerry Springer” and you might conjure some of the daytime TV host's greatest talk-show guests. Brawling strippers, maybe, or that mother-daughter dominatrix duo, or maybe the guy who married a horse!
But Springer might soon want you to think of something slightly more serious, like the Ohio governorship. Springer is considering running for office in their home state, they told reporters after a Labor Day rally on Monday. Hmm, a colorful celebrity turning to populist politics? Seems as if we've heard this one before. (There's Donald Trump, of course, and Kid Rock is toying with a Senate run.)
Springer, who has been active in Democratic politics and even served briefly as the mayor of Cincinnati, insisted in an interview with Cleveland.com that this is no publicity stunt. “It's a serious position and it deserves serious consideration,” they said.
Springer would have plenty of company among those seeking the Democratic nomination — the field includes former member of congress Betty Sutton (D-Ohio), former state representative Connie Pillich, former state Senate minority leader Joe Schiavoni and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray is also considering jumping into the ring.
One indication that Springer's name recognition might help? At the Monday rally, supporters reportedly broke into the chant made famous by their in-studio TV audiences: “Jerry, Jerry!”
An Ecuadorean volcano is spewing ash five miles into the air, closely monitored by experts, after an eruption this weekend.
Ash from the Tunguarahua volcano, whose name means ‘Throat of Fire' in the local Quechua language, was blown five miles, 28,000 ft, into the sky and drifted west.
It was the latest eruption from the volcano after a period of calm.

Tunguarahua volcano erupted on 29 July, 4 August and then again on 19 August.
Homes nearby have felt the strength of the eruptions, with the blast causing windows and roofs to vibrate.
Over the weekend the volcano started spewing small pyroclastic flows, a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock which can reach speeds of 450mph and temperatures of about 1,000 C.

Penn repeatedly stresses that the interview was arranged with the help of Mexican actor Kate del Castillo, who played a Sinaloa drug boss in the popular telenovela La Reina del Sur .
"I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats," Chapo reportedly boasted to Penn while eating tacos and drinking tequila together in a seven-hour meeting that began on the night of October 2 and lasted until 4am the next day.
The drug lord's encounter with Penn in October was the first time Chapo has ever been interviewed by any media outlet. The story behind the story involves throwaway cell phones, encrypted messages, a secret rendezvous brokered by a Mexican soap opera star, and, ultimately, Guzmán being taken into custody on Friday by Mexican authorities after a shootout in the coastal town of Los Mochis in the northern part of Sinaloa.
Shortly after the movie star's account of their meeting with the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin was published, a Mexican official told the Associated Press that the encounter helped authorities track Chapo down.
The story of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán was already stranger than fiction — but it took an even more bizarre turn on Saturday night when Rolling Stone published a lengthy feature story authored by the actor Sean Penn, who met the fugitive drug lord at a mountain hideout.

The story of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán was already stranger than fiction — but it took an even more bizarre turn on Saturday night when Rolling Stone published a lengthy feature story authored by the actor Sean Penn, who met the fugitive drug lord at a mountain hideout.
Shortly after the movie star's account of their meeting with the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin was published, a Mexican official told the Associated Press that the encounter helped authorities track Chapo down.

Penn repeatedly stresses that the interview was arranged with the help of Mexican actor Kate del Castillo, who played a Sinaloa drug boss in the popular telenovela La Reina del Sur.

Chapo had developed a messaging relationship with Del Castillo after they published a letter through Twitter in 2012 saying they had more trust in them than in governments, and urged them to start "trafficking with love." They also went with Penn to meet them at an undisclosed location in the Golden Triangle of the Sierra Madre mountains, a lawless region of northwest Mexico that is considered a stronghold of the drug lord's cartel. The actor writes that the drug lord treated them "like a daughter returning from college" when they got there.
Penn described chatting with Guzmán, gaining their trust — Rolling Stone prefaced the story by saying it was "submitted for the subject's approval before publication" — and organizing a more formal two-day sit down interview that was supposed to take place eight days later. That meeting never happened.
The day after Penn and Chapo parted ways, a major navy-led operation began in the Golden Triangle with the authorities later saying that they had nearly captured Guzmán. Penn wrote that a cellphone used by one of Chapo's crew put Mexican authorities on the drug lord's scent.
According to the article, Chapo later sent a note via BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) to Del Castillo explaining what happened.
"On October 6th, there was an operation…two helicopters and 6 BlackHawks began a confrontation upon their arrival," Penn quoted Chapo as writing. "The marines dispersed throughout the farms. The families had to escape and abandon their homes with the fear of being killed. We still don't know how many dead in total."
That raid — and its aftermath on the civilian population in the surrounding area — was detailed in a VICE News documentary.
Watch the VICE News documentary Displaced in Sinaloa: The Hunt for 'El Chapo':
An anonymous Mexican official confirmed to the AP that the Rolling Stone interview did lead them to El Chapo in October, as noted by Penn.
While not naming Penn and Del Castillo directly, Mexico's Attorney General Arely Gómez told reporters after Guzmán's recapture on Friday that the hunt for the capo had received a major boost when it was discovered that they were "intending to film a biographical film, to which end they sought communication with actors and producers."
According to ABC, both Penn and Del Castillo are now under investigation by Mexican authorities for their contact with the then fugitive drug lord. It's unclear what sort of criminal charges — if any — the actors could face.
Penn described struggling with encryption technology in their story, and detailed the lengths to which he, Del Castillo, and two other men who are identified only by nicknames had to go in order to make the meeting with Guzmán happen.
The group reportedly flew on a private jet to an undisclosed city in central Mexico, then met up with Guzmán's 29-year-old son Alfredo Guzmán, who flew with them on a small plane into the Sierra Madre. From there, they drove for several hours into the mountains before meeting Chapo. Penn said the group, including Guzman's son, was waved through a military checkpoint guarded by two uniformed government soldiers.

During the meeting, Penn and Chapo chatted while others translated. The actor bemoaned the fact that they didn't bring a pen and notepad, and said they stuck to question "one couldn't forget the answers too."
One thing Penn remembers is Chapo naming "a host of corrupt major corporations, both within Mexico and abroad" who help them launder money. The drug lord then asked Penn not to publish their names.
After Del Castillo went to bed, Penn noticed an immediate shift in the demeanor of Chapo and their men, who armed themselves to the teeth and dressed in bulletproof vests. After asking Chapo's son to take a photo of the two together, Penn said goodnight to Chapo and farted — an indiscretion they euphemistically refer to as "minor traveler's flatulence."
Penn and Del Castillo left Mexico the next day, but Penn headed back by themselves eight days later for the promised second interview that never took place. Eventually, the movie star sent questions to Chapo via BBM and waited for the kingpin's filmed responses. After a long delay — purportedly because Chapo lacked an English translator, was shy, or lacked the tech savvy to record themselves — the responses arrived in a 17-minute video sent to Del Castillo.
The video begins, "I want to make clear that this interview is for the exclusive use of Miss Kate del Castillo and Mister Sean Penn." So far, Rolling Stone has only released a two-minute clip of the recording.
A screen cap of the recording sent by Chapo Guzmán to Sean Penn.
Chapo's answers are brief and perhaps less revealing than Penn's anecdotes.
The movie star describes Guzmán as smiling constantly, and being surprised to hear that people in the United States knew who they are. They call Donald Trump "mi amigo" and says they met Pablo Escobar once, adding that the legendary Colombian drug lord had a "big house."
According to Penn, Chapo also presented themselves as a family man. In addition to the presence of Alfredo Guzmán, Penn said they also met Chapo's 32-year-old son Iván Archivaldo Guzmán. The capo even told the actor that the original plan had included their mother — who still lives in Chapo's hometown of La Tuna in the mountains of Sinaloa — but "something came up."

In the interview, Chapo describes their humble childhood selling soft drinks and oranges, before they started to grow marijuana and poppies at age 15 because their family had no other way to survive.
Though Penn quoted Chapo as bragging about supplying more drugs "than anybody else in the world," during their face-to-face meeting, the drug lord taped a more humble response to a question about their role in the international drug trade.
Penn asked, "Do you think it is true you are responsible for the high level of drug addiction in the world?" To which Chapo replied, "No, that is false, because the day I don't exist, it's not going to decrease in any way at all. Drug trafficking? That's false."

Former Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation flyweight champion Rocky “The Road Warrior” Fuentes gets a huge break when they fight undefeated Nicaraguan flyweight champion Roman “Chocolotito” Gonzalez for the WBC flyweight title on November 22 in Japan.
ALA Promotions president Michael Aldeguer confirmed the report in a conversation with BoxingScene.com/Manila Standard/Viva Sports and said the offer had come from Teiken Promotions of Akihiko Honda who manages Gonzalez.
Aldeguer said Fuentes, who won the OPBF title with a majority decision over Masafumi Okuba on March 9, 2010 in Japan and successfully defended the title six times, four against Japanese challengers - was popular among Japanese fight fans.
Aldeguer who is scheduled to leave for Carson City, California on Thursday to watch the featherweight unification battle between WBA super champion Nonito “The Filipino Flash” Donaire and the heavy-handed unbeaten Jamaican Nicholas Walters predicted the Fuentes-Gonzalez clash” would be a great fight.”
Well known American strength and conditioning coach Nick Curson told the Standard that Gonzalez who sparred with Fuentes in preparation for their title fight against WBC flyweight champion Akira Yaegashi from whom they won the title with a 9th round TKO probably believes that they could handle Fuentes who, according to Curson, was not in good shape when they sparred with Gonzalez.
Curson told us that “with the improvements Rocky has made it will make a big difference.”
Curson who is also working with WBO light flyweight champion Donnie Nietes and Milan Melindo who has dropped down to light flyweight and undefeated Prince Albert Pagara said Gonzalez will face “a very different Rocky Fuentes who will give them a very rough fight and could pull off an upset.”
They said that in the past Fuentes “could never compete with Nietes and Melindo in sparring but its different now and Rocky looks good.”
Curson said if Gonzalez “makes one wrong move, the fight could be over” although they conceded “it works both ways.”
The 28 year old Fuentes who is ranked No. 8 by the WBC lost by a unanimous twelve round decision when they faced Thailand's Amnat Ruenroeng for the vacant IBF flyweight title last January 22 in Thailand while Gonzalez who moved up from light flyweight where they successfully defended the WBA title eight times to flyweight where they won the title with a 9th round TKO over Japan's Akira Yaegeshi who they dropped in rounds 3 and 9 to score a rousing victory and push their unbeaten streak to 40-0 with 34 knockouts.
Fuentes has a record of 35-7-2 with 20 knockouts.
Aside from Heath, this was the only other character from the Monster High boys I really wanted to have.
Invisi Billy is something of a departure from the “Mansters” we've seen so far since he's the first to have actual rooted hair. I really love the outfit and accessories they come with since it looks a lot like what a student would normally wear. Most boys don't care that much about fashion. THANK YOU, MATTEL!
Everything about this guy; sculpt, accessories and all are perfect for me except I would have wanted their eyes to be a little smaller. I wouldn't have wanted to alter them at all if it weren't for how huge their eyes are. I know that it's intentionally the style or the look for the character but I'd like to reduce their eye size just a little bit.
Unlike Heath, he's got protruding cheek bones much like Spectra and skin color that matches with Lagoona Blue (yay!). Heath and Invisi Billy's sculpts have a lot in common but I still prefer Heath's.
Invisi Billy suffers a bit in having such a small mouth and huge eyes. The effect works really well for girls but not so much for boys. Hence, the magic of facial hair!
If your Ghouls are feeling lonely, Invisi Billy is available at the Etsy Shop!
Correction 9/10/2014: Invisi Billy isn't the first MH boy to have rooted hair, it's Jackson. =P I still think they were the first to wear something that is usual for a teenage boy.
Gangs have settled in the Demirler Farm in Reyhanlı. One worker talked about the situation in the farm and said the gang leaders speak Arabic among themselves to discuss Syria and don't leave the building during the day unless absolutely necessary. The workers are not allowed to enter the compound with phones, cameras or any electronic devices and they are searched on their way out.
A worker in Demirler Farm (Reyhanli Inc.) in Reyhanli exposed the activities of Hatay's biggest company and said leaders of armed groups with beards and turbans are staying in the villas in the farm.
DİHABER continues to publish articles on the borderline their reporter Erdoğan Alayumat was able to send before they were detained and consequently arrested.
Alayumat's article titled “Armed groups' farm” includes the following:
COMPANY PROCURES ARMS AND LOGISTICS FOR GANGS
Reyhanli Inc. (also known as Demirler Farm) in the Reyhanli district of Hatay, which has been turned into headquarters for the war, is infamous for providing arms and logistical support for radical groups with the start of the Syrian civil war. The activity along the borderline in recent weeks is reflected in the Reyhanli Demirler Farm, with AKP's Hatay MP Fevzi Şanverdi among the partners, as high-ranking administrators of gangs like Al Nusra and Ahrar Al Sham are hosted in the farm.
PROFITING OF WAR
Reyhanli Inc. has been one of the companies that have profited the most from the war, handling the “shady” business for the MİT and the police over the farm for a long time. The farm, when viewed from outside, resembles a military barracks. Six years ago the farm was used to shelter animals mostly, but with the start of the war it grew rapidly, turning into one of the most profitable companies in Hatay in the last 6 years.
GANG LEADERS STAY IN VILLAS IN THE FARM
There are communal areas like a market and a mosque inside the farm compound, and the company also purchased neighboring plots. Luxury villas were built in place of the now-demolished huts that used to host the farmworkers, and reports say leaders of gangs like Al Nusra and Ahrar Al Sham are staying in these villas. Neighbors of the farm say there is constant activity inside the farm compound, which has been out of commission for 3 years.
Reports of white colored vehicles being sent to Idlib where groups in the FSA have taken control have been published in the media, and the company was reported to have made millions of dollars this way. The company provided arms and logistical support for these groups for a long time, and with the recent increase in border activity, is seen to continue where they left off. The recently-built 3-story villas catch the eye in the farm compound, while the locals say the company's owners and leaders from the Idlib region gangs stay in them. Same sources had also claimed the farm engaged in arms transport before. The sources say strangers with beards and turbans regularly stay in the villas in the farm.
farmworker'S ACCOUNT
A member of the cleaning crew who wishes to remain anonymous claimed all the guests in the farm are gang leaders. The worker said these people are coming not just from Syria but from other cities in Turkey, and that they don't know which cities they are from but they use armored vehicles when they go out. The men don't leave the villas during the day unless absolutely necessary, don't talk to the few workers in the farm and speak Arabic among themselves.
The worker said the gang leaders come together in the evenings to talk, and the subject of their discussions is mostly Syria. The worker also said they see new people in the farm all the time, and that the newcomers usually arrive at night. The workers are not allowed inside with phones, cameras or any other electronics: “A couple of months ago, a worker had their phone on him. When it was found out, the man was taken directly to the police station. We heard they were released afer a day in custody, but we never heard of them again.”
The worker said armed men stand guard outside the villas 24/7. The villas are also guarded by CCTV. Workers are allowed in following a detailed search, and allowed out after another detailed search when their shifts are over. When the cleaning crew go into the villas, armed men watch them constantly.
Twitter has suspended the account of Jayda Fransen, the leader of nationalist U.K. party Britain First whose graphic anti-Muslim videos President Donald Trump retweeted last month, causing an uproar.
Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, an anti-Islam, anti-immigration and nationalist political party, had their account suspended on Monday in a purge by the social media platform of accounts that are deemed to “promote violence against civilians.”
Also targeted by Twitter's purge was the official Britain First account, as well as the account of the party leader Paul Golding.
The deputy leader was catapulted into the limelight in late November after Trump retweeted three of their tweets, which included graphic – and unverified — videos posted to spread fear of Muslims.
One of the videos, with the caption “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!”, even led the Netherlands Embassy to inform Trump it was fake (the attacker in the video was a Dutch-born national).
Despite the intense backlash — even an Infowars editor said the retweets were “not great optics” — the videos were never removed from Trump's account.
When questioned, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the president was unaware they were retweeting the leader of a hate group, but added that even if the videos were fake, “the threats are real.”
Fransen, who is on currently on bail after being charged with religiously aggravated harassment in September, celebrated the presidential endorsement after Trump retweeted her, writing “GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP! GOD BLESS AMERICA!”

Police in Kansas were searching for a suspect after three people were found dead on Sunday outside a home near Hesston, a rural area about 35 miles northwest of Wichita.
Authorities said an 18-month-old baby was found alive inside the home.
The Kansas Highway Patrol on Sunday said there was no active search for a suspect, KWCH-TV reported, but police on Monday said they were searching for a suspect. None was immediately identified, KAKE-TV reported.
Harvey County Sheriff Townsend Walton said they couldn't provide any details on a possible motive for the killings.
In a statement, police in Newton, located in rural Harvey County, Kansas, said the shooting was reported around 5:30 p.m. local time, when Harvey County 911 received a call from a motorist who had been flagged down and told about the shooting.
Walton called the shooting "a targeted event," adding, "I believe everybody is safe right now."
One of the victims, a male, was in their 50s, The Hutchinson News reported. The other two, a male and female, were believed to be in their mid-30s.
The baby, who was not hurt, belonged to the couple, police said.
The victims' identities were not immediately released.

BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) — Several gunmen forcibly entered the Burundi office of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, officials said Wednesday. The break-in occurred a week after a new U.N. report detailed crimes against humanity in the East African country and named security forces among the alleged perpetrators.
“A group of armed men went into our office in the middle of the night, at around 2:30 a.m.,” U.N. human rights office spokesperson Rupert Colville in Geneva told The Associated Press. “The alarm was raised pretty quickly, and they left. Nobody was harmed. An investigation is under way.”
The identities of the gunmen were not known, they said. “We don't know what this is all about.”
Six gunmen “intimidated” the guards before entering, an employee in the Burundi office said. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak to reporters.
Burundian police said the incident had not been reported.
The U.N. commission of inquiry report released last week said crimes against humanity, including killings and sexual violence, are being committed in Burundi amid political unrest. It asked the International Criminal Court to open an investigation as soon as possible.
Alleged perpetrators include top officials in Burundi's National Intelligence Services and police force, military officials and members of the youth league of the ruling party, known as Imbonerakure, said the report, which was based on interviews with more than 500 witnesses.
Burundi has seen political violence since April 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced they would seek a disputed third term. Nkurunziza won re-election despite widespread protests, and the country has remained volatile. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country.
“We were struck by the scale and the brutality of the violations. We also noted a lack of will on the part of the Burundian authorities to fight against impunity,” Fatsah Ouguergouz, president of the commission, said last week. Burundi's government refused to cooperate with the commission and did not allow its members to enter the country.

The watchers become the watched in “PYLON,” a dance performance at Olympic Sculpture Park that reacts to — and records — its audience.
As an audience member at a dance performance, I have the luxury of sitting unobserved by the artists I am watching. I can clap at things I like and grimace at things I don't, all from the comfortable anonymity of my dark theater seat. But how would I behave if the performance were happening all around me, in an arena where the audience is as visible to the dancers?
Audiovisual artist Ethan Folk, co-creator of the living installation “PYLON” (with choreographer Coleman Pester), believes that an audience will react very differently to a performance that takes place beyond the proscenium stage.
“Audience's actions,” they said, “are driven by that central concept of identity: How we see ourselves, and how that changes based on our perceptions of how we're being watched.” This weekend at Seattle Art Museum's Olympic Sculpture Park, “PYLON” audiences will be part of that experiment — a mix of dance and media that will respond to its viewers in real time.
Dance preview ‘PYLON' 7 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 20, Olympic Sculpture Park, Broad Street and Elliott Avenue, Seattle; free but RSVP requested (206-654-3100 or seattleartmuseum.org).
“PYLON” will take place at night in the Olympic Sculpture Park pavilion, where attendees will be guided by flight attendants through a variety of installations and movement exercises. A large architectural structure — designed and built by Cameron Irwin — will house cameras and projectors that gather images from the show and project them onto various surfaces, shifting audience members' focus between the artists and themselves.
As the evening progresses, Folk said, the flight attendants will invite audience members to participate in a series of directed tasks. In one, flight attendants will create two lines of attendees and instruct them to observe each other while trying to block out all the other activities in the room. Small groups of audience members will be led through dancers as they perform, sometimes instructed to watch only one dancer at a time.
Movement based on the choreography of Coleman Pester, founder of the local, experimental-performance group Tectonic Marrow Society, will be performed by Pester and local dancers Jody Kuehner (also known as the performance-art drag queen Cherdonna Shinatra), Lucie Baker and Marlys Yvonne.
While some of the dancing will be improvised based on audience reactions, Folk said Pester's choreography is particularly well-suited to the Olympic Sculpture Park pavilion: “Architecture is central to Coleman's work,” Folk explained, and uses “the influence of harsh structures and the way they frame tender, fluid movements.” Audiovisual designs by Matthew Witschonke and live music by Maiah Manser and James Squires, also created in real time, will accompany the dancing.
“PYLON” promises to be like visiting a museum where you can reach out and touch the art without setting off an alarm — and transform some of the mystery and inaccessibility of contemporary dance into a visible, friendly, tangible process.
Former Supreme Court judge, Justice Markandey Katju, has stoked a new controversy by saying that they supported their fellow Brahmin Ravana.
Taking to Facebook, the former Press Council of India chairperson said, “I am a Brahmin, and, therefore, I support Ravana, my fellow Brahmin. Just as Yadavs support Mulayam Singh and Laloo, dalits support Mayawati, and Muslims of Hyderabad support Owaisi. How can I support someone who cut off my fellow Brahmin's head ?
“Brahmins of India unite ! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win. Brahmin unity zindabad !”
In a tweet, Katju said that Ravana was a much vilified man in their opinion.
They tweeted, “I think Ravana was a much villified man. If someone cuts off your sister's nose, will you not get enraged?”
I think Ravana was a much villified man. If someone cuts off your sister's nose, will you not get enraged ? — Markandey Katju (@mkatju) September 20, 2016
Known for their plainspeak, Justice Katju was in news recently for their comments on the Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who had described as somebody with nothing in their head.
Bachchan had then responded by agreeing with them saying that indeed they had nothing in their head.
“He (Katju) is right I don't have anything inside my mind.  They are right…My head is ‘khalas' (finished),” Bachchan said when asked about the comment made on them by the former Supreme Court Judge, known for their hard-hitting and often controversial views on a rash of issues.
At a time when the veteran actor is receiving praise for their performance in “Pink”, a social thriller which revolves around the issue of women's empowerment, Justice Katju had a different take on their on-screen talent.
On September 17, the ex-Judge posted on their their social media page, “Amitabh Bachchan is a man with nothing in their head, and since most mediapersons praise him, I doubt there is anything in their heads too.”
“We were in same school. They were my senior. There is no rivalry,” said the 73-year-old actor in response to a question at a press conference.
Denouncing “corruption, crime and cronyism at the highest levels of state government,” Mr. Hubbard created a sophisticated — some have said legally questionable — fund-raising machine to win control of the State House in 2010. Chairman of both the State Republican Party and the House caucus, they conscripted candidates — bank employees, foresters, waste haulers — and determined where campaign money should be spent.
In November 2010, the Republicans not only took over the State House for the first time in 136 years, they won a supermajority, winning every court race on the ballot and every statewide office. Mr. Bentley, a dermatologist and low-profile legislator, was elected governor. Mr. Hubbard was unanimously elected speaker of the House, where their first priority was to pass an ethics law described as among the strongest in the country.
Four years later, Mr. Hubbard was indicted on a charge of violating that ethics law, accused of using their positions as speaker and party chairperson to solicit work and investments for their own financial interest by steering campaign work to their business interests and pushing bills that helped their consulting clients.
That their moneymaking plans were running into the ethics law they helped pass is something they are shown lamenting in private emails released by prosecutors. “Who proposed those things?!” they wrote, apparently jokingly, to Mr. Riley, the former governor. “What were we thinking?” They would eventually argue in court that the ethics law was unconstitutional.
Still, Mr. Hubbard remains the speaker and enjoys steadfast support in the House. This is in part because Democrats and their backers have been almost completely frozen out of state politics.
But Mr. Flynt and others say there is more to it than the lack of competition. The speed and scale of the Republican takeover brought into power a class of politicians inexperienced with total control, some with no political experience at all. There was little candidate-grooming infrastructure in the party beyond what Mr. Hubbard and their allies put together; at one point, they suggested the creation of a “shadow party,” something that would be effectively achieved by way of political action committees.
“Hubbard's problems permeated the whole Legislature,” said Arthur Payne, a former Republican state representative. “The majority felt like they owed their allegiance to them rather than the people of Alabama.”

Bombs do not discriminate. We know that the people wounded or killed from the Boston Marathon explosions were of all ages, all colors, and all beliefs. Yet, people without faith were explicitly excluded from the interfaith service attended by the president over a week ago. In a city where nearly half the population seldom or never attends religious services, organizers of the event didn't invite a single representative from the vibrant non-religious community to say a few words in mourning. Such a speech would not have been anti-God; it would simply have been without God, because it is, in fact, possible to grieve over lost loved ones without invoking the supernatural.
You may argue that the word “interfaith,” by definition, excludes those without faith, but the event was billed as an all-inclusive memorial service and that is the spirit in which the atheists saw it. Because of the snub, local humanists were forced to create a makeshift memorial service at a later date and create an online petition urging government officials to meet with them in coming weeks to hear their stories and ensure that “healing and unity will include everyone” in the future. Atheists online also donated more than $28,000 to various local charities in a matter of days, all without much publicity or fanfare, to help those (of all backgrounds) who suffered because of the attacks.
But the organizers of the memorial event weren't the only people leaving atheists in the dust. When the Boy Scouts of America announced last week that they may finally allow gay scouts in their ranks, the loudest reactions came from progressives who were (rightfully) upset that gay leaders would still be banned. (Apparently, you can be a gay scout until you become an adult at which point they kick you right back out.) However, the ensuing controversy all-but-ignored the fact that, even if the change allowed gay people of all ages, atheists would still be forbidden from becoming scouts because they are neither “reverent” to God (as required by scout law) nor able to do their “duty to God” (as required by the scout oath). In other words, an organization that prides itself on building character and developing responsible citizens does not believe atheists are capable of holding those values. One of the reasons for this continuing form of discrimination was brought up by the New Yorker‘s Richard Socarides: “Catholic and Mormon church hierarchies sponsor and fund much of the Boy Scouts' activities.” While the BSA may cave in to outside (and even inside) pressure to allow some gay people into their ranks, their religious landlords still prevent them from accept scouts who may not believe in a higher power.
This exclusion isn't limited to the United States, either. Atheists Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans have been renting out space in a de-consecrated church in London owned by the Church of England to host what they're calling The Sunday Assembly (better known in the media as “The Atheist Church”). The Sunday morning gatherings occur once a month and are marked by inspirational songs, guest speakers and joyous community, all without paying any homage to the supernatural — their motto is “Live better, help often and wonder more.” The events have become so popular, in fact, that two services now take place to hold the growing “godless congregation” and the founders are looking for a larger space.
Unfortunately, they may have to find permanent space sooner than they expected. Trustees from the Steiner School (housed in the same church) have kicked them out of the building. While the trustees cited safety reasons (too many people in the building), Jones contends there's a less benevolent reason for the eviction. They said that some of the trustees found The Sunday Assembly to be “antithetical to their own ethos.” You can decide for yourself whether it was the living better, helping often, or wondering more that upset them the most.
In fact, The Sunday Assembly has complied with all safety regulations, including turning people away at the door if the crowds were getting too large.
In all of these instances, kind, well-intentioned atheists were excluded on the basis of their beliefs, by people who often claim their faith makes them more moral, more noble, and more generous than those who don't possess it. Indeed, we are finding that faith is not a virtue. If it were, you would not see atheists being banned from an interfaith (or, to phrase it more accurately, interthought) event meant to honor people of all backgrounds and beliefs. You would not see atheists kicked out of the Boy Scouts of America when scouting organizations around the world (not to mention the Girl Scouts of the USA) have accepted atheists in their ranks without a problem. And I doubt you would see church groups renege on their contract at the last second if they were dealing with another religious group.
Why is healing, helping and honoring fellow citizens so alarming when it's atheists who want to do it? Why are religious groups opposing inclusion and equality? There's simply no good reason atheists should be left out in these particular cases. The fact that they are suggests prejudice built up over the course of several decades — a belief that the atheists would ruin the event, offend religious sensibilities, or make organizers look bad. That couldn't be further from the truth. The atheists here are not arguing theology or debating religion; there's a time and place for that, well beyond these particular instances. They are just asking for the same treatment all other groups receive. We're left wondering why atheists are held in such low esteem by people who claim that their faith makes them better people. Right now, their faith serves only as an obstacle to common sense.
An oil drilling rig owned by Shell ran aground in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska on New Year's Eve amid a storm that had forced the crew to evacuate, the U.S. Coast Guard told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The ship, the Kulluk, was built in the 1980s and carries about 150,000 gallons of fuel and another 12,000 gallons of oil and hydraulic fluid. It reportedly ran aground around 9 p.m. on Monday night after a tugboat cut its ties to the vessel for safety reasons.
Although the company claims the ship is “as Arctic ready as it's possible to be,” Coast Guard officials said Tuesday that a spill is “possible” and that response teams are standing by. A crew of 17 men was evacuated from the Kulluk on Saturday amid efforts to tow the ship to shore.

SPOILER ALERT: This story continues details about tonight's episode of the CW's Legends of Tomorrow.
EXCLUSIVE: Tonight's episode of DC's Legends of Tomorrow featured a shocking development involving Wentworth Miller's character Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold. I can reveal that the major event is a precursor to a status change for Miller, who was a regular on the first season of the team-up superhero drama series after recurring on Flash. They will no longer be a regular on Legends but has entered a series regular contract with Legends producing studio Warner Bros. TV, with their duties spread over the different Greg Berlanti DC shows, for the time being Legends and Flash.
Miller's Legends arc was designed to have an end from the get-go as the actor had sought and signed a short-term deal. “We always knew that they wouldn't be a permanent member of The Waverider,” Legends of Tomorrow, Flash and Arrow co-creator/executive producer Greg Berlanti said in an interview with Deadline. “We also knew we loved them on the show and all the shows, Flash as well.”
So Berlanti and their team pitched Miller a new arrangement where they would have flexibility and recur on multiple shows simultaneously as Snart. “What it really emulates to us is the comic books themselves where there really are a cast of characters,” Berlanti said. While Miller, who also has been filming the Prison Break followup, “won't be part of the team of Legends on board of The Waverider next year, they will have a very active role on the show.”
Miller's is “the first contract not applicable to just one show,” Berlanti said. “In success we hope to continue with other characters finding their way across all the shows.”
Spoiler Alert! On tonight's episode of Legends, the Time Council revealed to Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) that they have been controlling the Legends actions through a device called the Oculus, aiding Vandal Savage's rise to power. To defeat Vandal, the team tries to destroy the Oculus but there is a fail safe that must be manually held in place, and it is Snart who sacrifices themselves and is killed in the explosion.
“He is a guy who who was a villain at the beginning, finding the hero in them by the end,” Berlanti said.
Because of the time-travel nature of Legends, dying on the show is not permanent.
Legends are built for flexibility with the core team. “One of joys and advantages is that it allows us to change in success who is on The Waverider and not,” Berlanti said. “Flash and Arrow are very much about building one team, while there is an anthology element to Legends.”
Legends already is recruiting two new team members for next season, casting a male and female new regulars.
“Every year for this show people should expect a new adventure,” said Berlanti, dropping a few hints about Season 2. “There will be new teammates, a new big bad. Mixing and matching things is part of the fun of the show.”
Complexity is expensive. That's just as true of tax systems and economies as it is of manufacturing processes and prices.
As rising powers in Asia, South America and elsewhere develop increasingly competitive legal systems, workforces and infrastructure, our unwieldy and cumbersome tax code is becoming an obstacle to investment and growth that we can no longer afford to ignore.
Just look at the difference between our tax system and Hong Kong's – at over 17,000 pages, a pile of Tolley's Tax Handbooks tower over their 267-page counterpart.
Complicated taxes put significant burdens on businesses. Small firms, in particular, are at a big disadvantage, having to negotiate that labyrinthine system with limited resources.
Worse still is tax uncertainty; with annual Finance Acts running to hundreds of pages, making sensible business decisions for the long term becomes all the more difficult.
Despite recent optimism, the economy remains mired in a long period of sluggish growth and poor productivity. But we can do something about it. Radical reforms to business taxes will help to pull us out of the mire.
The final report of the 2020 Tax Commission, which the TaxPayers' Alliance ran with the Institute of Directors, recommended sweeping reforms to the tax system. The key proposal was a single proportionate tax of 30pc above a generous personal allowance.
This would cut tax for everyone, because even if you ignore the employer's National Insurance, the current basic rate of tax is actually 32pc once the employee's contributions are factored in.
Of course, we shouldn't ignore employers' contributions. In the same way that your TV doesn't pay the TV licence, ultimately business doesn't pay taxes. People do. High taxes supposedly on businesses always mean lower wages for workers, lower returns for shareholders or higher prices for customers.
So the commission proposed abolishing taxes on capital and labour disguised as business taxes. They should be replaced with a single tax on distributed income levied at the same rate as labour income.
Incentives for entrepreneurs would improve substantially without corporation tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. If they were replaced with a single tax on capital income, the top marginal rate on income earned, saved, invested in a company and passed on to children would be significantly cut.
Not only would this make economic sense by substantially sharpening incentives, it would also remove large swathes of the loopholes and ambiguities in the system that make it opaque and untrustworthy.
Sounds good, doesn't it?
But there's a big, big problem – the Government still spends far too much of our money for such a lean system to be realistic. And for all the talk of austerity, spending will still be 43pc of GDP by 2015, according to OBR projections.
To implement the kind of reforms proposed by the 2020 Tax Commission, we need to reduce spending to around 33pc of national income. Rolling back spending to this level needn't mean destitution. The governments of Australia and Switzerland spend roughly that share of their economies. There are differences between theirs and ours, but they show that spending a third of your national income doesn't equal disaster. There has been a lot of talk of austerity, but it perhaps hasn't happened on a scale that matches the publicity.
But credit where credit is due – many departments and councils have gone on major efficiency drives, trimming the fat and improving processes. The Cabinet Office is doing a lot of working on improving IT procurement, for instance, which has been a thorn in the side of successive governments.
But, looking at the bigger picture, there is still far too much wasteful spending going on, from the humble town hall all the way up to the European Commission.
Big savings are there to be made. The National Audit Office found that better use of public sector office space could save £830m. Civil servants are still entitled to 2.5 “privilege days” off, for the Queen's birthday and Maundy Thursday. This costs taxpayers around £180m a year.
We could save £1bn by prescribing whichever is the cheapest between generic drugs and the branded alternative.
And the new TaxPayers' Alliance War on Waste campaign will pick out smaller cases of profligacy as well, such as the £70 spent by the Forestry Commission on a bunny suit. It might seem like a trivially small amount of money, but it matters: somebody worked for that £70 and had it taken from their wages. Changing the mindset of public servants, so that they act as responsible guardians of taxpayers' money, is crucial.
But for a long-term, sustainable reduction in the size of the state we also need to re-think what it actually does. The size and scale of the quango state must be properly addressed, too. When the coalition Government came to power in 2010, some organisations – like Becta, an IT supplier for schools – were put out to pasture immediately. Other so-called abolitions were less impressive, though.
Government funding of charities has grown over recent years. In fact, according to research by the Institute of Economic Affairs, 27,000 charities are dependent on the Government for over 75pc of their income. Not only is this a pernicious development for charity independence, it also indicates that the state's tentacles are too far-reaching.
Of course, structural reforms and re-thinking the role of the state will take time. But it is the big challenge facing the next government, regardless of its political make-up.
Health care and pensions are only going to become more costly in the near future and we need a proper discussion about how we finance them in the long term.
Growth-maximising spending levels are far lower than the current 44pc of GDP. There is an extensive body of academic literature out there backing that up. At the moment, the state is simply too big and most politicians don't have a solution.
But if we get spending under control, we can make the reforms to the tax system that would secure our future prosperity.

Seven families sue state of Victoria over parolee crime
Updated
Relatives of seven Victorians who were murdered or sexually assaulted by convicted criminals on parole or on supervision orders have officially lodged legal proceedings against the State Government.
Spearheaded by Noelle Dickson, the mother of murder victim Sarah Cafferkey, the families are seeking compensation accusing the State of Victoria of negligence and breaching its duty of care.
Sarah Cafferkey, 22, was bashed and stabbed by Steven James Hunter at their Bacchus Marsh unit north-west of Melbourne in 2012 and dumped in a wheelie bin.
It was Hunter's second murder and they had just finished a period of parole for other violent offences when they killed Ms Cafferkey.
The families of murder victims, Raechel Betts, Joanne Wicking, Evan Rudd and Douglas Philips, have now lodged official writs with the court, claiming the system failed them.
Writs allege state was 'responsible' for offenders
All writs lodged with the County Court argued the state was at all times responsible for the offenders, including assessing the suitability of the prisoner's release, putting in place suitable conditions of parole, including proper monitoring and was responsible for protecting the community against offenders.
Raechel Betts, 27, was murdered in August, 2009, by serial killer John Leslie Coombes, 56, while they were on parole. It was their third murder.
Joanne Wicking, 29, was killed in front of their four children by Sean Maraffko in 2010. They were on parole having been released from prison just 18 days earlier.
Evan Rudd, 29, was killed by serial offender Richard Stephen Devries during an argument over a car parking spot in Moe in 2011. Devries had 80 convictions dating back to 1991 and was on parole for assault at the time.
Douglas Phillips was killed by their parolee son Christopher Phillips at Frankston North.
Two families of victims of sex offenders who breached supervision orders under the Serious Sexual Offenders Act were joining the lawsuit.
At least one other family was also expected to join the fight for compensation.
Compassion for families involved
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said they had empathy and compassion for the families involved.
"What has occurred to those families and indeed to others is a tragedy and we send our best wishes to those families," the Premier said.
"I'm sure we have, all of us, just some inkling of the pain they have to live through every day.
"As [the matters are] before the courts though I wouldn't want to comment any further than that."
There have been numerous reports and reviews into the parole system's failings over the years.
A report by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan resulted in a raft of legislative changes regarding parole and supervision of offenders.
The failures of the system were again placed under the spotlight in the recent Harper Review following the brutal stabbing of 17-year-old Masa Vukotic by Sean Christian Price while they were on bail and on a 10-year serious sex offender supervision order.
The Andrews Government has vowed to implement stricter management of sex offenders including the creation of a new "public protection" agency.

The good times continue to roll on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrial average stormed above the 24,000 mark for the first time on Thursday as investors reacted joyously to news that the Senate appeared close to passing its tax overhaul bill.
The blue-chip index gained 331.67 points, to close at 24,272.35 — the fifth 1,000-point plateau scaled this year and the sixth since President Trump was elected last year.
The updraft under much of Thursday's Dow rise was generated after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), once a critic of the chamber's tax bill, said they now supported it.
“I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle-class families,” McCain said in a statement.
A Senate vote on the bill is expected by Friday.
Tax cuts would give “greater incentive for companies to increase capital expenditures, which would obviously mean continuation of solid earnings growth,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, told The Post.
The Senate bill could lower corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent — though few companies in the S&P 500 pay that much.
“A lot of investors are focused on 35 percent, but they need to be focused on the effective rate,” which is closer to 26 percent, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told The Post.
Senate Republicans are reportedly weighing tweaking the rate cut to 21-to-22 percent.
“Twenty-two percent doesn't make this a horrible bill,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). “It's like making a cocktail. If you've got to add more of this and less of that, I'm fine. Failure is not an option.”
The Dow's meteoric rise since President Trump was elected last year is one of several data points that show that Trump is having a positive affect on the economy.
In addition:
The US gross domestic product increased 3.3 percent in the third quarter, after rising 3 percent in the second quarter.
Housing prices in 20 large US cities in September rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase in more than three years.
The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is the lowest since December 2000.
“Another milestone is not a surprise in a year where we've hit more than 50 all-time highs,” Ablin said.
The S&P 500 index also hit a fresh record, gaining 21.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,647.58.
The Nasdaq composite indec added 49.58 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,873.97 after getting weighed down on Wednesday by sell-offs in tech stocks.
There's a tendency to think that ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft will help seriously reduce congestion in major cities. If that's the case, San Francisco hasn't seen it. City officials are now reportedly considering “legal action” against the state of California to obtain location data of records of tens of thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers that, according to the San Francisco Examiner, “may help planners alleviate traffic congestion.”
The Examiner reports that the California Public Utilities Commission has in its possession the location data of “the tens of thousand of Uber and Lyft vehicles on San Francisco streets.” But the commission refuses to hand over the records. From the Examiner:
“[I] asked the City Attorney to look through legal action with the state PUC and force them to share this information with us,” [San Francisco supervisor Ahsha] Safai said. “The idea that they have data they don't want to share with a locality that could potentially help us to plan and make better decisions is absurd.” Safai said he's not the sharpest critic of Uber and Lyft, like others in San Francisco, but noted some city entities like the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency pointed to ride-hails as a source of traffic woes. Previously, the CPUC told the San Francisco Examiner that Uber and Lyft “mark the data as confidential under Public Utilities Code section 583.” That section states that no information furnished to the commission by a public utility “or any business which is a subsidiary or affiliate of a public utility, or a corporation which holds a controlling interest in a public utility, except those matters specifically required to be open to public inspection by this part” shall be open to public inspection.

This sort of Ride Sharing Actually Causes Congestion theory doesn't track at all with recent studies.
A report by MIT researchers released in January, for instance, said a computer model-generated scenario showed that just 3,000 Uber and Lyft vehicles—when utilizing the services' carpool methods—could replace all of New York City's 14,000-plus taxi fleet.
A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that 3,000 four-passenger cars could serve 94 percent of demand in New York City, while 2,000 ten-person vehicles could fulfill 95 percent of demand—and with an average wait time of just 2.7 minutes and a trip delay of about 3.5 minutes. To make this efficiency a reality, however, most passengers would have to use the carpool feature on their Uber or Lyft apps, requiring them to share their ride with others and make multiple stops along the way.
Advertisement
That's a hard sell, anyway, as Uber and Lyft's carpool features aren't generally liked by drivers or riders.
But as San Francisco's situation shows, there's also just a substantially higher amount of ride-sharing service drivers on the road, making it seem damn-near impossible that Uber and Lyft will ever lead to a reduction of congestion.
Queensland national park land facing resumption for Defence base expansion, Minister says
Posted
About 5,000 hectares of national park and conservation land in central Queensland is included in an extensive area facing Federal Government acquisition for a military base expansion, the State Government says.
The Defence Department is aiming to take over a swathe of land around Shoalwater Bay, near Rockhampton, under Australian Defence Force plans to accommodate more than 14,000 Singaporean troops who will be training in the region.
Last week, the Queensland Government condemned the plan, saying it could mean the state lost grazing land for about 100,000 head of cattle.
Agriculture Minister Bill Byrne said the State Government was not made aware of the extent of land required under the deal, and that it would devastate the Queensland beef industry.
National Parks Minister Steven Miles has gone further, saying the plan also involves acquiring conservation areas including national parks.
"That's 5,000 fewer hectares that will be part of Queensland's protected area estate if Malcolm Turnbull has their way," Dr Miles said.
"We're very concerned about that plan and what could happen to that conservation land, including the 11 endangered species that call that conservation park home.
"It will also isolate another 540 hectares of conservation park, leaving it disjointed from the rest of our protected areas.
"That can leave wildlife isolated, unable to travel through the corridors that they're used to travelling through."
"It can leave genetic pools isolated and really threaten the survival of certain species."
Dr Miles said they had written to the Commonwealth demanding a briefing on the details of the plan.
"This is land that's currently protected, and if by acquiring it they intend to clear it we'd be very, very concerned."
"Usually when national park needs to be rescinded and used for some other purpose we have a five-to-one compensation arrangement."
Defence Minister Marise Payne has been contacted for comment.

Yahoo has finally opened its doors to a possible sale of its core internet business after facing another turbulent year of declining business and eroding market value. This comes at a time CEO Marissa Mayer is still hoping for a turnaround of the early internet star.
Yahoo on Tuesday (2 February) announced its results for the fourth quarter of 2015. It reported revenues of $1.3bn (£900m; €1.2bn) and a loss of $4.4bn on account of a goodwill impairment.
The troubled internet portal has been under extreme pressure from investors to sell its core assets, and perhaps the entire company. According to the Financial Times, telecom companies like Verizon and AT&T, and digital media groups such as IAC are potential suitors.
In a statement, Yahoo chairperson Maynard Webb said: "Separating our Alibaba stake from our operating business continues to be a primary focus and our most direct path to value maximization. In addition to continuing work on the reverse spin, which we've discussed previously, we will engage on qualified strategic proposals."
Mayer still announced a transformation plan to return to "modest and accelerating" growth in 2017 and 2018. The plan would explore ways to reduce costs by $400m and raise around $1bn to $3bn from sale of non-strategic assets, patents and real estate.
"By the end of 2016, the company anticipates having approximately 9,000 employees and fewer than 1,000 contractors. This represents a workforce that is roughly 42% smaller than it was in 2012," Mayer said. The job cuts were estimated at 1,700, or about 15% of its total workforce.
Under Mayer's plan, Yahoo would consolidate its businesses and global presence. It would shut operations in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan, and increase focus in growth markets like the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
It would also close down services including Games and Smart TV, and Yahoo Screen, and simplify its product portfolio to three platforms — Search, Mail, and Tumblr — besides focussing on specific verticals of news, sports, finance and lifestyle.
Mayer said: "We concluded that the carrying value of our US & Canada, Europe, Latin America and Tumblr reporting units exceeded their respective estimated fair values." The US remained Yahoo's biggest market, accounting for 80% of the company's revenue, followed by the Asia Pacific region which contributed about 13%.
Once a leading internet company that brought the dot.com boom, Yahoo's revenue has declined from $7bn in 2008 to less than $5bn as it lost market share to Google and Microsoft. The company holds a 40% stake worth $25bn in Alibaba, a China-based e-commerce company.
The German minister responsible for that country's “Energiewende” says it is time that the private sector around the world realized that the age of fossil fuels is over, and their own country's energy transition is irreversible.
Last week, new data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggested that in 2015 – like 2014 – more money was invested in renewable energy generation than in fossil fuels. Some $US329 billion went into clean energy investment in the last year.
But still, enormous amounts not captured by this data appear to be spent searching for new reserves to replenish and expand fossil fuel resources.
Some of that investment may need to be re-considered, particularly in light of new data coming out of China, which reveals a 3.5 per cent reduction in coal consumption in the country's biggest coal consumer, and a 2.8 per cent cut in coal-fired generation, well ahead of all estimates.
“These figures are staggering and totally non consensus,” said Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).” The implications for the global coal industry and indeed global financial markets simply cannot be understated.”
Earlier this week, Rainer Bakke, the German minister for state said climate science and the targets agreed at the Paris climate talks are quite clear in their implications: the world has a “carbon budget” equivalent of jus 1,000GT of carbon emissions.
This compares to the 15,000GT that would be released if all known fossil fuel reserves were burned. That means, that 14,000GT has to be left in the ground in 2015.
“My question to the private sector is this: ‘When are you going to learn that the age of fossil fuels is over',” Bakke told the annual assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi this week.
“That is the key question. When is the old economy going to accept that it is over, and when are they going to be willing to sit down with us to talk about a game plan to phase out fossil fuels.”
Bakke is the man responsible for ensuring that Germany's Energiewende, or Energy Transition, away from fossil fuels and nuclear to renewable energy, stays on track.
Bakke says the Energiewende is still going strong. In the last year, the share of renewable energy in the German grid jumped from 27 per cent to 32.5 per cent, which they said was unprecedented as a percentage rise.
Since 2007, the share of renewable energy has grown from just 7 per cent. “That is an extraordinary rise,” they said. The government expects that by 2050, 80 per cent of all energy needs will come from renewables.
In a later interview with RenewEconomy, Bakke said it was clear that the technology battle had already been won by wind and solar. The task now was to provide the integration, through software, market design, storage, flexibility and regulatory changes, to make sure it was both “ecologic and economic”.
Bakke said the next phase of the Energiewende is to ensure a push to digitization of the grid, which they say is essential. Accompanying this is the need for a change to regulatory measures and market design.
This includes mechanisms that allow for flexibility on the side of generation, flexibility on the demand side, flexibility through the grid, and flexibility through storage.
“The market has to drive these innovations,” Bakke says. Another focus is on addressing the transport and the building and industry sectors, rather than just the power sector – hence the reported push into supporting electric vehicles. (We'll have more from Bakke's interview in another article later this week).
Bakke's policies are not without critics, even within the renewable energy industry. One of the biggest criticisms is their push to replace feed in tariffs with auctions.
While it is true that auctions are an effective mechanism to find the lowest cost pricing, there is a fear that the mechanism effectively shuts out community-level rojects.
And one of the underlying successes of the Energiewende has been the fact that it has been largely driven by community ownership, and supported by the community.
(Later this week we will report on our interview with Bakke in more detail).
One of Germany's main issues is how to ensure the removal of the huge lignite (or brown coal) plants, which for political, social, and more recently market reasons (the low carbon price), are proving hard to shift.
The issue of fossil fuel subsidies is a critical one. At a debate held in IRENA's new headquarters held in the heart of Abu Dhabi's experiment in sustainable development, Masdar City, it was pointed out that fossil fuel subsidies are more than offsetting incentives for renewables.
Data from the International Energy Agency shows that fossil fuel subsidies outrank those for renewables by a factor of 10 to 1. According to the IMF, if the health and environmental impacts are including, it is by a factor of 100 to 1.
Like Bakke, Figueres invited the private sector to work back from the climate targets agreed in Paris, “connect the dots” and work out what that means for future investment. “The long term direction is abundantly clear.”
Kyung-Ah Park, the head of environmental markets at Goldman Sachs, and one of the key drivers of that groups massive commitment to low carbon investments, agreed that it was a good time to dump fossil fuel subsidies.
But they said markets need to see the Paris pledges transformed into clear, long term policies by individual countries.
Park said there is no shortage of capital, or of interest in renewables. What there is a lack of solid long term policies. They noted, for instance, that when the Paris deal was signed, US solar stocks jumped 5 per cent. A week later, when the Obama administration locked in a further five-year period for the investment tax credit, providing certainty for the sector, solar stocks jumped 30 per cent.
Park said it was clear that capital was looking for long term investment signals, but corporates were also looking for investments, while the actual technologies were breaking all records.
Back on the subject of China, Barclays released a report highlighting how critical that country was to meet the targets, suggesting it accounts for at least one third of the gap between the effects of current policies, and the targets agreed in Paris.
Various analysis suggests that the individual country agreements offered in Paris reduce the anticipated rise in temperature to 2.7C to 3.0C. That is still well above the 2C maximum agreed in Paris, and its more aspirational target of 1.5C.
Barclays suggests that China's CO2 emissions from energy will peak already by 2025 at 10.3Gt (five years ahead of target), and thereafter start trending down to reach 9.8Gt by 2030.
“The investment decisions China makes over the next 10-15 years with regard to energy and industrial infrastructure will also be absolutely crucial in determining whether the world is able to adjust its course onto a 2°C pathway,” Lewis said.

There's at least one minimum wage fact that both Republicans and Democrats agree on: Opposing an increase, as Republicans typically do, is a political loser. So confident are Democrats in the effectiveness of this “wedge” issue that they've made it a key part of their 2014 strategy to retake control of the House of Representatives.
But as is often the case in politics, “effective” is not synonymous with “true.” The case in favor of a higher minimum wage is built on a bewildering number of misleading statistics and straight-up falsehoods, some of which were recently rehashed on the pages of the Washington Post by former Obama administration economist Betsey Stevenson.
It's time to correct the record.
Let's start with job loss, a defining issue of any minimum wage debate. Opponents of this policy argue that raising business' labor costs will (absent the ability to increase prices) force them to scale back on employee hours and jobs. Stevenson argues that this consequence is a figment of the conservative imagination, citing “many” studies which show a higher minimum wage has no impact on employment.
However, “many” is not the same as “most,” and Stevenson crosses the line from professor to pundit when they classify wage hike-related job loss as a myth.
In a comprehensive, 182-page summary of the research on this subject from the last two decades, economists David Neumark (UC-Irvine) and William Wascher (Federal Reserve Board) determined that 85 percent of the best research points to a loss of jobs following a minimum wage increase.
As in any academic discipline, there are outliers. But even the outliers are problematic: For instance, the famous (or rather, infamous) New Jersey study that associated a higher minimum with increased employment was later refuted in the same academic journal that originally published it. More recently, the paper that the President relied on to make their case for a higher minimum was debunked in a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Of course, the goal of minimum wage policy is not to reduce employment, but rather poverty. Indeed, Stevenson says explicitly in their commentary that a higher minimum wage will achieve this end. But empirical evidence refutes their point. Twenty-eight states raised minimum wages in the four years prior to passage of the last federal minimum wage increase. Economists from Cornell and American Universities, writing in the Southern Economic Journal, found no associated reduction in poverty rates.
One reason is poor targeting. According to the Census Bureau, roughly 60 percent of people living in poverty don't currently work, and thus can't benefit from a raise. Of those who do work and would be covered by the President's $9 proposal, Census Bureau data show that the majority live in families far above the poverty line. Across all covered minimum wage earners, the average family income is $50,789.
Were there no other consequences to raising the minimum wage, imprecise targeting would be a minor drawback. But a study published in the Journal of Human Resources found that a higher minimum wage can actually increase the proportion of families living at or near the poverty line, as the resulting reduction in work hours (or a loss of employment altogether) leads to less take-home pay rather than more.
Stevenson covers other oft-cited reasons to raise the minimum wage, including the argument that, adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage would already be above $9 an hour. But inflation rates can both rise and fall, which means a minimum wage that truly kept up with inflation since its inception in 1938 would only be $4.12 today—not the current $7.25.
Stevenson's broader point is that people are "stuck" waiting for the federal government to give them a raise. Yet research from economists at Florida State University and Miami University finds that two-thirds of minimum wage earners receive a bump in pay in their first 1-12 months on the job.
For the small number of truly-disadvantaged individuals who remain at the minimum wage for a longer period of time, Congress has put in place a significant income supplement in the form of the Earned Income Tax Credit. A single parent with two children receives an additional $5,200 in income from this credit, bumping their effective hourly wage from $7.25 to $9.76. Some states have added to the federal EITC, boosting the wage even further.
Undoubtedly, wage hike advocates will continue to be creative in their pro-minimum wage arguments—focusing on the hefty profits of restaurant corporations instead of the far-smaller profits of their affiliated franchisees, for instance, or describing $13-an-hour tipped restaurant employees as “subminimum” wage earners. But no amount of spin can erase the consequences of a wage hike for the poor and others in the entry-level job market.

Rumors of child sexual abuse have been following R. Kelly around since a woman named Tiffany Hawkins claimed they had sex with the singer when they were 15 and they were 24. While the singer later settled the $10 million lawsuit out of court for $250,000, they told New York magazine that the allegations wouldn't even exist if they weren't famous.
"That's a rumor that comes from the Earth, like all rumors," Kelly added, "No. It's not true. I love women, period. If I wasn't a celebrity, people wouldn't be saying these things about me."
Speaking more about the situation, Kelly addressed people close to him, including their brother and longtime personal assistant, backing up the rumors. The singer explained, "All those people have been fired by me. If you're going to ask me these questions, you have to make sense out of it. It wasn't until after they got fired that they said these things. Go figure. I got one life, and I don't want to spend it talking about negativity. I've moved on. Maybe you haven't."

Announced by small tech firm Devant earlier this week, the Pond Wireless ecosystem of products looks to bring Qi wireless charging to Apple's iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s with a "Made for iPhone" charging case, tray and fob adapter.
Pond Duo tray.
Already named a Kickstarter Staff Pick, the Pond project revolves around the Qi wireless charging standard, one of the more popular inductive charging solutions on the market.The star of the lineup is Pond's Stream, which is being billed as the "first globally available" Apple MFi-approved Qi wireless charging case to hit the market. Other case makers have created similar solutions, though apparently sales have been limited to specific markets.Stream is basically a Lightning connector-compatible Qi adapter shoehorned into a form-fitting iPhone 5 and 5s sheath. Like other two-piece case designs, Stream's bottom portion docks with the iPhone's Lightning connector, while a second part slides on top to lock the handset in place. As seen in the photo below, the "chin" section containing Qi charging circuitry is comparable in size to an extended battery case.According to Devant, the case delivers a maximum one amp of juice to the iPhone when sitting on a compatible Qi wireless charging pad. Regular models are crafted from ABS plastic, while premium versions use maple and walnut wood surrounded by ABS frames.The lineup's namesake valet tray comes in two battery powered versions, both of which include a carved out section for keys, coins and other pocketable items. The smaller Pond comes with an integrated 10,000 mAh battery, while the Pond Duo uses a 20,000 mAh unit and two Qi induction coils for charging two devices at once. Pond batteries are recharged via a common USB adapter. Like Stream, the Pond and Pond Duo also come in wooden versions for a unique premium look.Finally, the Pond Pebble is a small fob adapter that enables Qi wireless charging for nearly any Micro-USB or Lightning-equipped device. While not mentioned by Devant, electronics with higher capacity batteries like an iPad likely take longer to fully charge.Early-bird pledges for the Stream start at $45 ($70 for a premium wood version), while the Pond tray can be had for $125 ($140 for the larger Pond Duo). Pond Pebble adapters are only available in combination with a Pond tray purchase and packages start at $145.The Stream is expected to ship out to backers in August, while the Pond, Pond Duo and Pond Pebble are due in September. With 26 days left to go, the project has amassed $4,435 of its $30,000 goal.
Bacteria that respond to magnetic fields and low oxygen levels may soon join the fight against cancer. Researchers in Canada have done experiments that show how magneto-aerotactic bacteria can be used to deliver drugs to hard-to-reach parts of tumours. With further development, the method could be used to treat a variety of solid tumours, which account for roughly 85% of all cancers.
Cancer cells in a growing tumour consume large amounts of oxygen and parts of the tumour will become starved of oxygen – or hypoxic. It is notoriously difficult to deliver tumour-destroying drugs to these hypoxic regions using conventional pharmaceutical nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles and polymeric nanoparticles.
Now, a team led by Sylvain Martel of the NanoRobotics Laboratory at the Polytechnique Montréal – including researchers at McGill University – has developed a method that exploits the magnetotactic bacteria Magnetoccus marinus (MC-1) to overcome this problem.
Tiny compass needles
A MC-1 bacterium has a chain of magnetic nanoparticles that acts like a microscopic magnetic compass needle. The bacteria live in saltwater estuaries in the northern hemisphere, where they use the Earths's geomagnetic field to point them towards deeper water with low oxygen concentrations. The microbes do this because they thrive where oxygen concentrations are low. Indeed, the oxygen levels found in hypoxic regions of a tumour – about 0.5% – are perfect for MC-1.
The researchers created an artificial environment to allow these bacteria to migrate towards the hypoxic regions of tumours in live mice with colorectal cancers. “We first produce a weak magnetic field pointing towards the tumour to guide drug-loaded bacteria and make them swim towards the tumour (a process called magnetotaxis),” says Martel. “Once inside the tumour and sufficiently close to the hypoxic zones, we remove the magnetic field to allow the bacteria to use their internal oxygen sensors (aerotaxis) and follow the decreasing oxygen gradient in the tumour until they reach the 0.5% oxygen level.”
These bacteria can be used as general transport vehicles to carry a huge variety of therapeutic agents, such as various drug molecules, radiotherapeutic agents, stem cells and immunotherapeutics. “In the short term, we will be using our technique to study how it can enhance cancer treatment,” says Martel. “The possibilities are vast, since all therapeutic agents for treating solid tumours share a common problem – the effective delivery to the site of treatment.”
Therapeutic agents
Looking further into the future, the researchers say they would like to look into the efficacy of various therapeutic agents that are delivered using their new technique. They also hope to collaborate with other research groups around the world.
In the next few months the team will begin to develop medical protocols based on the technique. Also planned is the implementation of mathematical models to improve how magnetic fields are used to guide the bacteria. They will also continue doing studies of the safety of the technique, which Martel says “are encouraging so far”.
The new technique is described in Nature Nanotechnology.

Inside the surprisingly light 3D-printed box are four AA batteries, an Arduino Nano and a custom-built filter board. The box feeds information to a handset via Bluetooth, which communicates with a PC via WiFI. At present, the app is Android only, hence the Droid RAZR in the demo video, but that's something they naturally would look to expand, should the product ever come to market. Early versions of the shirt had the phone connecting to the box via USB, but the new wireless version means that you don't have to carry the handset on your person while working out -- certainly a plus.
The shirt also has vibrating motors nestled between each pair of sensors -- though they weren't ready for our demo. According to Sivak, the researchers are in the process of deciding whether the cellphone vibrators would give the wearer positive or negative feedback, in order to either entice or correct the user while working out. The application features two different modes -- home and gym, tailored to different workout methods. The information is viewable in a calendar format on the site, so the user can monitor the information over time. For now, reps are simply counted down in seconds, because the sensors need to be manually calibrated for each person who wears it, though, the team is currently working on an algorithm to automate the process. We were shown a rough graphing app that allows you to see raw signal data coming in from the EMG pads, and reps were highlighted with drastic spikes in the readings. For now though, measurements like "intensity" are graphed in averaged out bars for the right and left arm. As a bonus, the individual right and left measurements allow you to monitor symmetry, a feature that could have other health applications in the case of stroke victims, who have lost strength on one side of their body.
Naturally, the whole thing is still in the early testing phase, which helps explain the roughly sew-on patches and hair-pulling electrode pads. Sivak says the University is interested in using the technology to monitor its athletes and teams for off-season training. Eventually a coach or trainer mode would allow routines to be pushed to participating players, and once the automatic calibration system is in place Squid could ensure that competitors perform the prescribed number of sets and reps.
I had a chance to play Forza Horizon 3 a short while ago, and can report that the third open-world racer from Playground Games is an awful lot like the first two. That is to say, it's gorgeous, slick, cheerful and free-wheeling; it's realistic enough for a car nerd like me to take seriously, but loose enough for anyone to enjoy. Best of all, it's not structured around competitive grind but around the enduring and universal joy of exploring a large and beautiful landscape. It's a racing game for everyone.
There are precious few, if any, of those left. The simulation and motorsport scenes are healthier than ever, thanks to the likes of Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally and Project Cars, but also more specialist than ever in their appeal. Horizon's big brother, Forza Motorsport, and Gran Turismo package this experience up for the mainstream, but never fully escape the accusation from everyday thrillseekers that they can be dry and repetitive. Burnout's gone, Driver's gone, Project Gotham's gone, Wipeout's gone. Need for Speed is off the pace. You can make a case for Ubisoft's 'World of Carcraft' alternative, The Crew, though perhaps it's a little bit on the wacky side for most people. Mario Kart is pretty much the only pure arcade racer left standing. We need a game like Forza Horizon 3: a game which makes the simple act of driving a car romantic and exhilarating and fun, which channels the spirits of OutRun, Project Gotham and Test Drive.
This isn't news to Xbox owners, of course, and for them, Horizon 3 will admittedly be as unsurprising as it is welcome. The first game established the single-player blueprint and the second made open-world multiplayer work, so Horizon 3 settles into the comfortable routine of refinement, adding features that mostly belong in the column marked "nice to have". Here's a quick rundown of those that stood out for me:
The Playground art team are particularly proud of their Australian skies.
Campaign mode can be played in four-player, drop-in-drop-out co-op, with the races using a team battle format similar to Forza Horizon 2's multiplayer
A 'blueprint' mode allows you to create your own race events from preset routes
You're now the director of the travelling Horizon festival, rather than a mere competitor; you get to recruit Drivatars to the line-up, sign radio stations and expand festival sites
Multiplayer now allows you to filter by event styles - so you can request playlists which don't include the knockabout Playground modes, for example
The game will be updated with weekly Forzathon themed events, with prize cars
Honk your customisable horn at AI drivers to get them to join you in a convoy to your current destination
You can unlock a 'drone mode' free camera that allows you to explore the landscape from above (useful for video shoots and hunting for barn finds)
The auction house for selling cars to other players is making a return to the Forza series for the first time since Motorsport 4
You can choose from a diverse range of avatars - and names and nicknames for the voiceover, too The satnav can now make suggestions for which event to do next
With the possible exception of co-op, it's not really game-changing stuff, but by the same token I'm glad that Playground isn't spending its time fixing the unbroken. Beyond these features lies the new car list, which now adds buggies for an even greater emphasis on off-road and all-terrain vehicles. And there's the map, set in Australia, which is more varied, more condensed, and more fictionalised than either Horizon 1's Colorado or Horizon 2's Mediterranean coast. What it might lack in specific local atmosphere and motoring heritage, it makes up for in sheer spectacle and variety. You get the wide desert of the Outback, lush jungle to race off-roaders through, glamorous sun-kissed coastline, and glassy modern cities. And you get to drive on the left side of the road, which is a first for open-world racers and takes a surprising length of time to get used to. (Take a gander at it in the gameplay video below, captured by yours truly and soundtracked by myself and Martin nerding out.)
The real story, of course, is that Horizon 3 is an Xbox Play Anywhere game, which means it's coming to Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. Microsoft Game Studios' adventures in cross-platform publishing didn't get off to a great start with Quantum Break, but Horizon game director Ralph Fulton tells me that the Playground team knew from day one they would be developing for PC, and that the PC version has been engineered from the ground up alongside the Xbox One game, in-house at the studio. Despite some rather intimidating recommended specs, it could bring Horizon 3 to a much wider audience. More importantly, it will treat PC gamers to a racing game that can't be beat on production values, on accessibility, and on sheer entertainment value. Since this is the racing game for everyone, it's only right that everyone - well, almost everyone - should get to play it.
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick (7) reacts against the New Orleans Saints during the second half of a game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. The Saints defeated the Easgles 28-13. (Photo11: Derick E. Hingle, U.S. Presswire) Story Highlights Vick donated $50,000 to Red Cross relief efforts in N.J.
They have been pressured, hit or sacked on a third of their dropbacks this season.
Vick says he's not worried about coach Andy Reid's future with the team
Michael Vick can't go anywhere to escape the disappointment with the Philadelphia Eagles. Not even a charity mission to Superstorm Sandy-ravaged Atlantic City, N.J.
The quarterback is making a $50,000 donation to the Red Cross' relief efforts, and they spent part of their Tuesday speaking to high school students and visiting a local shelter for displaced residents. More than a few people wanted to know why the Eagles lost 28-13 Monday night to the New Orleans Saints, making both clubs 3-5.
The Saints have an excuse for a poor first half: Their season was blown of course by the NFL's bounty investigation.
And the Eagles?
"People want to know the reason behind the loss, so I had to break it down to them," Vick told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. "You just let them know that it's just football. It takes a total team effort to win football games. Young kids have to learn that and learn not to point the finger early."
CAN EAGLES REBOUND?: Week 10 selections
If the occasion of four losses in a row at midseason is too early to point fingers, when is the right time? Vick's younger brother, Marcus, assigned blame Monday night, demanding a trade for their brother during the game in a curse-filled Twitter rant that criticized the offensive line. They have since apologized.
Michael says they had a heart-to-heart with their brother, and is assured that won't happen again.
"Coach wasn't seeing into it, and my teammates weren't seeing into it, and nobody said anything about it," Vick said. "They know me as a person and they knew I would get to the bottom of that and they knew that I'd handle that."
But their brother's outburst isn't nearly Vick's chief concern. Their offensive line has been ravaged by injuries. Starters Jason Peters, Jason Kelce and Todd Herremans are lost for the season. Vick has been pressured, hit or sacked on a third of their dropbacks this season, and he's thrown the ball away a league-high 17 times.
At this point, Vick feels as if they need to "kinda, sorta" put the team on their back.
"I have to make plays that I know I can make and kind of put the team on my back a little bit," Vick said. "But we have a lot of great players, and I've just got to play at a high level. I've got to bring everyone else with me."
SO SORRY: Marcus Vick apologizes for Twitter rant
Vick said they were worried about injuries early in the season, forcing them into bad throws. That mentality is no more.
Vick said they refuse to worry about coach Andy Reid's long-term future with the team. Reid long ago tied their tenure in Philadelphia to Vick's success. Vick is due $16.5 million if he's on the roster next season. Reid's contract is up after next year, but Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in August they needed to see "substantial improvement" from the team for the coach to keep their job.
Instead, the Eagles have regressed, fueling speculation that Reid and Vick's jobs are in jeopardy.
And though Vick has admitted to feeling the pressure from the media in several instances this season, they and Reid aren't discussing matters beyond Sunday's NFC East game against Dallas.
"We don't think about it and we don't talk about it," Vick said. "We think about the next game and how to win it. That's what's most important. Everything else is a distraction."
Bethesda has given PC users the tools to unlock The Evil Within's built-in 30fps cap, but we couldn't help but wonder - just how much computational power is required to double the game's frame-rate and produce a sustained, consistent 60fps experience at 1080p? It turns out that our PC test rig - fitted with a Core i7 3770K overclocked to 4.3GHz and matched with 16GB of DDR3 - couldn't handle it, not even when outfitted with the GeForce GTX 980, the fastest single-chip graphics card available on the market today.
What's curious is that despite The Evil Within's apparently mammoth system requirements for the best experience, what looks like a straight, under-optimised PC conversion works fairly well with entry-level enthusiast hardware. As we've seen in the past, a hard 30fps lock can give both CPU and GPU a lot of "wiggle room" - and in the case of The Evil Within, a lowly Core i3 4130 paired with a £100 GTX 750 Ti produces an experience very close indeed to the PS4 version. The problem is scalability - while it's relatively straightforward to maintain 30fps at higher resolutions with a good enthusiast card, locking to 60fps at 1080p just wasn't possible on any of the hardware configurations we tested.
In the video below, you'll find a broad overview of the components we tested and the results gained. In addition to the GTX 750 Ti, 760 and 980, we've also played the game on other enthusiast-level top-line GPUs, including the GTX 780 and the AMD Radeon R9 290X - and unfortunately none of them sustain anything approaching a flawlessly smooth 1080p60 update.
Right now, resolution seems to be the only dimension in scalability available - certainly in terms of quality presets, there's nothing here that significantly moves image quality beyond PlayStation 4 standard. And that's a real shame. There are three anti-aliasing settings - FXAA, MLAA and SMAA - but none of them do a particularly good job in tackling the myriad aliasing issues the game features. Forcing multi-sampling (MSAA) via the GPU control panel also fails to refine image quality to any noticeable extent, while Nvidia's built-in super-sampling technology - DSR - also seems non-functional on this particular title.
The Evil Within tested across multiple CPUs and GPUs reveals a game that can hit PlayStation 4 standards relatively easily, but seems incapable of locking at 1080p60, no matter what hardware we threw at it.
Bethesda has warned of issues in utilising the built-in tools that allow PC users to dabble with the technical set-up of the game, but has made noises about getting the game to run at 60fps. Based on what we've been playing over the last couple of days, that is looking like a gargantuan optimisation effort. In the here and now, The Evil Within joins the ranks of a steadily growing number of disappointing PC conversions, where achieving console-style image quality and performance is relatively straightforward on mid-range gaming PCs, but scaling up beyond the 30fps console standard to a locked 60fps proves inordinately difficult.
In the case of The Evil Within, it's a little strange, bearing in mind that the id Tech 5 engine on which it is based was designed by John Carmack and their colleagues with 60fps gameplay in mind - to the point where Jens Matthies, Creative Director at Machine Games noted that the technology effectively forced them into running Wolfenstein: The New Order at 60fps.
What's clear is that the engine has been dramatically altered for this new game - The Evil Within's lighting system is quite unlike any other id Tech 5 titles - but regardless, the performance bottlenecks we encountered in the PC version are deeply disappointing. Our tests here continue, and we hope to post our full Xbox One/PS4/PC comparison in the next couple of days.
Cats are largely solitary creatures—they live alone, they hunt alone and they don't have particularly strong social skills. Humans, on the other hand, are as social as they come: we use language, facial expressions and body language to express what we have to say. We learn from each other, and we get feedback on our actions from the crowd. It's this disconnect, says veterinarian Tony Buffington to Wired, that causes so much confusion between cats and their owners.
Dogs, like humans, are largely social creatures. They're used to getting feedback from the pack. So, if a human says “no” enough times, eventually they get the hint. Cats don't do this. Cats can't do this, writes Nick Stockton for Wired. While it's true that cats don't care what you think, the source of this tension is more than ambivalence. Cats' brains have difficulty even parsing the types of social feedback that comes so naturally to us.
“How the hell is your cat supposed to know that you're yelling at them because you want them to stop scratching the couch?” Buffington says. Without the cognitive ability to connect your outburst to their scratching, cats see only chaotic aggression. “To the cat, you're this crazy primate who is attacking them for no reason,” they say.
“Instead of discouraging the act,” writes Stockton, “you become an object of fear.”
Your cat just wants to be a cat and do cat things, like jump and scratch. You keep saying “no!” but it doesn't mean anything. All this tension stresses kitty out, says vet Buffington:
“Cats get sick when they want to express their natural behaviors and they can't,” they said, and will continue to do the thing when you aren't around.
Many of the tensions cat owners experience stem from similar miscommunications. In their story, Stockton gets tips from Buffington on how to handle all sorts of common cat-related woes, including the dreaded claws-out, teeth-bared "one tummy rub too many" leap from lap to the other side of the house.

Shortly after telling Americans that some opponents are trying to "scare the heck out of folks" by misleading them about their health care reform efforts, President Obama told a town hall audience in New Hampshire that they are "not in favor" of so-called "death panels" in which the government would decide who does and does not qualify for care to keep them alive.
The notion that the president and Congressional Democrats are seeking to institute such panels has been pushed by former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin and some activists.
House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter (R-Mich.) put out a statement last month claiming the health care legislation "may place seniors in situations where they feel pressured to sign end of life directives they would not otherwise sign. This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia if enacted into law."
Some Republicans have disavowed the "death panel" claim, which several media outlets have noted is false. It was among the "10 Health Care Myths" debunked on this site last week. The provision cited by critics, the president said today, would allow Medicare to pay doctors to counsel those seeking information about end-of-life care issues, such as living wills and hospice care.
It would not, they said, "basically pull the plug on grandma because we decided that it's too expensive to let them live anymore."
Mr. Obama noted that a Republican, Johnny Isakson, was an initial sponsor of the provision. The president said lawmakers "very sensibly thought this was something that would expand people's options."
Isakson called the notion that the provision meant euthanasia "nuts." They later disavowed the president's comments, however, writing in a statement, "I categorically oppose the House bill and find it incredulous that the White House and others would use my amendment as a scapegoat for their misguided policies."
In a Facebook post Friday, Palin wrote this: "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so their bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil."
The president said in a response to such claims that Americans should not listen to efforts by those seeking to "scare and mislead the American people."
"Where we disagree, let's disagree over things that are real, not these wild misrepresentations that don't bear any resemblance to anything that's actually being proposed," they said.

Will 2017 finally be the year this issue receives a hearing?
A tenacious Indiana lawmaker is making a push once again in the 2017 session to legalize medical marijuana.
Democratic Senator Karen Tallian recently submitted a measure to the Indiana General Assembly, which seeks the creation of a statewide medical marijuana program.
The proposal (Senate Bill 255) would allow patients with a variety of health conditions, including migraines and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to have access to cannabis as long as they have a recommendation from a licensed physician. It would also give patients suffering from “any persistent or chronic illness or condition” to access the program so long as a doctor believes marijuana could provide some benefit.
The bill calls for the creation of a Department of Marijuana Enforcement (DOME) to oversee the program. This department would also come with an advisory committee that would determine multiple facets of the program, including whether to add more qualified conditions.
This year marks Tallian's sixth attempt with this type of proposal. So far, the Republican dominated legislature has refused to allow any marijuana-related proposals to so much as receive a hearing.
The lawmaker said last year that they could secure strong support from the Republicans if only the legislative gatekeepers would give them bills an opportunity to be heard.
“We move by inches down there, so I'd take every inch I could get,” Tallian said last year. “I have a lot of votes over there on the Republican side if I could just get a hearing.”
Interestingly, Tallian could receive some influential support this session from the American Legion Department of Indiana. The organization is set to vote next week on a resolution aimed at persuading the State Legislature to finally give medical marijuana some consideration.
“Legislators listen to veterans,” said Jeff Staker, the veteran responsible for introducing the resolution. “We've got to get their attention, and who better to do that than veterans?”
A recent WTHR Howey Politics Indiana Poll shows 73 percent of Indiana residents believe marijuana should be legalized throughout the state for medicinal purposes. Only 25 percent said they opposed, while 2 percent were left undecided.
But even if Tallian's bill were blessed with a miracle in the coming months, allowing it to move swiftly through the State Legislature without incident, Republican Governor Eric Holcomb would probably not support the proposal in ink.
Last year, during a gubernatorial debate in Evansville, Holcomb said, “expanding or legalizing drugs of this nature isn't on my list.”
THIS week sees the last batch of bug fixes and security patches that Microsoft will issue for Windows XP. After April 8th, computers using the 13-year-old operating system will continue to work just fine, but all technical support for XP—whether paid or otherwise—will cease. In a change of heart, Microsoft has at least agreed to continue issuing updates for its Security Essentials malware engine, which runs on XP, until July 2015. Apart from that, users who continue to rely on the thing will be on their own—at the mercy of mischief-makers everywhere.
More than a few seem determined to stick with it. According to NetMarketShare, a web-analytics consultancy, Windows XP runs on 28% of the world's PCs, making it even today the second most popular operating system (surpassed only by Windows 7, with 49%). Over 400m machines will therefore be left exposed. Included in that number are 95% of all the cashpoints (ATMs) in the world. Windows XP and Embedded XP also power a lot of cash registers.

At least most banks, stores, petrol stations and other retail chains have plans in place to migrate their point-of-sale (POS) terminals from XP to Windows 7 or Linux. Many have delayed doing so for financial reasons. POS terminals cost anything from $15,000 to $60,000 apiece, so they tend to be left in place for ten years or more. Besides, new rules will soon require the American versions of these terminals to be upgraded anyway, so that they can handle the more secure “chip-and-pin” credit cards popular in Europe.
Most of the holdouts are small businesses and individual users. Typically, they view the job of upgrading as a costly chore that can be deferred (it ain't broke, so why fix it?). But more than a few consider all apocalyptic talk of XP's vulnerability as scaremongering by Microsoft and computer security firms.
It is certainly true that hardware makers, as well as software firms, have encouraged a fair amount of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), hoping to scare XP users at least into replacing much of their software, if not their hardware as well. Older XP computers can run Windows 7, though at nowhere near the spritely rate of newer ones. Few older machines, however, can run Windows 8 or 8.1 without upgrading crucial components. And the FUD factor worked in 1999, when the mythical "Y2K" millennium bug spurred a world-wide computer-buying spree. Once again, FUD seems to be working. Global PC sales have been in free-fall recently, as people embrace iPads and Android tablets, but the downward trend went into reverse in the third quarter of 2013, in which sales were up 5% from the same period the previous year, according to analysts at Citigroup. And this was not just a one-off. Year-on-year sales in the fourth quarter of last year were up 10%.
Even so, a lot of XP diehards refuse to be swayed. They believe that as long as they keep their firewalls and anti-virus software up-to-date, use Chrome as their default browser instead Internet Explorer, and disable Java and Adobe Flash, they will be OK.
They are half right. Doing so will certainly reduce an XP machine's risk of being infected or hijacked. But all it takes is one security breach for a hapless user's identity, social-security and credit-card details to be stolen. Scans of real-world installations show that XP systems get infected six times more often than computers running later editions, including Windows 8. Better by far to upgrade and have done with it.
But to what? For those determined to stay in the Microsoft camp, forget Windows 8 or 8.1. Not only do they demand too much in the way of hardware, both have been been written off as a debacle as bad as the Windows Vista disaster. With their touch-based design, they require users to do things differently from the way they are familiar with. Microsoft is now hurrying out Windows 9 in a bid to pre-empt a mass migration to Linux or Macintosh.
The best choice for those reluctant to change their habits and their hardware is to upgrade to Windows 7. This can be made to look and feel exactly like Windows XP, while offering far better security. Unfortunately, because this upgrade leaps a generation—avoiding the ill-fated Windows Vista—the migration is not as straightforward as one might hope. If precautions are not taken, the process will wipe out all of a user's software applications, program settings and data files. These have to be moved from the hard-drive to a separate disk beforehand, so that they can be transferred back intact after the installation is complete. Fortunately, there is a handy software tool, well worth its $30 price, that simplifies the process (see “Say farewell to XP”, September 6th 2013).
One of the attractions of migrating to Windows 7 is that it has a “compatibility mode” which lets users run all their legacy software. People can also set up a “virtual machine” on a Windows 7 system that will emulate their old Windows XP environment, quirks and all. But be warned: running Windows XP on a virtual machine inside Windows 7 does not magically make XP more secure. It will still be as vulnerable to exploitation as it was when running undisguised.
An alternative for more adventurous souls is to upgrade to one or other of the many flavours of Linux. Not only are all the popular Linux distributions free, they make fewer demands on hardware and run faster. They are also mercifully free of infection. For the same reason that Macintosh computers were once thought immune to viruses and other malware, hackers tend to leave Linux systems well alone: their installed base (1.5% of all computers) is too small to bother with.
Of the hundreds of Linux distributions, three stands out as solid replacements for Windows XP. The most popular by far (when all its derivatives are taken into account) is Ubuntu, followed by LinuxMint. Both stress ease of use and offer desktop environments that Windows XP users will feel comfortable with. And both will work on even relics from computing's iron age. All they ask for is a 700-megahertz processor, 512 megabytes of random-access memory, five gigabytes of hard-drive space and a graphics card capable of just 800-by-600 pixels of resolution. On anything better, Linux will run rings around comparable Macs or Windows machines.
The third stand-out, an interesting alternative to Ubuntu and LinuxMint, is Zorin. This has gone out of its way to emulate Windows XP. For computer users fleeing Microsoft, Zorin OS 8 could be the perfect drop-in replacement for Windows XP. Unfotunately, Zorin's installation process is not as idiot-proof as those baked into Ubuntu and LinuxMint.
Babbage's favourite Linux of all remains LinuxMint, because it comes with all the "drivers" and "codecs" (including various proprietary ones that open-source purist Ubuntu refuses to include) that let it function without a hitch straight out of the box. They recommend newcomers from the world of Windows adopt the version with the Cinnamon interface—XP users, in particular, will feel right at home.
Rather than junk XP altogether, though, Babbage suggests users set up LinuxMint alongside Windows, in a separate partition on their primary hard-drive. LinuxMint even asks users whether they want to do that during installation, and will then automate the process for them. With a dual-boot machine, users can then choose which operating system to load at start up. Having the two operating systems installed side by side provides access to the file systems of both. It is also a handy way for people to find out which one they prefer. If they do not like what they see, they can simply delete LinuxMint and go back to Windows XP. When upgrading their XP desktops to Windows 7, Babbage ran both operating systems side by side for several months until they were happy with the result. They did the same when moving a couple of old laptops from XP to LinuxMint.
Inevitably, though, the move from one operating system to another—whether to Linux or Macintosh or simply to a later version of Windows—entails niggling compromises. Having a user interface that looks and feels like Windows XP can be comforting, but ultimately it is the quality of the applications available for the new operating system that make or break a migration.
That is not so much a problem when upgrading from XP to Windows 7. It is bigger one when migrating to Macintosh or any Linux system. Equivalent programs for all the usual applications—wordprocessors, e-mail packages, browsers, media players and the like—can invariably be found. But it is the handy little software tools that are often irreplaceable and missed the most. Only when moving off the the Windows platform can users really begin to appreciate how rich and diverse it is.
I'M not narrow-minded and don't think I'm squeamish, but getting my shoes covered in vomit before I even got through the door should have provided all the warning I needed.
I'd already fought my way through the scaffolding yard masquerading as a car park by the time a huge beast lurched out of The County Oak and threw up over my feet.
By the time the fully track-suited barmaid, with a bandage on their right hand, served me a pint of Kronenbourg I realised this was Shameless meets Celebrity Juice – but without the class of either of these programmes.
The noise and chaos in the main bar was so intense – not to mention the potentially lethal mix of a child chucking darts and an American bulldog that looked like a shire horse – I headed for the deserted middle bar purely on safety grounds.
Sadly it was not a safe zone as one of the neaderthals decided to hurl a red ball into this middle bar and the 26-week-old bulldog, affectionately named RJ, followed it to cause total mayhem.
Things went further downhill when its inebriated owner lurched in to apologise.
Worse still, the inebriated man's even more drunk mate in an horrendous pink shirt thrust themselves forward and demanded to know “What the f**** I was doing in their bar?”
To be fair this was exactly what I was thinking too!
Demanding to know what I was doing here for a second time, they then collapsed across a chair and I took my chance to escape back to the main bar.
The darts had been confiscated and RJ had sneaked behind the counter, so it seemed a safer option.
The noise level was still phenomenal and everyone was completely annihilated by 7pm.
A reddish-headed barmaid supping a Bud ejected RJ from behind the bar and whilst the massive bulldog was by far the friendliest thing in here, and probably the most intelligent, they aren't chatty so I had a word with the child who was tearing about.
They slowed down just long enough to tell me their name, that they were seven years old and that their nan owned the pub.
By now the desperate locals had started a game which involved them trying to touch their toes.
The first consequence saw RJ being blamed for a massive fart.
The next saw several collapses to the floor before the man in the offensive pink shirt loudly declared he'd torn something and pulled their trousers down to check. What happened next must go unreported.
I really don't think there is much more I can say about The County Oak – there are two pool tables and darts though I wouldn't recommend either as they can only add potential weapons to an already volatile atmosphere.
There is a third bar, which I think can be hired out, but this was closed and locked when I visited – otherwise it might have provided a temporary hiding place.
The colour scheme throughout is horrible, in fact, come to think of it, it may have been this that upset poor RJ's stomach.
I briefly visited the facilities to leave my calling card and quickly realised it was indeed the only safe haven in the place.
There was no soap in the dispenser but that's the least of your worries here.
By the time I left someone had thrown a bucket of water over the vomit and Emmerdale had replaced the horse racing on the telly, but what certainly hadn't changed was the atmosphere in the pub.
It felt just as dangerous and threatening as when I first went in.
You get the distinct impression the locals have been drinking right through the day and probably the night before too.
I've been in some rough dives in my time, but I don't think I've ever been anywhere that I thought it was more likely to kick off at any moment.
If you're planning a visit here leave your common sense at home and take a couple of minders.

Drink: ★★
(Very little on tap, no decent ale worth considering)

SAN JOSE — The Earthquakes have signed a five-year deal with the 49ers to play an annual regular-season Major League Soccer game at Levi's Stadium.
San Jose president Dave Kaval revealed the agreement Thursday in an interview with this newspaper.
“It's a great way to showcase MLS and our team at a bigger venue,” they said.
An estimated 45,000 fans are expected Saturday when the Quakes (5-8-5, MLS) play host to first-place Seattle Sounders FC to christen the $1.3 billion Levis next to Great America amusement park in Santa Clara.
The Quakes plan to open an 18,000-seat soccer stadium next year across from Mineta San Jose International Airport. But the team will continue playing rival Los Angeles at Stanford Stadium and a second “tent pole” event at Levi's.
“It not only helps us promote our brand and make us feel major league, but it helps us to sell our stadium,” Kaval said.
The Earthquakes, in conjunction with MLS officials, haven't decided on opponents for the games at Levi's. But Kaval said San Jose could face Seattle each year to add to the rivalry the 49ers have with the Seahawks.
The Quakes and Sounders also have a rivalry dating four decades to the now-defunct North American Soccer League. The teams play each season for the Heritage Cup, a competition involving former NASL teams. The Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps also are eligible to participate but so far have not.
Kaval said future opponents for games at Levi's also could include 2015 expansion team New York City FC, which already has signed marquee players David Villa and Frank Lampard.
By playing at Levi's and Stanford stadiums, the Earthquakes can “elevate the ability to sign bigger players,” Kaval said. “We can elevate local TV packages. There are so many positives externalities from these type of successes.”
The 49ers also announced this week that Mexico will play Chile on Sept. 6 at Levi's, the first of many major international soccer events the stadium hopes to hold.

NEW DELHI: A poster calling for freedom for Kashmir had the Jawaharlal Nehru University administration in a tizzy on Thursday.The solitary poster was noticed by some students on the wall of the School of Social Sciences' new block, after which they alerted the varsity administration.“Freedom for Kashmir! Free Palestine! Right to self-determination long live,“ the poster, which appeared in the name of ultra-Left group DSU, stated. By evening, the administration had asked the university security to remove the poster.DSU, or Democratic Students Union, is the same group whose former members Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhat tacharya and others organised a protest rally on February 9, 2016, against the hanging of Parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru and Kashmiri separatist Maqbool Bhat.Alleged anti-national slogans raised during the rally had led to police slapping sedition cases on these students.A student affiliated to a Left group, but not from DSU, said: “The poster has been there for three-four days. But this is nothing new as such posters from DSU keep emerging at the start of sessions.“Khalid and Bhattacharya, along with former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar (from CPI-affiliated AISF) are out on bail after arrest on charges of sedition for the February 9 event.The JNU administration has not been able to function for more 17 days due to a blockade of the administrative building by students protesting against a UGC notification which put a cap on the number of students a professor can provide guidance, resulting in seat cuts in MPhil and PhD programmes. It was only early this week that the staff got access to the building and resumed work.According to a senior JNU official, “The university has already lost precious time and energy in unnecessary controversies. Unfortunately a small group of people are still trying to create another ruckus and vitiate the academic environment.We don't know who put up the poster as this has been the pattern in JNU. However, the administration has asked the staff to bring it down.““On February 9 this year they failed to create any disturbance in JNU and so they targeted Delhi University .This poster is another attempt to destabilise JNU's academic environment,“ said Hariram Mishra, professor of Sanskrit.
APY Mintabie store owner fined for taking $1m from customers' accounts through book-up scheme
Updated
A store owner in South Australia's remote APY Lands has been fined $167,500 for withdrawing almost $1 million from the accounts of local residents.
The Federal Court previously found the owner of Nobby's Mintabie General Store, Lindsay Gordon Kobelt, had withdrawn the money from the accounts of 85 customers between July 2010 and November 2012.
It was told Kobelt used an informal credit system known as 'book-up' that allows people to buy goods on the spot and pay later by providing their account information.
Nobby's also sold cars and customers had used the book-up arrangement for purchase of second-hand vehicles.
Kobelt had each customer's bank debit card and PIN details and used EFTPOS machines to access the accounts, withdrawing wages or Centrelink benefits about the time they went into the accounts.
Corporate regulator ASIC found Kobelt failed to keep good records of what customers owed them and made deductions well in excess of what people had spent.
The Federal Court found them guilty late last year of unconscionable and unlicensed conduct, finding Kobelt was indifferent and defiant to their obligations under the National Consumer Protection Act.
It heard they described a fact sheet ASIC provided about their obligations as "bullshit" after reading the first few lines.
Penalty could have had 'crushing effect'
In their judgment, Justice White said they would reduce the total penalty from $230,000 so it did not have a "crushing effect" on the store owner.
"It is particularly pertinent that they are a 73-year-old sole trader and will bear personally the burden of the court's penalties," they said.
"There is the prospect that the penalties outlined above will have a crushing effect, taking into account their financial situation."
ASIC deputy chairperson Peter Kell said the penalty was a warning to those in the credit industry that exploitation of financially vulnerable consumers would have serious consequences.
"ASIC is continuing to work with book-up providers and Indigenous communities to ensure that all consumers are treated fairly," they said.
"Behaviour that is unscrupulous or illegal will not be tolerated."
Payment of the penalty will now depend on the outcome of an appeal Kobelt has lodged against the Federal Court's finding of misconduct.

KEIZER, Ore. — Police near Salem, Ore., say they arrested a naked man after they broke into two homes, drank booze and used a hot tub at one of them.
Officers received a 911 call early Sunday from a woman who was house-sitting in Keizer when they were awakened by noises coming from the laundry room.
As they went to check it out, the laundry room door slammed, so they grabbed a knife and called police and their husband.
Police found the burglar inside, naked, and arrested them without incident. Investigators determined that they climbed in through a back window after removing a screen.
They also noticed that screens had been removed from windows at a neighbor's home. Police say the suspect had burglarized that home, drinking the homeowner's alcohol and using the hot tub and shower.
Final Fantasy XIV Previews Highlight Its Next Trial And 24-Person Raid
By Casey . May 26, 2016 . 8:00am
The Final Fantasy XIV Lodestone has been updated with a couple of previews showcasing content coming in patch 3.3, Revenge of the Horde.
The first preview gives us another look at “The Final Steps of Faith,” the newest trial headed to the game in which you face off with the fearsome dragon Nidhogg for the final time to decide the fate of the Dragonsong War. This trial will require an item level of 205. There will also be an extreme version named the “Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage,” which will require an item level of 220.
“The great steps which marked a journey's beginning shall now mark its end as the Warrior of Light enters into a final confrontation with the great wyrm Nidhogg. Steel will clash against fang and furious flames. But when the dust settles, only the victor will decide the fate of man, dragon, and the broken bonds that once united them.”
The next preview highlights the second addition to the Void Ark 24-person raid series. To access this raid, adventurers must have an item level of at least 205 and must have completed the quest “To Rule the Skies.” We also get a look at some gear presumably acquired from the upcoming raid.
“Deep in the Yafaem Saltmoor lie the ruins of the fabled city of Mhach─a civilization of the Fifth Astral Era whose prosperity was built upon unparalleled magicks of destruction. It is to this ancient edifice, and its vaults of occult secrets, that you and the Redbills plan your next foray.”
Final Fantasy XIV is available for PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. Patch 3.3 will release on Tuesday, June 7th.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has moved what appears to be a mid-range Musudan missile to its east coast, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said on Thursday, quoting multiple government sources privy to intelligence from U.S. and South Korean authorities.
It was not clear if the missile was mounted with a warhead or whether the North was planning to fire it or was just putting it on display as a show of force, one South Korean government source was quoted as saying.
“South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities have obtained indications the North has moved an object that appears to be a mid-range missile to the east coast,” the source said.
The Musudan missile is believed to have a range of 3,000 km (1,875 miles) or more, which would put all of South Korea and Japan in range and possibly also the U.S. territory of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea is not believed to have tested these mid-range missiles, according to most independent experts
South Korea's defence ministry declined to comment.
North Korea has threatened a nuclear strike on the United States and missile attacks on its Pacific bases, including in Guam. Those threats followed new U.N. sanctions imposed on the North after it carried out its third nuclear test in February.
The missile was moved to the coast by train. The North has a missile launch site on the northeastern coast, which it has used to unsuccessfully test-fire long-range rockets in the past.
The Yonhap report did not say if the missile had been moved to the missile site.
Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper issued a similar report on Thursday, saying the North had moved what appeared to be a long-range missile to its east coast.
Bernie Sanders has run the most successful grassroots campaign in American history, and their second American revolution provides the first real opportunity that We, the People, have had to overthrow our corporate-corrupted government and replace it with a system that benefits the public interest, our shared ecology, and a peaceful future.
There is simply no downside to voting for Sanders during this month's final Democratic primaries. Bernie may still be our next President, despite the widely parroted insistence by a Clinton-biased corporate media and Democratic Party insiders' that Bernie is finished. These are the same voices that have been singing the "may as well stay home Bernie voter" song since the very beginning of the primary season.
There will be time to vote against Donald Trump in November. This is the time to vote FOR Sanders. Because of their huge national support among young and independent voters (two groups whose turnout is needed to win a presidential election), every poll shows Bernie easily beating Trump in November. Recent polls show that Bernie, unlike Hillary, will beat Trump in every swing state, and that their overall projected margins of victory are more than double Hillary's. Clinton is projected to lose to Trump in several key swing states, and some also show them losing the entire election. Bernie wins by double digits.
The superdelegate system has felt like a rigged Democratic National Committee coronation process for Hillary Clinton, tipping the scales with about 500 extra delegate votes well before the first actual citizen expressed their preference at the polls. It is impossible to say how many voters were swayed away from Sanders because of Clinton's constantly repeated superdelegate-enforced "inevitability," or whether a level playing field would have resulted in Sanders being the front runner right now.
Clearly, the system was established by the Democratic Party both to preserve its hierarchal power by allowing the party machinery to deliver votes to the candidate blessed by the party establishment and, to many critics, the corporate donors that fund both parties, almost equally.
But the superdelegates were created for a second reason, a reason that, shall we say, may TRUMP the Clinton coronation process. The primary role of the superdelegate system is to ensure that the Democratic candidate most likely to become President in the national election is nominated.
Democratic superdelegates are loyal--but they are not stupid, and they do not want to lose the White House. Bernie Sanders' call for their support on July 25 is not pie in the sky. It is reality politics. And victories by Sanders during the final June primaries will serve to make this possibility much more likely. That's why California's June 7 election has shaped up to be the most important Democratic contest of the primary season. And why it is more important to vote for Bernie this month than ever.
Bernie, not Hillary, is the one packing stadiums with newly motivated young voters and previously apathetic citizens of all races. Bernie's momentum continues to soar, just as Clinton's popularity, hammered by the latest report on their email scandal and a merciless Trump campaign, continues to decline. If Sanders pulls off an upset victory in California, which feels likely, and in other states during the next few weeks, then Bernie's purportedly impossible dream may yet become our reality.
Winning California will not give either Sanders or Clinton the delegates they need to clinch the nomination. And there is a low likelihood that Sanders will win the two thirds of all remaining unpledged primary delegates (908) needed to overcome Clinton's current 268 delegate advantage. But they can come to within 5% or so of their pledged delegate count. And the superdelegates might do the rest.
Even if the superdelegates stuck with Clinton on July 25, there is a second huge reason for Sanders supporters to turn out for June primaries. This is to compel Clinton to name Bernie Sanders as their Vice Presidential running mate
This will have nothing to do with how Clinton feels about Bernie Sanders. It will have everything to do with the only action that can turn out a sufficient number of Bernie's anti-establishment supporters to win the November election against Trump. This, or selecting as VP Elizabeth Warren (whose Senate seat is probably too valuable for the Democratic Party to lose right now), would be the only way to overcome the distrust that the fast-growing progressive wing of the Democratic Party has for Hillary Clinton. Short of a Sanders nomination, it would be the only way that millions of Sanders voters will feel represented by a Clinton-headed Democratic Party, and the only way they will feel that the Sanders revolution is at least on deck to have a positive impact on our collective future. (Here's our new petition urging them to do this).
The year 2016 will go down in history as the year of the anti-establishment election for both major political parties. This recent video interview of an African American Sanders supporter articulates the worldview of an anti-establishment Sanders voter who says that nothing short of a Sanders or Elizabeth Warren vice presidential selection will compel them to vote for Hillary Clinton. More than half of the Bernie supporters I have interviewed say this. Millions of voters probably feel this way--enough to sway the November election.
Necessity is the mother of invention. Democratic delegates and superdelegates alike will need to unify the Party on July 25 to prepare the ticket most likely to win. If it is demonstrated by the results of the June primaries, and the results of general election polls conducted during the next two months, that Bernie is that person, then the superdelegates will have only three choices:
1) Lose the White House to Donald Trump
2) Make Sanders the Democratic nominee
3) Compel Clinton to name Sanders as their running mate.
Many wonders why Sanders supporters are so reticent to support Hillary Clinton, to "unite" the Democratic Party based on our shared beliefs. A lot of this has to do with the fact that we believe that Bernie, not Hillary, is candidate who better represents these viewpoints. A carefully orchestrated corporate media-supported campaign of misrepresentation has hidden from most citizens the facts that on the voter-critical issues of public campaign financing, Medicare for all, labeling genetically modified food, and the full federal decriminalization of marijuana, it is Sanders, not Clinton, who represents the views of about 80% of Democratic voters--and a majority of Americans as well.
Looming even larger in the minds of Bernie voters is the issue of war and peace. Many of us find it is impossible to support Hillary Clinton's endless war doctrine. That they continue to praise Henry Kissinger, the notorious "butcher of Cambodia," for their "realism" based brand of foreign policy, sends alarm bells ringing.
As recently reported, a people-powered media revolution fuels the Sanders campaign's success, defying carefully messaged deception on Hillary Clinton's behalf.
Like Sanders himself, truth is challenged by an establishment determined to suppress it.
For those June primary voters who have been subjected to the false narratives that exit polls indicate are three of the main reasons citizens have selected Hillary, here's the myth-busting shortlist:
Experience? Bernie has 34 years holding government office compared to Hillary's 12 years.
Effectiveness? Bernie's 83% approval rating by the voters of Vermont is the highest of anyone in the Senate: it was about 50% higher than Clinton's was when they were New York Senator.
The candidate most likely to beat Trump? Poll after poll shows that this is Bernie.
But we've got to elect them first!
June Primary voters, your vote has never been as important as it is right now.
IRVING, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys have waived defensive end Michael Sam from their practice squad and signed linebacker Troy Davis.
Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, signed with the Cowboys on Sept. 3 after they were among the final cuts of the St. Louis Rams.
They took to Twitter on Tuesday to express their gratitude for the opportunity.
I want to thank the Jones family and the entire Cowboys organization for this opportunity, as well as my friends, family, teammates, (1/3) — Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) October 21, 2014
and fans for their support. While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an (2/3) — Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) October 21, 2014
opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday. (3/3) — Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) October 21, 2014
Coach Jason Garrett and defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli praised Sam's work in practice.
"Comes to work every day and practices hard," Garrett said last week. "One of 10 practice roster guys that we have, so he's working on their skills, trying to develop, but also doing a lot of other things. Playing offense, defense, playing the kicking game, that's what a lot of those guys do."
The Cowboys (6-1) have just seven sacks this season, but they never seriously considered calling up Sam to the active roster. With rookie defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence eligible to play Nov. 2 against the Arizona Cardinals, the Cowboys are hoping they can spark the pass rush.
When the Cowboys signed Sam, the team broke from the norm for a practice squad player and held an interview session outside the locker room because of the large corps of media on hand.
"It feels good to be a Cowboy," Sam said that day.
They did not answer questions after that day, slipping into the background like most practice squad players do. They made $6,300 per week.
Davis spent time the last two seasons with the New York Jets before they were released in August.
Now, with about six weeks to go before publication, Mr. Murdoch has raised objections with Mr. Wolff and their publisher about portions of the book, titled "The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch," that suggest that Mr. Murdoch is at times embarrassed by Fox News, which they own, and its chief executive, Roger Ailes, and that they often share "the general liberal apoplexy," as Mr. Wolff writes in the book, toward Fox News and its perceived conservative slant...
...The objections raised on behalf of Mr. Murdoch came after an article on Mr. Murdoch and the book was published in Vanity Fair in the October issue in which Mr. Wolff wrote that Mr. Murdoch was making friends with liberals and that they had soured on Fox News and Mr. Ailes. (A 10,000-word excerpt from the book will be published in the December issue, due out early next month.)
"For a long time, they were in love with the Fox chief, Roger Ailes, because they were even more Murdoch than Murdoch," Mr. Wolff wrote in the October Vanity Fair piece. "And yet now the embarrassment can't be missed -- they mumble even more than usual when called on to justify it; they barely pretend to hide the way they feel about Bill O'Reilly."

Something is stirring in Saudi Arabia. Gone is the historically conservative, don't-rock-the-boat, tip-toeing approach to the big, strategic issues of the Middle East.
In its place has come a new, assertive attitude that is seeing the oil-rich kingdom set off on previously untried and potentially risky ventures.
In Yemen, the Saudi military has now been at war with Houthi rebels for more than four months.
In Syria, Saudi patronage for Islamist rebels opposed to the government of President Bashar al-Assad has been stepped up dramatically - and, on the Iran nuclear deal, well-placed Saudi sources have let it be known that if they assess Tehran as likely to acquire nuclear weapons in the future, then Saudi Arabia will go down the same path, triggering a Middle Eastern arms race.
So, what's behind this?
Jeddah, September 2013, and I am sitting in an air-conditioned reception room in a well-guarded palace, close to the shores of the Red Sea.
There are only two other people in the room, Crown Prince - now King - Salman Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud and their most favoured son, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
On that day, Prince Salman was still 16 months away from succeeding their brother King Abdullah to the throne.
But as the country's defence minister, they had just rushed back from holiday in Morocco to take charge of Saudi forces, which were then poised to support the Americans in launching punitive missile strikes on Assad.
The missile strikes were supposed to be an international response to the widely-held belief that the Syrian regime was behind the massive nerve gas attack at Ghouta that summer, which killed hundreds of Syrian civilians.
But thanks to a Russian-brokered deal that saw Assad give up their chemical arsenal - or most of it - the missile strikes were called off at the eleventh hour.

Young but ambitious
For the Saudi leadership, this was a seminal moment and a turning point in its dealings with the US.
The Saudis felt utterly let down by their long-time American allies. They had been hoping that combined international military action against the Assad regime would finally turn the corner in that country's civil war, removing Iran's closest allied Arab ruler, President Assad, and replacing them with a Sunni-led government.
When this did not happen, the senior Saudi princes and decision-makers resolved that, from then on, they would have to take matters into their own hands.
Step forward the young, militarily inexperienced, but highly ambitious Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the younger man present in that meeting in Jeddah.
At about 30 years old, they are possibly the world's youngest defence minister.
 They are also the visible face of the massive Saudi-led military campaign to push back the Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen and restore the exiled President Hadi, a Saudi ally, to power.

In Saudi news bulletins, the tall and often unshaven Prince Mohammed can be seen visiting operations rooms, inspecting plans, conferring with their generals.
To the surprise of many, their gamble appears to be paying off, although the hapless Yemeni population has paid a heavy price.
After four months of relentless pounding of Houthi positions with air strikes, the blockading of Yemeni ports and airports and the landing in Aden of an entire UAE armoured brigade, the Houthis are now on the back foot.
Despite an estimated 3,000 people killed and 80% of the Yemeni population now reliant on aid, the Saudi leadership appears determined to see the campaign through and force the Houthis to sue for peace.

For Saudi Arabia, this is about more than just securing its southern flank.
The Saudis fear they are being steadily encircled by Iranian allies and this is something they want to reverse.
In Yemen, they see the Shia Houthis as being a proxy militia for Iran, although in reality the Houthis owed their earlier gains to support they got from the ousted former President Saleh, not the Iranians.
In Iraq, they have watched in dismay as the Sunni regime of Saddam Hussein has given way to a Shia-led government with extremely close ties to Tehran. Iranian-trained militias were instrumental in helping Iraq retake the town of Tikrit from IS.
In Syria, the Saudis see Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, battling Sunni rebels - and in Bahrain and their own eastern province, they have long suspected Iran's Quds Force of encouraging unrest amongst the Shia population.
So how will this end? Badly, say Saudi Arabia's detractors.
They think the country is over-reaching itself and backing some dangerous players in places like Syria, feeding into a wave of Sunni jihadism that will bring more violence from IS supporters to the streets of Saudi Arabia, as well as elsewhere.
But some seasoned observers who have been watching the newfound Saudi assertiveness say that, in the wake of the disastrous Arab Spring that has brought such misery to much of the Arab world, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to look after its own interests, form its own alliances and forge its own path, irrespective of what Washington is up to.
New light has been shed on solar power generation using devices made with polymers, thanks to a collaboration between scientists in the University of Chicago's chemistry department, the Institute for Molecular Engineering, and Argonne National Laboratory.
Researchers identified a new polymer -- a type of large molecule that forms plastics and other familiar materials -- which improved the efficiency of solar cells. The group also determined the method by which the polymer improved the cells' efficiency. The polymer allowed electrical charges to move more easily throughout the cell, boosting the production of electricity -- a mechanism never before demonstrated in such devices.
"Polymer solar cells have great potential to provide low-cost, lightweight and flexible electronic devices to harvest solar energy," said Luyao Lu, graduate student in chemistry and lead author of a paper describing the result, published online last month in the journal Nature Photonics.
Solar cells made from polymers are a popular topic of research due to their appealing properties. But researchers are still struggling to efficiently generate electrical power with these materials.
"The field is rather immature -- it's in the infancy stage," said Luping Yu, professor in chemistry, fellow in the Institute for Molecular Engineering, who led the UChicago group carrying out the research.
The active regions of such solar cells are composed of a mixture of polymers that give and receive electrons to generate electrical current when exposed to light. The new polymer developed by Yu's group, called PID2, improves the efficiency of electrical power generation by 15 percent when added to a standard polymer-fullerene mixture.
"Fullerene, a small carbon molecule, is one of the standard materials used in polymer solar cells," Lu said. "Basically, in polymer solar cells we have a polymer as electron donor and fullerene as electron acceptor to allow charge separation." In their work, the UChicago-Argonne researchers added another polymer into the device, resulting in solar cells with two polymers and one fullerene.
8.2 percent efficiency
The group achieved an efficiency of 8.2 percent when an optimal amount of PID2 was added -- the highest ever for solar cells made up of two types of polymers with fullerene -- and the result implies that even higher efficiencies could be possible with further work. The group is now working to push efficiencies toward 10 percent, a benchmark necessary for polymer solar cells to be viable for commercial application.
The result was remarkable not only because of the advance in technical capabilities, Yu noted, but also because PID2 enhanced the efficiency via a new method. The standard mechanism for improving efficiency with a third polymer is by increasing the absorption of light in the device. But in addition to that effect, the team found that when PID2 was added, charges were transported more easily between polymers and throughout the cell.
In order for a current to be generated by the solar cell, electrons must be transferred from polymer to fullerene within the device. But the difference between electron energy levels for the standard polymer-fullerene is large enough that electron transfer between them is difficult. PID2 has energy levels in between the other two, and acts as an intermediary in the process.
"It's like a step," Yu said. "When it's too high, it's hard to climb up, but if you put in the middle another step then you can easily walk up."
Thanks to a collaboration with Argonne, Yu and their group were also able to study the changes in structure of the polymer blend when PID2 was added, and show that these changes likewise improved the ability of charges to move throughout the cell, further improving the efficiency. The addition of PID2 caused the polymer blend to form fibers, which improve the mobility of electrons throughout the material. The fibers serve as a pathway to allow electrons to travel to the electrodes on the sides of the solar cell.
"It's like you're generating a street and somebody that's traveling along the street can find a way to go from this end to another," Yu said.
To reveal this structure, Wei Chen of the Materials Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory and the Institute for Molecular Engineering performed X-ray scattering studies using the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley.
"Without that it's hard to get insight about the structure," Yu said, calling the collaboration with Argonne "crucial" to the work. "That benefits us tremendously," they said.
Chen noted that "Working together, these groups represent a confluence of the best materials and the best expertise and tools to study them to achieve progress beyond what could be achieved with independent efforts.
"This knowledge will serve as a foundation from which to develop high-efficiency organic photovoltaic devices to meet the nation's future energy needs," Chen said. -- By Emily Conover
00:47 Why Wildfires Are Creating More Thunderstorms A freaky phenomenon is on the rise: wildfires are creating thunderstorms. Here's why that's a growing problem.
At a Glance States of emergency have been declared in Tennessee, North Carolina and Kentucky.
Officials in Kentucky say 150 of 210 wildfires since October were arson-related.
With little to no rain in recent weeks and prolonged drought conditions affecting much of the Southeast, hundreds of wildfires have broken out across the region, prompting evacuations and sending up a blanket of smoke that covers several states.
Many of the fires are the result of arson, officials say, and three people have been arrested thus far, according to the Associated Press.
Police in eastern Kentucky say they have arrested a man described as a "wannabe meteorologist" who deliberately set a wildfire in an attempt to garner a larger Facebook following. Johnny Mullins, 21 of Jenkins, Kentucky, faces a charge of second-degree arson for a blaze in Letcher County, Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens told the AP.
"(Mullins) likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow them on their 'weather forecast,'" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens told the AP. "So that's pretty much why they did what they did. They enjoyed the attention they got from the Facebook stuff."
(MORE: La Niña Is Here, and It'll Be Around for the Winter )
According to Stephens, Mullins posted selfie videos on Facebook that were recorded in front of various fires. They called them "Weather Outlook" segments and received 2,900 views on their final video, which they posted Nov. 6.
Another unidentified teen was also arrested on suspicion of arson in Harlan, Kentucky, and a man was charged in Tennessee with setting fires and vandalism that caused more than $250,000 in damage outside Chattanooga.
According to the Courier-Journal, at least 150 of 210 wildfires — or 76 percent — that have broken out since October in Kentucky are arson-related , the Kentucky Energy and Environmental Cabinet reported.
The blazes have prompted officials in Tennessee, North Carolina and Kentucky to declare states of emergency.
More than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have poured into the Southeast to help fight the fires, according to Shardul Raval, U.S. Forest Service Director of Fire and Aviation Management for the Southern Region. About 40 aircraft, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, have been brought in.
North Carolina
Hundreds of acres have burned in Western North Carolina after multiple wildfires broke out, prompting the evacuation of dozens of residents in affected areas, according to the Citizen-Times.
<img class="styles__noscript__2rw2y" src="https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/58249fa5c46188b71f8b45b5.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0" srcset="https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/58249fa5c46188b71f8b45b5.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 400w, https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/58249fa5c46188b71f8b45b5.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 800w" > Smoke rising from several wildfires in the Southeast, taken from space on Monday, Nov. 7, 2016.

The Maple Springs fire, which began on Nov. 4 north of Santeetlah Lake, has burned 7,500 acres as of Monday night and is 15 percent contained.
The Party Rock fire burning in Chimney Rock State Park has consumed almost 3,500 acres and was 15 percent contained by Monday night, according to InciWeb.
Carrie Harmon, public information officer with the Fire Information Team at the Party Rock fire, told weather.com that increased fuel conditions, high wind gusts and relatively low humidity helped fuel the fire.
More than 375 personnel are battling the blaze. A majority of the personnel are from the North Carolina Forest Service, according to Harmon, who added that a burn ban is in effect for this area and 25 counties in the western part of North Carolina.
The counties with the ban are Alexander, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga and Yancey.
The issuance of any new permits has also been suspended until the ban is lifted.
"Due to weather conditions and extreme drought, a fire could ignite very easily and so take as much precaution as possible," Harmon said.
The Party Rock fire caused at least 18 homes to be evacuated, while another 50 homes in the area were warned of the growing blaze.
Limited evacuations were ordered for the Quail Ridge and Huntington Road areas of the Rumbling Bald Resort, according to a statement from Lake Lure's local government. Emergency personnel is going door to door to evacuate residents.
The Boteler fire near Hayesville in Clay County has reportedly consumed almost 9,000 acres and is 43 percent contained as of Monday night.
Located northwest of Franklin, the Tellico fire began on Nov. 3. The largest of North Carolina's active fires, it has consumed more than 13,676 acres and is 68 percent contained .
The blaze has prompted a state of emergency in Swain and Macon counties, the Citizen-Times also reported.
Kentucky
After dozens of fires broke out this week, the state's Department for Public Health issued a smoke inhalation advisory for the southeastern part of the state due to poor air quality and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin declared a state of emergency, according to Fox News.
Two woodland fires burning in Breathitt County have consumed 3,500 and 2,200 acres respectively , according to WEKU.
New restrictions on smoking, campfires and other potential fire hazards have gone into effect along the Kentucky-Tennessee border, the AP reported. Fireworks will be prohibited and stoves, lanterns and heating devices will be limited. Campfires are only permitted in designated campgrounds and picnic areas where metal fire rings and grills are provided.
Smoking is permitted only in vehicles, buildings or developed recreations sites, or areas cleared at least three feet away from flammable materials.
Tennessee
Dozens of wildfires in eastern Tennessee have left a blanket of smoke across much of the area.
“We are smoked out here in Cleveland ,” Terry McDonald, public affairs officer at the Cherokee National Forest, told the Knoxville News Sentinel.
The Tennesee Emergency Management Agency declared a Level 3 State of Emergency in response to the prolonged threat of drought and wildfires across the state, according to WBIR.com.
A forest fire trapped seven firefighters west of Kingsport , reports Fox News. All seven firefighters were later accounted for and none were injured, according to Gary Murrell, director of the Hawkins County Emergency Management Agency.
Nathan Waters, assistant forester of the East Tennessee District, said the wildfires keep cropping up, making conditions difficult for weary firefighters.
“We have been battling fires since well before Halloween,” Waters said. “When you have forest fires it takes a long time to get them out. It wears out the equipment and wears out the people. We are very fortunate compared to the Cumberland District; they have had larger issues.”
One of the largest wildfires is burning on Signal Mountain, along the Tennessee-Georgia border.
Anderson County is fighting four fires that have burned 4,230 acres , Campbell County has seven fires that have consumed 620 acres, Cumberland County has three fires burning 508 acres and Morgan County has five fires burning 600 acres, WBIR.com reports.
According to Waters, one firefighter was hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning after working alongside other firefighters to battle a blaze in White County near Sparta.
Georgia
Dozens of fires have broken out in Georgia in the past few weeks as drought conditions continue, especially in northern counties.
The mountaintop community of Head River Brow has been covered with thick smoke since Thursday and firefighters have been working to protect the homes, according to WXIA-TV. The flames nearly consumed a two-bedroom cabin. The owner, David Harris, said the fire came within about 15 feet.
"As soon as I dropped my girls off at school I got marching orders from the wife to come get our wedding pictures. That's really the only valuable thing in the house that we couldn't replace," said Harris.
In Rabun County, authorities are seeking a suspected arsonist that may have purposely started at least five small fires.
According to the Clayton Tribune, the Rabun County Sheriff's Office is on the lookout for a white male driving a dark blue SUV that was seen in the areas of the Rabun fires.
Two different fires along Tallulah River Road in Rabun County are burning on opposite sides of the road. One is named Rock Mountain, according to the Tribune. The other is Flat Branch. As of Monday night, the Rock Mountain fire had burned nearly 5,500 acres and was 10 percent contained.
Firefighters have been battling the Rough Ridge fire burning in the Cohutta Wilderness area of the Chattahoochee National Forest since Oct. 16, when lightning sparked the blaze.
"The fire continued its upslope run out of the Rough Creek drainage and crossed East Cowpen Trail and is backing downslope towards the west," states Inciweb. "Smoldering and creeping occurred in area with high shade. Leaf fall is continuing, so reburn potential remains high and expected to continue for the next two weeks."
According to WXIA-TV, wind and continued dry conditions have served as fuel for the wildfire that has exploded to more than 21,500 acres as of Monday night. The inferno is 20 percent contained.
On Lookout Mountain in Dade and Walker counties, two separate blazes have burned 450 and 100 acres respectively, according to NewsChannel9.com.
STOCKTON - The state's oldest elementary school is in danger of closing if a regional school district approves a plan to consolidate its facilities.
The tiny borough, which has a population of 538 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is home to the state's oldest, and smallest, elementary school. Most years fewer than 50 students are enrolled in the school, which opened in 1832. The current school building dates to 1872.
The South Hunterdon Regional School District, created in 2013, serves Lambertville, West Amwell and the borough. Most of the neighboring schools also have small student populations, with the South Hunterdon Regional High School often serving under 500 students each year.
The district has three elementary schools, one in each community, as well as a combined middle and high school.
A community meeting is planned for 7 p.m. Wednesday at the borough's fire house to discuss the school's future, according to Sara Bizarro, vice-president of the Stockton School Parent Teacher Organization.
Mayor concerned board wants to close school
"The district has a Master Plan for the future with 10 original options that were voted down to two options without any input from the community," they said. "Neither of the options on the table include Stockton Borough Elementary School."
Dan Seiter, president of the Board of Education, and Superintendent Lou Muenker are expected to attend the meeting along with members of the board. Declining enrollment is one of the reasons the district has considered closing the school, it has been previously reported.
"Residents will be able to discuss our school's situation and if there are steps can be taken to help keep our school as a viable option for the district," Bizarro said.
There are also discussions underway to make the school a magnet facility in an effort to keep enrollment numbers up.
In April, the board considered moving the kindergarten, first and sixth grade students to the West Amwell Township School for the 2016-17 school year. The kindergarten and first grade did move, but the sixth grade students remained in Stockton.
Stockton Mayor Timothy Nemeth said at the time they worried the move was a first step toward closing the school.
"Many people outside of Stockton, including within our own newly regionalized school district don't really understand or get our school," Stockton Parent Teacher Organization member Karen Edwards said at the time. "We are different, we are small, we have combined grade levels, but that creates a fantastic learning experience."
A treadwheel, or treadmill, is a form of engine typically powered by humans. It may resemble a water wheel in appearance, and can be worked either by a human treading paddles set into its circumference (treadmill), or by a human or animal standing inside it (treadwheel). These devices are no longer used for power or punishment, and the term "treadmill" has come to mean an exercise machine for running or walking in place.
History [ edit ]
Uses of treadwheels included raising water, to power cranes, or grind grain. They were used extensively in the Greek and Roman world, such as in the reverse overshot water-wheel used for dewatering purposes. They were widely used in the Middle ages to lift the stones in the soaring Gothic cathedrals. There is a literary reference to one in 1225, [1] and one treadwheel crane survives at Chesterfield, Derbyshire and is housed in the Museum. It has been dated to the early 14th century and was housed in the top of the church tower until its removal in 1947. They were used extensively in the Renaissance famously by Brunelleschi during the construction of Florence cathedral.
Penal treadmills were used in prisons during the early-Victorian period in the UK as a form of punishment. According to The Times in 1827, and reprinted in William Hone's Table-Book in 1838, the amount prisoners walked per day on average varied, from the equivalent of 6,600 vertical feet at Lewes to as much as 17,000 vertical feet in ten hours during the summertime at Warwick gaol.[2]In 1902, the British government banned the use of the treadwheel as a form of punishment.

With trust in the world's currencies at its lowest point in recent memory, bartering has reemerged as a possible solution to the credit crunch. All but forgotten, bartering predates any modern form of currency, and arose naturally in the ancient world as the primary means of economic exchange. Today, there are a number of barter systems in place alongside replacement currencies that operate on a local level in cities or small rural villages. Whether these approaches come from a hot Web 2.0 startup or a tiny Thai village, they are changing the economic landscape. Here's a look at some of the most promising.
Cyber Bartering
chika
Cyber-bartering is not a new phenomenon, but bartering-specific sites are more popular today than ever. More specialized sites such as Barterbee, Barterquest and Rehashclothes, offer individuals various avenues for bartering, specific to what good or service they are looking for. And then there is Craigslist.org: this site is not a bartering site per se, but its worldwide reach and myriad categories offer individuals the ability to trade anything with anyone, anywhere in the world. Want to trade a washing machine for a motorcycle? How about your old hockey gear for a new snowboard? Check out this site, and chances are, you'll find someone who's willing to take up your offer.
Regional Bartering Exchanges
rick
In the last several years, many regional bartering exchanges began popping up in various parts of the United States, and presumably elsewhere in the world. These are networks of businesses that trade the value of services for that of other services. For instance, a plumber may do a $400 dollar repair job for a local brewery. But instead of trading this directly for $400 worth of beer and chicken fingers, they can take this credit and put it back in circulation by trading units of $400 for other goods and services from the various other network members.
Big Businesses Bartering
herval
While it may sound strange, many of the world's largest companies are involved in bartering at some level. According to a recent study by Barter Business Unlimited (a large network with over 10,000 member businesses), “…more than 65 percent of the corporations listed in the New York Stock Exchange are presently using barter to reduce surplus inventory, boost sales and ensure that production facilities run at near capacity.” This can definitely help lots of businesses struggling to move inventory during this recession. CEO of Bartermania.com, Vipul Rawal claims that global business-to-business bartering is up by as much as 60% due to the current recession, and this trend is starting reach developing countries such as India and China.
Local Bartering Circles
techlah
In countries across the world, people are going back to the local marketplaces in droves. Exchanging wares and services are typically traded at such gatherings, which may set up for bartering specifically, or the bartering itself may just be a byproduct of individuals' personal credit crunches. Anything from surfboards to electronics, to produce can typically be traded at such places. While these of course did not emerge as a reaction to the current recession, there's no doubt that they are more popular today than ever.
Script Currencies
writerjax
Another recent development is the re-emergence of local currencies, or script currencies. One of the most famous examples of these started in 2007, in Western Massachusetts. In an effort to promote buying locally, residents of several communities are able to trade in $10 US at local banks for $11 Berkshares. There is a ten percent discount worked into the exchange rate, and the currency is widely accepted by many area merchants. As a result of the increased local commerce, businesses are willing to discount their prices, and local shoppers are happy to get the discount. It is estimated that more than $2 Million worth of Berkshares have circulated through 350 businesses since the bills were first printed two years ago.
Replacement Currencies
shmoomeena
Replacement currencies also tend to develop when a national currency loses the trust of local economies. During Asia's financial crises a decade ago, these developed in more remote regions, where many were dependent on remittances from relatives living in capital cities. The Santi Suk community in Northeastern Thailand is a notable example. The whole program is managed by a single monk, who operates the ‘Bank' from their one-room office. The currency goes by the Thai word for ‘merit', and is used alongside, or in lieu of the Thai Baht. Proponents of this currency (which are decorated by drawings made by local children) were once the subject of central government scorn, but due to today's global financial crises, the government is allowing the money to flow freely once again, as it does not place a strain on the broader economy, nor the currency at large.
Bartering's Legal Side
umjanedoan
While few might stop to think about the legal ramifications of bartering, it should be noted that even though it seems informal, bartering is a transaction just like any other. For those trading goods or services of a marked value, a contract ought to be used to protect both parties. According to SMU Law professor, Mary Spector, every aspect of the exchange should be outlined, for example, with regards to pet care being exchanged: “Would [four hours of pet care] mean grooming the pet? Walking the pet? How many pets would be involved? Is it just dogs or would it be dogs and fish?
Tax Implications of Bartering
Matt Honan
Similar to the legal ramifications, there are also tax implications of barter-based commerce. According to the IRS, “If you conduct any direct barter – barter for another's products or services – you will have to report the fair market value of the products or services you received on your tax return.”

How It Could Have Changed the World:
Cavendish made the majority of their discoveries decades before they were officially invented -- in the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution and the era of the steam engine. And when you look at said discoveries, you'll realize that many of their findings concerned pretty crucial stuff about thermodynamics and electricity.

Things like, "Warning: Do not lick."

Now, imagine if England had figured out electricity decades before they actually did. With findings like Ohm's Law moved from 1827 to 1781, a vast thermodynamic and electrical knowledge suddenly at the scientific community's disposal and the public mind set in the "industrialize everything" mode that was the spirit of the era, the progress of technology would have been rapidly put to use. Gaslights could have become electrical ones within years, and the steam engine would've gone the way of the dodo. Great Britain might've entered the Victorian era fully lit, amped up and more powerful than ever, at no bigger price than the ruined dreams of potential future steampunk enthusiasts.
Which, now that we come to think of it, might not be a bad thing. There's also another side to the Electrified England scenario: We doubt that they would've been too keen to share their newly found power with America, what with one thing and another going on at the time. So it's entirely possible that they'd used their Cavendish tech against America, who'd have been back to eating tea and crumpets before they even realized it.

In the late 70s and early 80s, there was no better defenceman for the Montreal Canadiens than Larry Robinson. The undisputed numbers two and three, and closing in fast, were Rod Langway (drafted 26th overall by the Canadiens in 1977) and Brian Engblom (selected 22nd in 1975).
From 1978 to 1982, they were consistently second and third in scoring among defencemen for the team, providing the club with a stabilizing force on the back end, and the heirs apparent on defence.
La Presse named Engblom “the most consistent defenceman” at the end of the 1981-82 season. They were voted to the Second All-Star Team at the end of the year, only second to Wayne Gretzky in the plus-minus department, and well ahead of Robinson.
Langway was being called “the next Robinson,” and not just because they both sported the same hairstyle and mustache, but because of the nastiness of their style of play.
The 1981-82 season concluded with a rather embarrassing first-round playoff exit to their provincial rival, the Quebec Nordiques. This was the third season in a row where, despite finishing very strong during the regular season, the once mighty Montreal Canadiens failed to get past the opening series of the post-season, and people were starting to freak out. This was, after all, the team that was four seasons removed from a dynasty.
Blame was being assigned, from the managing director, Irving Grundman, to head coach Bob Berry, all the way to the team's chief of scouting, “Professor” Ronald Caron, who failed to draft capable replacements for the team's aging stars. The Montreal Gazette ran a critical article of the team's direction with the infamous title “Canadiens' once-proud dynasty in Ruin” plastered across the front page of the sports section on the eve of their elimination. It was certainly time to act, and the entire team realized that changes would have to be made.
Tough financial reality in Canada
It was a tumultuous time in Canada in 1982, with interest rates hitting record highs of around 21% due to runaway inflation rates that sent the Canadian economy into a crisis. The Canadian dollar began to crash, and unemployment rates spiked as companies began downsizing to be able to compete with overseas manufacturing.
Unemployment in Montreal went up 39% in a single year. All of these factors, combined with a new federal budget that increased the income tax burden on the nation's citizens, decreased the quality of life in Canada, and everyone felt the pinch of the financial crisis, especially for residents of Quebec who paid the highest provincial taxes in the country.
Canadiens players were looking to renegotiate their contracts, something that was permitted under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, under special circumstances. Among the most vocal were Larry Robinson, Guy Lafleur, and Rod Langway.
Robinson and Lafleur ended up forming a collective front, and gradually increased their threats from refusing to play any pre-season games to not showing up to training camp, to outright retiring and going to play in Japan (that last one was more of a facetious threat that never held any water).
Grundman was ready to begin talks with Robinson and Lafleur, however they set a different tone for contract discussions with Langway, telling La Presse that “he better come equipped with some real solid arguments to convince me to renegotiate their contract. As an American citizen Rob is not taxed the same way as the rest of the guys.”
Langway replied to the comments a few days later saying that “I'll be there when training camp starts [...] but I'm not sure if I'll still be there when it ends.” Langway had been previously quoted stating that they wanted to continue their career in the United States to make more money, and although they denied those reports, they hurt their standing with the Canadiens.
Other players rumoured to also be looking to renegotiate their deals included Pierre Mondou and Brian Engblom, but at least in the case of the former, discussions never took place.
The big shock came down on September 9, 1982 — three days before training camp was due to open — when Grundman made a six-player trade sending Langway, Engblom, defensive specialist Doug Jarvis, and Craig Laughlin to the Washington Capitals for defenceman Rick Green and forward Ryan Walter.
Reactions to the trade
The trade was widely panned in the media, notably for involving Engblom, even running afoul of iconic Gazette columnist Red Fisher, who has covered the Canadiens since the late 1950s. In their scathing article, Fisher claimed that the Canadiens “gave away too much for what they received. Far too much. [...] What was Irving thinking about when they agreed to relinquish Engblom, who has been the best Canadiens' defenceman during the last two seasons... by far?”
Several players also voiced their displeasure in the trade:
Rick Wamsley: “How are we gonna get the puck out of our end? Nine times out of 10 Brian and Rod would get the puck out of our end. We've lost two of the best.”
Larry Robinson: “I thought we gave up too much. [...] when you give away someone like Brian, you're not only giving up an All-Star, you're giving away experience, something we're not left with right now.”
Mark Napier: “There's no surprise about Rod. I was surprised about Brian. The two of them leaving ... it leaves us a little short back there.”
Doug Risebrough (who was also traded that day): “They're blowing it apart, aren't they?”
But there were a few voices who saw the bigger picture.
Captain Bob Gainey: “We gave up some important pieces, but I imagine that to acquire a player of Walter's quality we had to give up a lot. In general I am opposed to any kind of change, so I can't be happy seeing those guys go.”
Richard Sevigny: “It's certain that we are now weakened on defence, but we got much better on offence. Since our defensive prospects are ready, Robert Picard in particular, I think that it was a good trade.”
Head Scout Claude Ruel: “We are bursting at the seams with defensive talent, and it is time to make some room for some younger players. Players like Bill Kitchen and Craig Ludwig.”
Jean Beliveau: “It was a necessary move. It's no secret that it's several years that I have advocated that the team add a big physical forward. [...] It's important to realize that having a forward like Walter is very important.”
The Washington Capitals' managing director, David Poile was ecstatic about the transaction, calling it a “trade that can happen only once every ten years in the National Hockey League. I can easily compare Langway to Larry Robinson at their best. With them nothing is impossible. As for Engblom, he's an international-class player, and I have no doubts that we have greatly improved the team with this move. By losing Walter we lose a player capable of scoring around 35 goals. However we gained two excellent defencemen capable of reducing our goals against by 60 to 70 goals.”
Joining the Canadiens
In return the Canadiens received a player that they had been trying to acquire for two years, and over three different management regimes, in left winger Ryan Walter. The Canadiens were looking to refresh their aging left wing, with Steve Shutt and Rejean Houle in the twilight of their careers, while the top left winger, Mark Napier, was in the midst of new contract negotiations that were not going well at all. Walter was coming off a 38-goal, 87-point season in Washington, so big things were expected of them in Montreal.
Defenceman Rick Green came advertized as a large 6'3” defenceman with six years of NHL experience, slow on skates but hard to play against. Not known for the offensive flair of Langway or Engblom, Green was a stay-at-home defenceman, quite content in stopping the opponent from scoring. They were quite happy about the trade, telling the Montreal Gazette: “mainly I'm just glad to be getting out of here and to get with a winner. I'm not overly concerned about the tax thing, but I'll be getting some professional advice about it pretty soon.”
Hindsight
Walter never came close to the 87 points or 38 goals they netted in 1981-82, but played nine seasons in Montreal. Initially they formed a dynamic offensive line with Guy Lafleur on the right side and Doug Wickenheiser at centre. Eventually as they aged they transitioned into more of a defensive role on the team.
Green stayed with the Canadiens for seven seasons, but missed the majority of the 1983-84 season with an injury.
Walter and Green were both part of the 1986 Stanley Cup-winning Canadiens team and the 1989 Cup finalist team.
Both players ended up having long careers in Montreal, but by far the brightest future of a player involved was Langway's.
Langway immediately blossomed and made a major impact on the Capitals, being named captain and winning the Norris Trophy for best defenceman that year, and taking them to their very first playoff birth. They would bear the captaincy for 11 seasons with the Capitals, and won a second Norris in 83-84.
Engblom never reached the same career highs they had enjoyed with the Canadiens, seeing their goal differential stats fall from +78 in 1981-82, their last with Montreal, to -4 in 1982-83, their first with the Capitals. They were quickly traded to Los Angeles a season later than part of the deal that brought Larry Murphy the other way.
Jarvis would win a Selke Trophy with the Capitals, in the same year as Langway's second Norris.
Grundman, historically seen as one of the worse general managers in Canadiens history, was relieved of their duties at the conclusion of the 1982-83 season.
Was it worth it?
The big question from this trade was whether the Canadiens weakened their defensive corps, or whether the younger players (and Green) could replace Langway and Engblom effectively.
Unfortunately, the answer was: no. The team allowed an additional 63 goals the following season, while scoring ten fewer. They also did not fare any better in the playoffs, getting knocked out early for a fourth straight season.
Kitchen and Picard were certainly not up to the task of replacing Langway and Engblom, and faded out of the lineup quickly. Ludwig and Green were serviceable, but it wasn't until the emergence of Chris Chelios and Petr Svoboda a few seasons later that the team's defence started to fill the hole. By the time the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs came around, Walter was not a difference maker, having played in only five games all playoffs due to an injury.
Employers who engage in unfair labor practices can be forced to pay a union's bargaining expenses, a federal appeals court ruled Friday, a move that could helped organized labor by tamping down on the practice going forward.
In a unanimous ruling by the D.C. Circuit, the court ruled the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can order the reimbursement of bargaining expenses like it did when it determined two Illinois nursing homes under the same ownership must do so.
“An award of bargaining expenses remedies an unfair labor practice by ensuring that, upon resolution of the unfair labor practice charge, the injured party can return to negotiations on the same footing it occupied before the violation of the [Labor Relations] Act occurred,” Judge Karen LeCraft wrote as part of the decision.
The NLRB in 2011 sided with unionized nursing home workers represented by SEIU at the Illinois nursing homes after determining their owner “blatantly circumvented the bargaining process and disregarded their statutory bargaining obligation by unilaterally implementing numerous changes in the employees' terms and conditions of employment and engaging in direct dealings with employees.”
Among the proposals made by the employer were a ban on union leafletting within 5,000 feet of a facility, as well as calling on employees to resolve grievances with management directly without the union's involvement. As a result, the NLRB called for the company to reimburse the union.
Employers often go to extreme measures to halt the power of unions. So the court ruling is a victory for everyday Americans who are merely trying to ensure their legal right of union representation is not abridged.
Companies should think twice before messing with Union Power!
Pankaj Tandon, a Harvard-trained economist, is a numismatist by calling. Poring over inscriptions and icons on old Indian coins, the academic has gathered enough evidence to put one forgotten dynasty on the Silk Route—the ancient trade route between the East and West—back on the map. And they are working on finding details about well-known dynasties as well—all from coins.
The detour into history was unplanned. Originally, the economist viewed ancient Indian coins simply as an investment. The price of cultural memorabilia is relatively low in developing countries, says Tandon, who teaches economics at Boston University.
“As the country becomes wealthier—its value skyrockets," they say.
Back in the 1990s, India looked to be poised for growth. In 1998, Tandon bought their very first coin, which was probably issued around the time of Asoka the Great. But they learned that the Maurya dynasty had minted millions of coins, and many survived—so the coin was not as rare as they had thought.
As Tandon learned more, they created the virtual museum CoinIndia.com to promote an appreciation of coins from the subcontinent. Indian coinage goes back a long way—the first coins appeared about 2,500 years ago near present-day Patna. The designs, which evolved over time, reveal many influences—from Ancient Greece, Rome and Persia. So, plenty of variety here.
Upinder Singh, head of the history department at the University of Delhi, says that in the virtual museum, the quality of the images is excellent and the text is reliable and informative. Cataloguing close to 2,000 coins for CoinIndia was a good learning experience, says Tandon.
But serious collectors don't just want to know about coins—they want to be able to read the inscriptions by themselves. That can be challenging.
Unlike today's machine-made currency, coins struck by hand could be missing critical parts of the inscription that reveal who issued it, when and why. A scholar of ancient Indian coins would have to read inscriptions in Greek, the extinct Kharosthi script and Brahmi, the mother of most modern Indian scripts.
Mystery coin
All this could make deciphering ancient coins akin to solving crossword puzzles. Tandon happens to be a crossword aficionado. “I never consign my copy of New York Times to the recycling bin till I have solved the puzzles," they say.
Thanks to their training in mathematics, Tandon knew the Greek alphabet. “We all do, from studying mathematics and science in school," they say matter-of-factly. They taught themselves to read Kharosthi and Brahmi.
So, what can old coins tell us? Details that corroborate recorded facts and, occasionally, lead to a rewrite of some chapters in history textbooks.
Take, for instance, a numismatic puzzle that Tandon cracked recently. In 1851, a hoard of gold coins was found near the holy city of Varanasi. They were issued by the Guptas, who ruled from the 4th to the 6th centuries CE. The Guptas stamped coins with their given names on the front and an assumed name ending with “aditya" on the back.
On two of the coins in the hoard, scholars were able to read only the king's assumed name—Prakasaditya—but they assumed that these, too, were Gupta coins. Without the given name, however, they were left with a bunch of questions. Which Gupta king was this Prakasaditya? When did they rule?
Other specimens of the coin have been found since, but not one had that particular king's name in its entirety.
Six years ago, when Tandon took on the challenge of finding the king's identity, colleagues gave them the best images they had. They pieced the puzzle together—a missing letter here, another clue there—but it wasn't quite enough.
Then, Tandon spent the 2011-12 academic year in India on a Fulbright-Nehru fellowship, teaching microeconomics at St Stephen's College, their alma mater. One weekend, on a hasty, behind-the-scenes tour of a museum in Uttar Pradesh, they took pictures of their coin collection. Later, they realized they had some pictures of the mystery coin as well. One image had the missing letters.
The king was no Gupta; they were Toramana, the Hun ruler.
In light of this unexpected find, there are new questions for historians to grapple with. What were the coins of an arch-rival doing in the heart of the Gupta empire? How were the Huns responsible for the precipitous decline of the Guptas, in the second half of the fifth century?
The economist in the numismatist
Sometimes, coins spell out clear-cut answers that have resonances in today's world. Take the case of the hoard of coins finds in Balochistan, in present-day Pakistan, issued by the Paratarajas. These kings, who issued copper coins with legends in Kharosthi, and silver coins with legends in Brahmi, have won a mention in the Mahabharata.
Tandon soon drew up a list of the Parataraja kings who, in all likelihood, ruled from around 125 to 300 AD. The discovery of the hoard had put the all-but forgotten kingdom of Paradan back on the map, but their work turned it into a living breathing place.
Curious about the source of the kingdom's wealth, Tandon scoured ancient texts and concluded that the Paratarajas owed their prosperity to international trade. One export was a fragrant plant that grew in abundance in the arid desert. It was prized by Romans for perfumery.
Around 225 AD, civil wars raged in Rome. As if on cue, the coinage of the Paratarajas went from silver to copper, signifying declining fortunes.
The Roman economy was the biggest in the world, just like the US's is today. A recession in Rome must have led to recession in India, Tandon hypothesizes. “Globalization may not be the modern phenomenon we think it is," they point out.
The crossover has happened—Tandon has transitioned from collector of coins to a researcher. And as they had predicted, the price of ancient Indian coins is going up in the market. Indian dealers, who once came to sell coins at top New York auctions, now buy coins instead, as they fetch a handsome price back home.
These days, when Tandon can't get a coin they have set their sights on, they tell themselves that all they need for their research is a high-resolution image. Truth is, though, they don't seem entirely convinced by their own argument.
Much after they outlived their original use, coins—sturdy pieces of metal that they are—are like snapshots of history, waiting to be deciphered. When diligent scholars get access to coins, we could end up learning interesting things about our collective past.
The British Museum in London and the National Museum in New Delhi have the largest collections of coins from some of the greatest empires of India. Many coins from ancient India now belong to private collectors and are all but inaccessible to the world at large.
Someday, Tandon hopes, their coins will be displayed in a brick-and-mortar museum, ideally in India, their place of origin.

Everton have been one of the more active Premier League teams in the summer transfer window so far, and there's a possibility that their starting lineup at the start of next season could look considerably different to that which finished the last, especially in a few key areas.
Romelu Lukaku is already on their way out. Their former club Chelsea are still lurking, but the transfer rumour mill is strongly linking them with a move to Manchester United, which will see former Everton star and club youth product Wayne Rooney return to Goodison Park as part of the deal.
Lukaku has extended their holiday in Los Angeles rather than linking up with their current club for the start of pre-season training, and United happen to by flying out to California next week for the start of a three week tour.
Another of Everton's key players last season, Ross Barkley, could also be on their way out with Tottenham showing interest in the player. Barkley took a while to settle into their game last season, but when they did they were regularly one of the better players in Blue.
Despite the importance of the pair, it could well be the case that their departure allows the squad to become stronger across the board as money will be spent throughout the team at the expense of only two players.
This could be vital as Everton plan their challenge to turn what is currently a Premier League big six into a big seven, and also embark on a European adventure.
New Look
With Lukaku all but gone it looks like there will at least be a new name in the centre forward position come the first game of the season at home to Stoke City, but there could be a host of others too.
Another newcomer could be present at the opposite end of the pitch, and with Jordan Pickford arriving at the club for the considerable sum of £25million, rising to £30million with add-ons, he's unlikely to be spending too much time on the bench and should be thrown straight into the action as the club's No 1.
Straight away the spine of the side has changed at its two extremes, and in between these two players there's likely to be plenty of options for manager Ronald Koeman.
Phil Jagielka turns 35 at the start of this season, so 24-year-old centre back Michael Keane, another £30million signing this summer, could come into the centre of defence to partner Ashley Williams while the club captain sits in reserve with Ramiro Funes Mori.
Leighton Baines is likely to keep their place at left back but on the right of the defence, with Seamus Coleman still sidelined, Mason Holgate could be challenged by another impressive youngster, Jonjoe Kenny, who shone in England's U-20 World Cup triumph this summer.
Ahead of the back four Morgan Schneiderlin and Idrissa Gueye will be difficult to dislodge, but in some games Koeman could decide that they only needs one of these ball winners, albeit of different types, in theirs side.
Having different roles in the same positions could be important next season as Everton look to balance their squad both domestically and in the Europa League, but while they may not have the strongest eleven in mind at the moment, the opening day's lineup could be an indication as to who the favourites are.
It also depends on the formation. The Dutch manager dabbled with a back three at times last season, and they definitely have the personnel to implement such a system again this time around.
However, three central midfielders are usually required regardless of the system, and it would be difficult to leave Tom Davies out of the team following their impressive showing in the last campaign.
But as well as being a possible replacement for Barkley, Davy Klaassen's arrival could mean less game time for Davies. The Liverpool-born 19-year-old could still play some part, however, due to their ability to play in both central and more attacking midfield positions. They could even partner Klaassen in the absence of one of Gueye or Schneiderlin.
Pace & Creativity Out Wide
Rather than operate with two out-and-out wingers, Koeman will often sit a player like Barkley or Davies in one of the wide roles, where they can drift around the striker and into midfield when needed.
The new-look Everton squad could see the likes of Rooney or Klaassen playing in these positions, but the manager could be persuaded that Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Ademola Lookman deserve game time on the wing.
A front three of Lookman, Sandro, and Mirallas would give an opposition defence considerable problems due to their combination of pace and movement, with someone like recent target Olivier Giroud being the ideal player to mix things up if needed.
On top of all this they still have last summer's record signing Yannick Bolasie working hard to recover from the serious knee injury they picked up last season, and he'll be like a new signing when they return.
It's evident that Koeman already has plenty of options, and a more physical centre forward would complete a squad which will be able to operate using a whole host of different playing styles and systems.
The idea of the strongest eleven is becoming an outdated concept. As teams begin to adopt more intense styles of play, and the number of fixtures increases when European competition is added into the mix, a full squad of similar quality players is the way forward for a team such as Everton.
The club is beginning to assemble such as squad with the help of unprecedented backing from their owners, and the shrewd player identification of director of football Steve Walsh. The biggest test for Koeman will be which ones to pick.

easy to do
You'll probably get it working on the first try.
Use a 10ohm resistor to start with, easier to get it running on that. Not as efficient, but just get it to work.
1 X 10ohm resistor
1 X 1N914 diode
1 X MPS8099 transistor or RCA3055 or 2N3055 either of those will work fine
Get enough wire of #23 and #26 or closest you can find for those. Enamel coated magnet wire..enough to wind about 600 turns on the coil to the dimensions in those schematics. Make sure to wind it so that when you put + top the top of the coil and - at the bottom that the magnetic field on the coil is NORTH at the TOP. Wind both of those wires together at the SAME time around the spool.
The core for the coil can be a soild piece of iron or use a bunch of smaller pieces of welding rod cut to lenght and bundled together.
The transistor has a collector, emitter and base. The collector is the input, the emitter it the output. With these NPN transistors, there is no connection through the transistor from collector to emitter. The faucet is shut off basically. To make the connection, it requires a bit of current at the base...that is what the trigger wire is for. That turns it on and when the power is no longer at the base, the transistor shuts off. It is just an off and on switch triggered by the base.
When you buy the transistor, the package will give you a diagram or you can find it online which lead is what. BCE is the 3 you need to know. Just connect the coil wires, diode and resistor to each other like in the diagrams John drew.
The resistor doesn't matter which way you put it. The diode, the little black stripe needs to be towards the base of the transistor.
Make sure the wheel spins really, really easily. One little spin and it just keeps going. You can make it like mine where the wheel spins around the shaft or you can make it fixed to the shaft so the shaft spins in some bearings in the frame uprights.
You can use regular ceramic magnets on the rotor. Just make sure North is facing out on all 4 magnets so that south are all facing towards the axle.
The little black sealed gel cell batts are good ones to play with for starters. Use 12 volt ones.
When it is all hooked up, you give a slight little spin on the wheel and it will just start speeding up as fast as it can go.
When you get it running with these parts (use the 10ohm resistor), then you can switch out the resistor to something like a 680ohm to see if it will run on that. You basically want as much resistance as possible while still letting enough get through to trigger the transistor. That is the idea anyway.

Nude House, a computer software company in Buckinghamshire, UK is looking to recruit female web coders who are prepared to work in a "warm and private" naturist office environment. The company is also looking for naked sales people tempting customers to buy, as well as nudists to provide free technical support. An ad titled "Nude Web Coders Wanted" has been placed on Craigslist, offering part-time or full-time positions and customers "who never meet you and will not know you are nude."
"As far as I am aware this is not only the first UK office job for naturists in web-coding or web-selling, but is also the first worldwide facility for naturists to earn substantial sums of money from work that incidentally provides them with the capability to work entirely without clothes," Nude House founder Chris Taylor told The Register. Because it is the first establishment in the world it is difficult to advertise – many seem to confuse the issue of being without clothes as being a place without concerns for personal freedom, where sex is paramount in its many varied forms. Sex does not play a part in naturism – yes one is aware of differences in sex and size and shape and age of everyone, but the concern is on sales and technical ability, not availability."
Taylor, a naturist for 20 years, insisted that the only reason they had advertised for female staff was because they wanted the office to be less male-dominated, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. So far, seven women have applied for the jobs, which pay £24,000 ($37,600).
The company website is pretty explicit (no pun intended) about its requirements: "New applicants will be required to work in the nude from the time they arrive at work until they leave to go home. Nude means no clothes whatsoever and no shoes either. All new applicants will be naturists and could be males or females."
Nude House's principal software is called "Move your Mouse', which essentially allows administrators to add popups to photos on their website. When a user moves their or their mouse over a so-called "hot-spot," the system shows a name, a long text comment, and an image. Clicking the mouse when the user sees the popup will open a new webpage.
Illustration: John Shakespeare Interviewers have pressed the two rivals at every opportunity since, demanding to know when they will meet, stoking anticipation of an eventual showdown. Both have resisted the idea. When interviewer Neil Mitchell goaded Turnbull on Thursday, the Prime Minister replied: "I look forward to having a chat with them when I catch up with them next." So what an anti-climax to learn that the pair have already spoken this week. By the time Turnbull brushed aside Mitchell's question, they'd already had a conversation. No, it wasn't the grand reconciliation. But it wasn't an angry exchange, either. It was a brief, businesslike chat to discuss their positions ahead of the weekend Party Futures Conference. As it happens, Turnbull and Abbott agreed on the key principle at stake.
Though their factions are in conflict over it, the current and former leaders converged on it – specifically, that all ordinary members of the Liberal Party should be allowed to have a vote in choosing their candidates for Parliament. A plebiscite, in other words. Turnbull phoned to let Abbott know in advance that he'd be publicly supporting the principle, even though it was the one championed by Abbott's faction. Curiously, neither man has wanted to advertise their conversation. It wasn't a drastic change of position for Turnbull. They have supported the idea of plebiscites for years. "Our pre-selections for our members are, in every state except NSW, plebiscites, so our members all get a direct say and I'd certainly like to see plebiscites in NSW as well," Turnbull said on Q&A in 2013. And it's not a radical concept. The remarkable fact is that the NSW Liberal party has remained so antidemocratic for so long. The Left faction's lock on power in NSW has almost entirely shut out ordinary members. When the former major general Jim Molan tried to run as a Liberal Senate candidate in NSW at the last election, they were stunned to find that a business lobbyist, Michael Photios, ran the state as a personal fiefdom.
The man who had commanded some half-million soldiers as chief of coalition operations in Iraq threw themselves into the campaign for reform: "As someone who has accompanied five countries down the road to democracy, and seen people die for the right to vote, and taken life to protect the right to vote," says Molan in rallying Liberal branches, "I find it astonishing that our party doesn't give our members the same right." In Britain, ordinary members get to vote on party representatives all the way up to national leader. In NSW, John Howard formally proposed plebiscites in 2014. Mike Baird supported the idea too. In the era when the No.1 accusation against the political class is that it's disconnected from ordinary people, the plebiscite is an irresistible idea. The principle is so powerful that the anti-reform camp has taken to scaremongering. They claim that the democratic reformers are a Trojan horse for Abbott-loving, far-right weirdos who will branch-stack the party into oblivion. They call them "the Taliban", as my colleague Sean Nicholls reported. A reformer laughs at this picture: "As if we have a shortage of weirdos and strange things going on now." The NSW division is dying, they say, with record low membership and a financial crisis that obliged the Prime Minister to donate $1.75 million of their own funds. The party was being used to serve the business interests of some powerful people, they said, even as it was collapsing. Calling the reformers the "Taliban", they said, was an embarrassing own-goal – Jim Molan's career was spent fighting fundamentalist terrorist movements. John Ruddick is a business person who is well-known as an advocate for democratisation of the NSW Liberals, so well-known that they were ultimately forced out of the party for their trouble.
Ruddick says that if the two key reform motions due for a vote on Sunday, known as the Warringah motions, succeed, "the NSW Liberal Party will catapult from the least democratic state division of any party in Australia to the national leader in democratic excellence". And if they don't succeed? Says Ruddick: "Cory Bernardi is like the phantom menace circling the party" referring to the former Liberal senator who defected to start their rival Australian Conservatives Party. "He has been reaching out to NSW conservatives in recent months and has been warmly received. My guess is around half of the party membership is in danger of defecting to Bernardi and will gladly do so if democratic reforms are not introduced. This convention is the last roll of the dice to prevent a historic split in the party." Turnbull would not be unhappy to see the reform motions die, because it would preserve their group's control of the NSW party, but they cannot say so openly. They will address the meeting on Saturday and endorse the plebiscite principle, but they won't be there to cast a vote when it comes up on Sunday. The reformers think they have the numbers, with perhaps 60 per cent of the 1400 members who've registered to come along, but acknowledge that it could be a close run thing.
So rather than bring Abbott and Turnbull into an epic showdown, this weekend's conference has actually brought them together. But for those who crave conflict, fear not. There will be no reconciliation of their greater ambitions. The rivalry that roils the Australian government will continue. Turnbull merely wants to hold their job; Abbott wants them destroyed. But what of Nick Greiner's warning that the government will lose office? He's correct, no doubt, but Abbott thinks it's irrelevant – they are sure that they are going to lose anyway. The logic is this. The Coalition is permanently behind in the polls because its primary vote is too low, in the mid 30 per cent range. It will remain there so long as Pauline Hanson's One Nation is polling the 7 to 11 per cent that it has enjoyed since the last election. They have taken disenchanted Liberal voters away and they are not coming back. But wouldn't most come back ultimately, through the preferential voting system? It's possible but it's highly unpredictable. It's impossible to predict the sort of preference-swapping deals that Hanson might make with other parties. This is the structural vote trap Turnbull finds themselves in. So how can the Coalition raise its primary share of the vote to winning levels? One option is the one represented by Abbott. They and their acolytes argue that, if they are restored as leader, they will appeal to Hanson's voters with an authentically right-wing appeal, with policies such as their proposals to cut the immigration intake and have the federal government build coal-fired power plants. The other option is the one represented by Turnbull. By moving to the "sensible centre" on policies such as schools funding and health care as they did at the May budget, they will win votes at the centre of the spectrum, votes that otherwise would go to Labor. The problem with this scenario is that, so far, there's no sign that it's actually working. The polls have remained unmoved.
Bill Shorten is taking no chances, however. On Friday the Labor leader signalled that, while Turnbull might have moved to the left to try to seize the "sensible centre", Labor will move yet further left. Taking a cue from Jeremy Corbyn's revival of British Labour, Shorten promised to make the tackling of inequality the "defining mission" of a future Labor government. They promised to return to the "too-hard basket in tax reform", for instance. The centre, in other words, is moving leftwards. This will further stretch Turnbull on the left even as they try to defend on the right. In the past week we've seen Turnbull make no fewer than three big announcements on national security. One was complete with a theatrical backdrop of armed commandos in balaclavas. If the budget zig to the centre failed to yield any extra votes, this is a concerted zag to the right to see if that works any better. With an election still more than a year away, why should Turnbull be so desperately chasing votes week to week? Because they themselves announced the polls as their judge and jury. Remember that they said 30 losing Newspolls in a row constituted a death sentence; they have lost 15 already. And Abbott is limbering up to be their executioner. Loading

ISIS v. Saudi Arabia, Implementation of Sharia Law
One is an enemy of America, a group of evil Sunni terrorists who ruthlessly employ their own twisted vision of Islamic Sharia Law to behead people, punish homosexuality and criminalize adultery.
And the other's one of America's staunchest Sunni allies in the Middle East, on the road to democracy, albeit one that employs its own twisted vision of Islamic Sharia Law to behead people, punish homosexuality and criminalize adultery.
Having trouble telling the difference between ISIS and Saudi Arabia? It can happen to anyone! Let Middle East Eye help you out with this handy chart:
It was all kind of trick question. See dummy, ISIS are terrorists. The Saudis just fund terrorists (including, perhaps until only recently, ISIS!) Duh.

With just two days until the 2017 NFL season kicks off, Colin Kaepernick remains a free agent.
Different gestures, displays of solidarity and signals of protest have arisen during the national anthem by other players during preseason games in 2017, but the former 49ers quarterback, who started the trend last year as a way to protest social justice issues and racial inequality in America, has not generated much interest from teams in need of quarteback help.
Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton came out in Kaepernick's defense Tuesday when asked about the issue at the end of their news conference.
"I really think it's not fair. I think it's unfair. But not to take any storm or glory away from their game, we're trying to find every way to beat the 49ers come Sunday. But in my opinion, do I think Kaepernick is better than some of these starting quarterbacks in this league? Absolutely," Newton said. "Should they be on a roster? In my opinion, absolutely. There's no question about it. Are they good enough to be on a roster? Are they good enough to be a starting quarterback? Absolutely. But our main focus right now is to try to beat the 49ers on Sunday."
Broncos linebacker Von Miller in an interview that will air during NFL Network's Total Access on Tuesday, said he'd welcome Kaepernick to Denver's roster. In need of a veteran backup with Paxton Lynch battling a shoulder injury, the Broncos signed Brock Osweiler on Monday.
"One hundred percent," Miller said. "If John Elway and Joe Ellis and the great leadership we have here at the Denver Broncos brought Colin Kaepernick here to our team I'd welcome them with open arms. It would be great to have Colin here. We have a lot of different types of personalities from Aqib Talib to T.J. Ward (now on the Bucs) to Derek Wolfe to Paxton [Lynch] ... I feel like he'd be a perfect match in our locker room and not only in our locker room but around the league.
"I think they can fit in any locker room around the league. He's definitely better than a couple of these quarterbacks in the National Football League. There's not 64 quarterbacks that are better than them -- and in the National Football League that's what it's about -- what can you do for me, how can you perform for me on the football field. So, I don't see why he's not on a team."
Kaepernick, who completed 59.2 percent of their passes for 2,241 yards, 16 touchdowns and four interceptions last year, has some high-profile names in their corner. Newton, the league's 2015 MVP and Miller, the Super Bowl 50 MVP, are certainly among the most notable. As the NFL's opening weekend approaches, their comments show that the conversation Kaepernick started won't be going away any time soon.
One hundred years ago, if you had a phone at all, you still had to call the operator first. Dial phones were introduced in some areas as early as 1916, but it wasn't until 1951 that you could call outside of your city or town without calling the operator first.
Direct Distance Dialing, or long distance as most people called it, created a huge burden on the telephone systems. The old systems took a long time to dial 10 or 11 numbers (like 1-248-896-8587) and connection problems were starting to mount up.
Touch-tone service was first unveiled in 1963 and became available to New York and Los Angeles customers in 1964. The system was designed so that it wouldn't accidentally dial a number because of music being played or people singing. By the standards of the day it was very complex, although it was incredibly simple to our computerized, jaded eyes.
A normal touch-tone phone could make a total of seven tones. The way it worked was, the user pushed a button and it made a combination of two sounds. A microphone hooked to a computer listened for the sounds and was able to decode the number. Two tones together were used because it made it harder for the computer to mistake the sound of someone singing or some background noise.
By using a grid, seven tones could make twelve different sounds.
1209 Hz 1336 Hz 1477 Hz 697 Hz 1 2 3 770 Hz 4 5 6 852 Hz 7 8 9 941 Hz * #
However, originally there were no * or # buttons.
This is the first touch tone phone. Notice anything missing? No * or # buttons. They hadn't been invented yet. They were added in 1968, but no one knew what to do with them. In fact, they were added mostly “because we can.” Since seven tones would make twelve sounds, AT&T figured they may as well put the extra buttons in, just in case someone figured out a use for them. Good thinking, AT&T.
By the 1980s, people figured out what to do with the extra buttons. AT&T introduces a series of “star codes” that let the caller do things like call back the person who had just called (*69) as well as other services. The # button became useful for a generation of voice-mail systems that proclaimed, “To finish, press pound.”
And by the way… why is it called the pound key?
In much of the world, the # symbol is called a “hash,” which will make sense to anyone who uses Twitter. Twitter, of course, makes extensive use of the # symbol for “hashtags.” In most of the world, ask for a pound symbol and you'll see this: £ which is, of course, the symbol for the British pound.
While it's not completely clear how # came to be known as “pound,” the most likely explanation comes in computer keyboards from the 1950s and 1960s upon which # and £ shared the same position above the number 3; international users flipped a switch to start using £ instead of #.
When people started referring to # on the touch-tone keypad, it didn't make sense to call it the “number sign” as the keypad was made up of nothing but numbers! So, it's pretty likely that programmers, used to seeing the “real” pound sign next to it, started calling that symbol “pound” as well.

Fort Sam Houston said Monday that it had canceled its annual ceremony marking Memorial Day, saying heavy storms that broke earlier in the morning had left its grounds too saturated to hold the event safely.
The event was to start with a musical prelude at 9 a.m. in the cemetery's assembly area, and continue with the formal ceremony and a keynote speaker at 9:30.
Typically, Fort Sam enjoys sunny skies on Memorial Day, but the last several years have been the exception to the rule.
"This is the first year we've ended up getting rained out," said Bob Winkler, the cemetery's grounds maintenance supervisor. "But it's rained on our ceremonies for the last four years in a row.
"It's been miserable, and the potential for all the flooding, especially as the rain Friday night and early Saturday morning dropped seven to nine inches, and now all of our creeks are flooding again, we just didn't want to take that chance," they added.
Another event featuring Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and retired Army Col. Bruce Candall later in the day appeared to still be on. Both men are to appear for a send-off of 100 Texans who will be headed to U.S. military academies later this summer. That ceremony, which will feature Crandall as the keynote speaker, is to start at 1:30 p.m. at Freeman Expo Hall.
About 450 people are expected to attend, including more than 100 academy-bound students and their families, as well as local elected officials, community leaders, and representatives from local veterans' organizations. Fort Sam Houston's 323d Army Band also will be on hand.

Boyan Slat first proposed their giant marine cleanup machine three years ago when they were just 17 years old. During a TED talk , they sketched a vision for a massive floating boom that would collect trash using the ocean's own currents.
The talk has now been viewed almost 2 million times, and Slat is a minor celebrity in their native Holland. But most remarkably, he's actually followed through on the project. While some would be happy with all the attention, Slat, still only 20, is getting serious about delivery, doing the painstaking work of building a team, testing feasibility, and trialling the machine in the wild.
Co.Exist spoke with them last year when The Ocean Cleanup, Slat's company, had just released a feasibility study and was starting a crowdfunding campaign (it raised more than $2 million). Since then, it's completed scale-model tests and organized a marine trash expedition that will take place this summer. Slat says there's a need to understand the full extent of the trash in the Pacific before they put a final product in the water.
“Doing the feasibility last year, we discovered there is a lot of uncertainty about the problem itself. And if you want to solve a problem, it's important to know what the problem is,” they say. If, for example, there's more trash in the water than commonly thought, that could affect the project's economics, which is based on selling some of the waste for recycling or energy generation.
There are various estimates for the amount of trash in the oceans (as we've written before). But little that's conclusive: Slat complains that much of the data is out-of-date or non-specific. The expedition will employ up to 50 boats to gather samples as they travel from Hawaii to the California coast. Most of the vessels will be on the return leg of the Transpacific Yacht Race. “We'll be taking more measurements in three weeks than in the past 40 years combined,” Slat says. “It will be the largest ocean research project in history.”
Ocean Cleanup is also preparing a larger ocean trial. In 2016, it will test a 2,000 meter booms near the island of Tsushima, between Japan and South Korea. Up to 30,000 cubic meters of trash a year washes up on Tsushima's coastline, and the island hopes to reduce the cost of clean-up, which is now about $5 million a year. “They're hoping it will save them some cost and effort. For us, that's a secondary goal though. We want to test the durability of the barriers over time,” Slat says.
On a cold winter morning in January 1948 a Jewish woman, Ans van Dijk, was executed in Fort Bijlmer near Amsterdam after being sentenced to death for collaboration with the German occupiers during World War II. The pivotal questions are why a Jewish woman was executed after the liberation and how they became involved in collaboration with the Germans during the war. Consulting the literature and sources on this topic reveal some astonishing facts which shed a different light on the fate of Dutch Jews in Holland in World War II.
Ans van Dijk
Anna (called “Ans”) van Dijk was born in 1905 to a Jewish family in Amsterdam. In 1927 they married to Bram Querido, and in 1940 their life took a dramatic turn when their father died in a mental hospital and they divorced their husband. Meanwhile the Germans had occupied Holland and they embarked on a lesbian relationship with the Miep Stodel. Stodel left them to flee to Switzerland and Van Dijk decided to go into hiding to evade deportation to Poland.
In 1943 Ans van Dijk was arrested by the German Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service—SD) and after they promised to work for the SD they were released. They posed as a member of the resistance who could provide hiding places and fake identity passes, but in reality they would report Jews in hiding to the SD. Van Dijk would not only evade deportation by their co-operation but was endowed with bounty money for everyone they turned in. They were the perfect agent because their Jewish appearance made them look trustworthy in the eyes of the resistance.
In the beginning they worked alone but after a while they surrounded themselves with Jewish women who helped them Meanwhile they picked up their life and started a lesbian relationship with Mies de Regt of Rotterdam, who knew about their work for the SD but kept silent. After the liberation the two women went into hiding in Rotterdam but were tracked down and arrested. Van Dijk was charged with the betrayal of around 700 persons.
How should we consider this number of 700 persons in the bigger picture of Jewish persecution? The most infamous ‘Jewhunter' C.J. Kaptein, a gentile police officer, credited themselves with rounding up 600 Jews when they stood trial after the war; like van Dijk, they were also sentenced to death. The case of Kaptein is widely published as a testimony that the Dutch police were complicit with the persecution of Jews during the war, while the case of Ans van Dijk almost descended into oblivion.
Anne Frank
It was not until 1994 that the case of Ans van Dijk was extensively described in a publication written by Koos Groen and titled “When Victims become Traitors.” Groen asks why Anne Frank is known worldwide as a victim but why the treason of Ans van Dijk has been erased from the collective memory. Besides the extent of their betrayal, the fact that they were the only woman who was executed after the war should be enough to attract attention.
The reason for the oblivion of Ans van Dijk should be sought in the fact that the historiography of Holland during World War II has largely been written by Jews. The Jewish journalist Loe de Jong was appointed as the director of the State Institute of War Documentation and wrote the official historical account of Holland during World War II. In this account of over 15,000 pages there is not one word about the treason of Ans van Dijk; nor is their treason mentioned in other publications that focus on the Jewish persecution and are considered standard works, like De ondergang (The Downfall) from the Jewish professor Jacques Presser.
In 2010 Sytze van der Zee published their book Vogelvrij (Outlawed) on the hunt for Jews in hiding, causing a considerable stir in the media. Based on their research on the files in the State Institute of War Documentation, Van der Zee found that there were more Jews involved in the rounding up of Jews in hiding than was known previously. This means that under the guidance of Mr. de Jong, who died in 2005, this knowledge was withheld from the public until their image of the war and the persecution of the Jews was firmly imprinted into the collective mind.
In their book and also on national television (25 January 2010) Van der Zee also tries to answer the unresolved question of who betrayed the most famous Jewess in hiding, Anne Frank.  They are fascinated by the case of Ans van Dijk and says that the more they investigate their case the more they are convinced that Ans van Dijk is the most probable candidate for the betrayal of Anne Frank. They have no evidence from the available sources, but the fact that Van Dijk's cover was the support of Jews in hiding and they were operating in the very neighbourhood (Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht) where the Frank family was hiding points in their view in that direction.
Conclusion
The power of the Jewish persecution narrative lies into the sharp distinction between Jewish victims and non-Jewish perpetrators, the last group preferably portrayed as male White Christian patriots. The weakness of the Jewish persecution narrative lies in the complex reality in which allegiances can shift and the roles of victims and perpetrators are reversed. Imagine what would be left of this narrative if historical records would show or even suggest that its icon, Anne Frank, was betrayed by a lesbian Jewess?
Minorities like the LGBT movement go at great lengths to mirror their suffering during the war with the fate of the Jews. In 2002 Germany apoligized to the gay community and the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Holocaust which included homosexuals. The monument to commemorate the persecuted homosexuals during the war is located behind the Anne Frank House, an ironic fact in the light of Van der Zee's theory.

Way back in 1995 a young, talented student at Fairfield High School played the guitar at the high school's “Spring Jam.” It was on May 12 in the gymnasium of what is now Fairfield Warde High School. The student, a senior, was the now-famous and still extremely talented John Mayer. Mayer grew up in Fairfield and attended the local public schools.  They are pictured here in a photo from the Fairfield Citizen with their band “Villanova Junction,” playing lead guitar and singing vocals.
Just last week Mayer was interviewed by Joe Coscarelli and featured in the New York Times. The interview was published on March 24 and included some references to Mayer's hometown. Here's what they said.
“I'm still always going to be a kid from Fairfield, Conn. They don't make rock stars in Fairfield. They don't. They make good people who get a job, get married, they watch TV together, they start a life together and make other good people.”
Mayer's thoughts about Fairfield will certainly make locals smile, and First Selectman Mike Tetreau even posted about it on Facebook.
Mayer, who is 39, said they are hoping they will settle down in light of the fact that their brother just had a daughter, and they compared their life as a celebrity to being on the International Space Station:
“It's just the life that I have, which is fabulous — it's just a bit more time on the International Space Station. Don't ever let me give you the sense that I don't love being on the International Space Station. It's a pretty cool reason why you haven't settled down — because you're an astronaut. I've never hated it. Sometimes I get upset at the way that it is, but the real question is: Will the appearance of this job prevent what I'm absolutely entitled to psychologically? That's the scary part.”
Mayer's new album, The Search for Everything: Wave Two, was recently released. Their tour is happening now, and they were at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. He'll be here in Connecticut at the Xfinity Theater in Hartford on August 20.

Conservative groups' mounting attacks against Planned Parenthood are beginning to expose rifts within the tea party movement that could grow more pronounced as Congress nears a potential government shutdown April 8.
Earlier this month, the Susan B. Anthony List, an antiabortion group, bought TV ads in support of some tea party members of congress who voted to cut all federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
But Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D) said the Senate would block all such efforts, and they got a measure of support from Sen. Scott Brown (R) of Massachusetts, whose 2009 victory marked the rising tide of tea party clout. Cutting all federal funding for family planning was "going too far," Senator Brown said, though they didn't mention Planned Parenthood by name.
On one hand, the bid to slash funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's top abortion provider, can be seen as an affirmation of the tea party's fiscally conservative, small-government credentials.
Yet Brown's comments suggest that the social issues behind Planned Parenthood are perhaps a stronger motive for some Republicans. Funding for Planned Parenthood, after all, is a negligible part of the deficit compared with military spending or entitlement programs, and federal funds cannot be used for the organization's abortion-related activities.
With the specter of a government shutdown looming, all eyes are on the 87 freshmen House Republicans most closely associated with the tea party movement. The position they take on defunding Planned Parenthood, in particular, could offer insight into a fundamental question: How do social issues such as abortion and gay marriage – which motivated the "religious right" and helped define the Republican Party in the past – fit into the tea party worldview?
"It's a watershed moment," says Angie Maxwell, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas who studies tea party demographics. They suggest that the topic will test whether the movement has the desire or ability to absorb social issues into into its identity without becoming consumed by them.
For some tea party members, defunding Planned Parenthood "is the perfect thing to push for, because it shows fiscal conservatism, and it's also not funding one of the social issues that you so adamantly want to control over," adds Professor Maxwell. "But it's also where it gets complicated for tea party members: If you want government off your back financially, you can't also want [it] on your backs controlling social issues. That's the contradiction that has to be balanced."
Social issues 'beside the point'?
The initial energy of the tea-party movement came wrapped in the imagery of libertarianism, the ubiquitous "Don't Tread on Me" flag suggesting that adherents basically wanted government out of their lives and wallet. Tackling social issues for political benefit is anathema to this tea party vision.
"Social issues may matter to particular individuals, but at the end of the day, the movement should be agnostic about it," tea party activist Ryan Hecker, the creator of the crowdsourced Contract From America platform, told The New York Times last year. "This is a movement that rose largely because of the Republican Party failing to deliver on being representative of the economic conservative ideology. To include social issues would be beside the point.”
A February survey by the Pew Research Center offers insight into Mr. Hecker's comments. While social conservatives generally support the tea party, the reverse is not always true. "Many people who support the tea party are unfamiliar with or uncertain about the religious right," write Scott Clement and John Green, authors of the Pew study, "The Tea Party, Religion and Social Issues."
"Forty-six percent of tea party supporters said they hadn't heard of or had no opinion on the religious right," they write.
An unscientific survey by the Hot Air website in November gives further clues about the priorities of core tea party supporters: 72 percent of respondents (all self-described tea partyers, conservatives, or libertarians) said they would support fiscal conservatism even if it led to a more socially liberal culture.
Similarly, a new Pew poll suggests Mitt Romney, a fiscally conservative but socially moderate Republican, polls better among tea party supporters than any other GOP presidential candidate, with 24 percent backing.
How tea partyers and social conservatives overlap
But since the election, the tea party message has been transformed both from the inside and outside, with more faith groups using tea party-type language, and some groups like Texas-based TeaParty.org and the Iowa Tea Party bucking tea party traditions by embracing social issues as part of their stated agendas.
Critics say Republican targeting of Planned Parenthood shows that the tea party is just a new incarnation of the traditional "values" driven Republican.
In truth, the resonance of issues like Planned Parenthood might simply show the demographic overlap that exists between social conservatives and the tea partyers, according to a survey by the Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society in Fayetteville, Ark.
Some 85 percent of members of tea party groups are self-identified Christians, 37 percent of whom are Biblical literalists, according to the survey. Moreover, 24 percent of members of tea party groups say that abortions should be available to all women as a choice, compared with 41 percent of non-tea partyers.
"The question is: What's really driving them? Is it budget stuff? Is it social issues? Is it anti-Obama, is it race?" says Maxwell. "This is a very, very consistent group of people. It's like you've taken a piece of the population out that's all so similar, so it's not surprising that they would have very consistent values on a lot of things."
They suggest that tea party could still succeed as a protest movement, even if it embraces a broader coalition of groups. But if tea party politics turns out to be nothing but the religious right in disguise, the tea party's base could fracture, damaging the party's brand at a critical time, they add.
In any case, it might be in the GOP's interests to pick a fight with Democrats, no matter what the underlying ideology. "The Republican party can move further to the right to accommodate what the tea party wants" and risk a shutdown, or it could move toward the center and join with Democrats to pass a compromise budget, adds budget analyst Stan Collender in a recent blog post. "Allowing or forcing a shutdown to occur may be just what the leadership needs to do to demonstrate its commitment to the tea party's preferred policies and style."

Listen to an interview with Alain Robert
Updated, 6:30 p.m. | Alain Robert, a French stuntman known for climbing tall buildings, scaled the north face of the New York Times building on Thursday, ascending 52 stories to the roof and clutching a bright green banner, before police officers arrested them around 12:22 p.m. (Update: Hours later, a second man was arrested after climbing to the roof on another part of the building. For a complete account of the day's events, see the article prepared for Friday print editions.)
Police and security officials cordoned off the sidewalk below, on West 41st Street, as a crowd assembled. The words on the banner were illegible from the sidewalk, but from office windows inside the tower the slogan on the banner could be clearly read: “Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week.”
The man later confirmed, moments after being arrested on the roof of the tower, that they were Alain Robert, a 46-year-old stuntman famous for scaling structures like the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Eiffel Tower and Montparnasse Tower in Paris.
They wore a T-shirt with their name and the address of a Web site (thesolutionissimple.org), exercise pants and climbing shoes. They had long blond hair. They used no rope, harness or parachute.
Police officers blocked off the sidewalk at the base of the building and asked members of the crowd to move along. Construction workers on a building directly across West 41st Street, facing the northern face of the building, looked on with expressions of astonishment and amusement. A crowd gathered on the sidewalk, pointing, gawking and capturing pictures and images with cellphones, digital cameras and video cameras.
“This is a publicity stunt, it looks like,” Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, said as they entered the building. “There is definitely going to be an arrest.”
Wearing a backpack slung over one shoulder, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., the chairperson of The Times Company and publisher of The Times, who is themselves an avid climber, ducked under the police tape and examined the spectacle. They declined to comment.
Deputies arrived in a marked four-wheel-drive patrol vechicle to respond to a report of nudity on a public St. Augustine beach Thursday morning. Once there, they saw a naked man walking along the water's edge in view of several beachgoers, according to an arrest affidavit from the St. John Sheriff's Office.
When deputies approached the man, William Cody McLaughlin, they detected a "strong odor of alcoholic beverage." McLaughlin told deputies they just wanted to be given a warning and dropped off and asked them to "give them a break," according to the affidavit.
Once inside the patrol vehicle, deputies said, McLaughlin "laughed and made statements that made no sense."
The lawmen must not have been feeling very generous -- they busted the 24-year-old nude dude and charged them with Disorderly Conduct.
That's when witnesses told deputies there was another nude dude who left the beach via a ramp. A deputy went to the ramp where they found two sets of shorts, cellphone, keys and the ID of Stephen McNeill, the report stated.
A construction worker near the ramp pointed out the home on the beach where the deputy could find the other nude dude. When the deputy went over to the home they made contact with the man's roommate who verified that McNeill did live there. The nude dude was inside their bedroom and refused to open the door, deputies said.
The deputy told the roommate that McNeil's phone and shorts were at the beach and then handed over McNeill's ID and keys before leaving, according to the arrest report.
The deputy took no further action.
Guess the lawman was feeling a little more generous towards nude dude No. 2.More FloriDUH
So, your kid is into TomSka.
Who is that? Let me explain.
Thomas James “TomSka” Ridgewell is a 27-year-old London-based comedian, actor, screenwriter, producer and director. Ridgewell started making short films with their parents' camera early on in life and is one of Youtube's longest content creators.
Ridgewell previously worked on the British webtoon Eddsworld, which was created and animated by Ridgewell's friend Edd Gould. Ridgewell in this format is represented as a blue-hoodied mean-spirited alcoholic. Following Gould's death in 2012 to leukemia, Ridgewell continued the show until 2016, when they handed the show back over to Gould's family.
Ridgewell's content revolves around dark and violent comedy, done in live action or animated form. For example, Pizza Time and its spiritual successor, Time Trouble, both deal with time travel-based comedy.
Future Tom: STOP! I'm you from the future! Present Tom: The Future? Oh man, I got fat! Future Tom: Like an hour into the future. Present Tom: Oh. (glances at their stomach) Oh… (sadly) –Pizza Time (2015)
Ridgewell's most popular video is also one of their earliest successes. asdfmovie (ASS-duff-MOO-vee) was created in 2008, and it sparked dozens of running gags and memes across its ten installments, including “I like Trains”, which got its own song, and “Everybody Does the Flop“, which also got its own song.
Almost every sketch from each of the 10 ‘asdfmovies' is highly quotable and their popularity stretches far across the internet, even to people who don't know who Ridgewell themselves is.
Ridgewell's live-action sketches have a ranging budget and scope from the low-budget but high-creativity The Hole to the high-budget and also high-creativity Baby With A Gun 2, wrapping back to the low-budget and well-written ‘The Confession‘, which has two sequels.
Ridgewell's second channel, DarkSquidge, differs in content. DarkSquidge videos range from the weekly Vlog (Video log, or video diary) “Last Week”, which details the week to week of Ridgewell's life, to videos talking about anger management, depression, weight loss, and their own personal struggle with all three. The DarkSquidge channel also does “Thanksdays“, where Ridgewell gives thanks to the people who helped them get where they are now.
Ridgewell's current company is known as TurboPunch Ltd., with the three most prominent employees being Tom Ridgewell, Eddie Bowley, and Elliot Gough. Music for most of Ridgewell's videos is created by Todd “LilDeuceDeuce” Bryanton.
So that's TomSka: A British youtube producer/director/actor who creates comedy sketches, full to the brim with grim humor and energy.
Now you can watch their videos with your kid, and be a rock star!

This year, 2008, marks the 150th anniversary of the use of the word “libertarian” by anarchists.
As is well known, anarchists use the terms “libertarian”, “libertarian socialist” and “libertarian communist” as equivalent to “anarchist” and, similarly, “libertarian socialism” or “libertarian communism” as an alternative for “anarchism.” This is perfectly understandable, as the anarchist goal is freedom, liberty, and the ending of all hierarchical and authoritarian institutions and social relations.
Unfortunately, in the United States the term “libertarian” has become, since the 1970s, associated with the right-wing, i.e., supporters of “free-market” capitalism. That defenders of the hierarchy associated with private property seek to associate the term “libertarian” for their authoritarian system is both unfortunate and somewhat unbelievable to any genuine libertarian. Equally unfortunately, thanks to the power of money and the relative small size of the anarchist movement in America, this appropriation of the term has become, to a large extent, the default meaning there. Somewhat ironically, this results in some right-wing “libertarians” complaining that we genuine libertarians have “stolen” their name in order to associate our socialist ideas with it!
The facts are somewhat different. As Murray Bookchin noted, “libertarian” was “a term created by nineteenth-century European anarchists, not by contemporary American right-wing proprietarians.” [The Ecology of Freedom, p. 57] While we discuss this issue in An Anarchist FAQ in a few places (most obviously, section A.1.3) it is useful on the 150^th anniversary to discuss the history of anarchist use of the word “libertarian” to describe our ideas.
The first anarchist journal to use the term “libertarian” was La Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social. Somewhat ironically, given recent developments in America, it was published in New York between 1858 and 1861 by French communist-anarchist Joseph Déjacque. The next recorded use of the term was in Europe, when “libertarian communism” was used at a French regional anarchist Congress at Le Havre (16–22 November, 1880). January the following year saw a French manifesto issued on “Libertarian or Anarchist Communism.” Finally, 1895 saw leading anarchists Sébastien Faure and Louise Michel publish La Libertaire in France. [Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism, pp. 75–6, p. 145 and p. 162]
It should be noted that Nettlau's history was first written in 1932 and revised in 1934. George Woodcock, in their history of anarchism, reported the same facts as regards Déjacque and Faure [Anarchism: A History of libertarian ideas and movements, p. 233] Significantly, Woodcock's account was written in 1962 and makes no mention of right-wing use of the term “libertarian.” More recently, Robert Graham states that Déjacque's act made “him the first person to use the word ‘libertarian' as synonymous with ‘anarchist'” while Faure and Michel were “popularising the use of the word ‘libertarian' as a synonym for ‘anarchist.'” [Robert Graham (Ed.), Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, p. 60 and p. 231]
Which means, incidentally, that Louise Michel is linked with anarchists both using the term “libertarian” to describe our ideas and with the black flag becoming our symbol. Faure subsequently wrote an article entitled “Libertarian Communism” in 1903.
In terms of America, we find Benjamin Tucker (a leading individualist anarchist) discussing “libertarian solutions” to land use in February, 1897. As we discuss in section G.3, the Individualist Anarchists attacked capitalist (i.e., right-“libertarian”) property rights in land as the “land monopoly” and looked forward to a time when “the libertarian principle to the tenure of land” was actually applied. [Liberty, no. 350, p. 5] The 1920s saw communist-anarchist Bartolomeo Vanzetti argue that:
“After all we are socialists as the social-democrats, the socialists, the communists, and the I.W.W. are all Socialists. The difference — the fundamental one — between us and all the other is that they are authoritarian while we are libertarian; they believe in a State or Government of their own; we believe in no State or Government.” [Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti, p. 274]
Interestingly, Rudolf Rocker's 1949 book, published in Los Angeles, states that individualist anarchist Stephan P. Andrews was “one of the most versatile and significant exponents of libertarian socialism.” [Pioneers of American Freedom, p. 85] It should also be noted that 1909 saw the translation into English of Kropotkin's history of the French Revolution in which they argued that “the principles of anarchism ... had their origin ... in the deeds of the Great French Revolution” and “the libertarians would no doubt so the same today.” [The Great French Revolution, vol. 1, p. 204 and p. 206]
The most famous use of “libertarian communism” must be by the world's largest anarchist movement, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT in Spain. After proclaiming its aim to be “libertarian communism” in 1919, the CNT held its national congress of May 1936 in Zaragoza, with 649 delegates representing 982 unions with a membership of over 550,000. One of the resolutions passed was “The Confederal Conception of Libertarian Communism” [Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 1, pp. 103–10] This was resolution on libertarian communism was largely the work of Isaac Puente, author of the widely reprinted and translated pamphlet of the same name published four years previously. That year, 1932, also saw the founding of the Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias (Iberian Federation of Anarchist Youth) in Madrid by anarchists.
The term “libertarian” has been used by more people than just anarchists, but always to describe socialist ideas close to anarchism. For example, in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s Maurice Brinton and the group they were a member of (Solidarity) described their politics as “libertarian” and their decentralised, self-managed form of socialism is hard to distinguish from anarchism. So while “libertarian” did become broader than anarchism, it was still used by people on the left who aimed for socialism.
Unsurprisingly, given this well known and well documented use of the word “libertarian” by anarchists (and those close to them on the left) to describe their ideas, the use of the term by supporters of capitalism is deplorable. And it should be resisted. Writing in the 1980s, Murray Bookchin noted that in the United States the “term ‘libertarian' itself, to be sure, raises a problem, notably, the specious identification of an anti-authoritarian ideology with a straggling movement for ‘pure capitalism' and ‘free trade.' This movement never created the word: it appropriated it from the anarchist movement of the [nineteenth] century. And it should be recovered by those anti-authoritarians ... who try to speak for dominated people as a whole, not for personal egotists who identify freedom with entrepreneurship and profit.” Thus anarchists in America should “restore in practice a tradition that has been denatured by” the free-market right. [The Modern Crisis, pp. 154–5]
As we note in section F.2, anarchists tend to use an alternative name for the right-wing “libertarian”, namely “Propertarian.” Interestingly, Ursula Le Guin used the term in their 1974 classic of anarchist Science-Fiction, The Dispossessed. One of the anarchist characters notes that inhabitants of Anarres (the communist-anarchist moon) “want nothing to do with the propertarians” of Urras. Urras is, however, a standard capitalist world (with A-Io representing the United States and Thu representing the Soviet Union) and not explicitly right-“libertarian” in nature. The anarchist protagonist, Shevek, does discover some people who describe themselves as “libertarian” but these declare themselves close to communist-anarchism (asked whether they are anarchists they reply: “Partly. Syndicalists, libertarians ... anti-centralists”). Shevek, needless to say, is unimpressed with claims they should visit Thu to see “socialism”, replying that they were well aware how “real socialism functions.” [The Dispossessed, p. 70, p. 245 and p. 118]
It should be noted that “archist” and “propertarian” is used pretty much interchangeably in The Dispossessed to describe Urras, showing clear understand of, and links to, Proudhon's argument in the first self-labelled anarchist book that property was both “theft” and “despotism.” As we noted in section F.1, Proudhon argued that “violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase, and freedom by despotism” and has “perfect identity with robbery.” [What is Property, p. 251] Little wonder French syndicalist Emile Pouget, echoing Proudhon, argued that:
“Property and authority are merely differing manifestations and expressions of one and the same ‘principle' which boils down to the enforcement and enshrinement of the servitude of man. Consequently, the only difference between them is one of vantage point: viewed from one angle, slavery appears as a property crime, whereas, viewed from a different angle, it constitutes an authority crime.” [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 2, p. 66]
So, in summary, considered in terms of our political, social and economics ideas it is unsurprising that anarchists have been using the term “libertarian” for 150 years. Regardless of the attempts by others ignorant of both the history of that term and the reality of capitalism to appropriate it for their hierarchical and authoritarian ideology, we will continue to do so.
The ASEAN chairperson is usually invited to the prestigious international forum
Published 7:15 PM, July 10, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – Despite being chairperson of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was not invited to the prestigious G20 Summit held in Hamburg, Germany last week.
A Palace official confirmed to Rappler that no formal invitation for Duterte was received by Malacañang from the German government, host of this year's G20 Summit which was held from July 7 to 8.
A German government spokesperson also confirmed this to Rappler.
"The Philippines did not belong to the invited guest countries," said the Press and Information Office of the Federal Government of Germany.
The decision not to invite Duterte is odd given that they are ASEAN chairperson this year and tradition holds that the ASEAN chairperson is invited to the G20 Summit.
In 2016, Laos President Bounnhang Vorachith was invited because they held the position that year. In 2015, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was also invited for the same reason.
The G20 Summit is one of the biggest international forums focused on financial and economic issues. It is participated in by leaders of the world's major powers, including the United States, China, Russia, European Union, India, South Korea, and Japan.
"The G20 countries account for more than four-fifths of gross world product and three-quarters of global trade, and are home to almost two-thirds of the world's population," reads a description on the G20 Germany 2017 website.
Missed opportunity?
Aside from the global economy, the summit also tackled terrorism, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and fighting corruption, key issues under the Duterte administration and for Southeast Asia.
The ASEAN chairperson is usually invited to the summit because of the growing significance of Southeast Asia.
The region, home to around 700 million people, boasts a total population third only to China and India.
The combined GDP of all 10 ASEAN countries in 2013 would have made the region the 7th largest economy in the world if it were a single country. By 2050, Southeast Asia is projected to grow further and become the 4th largest economy.
The Philippine government, in response to criticism of Duterte's expensive foreign trips, has given assurances that these trips have fostered good relations between the Philippines and the international community.
But while Duterte has improved ties with China, other ASEAN countries, and Russia, they have not been as attentive to improving relations with the US and the EU. (READ: Duterte foreign policy: Independent but isolated)
They famously flashed the middle finger at EU lawmakers who oppose their planned revival of the death penalty and the arrest of their critic Senator Leila de Lima.
Duterte only grudgingly thanked America for its assistance in the Marawi crisis, though they have rapport with US President Donald Trump, compared to frosty relations with Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.
The fiery Philippine leader will themselves host an international summit in November as ASEAN chairperson.
Major world leaders like Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to attend the event. – Rappler.com
Last season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers were 3-6 and looking like they were on life support against an undefeated MSU program destined for the college football playoff.
That is until the Huskers beat the Spartans in Lincoln, sparking a run to a bowl game, and now, in 2016, a perfect record.
MSU head coach Mark Dantonio recalls this as a spark that their team can learn from, as well as a time before they were even in East Lansing.
"When I was at the University of Cincinnati, in 2005, we lost to Penn State, I was talking to (Pat) Narduzzi, and I said, 'we have seven true first-year students playing right now on defense, out of eleven players, we're going to be just fine. Inevitably those seven players played in the Orange Bowl," Dantonio recalled.
Hear from Dantonio as they discuss the state of their 2-4 football team with sports reporter Justin Rose.
Common graphical tricks and the Medieval Warm Period
Posted on 29 April 2010 by MarkR
The Hockey Stick is a climate celebrity and skeptics have their own graphs that ‘show' it is wrong. One of the most common is from the 1990 IPCC report, showing the Medieval Warm Period or MWP.
Figure 1 – IPCC First Assessment Report estimate of temperature changes in Europe from 900AD onwards.
This is how it appeared in Durkin's The Great Global Warming Swindle:
Figure 2 – Shot of the same IPCC graph slightly modified to be shown in The Great Global Warming Swindle
The conclusions of most recent studies are that the MWP was on average cooler than today, but The Great Global Warming Swindle, blogs and industry think tanks say otherwise, often based on graphs like this. It appears to be modified from Lamb 1965:
The data is for central England and from 1680 it uses the 50 year average of the HadCET thermometer record. Thankfully, the HadCET record has carried on since that graph finishes (around 1920), so we can find where ‘NOW' really is. In Figure 4 we have HadCET with 10 year averages (dotted line) and 50 year averages (solid line). We continue the 50yr line and find that it's now about 0.35C warmer than Lamb's last point. However, global warming only really kicked off around 1980, so we've still got 20 years of no global warming in the 50yr average and it seems pretty fair to take a look at something that would catch suspected global warming – like the 10 year average. This has risen by just over 1 °C since Lamb's last measurement.
Figure 4 – HadCET data since 1680 reported as a 10 year running mean (dotted line) and as a 50 year running mean (solid line)
So when you see that graph with ‘NOW' marked on the right hand side, they are telling you that the temperature now is the 50 year average centred on the 1920s. As someone living in the 2000s, you probably think that's a bit silly. The temperatures of the 2000s would be the upper ‘NOW?' on figure. The lower ‘NOW?' is the latest 50yr average.
Figure 5 – Where are we now? The lower box and line is the latest 50-year average in HadCET to be consistent with the rest of the graph. This, however, misses much of the period thought to be associated with global warming. The the latest 10-year average captures this and is just off the chart.
The Great Global Warming Swindle and every other skeptical source that shows you this graph and claims it shows that the MWP was warmer than today is not giving you the full picture. They are showing you evidence that central England was warmer around 1200AD than it was around 1920. They are showing you that the last decade was warmer than any 50-year period on the graph including the MWP.
Many similar graphs are loved by skeptical sites, but this is a useful demonstration because it contains all 3 of the common ‘tricks to hide the incline' of global warming. Firstly they change the temperature scale and/or hide the values. Next they pick a single region, and finally they either cut off or ignore instrumental evidence showing recent warming.
There appears to be plenty of evidence for some places being warmer than today in the MWP, and whilst most studies say that globally it wasn't warmer it seems that scientists still want more data to be sure (and if it was warmer, that might suggest higher climate sensitivity). The important thing is being able to properly interpret the evidence that arrives – which involves spotting the misleading half-truths by the likes of Martin Durkin.
A snow storm in Edmonton Friday resulted in chaos on city streets, triggering 142 collisions, say city police.
There were also nine hit-and-runs and six crashes that led to injuries.
Images and videos on social media showed vehicles in downtown Edmonton sliding out of control as they descended the hill at 103rd Street near 89th Avenue.

Long waits for tow services
Those looking for tow service from the Alberta Motor Association were waiting more than four hours. Members looking for a battery boost, a tire change or help to unlock a vehicle waited for three to four hours.
"We're pretty busy right now. It's pretty much non-stop," said Ryan Lemont, AMA manager of fleet operations.
They said the AMA anticipated the workload yesterday, trying to get workers ready for long hours and overtime.
"The roads were super slick, even with winter tires. It took me almost double the time it takes to get across the city."
Tow ban
A towing ban was in place on Highway 2 from Edmonton, south to Millet. The ban will be lifted when conditions improve, with safer conditions to tow vehicles along the highway.

Common Cents Accounting in Hamilton offers an extensive range of accounting services — including monthly bookkeeping and financial statements — for small businesses. If you're a business owner, here's what accurate bookkeeping can mean to the success of your business.
Bookkeeping is the process of recording all financial transactions and business dealings for your business. This includes itemized record keeping of sales, purchases, earnings, expenses and payments. The process accounts for all money that comes in and goes out of your business. Small business owners invest considerable time and energy in ensuring the success of their businesses — and accurate bookkeeping is essential to that success. Your business has to deliver the best possible return on investment. Proper bookkeeping — and financial statement preparation — is essential.
Accountants use the information from bookkeeping to create financial reports and statements. This data is necessary to determine the financial health of your business, but it is also required for other purposes. For many small business owners — much as with larger businesses — all aspects involved in running a business, such as sales, marketing, product and service development, inventory control and more, can inadvertently deter business owners from keeping a close watch on the financial status of their business. Bookkeeping, and the ability to prepare accurate financial statements, provides business owners with info that guides the decision-making process. Knowing the financial status of your business at all times is paramount to its success.
Consider this: if you ever want to apply for a bank loan or other form of financing, getting that financing will depend on the financial profile of your business. Furthermore, when it comes time to file a tax return, those financial records will be required. Although many small business owners do their own record keeping, the investment of time and the risk of making mistakes can lead to costly repercussions. The information needs to be accurate.
BART can't keep pace with rising 'crush loads'
A passenger (right) getting off at the Rockridge BART station has to navigate through a crush of commuters trying to board a San Francisco train in Oakland, Calif. on Tuesday, March 24, 2015. Ridership continues to rise on the regional transit system. less A passenger (right) getting off at the Rockridge BART station has to navigate through a crush of commuters trying to board a San Francisco train in Oakland, Calif. on Tuesday, March 24, 2015.

With a familiar beep-beep, a Fremont-bound BART train rumbles into MacArthur Station in Oakland and an equally familiar routine begins. Hundreds of passengers exit. Most walk, some jog, across the platform and form neat lines as a San Francisco train rolls in.
Each of the 10 cars on the arriving train is already packed full of morning commuters, but only a few riders get out. It seems impossible, but most of the queued-up crowd squeezes on board. On one car, the guy standing nearest the entrance sucks in their gut, lets out a deep breath and puts their hands behind their back as the doors close.
“You could feel the heat coming out of that train just standing here,” said Edwin Charlebois, a UCSF epidemiologist and veteran BART rider who chose to wait for the next train, hoping there would be a little more space.
The tightly packed BART cars during commutes these days are a result of the transit agency's success — and its failure.
Weekday ridership now averages about 420,000 — 100,000 more than five years ago. But BART hasn't kept pace with that growth and is hobbled by its inadequate infrastructure.
In addition to an aging fleet of railcars, BART's ability to run more trains is limited by an outmoded control system and an insufficient number of crossover tracks that could allow the transit system to send more trains to crowded stations.
Mornings at MacArthur are particularly miserable because it's a transfer point between two lines hauling heavy loads.
“MacArthur is the worst,” said Emily Massari, 37, of Oakland, a human resources manager at a San Francisco startup. They get on BART at Rockridge Station, where the trains also arrive crowded but there are fewer people waiting to squeeze on.
“It's where the most people get on and the least get off,” Massari said of MacArthur. “The combination just doesn't work there.”
Commute hour rush
BART's railcars seat an average of about 60 people. The transit agency figures each can comfortably accommodate about 47 more people standing, which gives each standee about 6.7 square feet of space. The Federal Transit Administration recommends that trains carry a maximum of 115 riders per car.
However, during BART's busiest commute hours — 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., but expanding — trains often haul 140 people or more. That gives 80 people standing about 3.9 square feet apiece — not quite a 2-by-2 square.
At most, a BART car can hold what transit planners call a “crush load” of 200 people.
As every rider knows, sometimes you just have to take a deep breath, pile onto a train packed with sweaty people, bikes and backpacks, and deal with the discomfort.
“Sometimes, at the end of the day, you're just so tired that you just want to get on the train, no matter how crowded it is, and get to your stop,” said Tania Martin, 48, an administrative assistant, as they waited for a train at Montgomery Station on their commute home.
Martin and other riders are going to have to deal with the crush for a few more years before new railcars start rolling. Each will have a little more room, and there will be more of them. The first 10 of the cars will arrive this fall for testing, but it will be 2017 before a significant number start hauling passengers.
New railcars ordered
The new cars will have about five fewer seats but more standing room — exactly how much, BART couldn't say — and three doors on each side instead of two. BART has ordered 775 cars — an increase over its existing 669-car fleet — and hopes eventually to grow that order to 1,081 cars. That would allow BART to run more 10-car trains and, possibly, more frequent trains.
BART spokesperson Alicia Trost said the first 10 cars will be tested for about a year, without passengers, mostly when BART is closed. They'll start hauling riders in September 2016. During 2017, 44 cars will be delivered and pressed into service after a month of testing. New cars will continue to arrive through 2021.
“When those new cars start coming in, there's going to be some sunshine here,” General Manager Grace Crunican told the BART Board of Directors in February. “In the meantime, we're going to have grease on our hands getting everything in place. It's going to be a tough slog for the next two to three years.”
BART officials are also considering plans to squeeze a little more capacity out of the existing fleet by:
•Rebuilding six badly damaged railcars and getting them back on the tracks.
•Hiring more mechanics, or having them work overtime, to speed the maintenance and repair of railcars, enabling more of them to remain in service.
•Rejiggering schedules by turning around more trains before the end of the line, which would allow increased service at some of the busiest stations.
•Pressing into regular service some “ready reserve” trains, now on standby for breakdowns or emergencies.
No quick fixes
The first three options would cost money, and BART directors need to decide which of them to include in their next budget. The fourth would make BART's service less reliable, since additional trains wouldn't be available in breakdowns. Directors will consider the options in the next couple of months as they prepare the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
Infrastructure improvements could also provide commuters some relief, though none is a quick fix. BART is focused on delivering what it calls “the big three” — the railcars plus a bigger and more modern maintenance yard in Hayward and a new train control system.
Other fixes being considered include constructing more crossovers — the tracks that allow trains to turn back before the end of the line.
One new crossover opened two weeks ago. The track improvement between the Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill stations allows BART to turn around trains more quickly toward San Francisco, giving riders in Walnut Creek, Lafayette and Orinda a better chance at getting a seat. It will enable BART to run more 10-car trains on the line, which is the system's busiest.
BART is also contemplating ways to increase the capacity of the crowded Embarcadero and Montgomery stations, including building additional platforms on the opposite sides of the trains.
But the biggest possible infrastructure changes — like a second Transbay Tube, express tracks or additional lines or stations in San Francisco or Oakland — would take decades and require a huge investment, including tax, toll or bond money that would have to be approved by voters.
Tips to cope
For now the crush remains, and BART offers a few tools to help riders cope. They include a symbol on BART's online trip planner that shows how much crowding is expected on each train, and a “crowded car survival guide” that suggests removing backpacks, placing belongings on the floor and moving to the center of the car.
Passengers have their own suggestions for surviving the crush. They range from politeness to patience to planning ahead.
“Just try to be courteous,” Charlebois said. “People have what I like to call kinesthetic backpack blindness. They forget that their bag takes up space, especially when they spin around and hit people with it.”
Patience key
Michael Piper, 28, a project manager for a San Francisco art studio, commutes from Rockridge Station. They take somewhat of a Zen approach to the crowding.
“I'm not in a rush,” they said. “I can wait for the next train.”
Massari takes a similar approach — with a little planning thrown in. “I don't have a job where I need to be there right at a certain time,” they said, “and I feel sorry for the people who do. So I let them get on.”
But they try to time their arrival at Rockridge when trains are scheduled closely together, since the second train typically has a little extra room.
Riding upstream for seat
Many passengers use a practice known as “back-riding,” especially in the evening commute out of downtown San Francisco.
Instead of boarding at a packed downtown station, they take a train in the other direction for a few stops and climb aboard before it gets crowded.
“There are even times when I take the Millbrae train all the way to Glen Park and then come back,” said Marie Fahy, a 45-year-old technology support worker who lives in the East Bay and works near Powell Station.
BART has become so crowded over the past two years “that I can't ever get a seat,” Julia Marquez said as they're waiting in a 12-deep line at Montgomery. “Unless I ride backwards.”

What's not working
Issue: Trains are packed to the limit during morning and evening commutes.
What's been done: BART has ordered a new and expanded fleet of railcars, but it will be 2017 before enough of them arrive to make a difference. The transit system also opened crossover tracks in central Contra Costa County, allowing it to increase service on BART's busiest line.

Liberty, the civil rights group, has complained to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal over what it described as "out-of-control” spying and asked to examine whether human rights and official safeguards have been breached.
Documents disclosed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden suggest UK eavesdropping agency GCHQ secretly accessed fibre-optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data.
The agency is said to be able to tap into and store data from the cables for up to 30 days for analysis under an operation code-named Tempora.
GCHQ is also said to have accessed information about UK citizens via the US National Security Agency's secret Prism monitoring programme.
The Cheltenham-based agency insists it is "scrupulous" in complying with the law.
And Foreign Secretary William Hague has dismissed claims that it used Prism to circumvent the law as "baseless".
But if the IPT, which hears complaints of inappropriate access by the spy agencies, decides there are grounds in Liberty's argument it could demand evidence from GCHQ.
Liberty said it believes its electronic communications – and those of its staff – "may have been unlawfully accessed by the likes of the Security Services and GCHQ".
Legal director James Welch said: "Those demanding the Snoopers' Charter seem to have been indulging in out-of-control snooping even without it – exploiting legal loopholes and help from Uncle Sam.
"No one suggests a completely unpoliced internet but those in power cannot swap targeted investigations for endless monitoring of the entire globe."
It also emerged that Germany's justice minister has written to the UK Government for reassurances that GCHQ operates within the law.
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger also wants to know whether any German citizens have ever been targeted by the intelligence agency.
In a letter to the Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, they said: “In our modern world, the new media provide the framework for a free exchange of opinions and information. Transparent governance is one of the most important prerequisites that a democratic state and the rule of law requires."
A Nazi salute is not illegal racial discrimination provided it is intended as a personal statement, Switzerland's top court ruled on Wednesday.
The Federal Tribunal's ruling, entitled "Hitler salutes in public not always punishable," said the gesture is a crime only if someone is using it to try to spread racist ideology to others, not simply declaring one's own conviction.
The ruling by the Lausanne-based court overturned a lower court's conviction last year of a man who was charged with racial discrimination after they took part in an August 2010 demonstration with 150 participants.
The demonstration was held a week after the Swiss National Day on the famous Ruetli Meadow above Lake Lucerne where, according to legend, the modern Swiss Confederation was born in 1291.
The court said the man substituted the Swiss oath with a 20-second Nazi salute, an extension of the right arm in the air with a straightened hand that's usually accompanied by the utterance "Heil Hitler!"
But it said the gesture is only punishable if it is being used to spread, advertise or propagate racist ideology with the intention of influencing "third parties".
The gesture is a criminal offence in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.
An anti-racism law in 1995 forbids the public display and dissemination of racist symbols, but only in cases when they are used to promoting racist ideologies.
For more than a decade the Swiss have grappled with right-wing extremists disrupting Swiss National Day celebrations on the Ruetli, where they have openly displayed Nazi symbols.
The Swiss were shocked by a mass march on August 1, 2000 when a neo-Nazi mob booed and humiliated then-Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger during their speech on the Ruetli and, according to the anti-racism commission, Adolf Ogi, who was Swiss president at the time, "had to apply for special protection during a national celebration, which was paid for privately".
Matt Cassel's run with the Kansas City Chiefs has been an -- shall we say -- uneven affair over three seasons, and it appears they don't have much rope left with the good people of Missouri.

Playing in Sunday's All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game at the Kansas City Royals' Kauffman Stadium, Cassel was booed during their introduction, according to the Lawrence (Kansas) Journal-World. They were given "polite applause" by the 40,095 in attendance in each of their at-bats.
Cassel enters a new season with plenty of pressure to lead the Chiefs back into contention. Cassel's strong 2010 season (27 touchdowns, seven interceptions, 93 passer rating) has been sandwiched by two mediocre years at Arrowhead. The Chiefs are 18-22 with Cassel under center, including one postseason shellacking by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2010 season.
The tape-delayed broadcast of the game aired on ESPN after Monday's Home Run Derby. And with that, we've provided the first compelling reason in recorded history to watch a celebrity softball game.
The last straw for Captain Abu Mahmoud came when 13 of their fellow officers were lined up and shot by a Syrian firing squad. They had been identified as potential deserters - all officers have their own team of watchers from military intelligence to monitor their behaviour - and were executed just in case, they said.
They were headed at the time with their Third Division for Idlib in the north, scene already of many battles and massacres in this encroaching civil war. They turned tail, shook off their spies and went home.
In a fine example of how the paranoias of dictators eventually make themselves come true, they are now with the Free Syrian Army on the front line of the battle for Homs.
 They are a helpless spectator as the Syrian tanks and artillery, which their Free Syrian Army cannot match, drop round after round of shell fire on to the defenceless citizens of the Homs neighbourhoods Bab al-Amr and Khalidiya, enclaves now to match the names of Sarajevo and Misurata.
Calls from inside Homs said that only Bab al-Amr remained as a pocket of FSA resistance, but that army tanks were approaching.
Other formerly free areas such as Inshaíat were under regime control, another Free Syrian Army soldier said.
In these places, there is no longer any visible life. People who were among the last to leave the city as the army moved in to follow up on days of artillery assault say that no-one can go out for fear of the shelling and the snipers who take aim at men, women, and children in the street.
One hospital contacted by telephone in the city said it had only three patients and five nurses. Most of the population is sheltering in the lower floors and basements of houses, crammed 30 to a room.
But despite the obvious threat of retribution when the regime turns to face him, Capt. Abu Mahmoud is now marshalling defences of the liberated area the other side of the government line, between Homs and the Lebanese border, and even driving the army back. Their men have pushed government troops four miles from positions they held recently, and now occupy a line roughly between the old military airport and the military training school, they said.
"After Homs, 100 per cent sure they will turn against us," they said. "They have tanks but we have heavy arms. Praise be to Allah we will beat them."
The ruthlessness of the army's assault on Homs must cast that claim in doubt. The clear intention of the Assad forces is to repeat the massacre of the nearby city of Hama in 1982, when President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez, and uncle, Rifaat, ordered the deaths of tens of thousands following an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood.
Residents of that city at the time recall the results. One Christian woman described to The Sunday Telegraph how, as a young girl, they saw their next door neighbours executed in their back yard, including a nine-year-old playmate.
It was brutal, and it succeeded: there was no concerted internal opposition to Assad rule for three decades afterwards.
This time, though, the Assad modus operandi seems not to be working. Rather than intimidating them, residents of the surrounding area say it has made them more determined than before to hold out.
"I don't know if the government knows what I am doing here, and I don't care," said Dr Abbas, who has become the de facto civilian leader of the free area defended by Capt. Abu Mahmoud and their men. "None of us cares."
This area did not throw off its shackles in one bound, as happened with the free cities of the Libyan uprising. But after months of demonstrations, arrests and shootings, gradually a group of respected citizens took the shape of an informal civilian council led by Dr Abbas who is not in fact a doctor but a dentist and an owner of several factories in Syria and abroad.
The Free Syrian Army managed to turn it into a regime-free area, last week evicting regular forces from a pair of buildings occupied by the police and military intelligence, or Mukhabarat. An outpost in what was once the regional hospital is the only government hold-out within sniper range of heavily built-up areas.
Dr Abbas - who like otehrs in this area were nervous about giving their whole names - reckons that this pocket of land contains 110-120,000 people, and stretches to the Lebanese border. It is mostly contiguous, though there is a problem with pockets inhabited by Shia Muslims.
While they insist that the uprising is not sectarian - "We just want democracy, we don't care whether people are Sunni, or Alawite or Shia, or Christian. Have I asked you what you are?" they say - they also add that the Shia villages are a problem because of their links with Hizbollah in Lebanon, the Shia militant group backed by the Assads.
This has made parts of both sides of the border no-go areas.
But throughout this area they and other council members supervise the arrival of supplies, including medicines, brought in from Lebanon, and relief efforts for the families of those arrested by regime forces, or whose houses have been shelled and destroyed.
They have also set up a field hospital in an abandoned house, which also operates as a place for council members to meet daily and review their work. Lunch-time discussion sessions are regularly punctuated by the arrival of the injured, like a man yesterday with a bullet-hole through their knee.
Four months ago, Dr Kasem, its senior doctor, left their post at the government hospital and joined the opposition. They had already begun operating secretly on injured rebels, keeping them off the books.
They know, they say with a nervous laugh, that they are "for it" if the regime troops re-take this place. "The government has a blacklist, and we are all on it," they said.
But this is the difference from events of Hama 30 years ago. While that was an organised uprising from a particular opposition faction, none of these men, whether doctors and business people like Dr Abbas and Dr Kasem, or career soldiers like Abu Mahmoud, had any inkling of what was going to happen, only a longstanding grievance. When they saw an opportunity, they seized it, as did similar figures across the country.
"We have had 40 years of it," Dr Abbas said. "Forty years of security running our lives." They say that President Assad is a "liar", because of their early promises of reform when they came to power in 2000.
"He said the right things, about democracy and everything," they said. "Things I thought came out of their mouth. But I think they did not understand the system himself."
Now, they say, they have proved themselves as "criminal", like their father.
It is hard to disagree, when considering events down the road in Homs, or the random sniper fire and shell-bursts that send people here scurrying for cover and have turned those parts of town still in the line of fire into wastelands.
It is also hard, though, to be confident about these men's futures.
Abu Mahmoud admits that they are short of weapons - in reality, they have only a few light arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
Dr Abbas snorts imperiously when asked if they are afraid. "We are not doing it for ourselves. We are doing it for our sons, so they can have a future," they said. "We will never let them rule us again like they did before."
But the women are clearly nervous, sheltering inside as their menfolk go to war. And when pushed, even Dr Kasem looks sheepish. "Of course we are all afraid," they said and, only half-jokingly, adds: "If they come, I shall run for the border."
You may have heard of Mr. Robot, an award-winning show about a clinically-depressed cybersecurity engineer hired by "Mr. Robot" to join a group of hacktivists. The latest episode, "eps2.6_succ3ss0r.p12," opens with a discussion between a Nexus owner (Mobley) and an iPhone owner (Trenton). Take a look at the clip:
For context, the terminal window open on Trenton's screen is creating a custom MP4 file with the Stagefright vulnerability. When Mobley is tricked into visiting the page to prove their superiority as an Android user, the infected video file loads on their phone (despite their claims that Chrome on Android has "better HTML5 compliance"). From there, Trenton gains root access to Mobley's phone over the shop's WiFi connection, much to their surprise.
The attitude of Mobley is what cracks me up the most, it's a perfect personification of the 'Nexus Warriors' so common on forums (and even AP's comment section). Granted, Stagefright is no longer a problem if you're on Android 5.1.1 or later, but Mobley could very well be that guy visting AP with a Galaxy Nexus.
“The real question for Republicans in Washington is how low can you go, because we are approaching a level of ridiculousness,” said Mr. Reed, sounding exasperated in an interview on Tuesday morning. “You can't make this stuff up. And the impact this is having on the grass-roots around the country is devastating. Republicans think the governing class in Washington are a bunch of buffoons who have total disregard for the principles of the party, the law of the land and the future of the country.”
Then again, Washington does not have a monopoly on the latest trend among Republicans. Just ask Thomas Ravenel, the state treasurer of South Carolina, who had to step down as state chairperson of Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign after they were indicted on cocaine charges in June.
Or Bob Allen, a state representative in Florida who was jettisoned from the John McCain campaign last month after they were arrested on charges of soliciting sex in a public restroom.
Mr. Craig, for their part, has severed ties with the Mitt Romney campaign, despite their public declaration on Tuesday that “I did nothing wrong.”
In an interview Tuesday on “Kudlow and Company” on CNBC, Mr. Romney could not distance themselves fast enough. “Once again, we've found people in Washington have not lived up to the level of respect and dignity that we would expect for somebody that gets elected to a position of high influence,” Mr. Romney said. “Very disappointing. He's no longer associated with my campaign, as you can imagine.”
Republicans, of course, do not have an exclusive hold on scandal. As Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a “culture of corruption” during the 2006 midterm elections, Republicans eagerly put the spotlight on Representative William J. Jefferson, the Louisiana Democrat who stashed $90,000 in their freezer — ill-gotten gains, the authorities said.

Still, there is a sort of “here we go again” sense among Republicans these days, especially since news of the Craig arrest broke on Monday afternoon. It is tough enough being in the minority, weighed down by the burden of the war in Iraq. Now Republicans have an even more pressing task: keeping their party from being portrayed not just as hypocritical and out of touch with the values of people they represent, but also as a laughingstock — amid headlines like “Senator's Bathroom Bust,” which ran all Tuesday afternoon on CNN. The story also ran at the top of all the network evening newscasts on Tuesday.
“I'm hoping it's a big mistake,” said one of Mr. Craig's Republican colleagues, Senator Lamar Alexander, traveling Tuesday in Tennessee, their home state. “But it certainly does nothing to increase confidence in the United States Senate.”

With President Bush hobbled by their own political difficulties, the party can hardly look to them to lead them out of the morass. “If we had a coach,” said John Feehery, who was press secretary to Representative J. Dennis Hastert when Mr. Hastert was the House speaker, “the coach would take us in the locker room and scream at us.”
Some Republicans are indeed screaming, particularly the party's social conservative wing, which places a high priority on ethics and family values. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group in Washington, said the elections of November 2006, in which Republicans lost control of the House and the Senate, proved that voters want politicians in Washington to clean up their act.
“Exit polls show that was the No. 1 factor in depressing Republican enthusiasm,” Mr. Perkins said in an interview Tuesday. “There is an expectation that leaders who espouse family values will live by those values. And while the values voters don't demand perfection, I do believe they want leaders with integrity.”
The perception that Mr. Craig is not living up to their own values is causing problems for him, and after their appearance on Tuesday, with their wife standing by their side, some Republicans confessed they did not know what to think.
“He sounded almost as convincing as, ‘I did not have sex with that woman,' ” said Gary Bauer, a Christian conservative and onetime Republican presidential candidate, reprising President Bill Clinton's remark initially denying involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Mr. Craig is up for re-election next year and has promised to announce next month whether they are running again. Some, like Mr. Bauer, say they are unlikely to survive the current scandal; others, noting that Senator Vitter seems to have weathered their storm, say Mr. Craig might be able to tough it out. And at the rate things are going, says Mr. Reed, the Republican strategist, it might be only a matter of time before a new scandal pushes Mr. Craig's woes off the front page.
“I'm a little afraid to say anything, because you don't know what happens tomorrow,” Mr. Reed said. “That Vitter thing, that's like ancient history now.”
Black holes are complicated.
The Schwarzschild spacetime, which is the original basis for the theory of black holes, is more complicated than the simple form of the metric would have you think. The usual form of the metric is, to remind you, .
At the Schwarzschild radius, , this metric blows up (i.e., goes to infinity). That means, originally, the metric really only makes sense outside this radius, .
But last time, we talked about how this apparent singularity is not actually a problem. After a change of coordinates, the weirdness at the Schwarzschild radius goes away, and the spacetime is suddenly well behaved all the way down to .
Well, except that light can't escape from inside this radius, due to the extreme bending of spacetime. That's why we call the sphere at the event horizon, and the whole thing a black hole.
So, the original presentation of the Schwarzschild metric was problematic, and so it only made sense for , outside the black hole. But a coordinate change let the spacetime make sense inside the black hole as well, for . We were able to extend the spacetime.
So that leads to a question. Can we extend the spacetime even further?
It doesn't seem like there's anywhere to extend to, like there was before, when we extended into the interior of the black hole.
But it turns out, despite all appearances, we can extend the spacetime further, and discover another universe on the other side of the black hole.
But to understand that we need to talk about a special coordinate change for special relativity.
To remind you, Minkowski space, the spacetime of special relativity, can be interpreted as a solution of general relativity. The manifold is , with metric . However, if we change to spherical spacetime coordinates, the metric in This becomes . (Same spacetime and metric, different coordinates.)
Like we did last time, we're going to mostly ignore the sphere part of the metric (the and parts), and focus on the and parts. And we're going to do a weird kind of coordinate change. In fact, it's weird enough that let's just sketch a diagram for the Minkowski spacetime in these new coordinates, rather than write out a metric.
It's kind of weird, but what we did is we compressed the infinite range of time and the infinite range of radii down to a compact area. For clarity, we also drew some coordinate lines based on the old coordinates.
One nice part about this diagram, sometimes called a Penrose diagram, is that light still travels at 45 degree angles.
Notice they end up at the (upper) right diagonal line. This line is called (future) null infinity. It's called null, since light follows null paths, and infinity, since that's where light “ends up” after traveling infinite distance. It's infinitely far away, through represented as a line in our diagram.
On the other hand, if you are sitting still, no matter what radius you're sitting at, you end up at the top point. This top point is called future timelike infinity. It's “infinity” since it takes infinite time to get there, and timelike, since it's where you end up if you travel along a timelike path (such as sitting still.) The bottom point is similarly past timelike infinity.
To summarize, the most important things to take away from this diagram is that the top and bottom points are infinitely far to the future or past, and the right sides represent infinitely far away.
These Penrose diagrams are kind of weird, but they are incredibly useful in understanding black holes.
So, what does the Penrose diagram for the Schwarzschild spacetime look like?
Due to the black hole, this diagram looks a bit different. The right part of the spacetime, approaching null infinity, though, works exactly the same way as in the diagram for special relativity. The top point is infinitely far into the future, while the right lines are infinitely far away.
On the left, the diagonal line cutting the spacetime in two is the event horizon of the black hole, at . Inside the black hole, the top line is the singularity at .
Light still travels at 45 degree angles in this diagram. But if that light was emitted inside the black hole, that means the light must fall into the singularity .
We saw this before, but it's particularly easy to see in this diagram.
It's also interesting to notice that the event horizon is also at 45 degrees. In other words, the event horizon (and thus the black hole) is expanding at the speed of light!
It's not that the radius is changing. But if you shot a ray of light out from the black hole right on the event horizon, it would stay on the event horizon forever, travelling “outward.” And the path of the light in the spacetime would exactly be that line of the event horizon. So, in a very real sense, the event horizon is going outward at the speed of light. It's just that the spacetime is so curved, light isn't moving!
As one demonstration for why this diagram is useful for understanding the spacetime, let's think about what happened when we pushed Hitler out the airlock into the black hole.
If Hitler is moving directly toward the black hole, their path in the spacetime might look like this.
Of course, we'll be sitting at a safe distance, say at a fixed value.
What would we see as Hitler approaches the black hole?
The light reflecting off of their face would travel out to us along null geodesics, i.e., along 45 degree lines. Let's sketch a few of these light paths.
Now, remember that the only infinities occur at the boundaries of the diagram. That means that Hitler, according to their own perception, falls into the black hole in some finite amount of time.
But notice that the light coming from them reaches us (sitting at a safe distance) at later and later times. (Remember that the top of the diagram, where our path ends, represents the infinite future. So the light rays look evenly spaced on the diagram, but the time between when each ray reaches us is longer and longer.) Even though some light is leaving Hitler shortly before they fall through the horizon, it doesn't reach us until almost infinitely later!
In other words, Hitler experiences falling through the event horizon in finite time, but we will never actually see them fall in. We'll just see them get closer and closer.
Pretty weird, huh?
So, this Penrose diagram, so far, is pretty cool.
But I promised that we could extend the spacetime, and I haven't shown you how yet.
The idea how is simple enough. You can write down the metric in the coordinates of the Penrose diagram, though I'll leave it to a footnote. The trick is that, while the spacetime that we have been using represents in these coordinates, the metric is perfectly nice and well-behaved for as well!
If we add that part of the spacetime to our Penrose diagram, we get something like this.
The diamond on the right, remember, is our universe. The diamond on the left is an alternate universe!
Anything could be going on in that other universe, but we could never find out.
See, the only way our universes connect is through the black hole.
Since we can only travel on paths at angles less than 45 degrees (timelike paths), the only way that our paths could cross with the path of an alien from the alternate universe is inside the black hole.
Certainly, inside the black hole, we could talk about the wonders of our respective universes, but only for a short time.
Then we all get eaten by the singularity.
What about the triangular region at the bottom?
The best way to think of that region is in analogy with the black hole region (the top triangular region.) The black hole is a region where light and matter and energy can go in, but nothing can ever come out.
The bottom region is the time-reversed version of this; light and matter and energy can leave, but it can never go back.
Since it's the opposite of a black hole, we call it a white hole.
Unfortunately, this alternate universe is really just a mathematical construct.
Remember, the Schwarzschild spacetime is supposed to model the region outside of a star. If a star runs out of fuel, and is massive enough, it will collapse to a radius smaller than the Schwarzschild radius , forming a black hole.
But the matter is still there, inside the black hole, at least until it falls into the singularity. (And who knows what happens then; probably something weird and quantum.) But that matter “censors” the alternate universe part of the solution from showing up.
The easiest way to see this is to draw another Penrose diagram.
The star stuff starts out bigger than the Schwarzschild radius. But as it collapses, it eventually falls within that radius.
But since the Schwarzschild solution is only valid outside the star, there isn't any alternate dimension “beyond” the matter falling inward. There's just the center of the matter.
Is it possible to extend the spacetime even farther?
Well, something we can't do is extend past the singularity at . As we talked about last time, the curvature goes to infinity there, meaning there is infinite gravity. We shouldn't be able to extend past that.
There doesn't seem to be a way to extend the Schwarzschild spacetime any farther.
But if we add a little electric/magnetic charge (and so get a different black hole spacetime), it turns out we can extend past the equivalent of .
And it causes all sorts of problems, because it seems like it might be there, even for a collapsing star.
But that's a story for another day.

Damien Chazelle's La La Land is not only one of the most acclaimed films of 2016; it has just walked away with 7 Golden Globe awards leaving us wondering why the film has been given an ‘Adults Only' censor certificate in India.
Once again the chairperson of the censor board Pahlaj Nihalani is in the eye of storm. However this time they are ready with all their facts and figures. Explains Nihalani, “We were ready to grant La La Land a ‘UA' certificate, but with a few verbal cuts where the ‘F' word and other expletives were used, and a shot of the middle finger being shown. However the film's producers Viacom 18 begged off, explaining that they could not afford to make the cuts required, as the budget allocated for their film was small. So we had no choice but to grant the film an ‘A' certificate.”
Here it would be pertinent to say that the recent Hindi film Befikre not only had multiple kisses but also dialogues which referred to the hero as a ‘slut' and a ‘bitch'. It was granted a ‘UA' certificate.
Double standards?
Says critic Raja Sen, “I think it's tragic that our censors evidently think great cinema is too masterful for children to watch. There is nothing remotely inappropriate about the glorious La La Land — which is more than can be said about the CBFC.”
Over at Advanced NFL Stats, Brian Burke has put together a great visualization plotting the offensive and defensive performance of the league's 32 teams. It's nothing too complicated—basically a NYMag Approval Matrix for football—but it reveals a lot about the state of the NFL through Week 5.
The measurement here is expected points added (EPA) per game, which sums how much a team's offense has increased the odds of scoring, or a team's defense has decreased those odds, following every play (similar to RE24 in baseball). This type of stat acknowledges that not all situations are equal—yards per game might be a useful comparative figure, but five yards on 2nd and 10 and five yards on 3rd and 4 aren't the same thing. The axes are set at the league averages, so even a slightly negative EPA defense like the Colts can qualify as "good" in today's NFL.
The scales had to be adjusted to fit the Broncos, but who would have guessed that the Colts attack would come in fourth? How many more points does Matt Schaub have to hand their opponents before the Texans' offense drops below the Jags? And what teams are going to distinguish themselves from the "decent D/medicore O" clusterfuck in the top left? Stay tuned, these update every week.

Jeremy Corbyn has kicked off their summer tour of Britain with a rally to delighted fans in Cornwall.
More than 1,000 people turned out as the Labour leader slammed Tory "crocodile tears" over the NHS and Donald Trump's "threats", apparently against North Korea.
In a lengthy speech to attendees who regularly cheered and clapped, Mr Corbyn said they would be touring marginal seats "all along the south coast", the Midlands and Wales for three weeks, ending with a campaign in Scotland and a Q&A at Edinburgh's Fringe festival.
Fans held banners saying "don't sell our NHS" and "kids for Corbyn" near Camborne, where local Tory MP George Eustice's majority was cut from 7,000 to 1,577 in the general election.
Mr Corbyn slammed new figures that show the NHS has now missed waiting time targets every month in a row for two years.

"It's under threat from underfunding" they claimed. "It's under threat from privatisation. It's under threat from an internal market."
Demanding an end to the 1% pay rise cap for staff they said: "The next time Tory MPs tell you how wonderful the health service is... forgive me the crocodile tears. Pay them properly as well!"
But for the second time this week they would not directly condemn Venezuela's Socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who won sweeping powers in an election amid claims the official turnout was "manipulated".
Mr Corbyn, who has repeatedly backed Venezuela's government, said they take UN allegations of human rights violations by security forces and pro-government armed groups "very seriously".

But asked if they would now condemn Maduro's regime they replied: "I condemn all abuses of human rights."
They added: "The solution has to be dialogue in Venezuela, has to be independence of the judiciary, and has to be support for a process that brings about a peaceful long-term solution."
Their comments came as it emerged their close ally Diane Abbott provides a House of Commons security pass for a co-coordinator of the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign, Matthew Willgress.
Matthew Willgress works part time on digital communications and social media and does not carry out work for the VSC while working for Ms Abbott, their spokesperson said.
Mr Corbyn also urged Donald Trump to "ratchet down the rhetoric" after the US President threatened North Korea with "fire and fury".

They told journalists: "There is no such thing as an isolated nuclear attack. It would kill millions on both sides of the Korean border and of course in neighbouring countries."
They later added to their supporters: "Whilst I don't particularly want a fall-out with Donald Trump or anybody else I simply say to them quite gently - it's much better to build bridges than build walls.
"And it's much better to bring about peace by discussion rather than threat and to bring people along with you.
"And it's much better for all of us if we have a foreign policy based on peace, on justice and on human rights all around the world."

Mr Corbyn is mostly holding private or members'-only meetings as they tour the country. Those included a visit this morning to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.
They will hold a rally on the beach in Southport, Merseyside, from 6pm on Friday 18 August and a third rally in Glasgow towards the end of the month.
Introduced as the "next Prime Minister of Cornwall", they told fans Labour's election manifesto was on its third reprint "because so many people want copies of it".
They said "we didn't play by the rules" in the election and Labour defied the "commentariat".

Challenging Theresa May to another election they added: "Whenever this government finally realises it has no mandate, it has no long term future and it makes way for another chance at the ballot box, let's take it with both hands, win those seats, win that election and get a Labour government elected."
Mr Corbyn returned from a holiday in Croatia on Saturday and began the event with a low-key visit to a doctor's surgery in Crawley, Sussex, on Monday.
Meanwhile they have given their backing to a four-day music and politics festival in Brighton by the left-wing group Momentum - timed to happen at the same time as Labour's party conference.
The group first held its 'The World Transformed' festival a short walk from Labour's conference in Liverpool last year.
Theresa May remains on a two-week walking holiday in the Swiss Alps with husband Philip after spending a week in northern Italy at the end of July.
 They are due back in Downing Street on Monday and will reportedly unveil a string of 'position papers' on Brexit within days.
Parts of Stockholm Skavsta Airport were evacuated on 10 January after traces of an explosive powder were found on a passenger's luggage during security checks. "The baggage and departure halls were evacuated, which has affected departing flights but not arrivals," police duty officer Roland Lindkvist said, as quoted by AFP news agency.
A bomb squad is currently inspecting the bag at the airport, which is located about 60 miles from the Swedish capital. Linqvist added: "The bag in question belongs to an elderly lady and they are cooperating with us... They say they don't know how the powder got on their bag."
A note on the airport's website says the departures terminal is "closed due to possible indication of a suspicious object. Bomb squad is on site, and has started their work with the bag. The airport is awaiting clearance from the police to re-open the terminal and resume air traffic. Check-in is temporary [sic] closed and departures are delayed".
Stockholm Skavsta Airport is the fifth largest in the country and serves mainly budget and cargo carriers, handling around 2.5 million passengers a year.
A whopping 74 percent of have barely heard of Donald Trump's new running mate Mike Pence. | AP Photo 5 numbers that mattered this week
Continuing our POLITICO feature, where we dig into the latest polls and loop in other data streams to tell the story of the 2016 campaign. Here are five numbers that mattered this week.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence — Donald Trump's now-official choice of running mate on the GOP presidential ticket — enters the national political arena as a virtual clean slate, according to an average of two recent polls.
In this week's CBS News/New York Times poll, a whopping 74 percent of registered voters said they hadn't yet heard enough about Pence to have an opinion. An additional 13 percent described themselves as undecided or refused to answer the question.
Only 5 percent of voters in the CBS News/New York Times poll said they have a favorable opinion of Pence, and 8 percent viewed them unfavorably.
More voters had an opinion of Pence in a McClatchy-Marist poll this week: A combined 68 percent said they hadn't heard of Pence or had no opinion. Pence's favorable rating was just 12 percent, compared to 21 percent unfavorable.
The discrepancy is likely due to question wording: The CBS News/New York Times poll specifically offers respondents the option of saying they are undecided, or they haven't heard enough about the subject to form an opinion. That leads to lower favorable — and, consequentially, unfavorable — ratings for all figures.
For example, Hillary Clinton's favorable rating in the same CBS News/New York Times poll, which showed a tied race on the ballot test, was just 28 percent — 11 points lower than their average favorable rating, according to HuffPost Pollster. But the percentage who had an unfavorable opinion — 54 percent — was 3 points lower than the national average.
That doesn't mean the way the CBS News/New York Times poll asks the question leads to less accurate results. Indeed, for little-known figures like Pence, it might be more accurate — giving respondents the option of saying they don't know the person rather than being forced to express an opinion.
Between Trump's announcement this week and next week's convention, Pence is about to step on to the national stage. But it's more likely that opinions of Pence track closely with Trump's image, which means it's likely their favorable rating will be upside-down after the convention — that is, more Americans will view them unfavorably than favorably.
Either way, Pence enters with virtually no name identification. In the McClatchy-Marist poll, they were the potential running mate with the lowest name-ID among GOP short-listers — a list that also includes relatively unknown Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and first-year student Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst.
Race and ethnicity — especially the growing Hispanic vote — represent the sharpest dividing lines of the 2016 campaign.
We've written recently about the difficulty in getting accurate results for Hispanic voters, and a new survey this week, commissioned by Univision and conducted by two separate polling firms, underscores one of the major challenges: language.
In the poll, conducted earlier this month, Hillary Clinton leads Trump by 48 points among Hispanic voters nationwide, 67 percent to 19 percent.
But there's a language barrier: Clinton's lead among Hispanic voters interviewed in English was just 39 points, 60 percent to 21 percent. But they lead by 59 points among those interviewed in Spanish, 71 percent to 12 percent.
Since Spanish speakers represent a relatively small share of the electorate, and hiring bilingual interviewers is expensive, few public pollsters make that effort.
But especially in battleground states with larger Hispanic populations, missing that the small slice of more Democratic Spanish-speaking voters could make Hispanics appear a little more Republican in the polls.
The general election is more than a month old, but this week finally brought a wave of polls in the key states that will decide the winner of the Electoral College.
NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist released seven swing-state polls this week — each one surveying roughly 800 voters or more. Two other Northeastern universities — Monmouth and Quinnipiac — followed with three self-commissioned surveys each. Fox News' polling operation hit another two swing states.
And in a state ignored by those national pollsters this week, Wisconsin, the leading in-state academic survey outfit released its latest poll.
The results weren't uniform: Quinnipiac's polls in Florida and Pennsylvania had Trump in the lead, while Marist's surveys in the same states showed significant Clinton advantages. That disparity is one reason why we've launched the POLITICO Battleground States polling average, a look at the race across the 11 states most likely to determine who wins the November election.
Current polling shows Clinton leading in all 11 states, with an overall, weighted advantage of a little more than 5 percentage points.
The 2016 presidential campaign is entering a more active, spirited phase — but voters want no part of it.
The CBS News/New York Times poll this week asked voters if they were looking forward to the next few months of the campaign, and few are. Overall, just 37 percent said they were looking forward to the next few months, while more than six-in-10 weren't.
There's little difference by party: Democrats (57 percent) and Republicans (59 percent) were equally likely to say they weren't looking forward to the campaign.
Independents are especially turned off, however: More than two-thirds, 67 percent, said they aren't looking forward to the next few months. Just 32 percent said they are eager for the rest of the campaign.
Trump's campaign hasn't run television advertisements since they vanquished their rivals for the GOP nomination back in May, but don't tell that to voters who are seeing them on television day after day.
Republican super-lobbyist Bruce Mehlman posted a slide on Twitter this week with data from online pollster Fluent, LLC, showing 45 percent of voters said they've seen television ads in support of Trump. (Fluent's most recent survey, conducted last Sunday, had that number at 43 percent.)
The number speaks to the extent of Trump's free-media exposure, which is significant. But there's another element to this number: Voters don't tell the truth.
Republican pollster Alex Lundry — whose Arlington, Virginia-based firm, Deep Root Analytics, seeks to marry data analytics with television-ad buying — tweeted that in their time as director of data science for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, they found the similar number of voters would say they had seen specific Romney television ads. Only the ads didn't exist.
